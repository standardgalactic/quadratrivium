1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
So, what is it that I have against Nano?

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,720
What is my problem with the Nano text editor?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,640
People really want me to answer this question.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,200
This is something that has been constantly asked over the years of me doing this YouTube

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
channel.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,160
For one thing, I spend a lot of time covering really extensible text editors like Vim and

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,760
Emacs, and I really never talk about Nano.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,120
When I do talk about Nano, I'll be honest, I don't necessarily talk about Nano in a

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
good light, right?

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,160
A lot of people are like, hey, man, what is it?

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,840
What is it that you have against Nano?

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,080
Why do you hate Nano so much?

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Where does all this built-in dislike for Nano come from?

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,960
And I'm just going to go ahead and say this, these people that imagine that I hate Nano,

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
they're not imagining it.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,320
I really do hate Nano as a text editor.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,880
Now, that being said, there's nothing wrong with you using Nano as your text editor.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,400
If you want to use Nano, keep using it.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
You use the software.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
You want to use.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
I use the software that I want to use.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,760
We all make these personal choices as far as the software we choose to use.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,200
And if Nano is working for you, keep using it.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,200
For me, I'm going to go ahead and tell you, I've got some things against Nano that really

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
bugged the hell out of me.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,920
Probably my biggest issue with Nano is with any text editor, whether it be Nano, Vim,

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,280
Emacs, it really doesn't matter, to get the most out of any text editor, you really need

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,000
to learn all the built-in functionality of that editor.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,520
You need to learn all the already assigned key bindings to that editor, right, to get

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,120
the most out of it, to learn how to really navigate around a document quickly and make

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,840
those edits, you know, much faster to really speed up that process.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,120
You need to learn the key bindings and Nano has a lot of key bindings already assigned

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
to it.

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,880
Many of you Nano users actually don't realize just how many key bindings there are in Nano.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,320
There's an extensive list of key bindings available to you.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,040
Matter of fact, I should actually link to like a Nano cheat sheet of all the key bindings

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,640
that are built into it.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
There's a lot, right?

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
So, there's a learning curve to Nano, just like there is with Vim, just like there is

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,120
in Emacs, you have a lot of learning to do up front.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,520
You need to learn all those key bindings.

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,760
You need to get used to all those key presses, those strokes, right, and here's the thing,

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,800
with Nano, that learning curve to learn all that stuff, it's not worth it because Nano

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,880
at the end of the day, there's only so powerful, there's only so much you can do with a very

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,480
basic plain text editor like Nano, where with Vim and Emacs, yes, there's a huge learning

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
curve.

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,120
You got to learn all these key bindings, you got to learn the plugin system, you may have

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,000
to learn how to write in Vim script or Lua or Emacs list if you're using Emacs, you're

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,320
going to have to learn some stuff, but it's worth it in the end because of what those editors

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,760
ultimately can do, what they can become with you being knowledgeable and how they're scripted

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,160
and, you know, with Nano, there's a learning curve to Nano and that learning curve just

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
isn't worth it.

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,680
Also with Nano, just like with Vim and Emacs, there's some basic plugin functionality available,

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,080
you know, there's a few Nano plugins, there's a config file, you've got your Nano or C

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,160
file, right, that you can play around with, you know, change some settings, but at the

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,760
end of the day, there's only so much extending of Nano you can do.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,560
The sky is the limit with Vim and Emacs as far as extensions and what you can turn those

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,600
text editors into Emacs can practically become a full IDE, hell, Emacs can practically become

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,080
its own desktop environment, you can extend it to that kind of capability, where Nano

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,040
at the end of the day is really just a very basic plain text editor.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,120
There's not a lot of plugins out there, there's just a few, you can only do so much with the

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,080
config file, even turning on things like basic syntax highlighting and things like that,

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,880
you know, it's just not great.

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah, it doesn't have the kind of capabilities that both Vim and Emacs, for example, have.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,000
So really, that's my only gripe is when I get into Nano and try to do anything in Nano,

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,400
it's got these weird set of key bindings that are not standard, it's a complete different

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,420
set of key bindings than you would use in something like Vim or in Emacs or even plain

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,220
text editors like G-Editor, Nano has its own weird set of key bindings that you have to

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,900
learn, it's just not worth it.

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,780
That's really my complaint is it's uncomfortable to use and I don't want to learn it, I don't

71
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,660
want to waste time learning it just because at the end of the day, I just don't think

72
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,460
that that is time well spent.

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,860
For me, Nano is not a in-game text editor, that's not ultimately where you want to end

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,540
up as far as your text editing software of choice.

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,420
I think where you want to end up is something like Vim or Emacs.

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,900
What Nano is really good for and what I might would use Nano on occasion for is if I need

77
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,980
to make a quick edit, a really quick, simple edit to a config file on my system or a machine

78
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,140
I remote into, SSH into a machine and maybe Nano is the only editor on that server and

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,700
I don't want to install another editor on that server just to make a really quick five

80
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,380
second edit to one config file, I'll just use Nano for that.

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,380
Why not?

82
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,420
I can make it work for something really simple, if it's a situation where I don't have to

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,060
spend a significant amount of time in an editor, Nano is fine for those tasks.

84
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,420
But where Nano really falls apart is if you're going to do a ton of writing, a ton of programming,

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,380
a ton of scripting, creative writing, whatever it happens to be, you're writing your latest

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,380
novel.

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,040
Nano is definitely not the best tool for a job like that.

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,860
That is where tools like Vim and Emacs and those really extensible text editors, that's

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,740
where they shine because they have so much more functionality available for you for whatever

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
task you're doing.

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,620
You've got all these thousands of plugins available to help you programmers and developers

92
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,300
or you creative writers or whatever it happens to be that you need that text editor for,

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,660
they can make that happen where Nano at the end of the day is just a very basic piece

94
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
of software.

95
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,900
And where some of my obvious dislike of Nano comes into play, you guys sometimes see it

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
on camera.

97
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,980
I spent so many years using Vim and Emacs, I find Nano, it's so damn frustrating when

98
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,860
I end up in Nano in a virtual machine, if I'm checking out a Linux distribution and Nano

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,820
is the only editor on it or whatever it happens to be.

100
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,500
If I end up in Nano for some reason, then I have to try to figure out the key bindings

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
for Nano.

102
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,260
And again, Nano's got this weird set of key bindings that nothing else uses.

103
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,940
It's a complete set of key bindings unlike any other program you've ever used.

104
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,060
And that's part of my hatred of Nano.

105
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,420
I have nothing against GNU, Nano, the text editor, again, you guys that want to use it,

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,540
you can for me every time I end up in it.

107
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,660
That frustration builds because I'm a fish out of water, at the end of the day, I'm

108
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,540
just not used to it and that's the problem.

109
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,740
A good analogy is when I end up in Nano compared to Vim or Emacs, when I'm in Nano, it's almost

110
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,420
like I'm typing with both of my hands tied behind my back.

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,900
That's how clunky and slow and frustrating I find Nano.

112
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,580
So I hope that answers some of your guys' questions as far as what I have against Nano.

113
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,260
Some of you guys are even asking questions like, what do I have against Nano users?

114
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,980
I've got nothing against Nano users.

115
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,260
I don't care what piece of software you choose to use.

116
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Just like you really shouldn't care what piece of software I choose to use.

117
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,860
You need to worry about yourself.

118
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,180
If you're worried about what other people are doing, you've got some issues to work

119
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
out.

120
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,420
Any sane and rational person really isn't concerned about what somebody else is doing

121
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
with their life.

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,580
So I have no problems with Nano users and when I talk about Nano in a negative light,

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,180
I'm not talking about people using Nano.

124
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,980
Some people think when I say a piece of software is not right for me, I dislike a piece of

125
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,460
software, whatever it happens to be, that I'm somehow taking a shot at the people that

126
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,740
use that piece of software and like using that piece of software, that's not the case

127
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
at all.

128
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,020
I'm just speaking my personal opinion and many of you guys want my opinions on this

129
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
stuff.

130
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,220
So I'm happy to give them, like on this video, I'm very straightforward and honest.

131
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,940
I just don't like Nano and it's not, you know, that you shouldn't like Nano.

132
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,420
Nano is just not the right tool for me for 99% of what I do with my text editing.

133
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,940
Peace guys.
