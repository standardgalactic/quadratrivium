1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of the most common video formats on YouTube is where a content creator recommends you

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,360
other YouTubers to follow other related YouTubers to follow other than his channel.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,640
And this is very common in the Linux space as well where Linux YouTubers will create

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,040
a video giving you their top 5, top 10, top 20, whatever, other Linux YouTubers that you

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,520
should go and check out and subscribe to and watch their videos.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
And I've done these types of videos too in the past, I haven't made one recently, but

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,200
one thing that's kind of common with these types of videos is that people typically recommend

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,440
the same channels.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,880
It's typically the big channels, the really big channels sometimes, channels that if

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,120
you're a Linux enthusiast, you probably already know about, right?

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,480
I don't need to tell you guys about channels like Brian Lunduk or Luke Smith or Jupiter

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Broadcasting.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
You know, I don't need to tell you about Level 1 Tech.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,440
You guys probably know about those big channels, Quidd's Up and Joe Collins and everything

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
like that.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,440
I don't need to send you to those channels.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,280
If you have been following a little bit of Linux on YouTube, no doubt you've come across

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,080
videos of those guys.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,480
So today I wanted to give, really I wanted to shine a spotlight on some of the smaller

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,600
channels, some of the channels that I don't think get enough views and subscribers.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,480
I think they put out great content and for whatever reason, maybe it's because their

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,840
channel is a little newer or it's because they focus on a really small niche topic for

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
the most part.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,760
I think these channels, I'm going to discuss 12 channels today that I think are greatly

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,120
deserving of far more views and subscribers than they currently get.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,520
That's our topic for the day.

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,240
Alright so first things first, if you guys go to my YouTube channel homepage and if you

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,080
click on the Channels tab in my page, it will show you every single YouTuber that I'm subscribed

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
to.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm subscribed to probably a hundred different Linux and tech related YouTubers and of course

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
a lot of these are a lot of the big channels you probably know about and of course some

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,960
of these are the smaller channels that I'm going to be discussing today.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,920
Again, many of these you probably already heard of, many of them you haven't though.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,400
So check out the Channels tab here at the DistroTube YouTube page and you'll see everybody

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,080
that I'm subscribed to, good channels.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,640
Today though I want to focus on some of the smaller channels that I don't think get enough

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,520
attention and part of the reason some of these guys don't get enough attention is the channels

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,920
are new and this is one example, old tech bloke, OTB.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,600
His channel just started a month ago, maybe two months ago, he messaged me actually on

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,640
Mastodon, he watches some of my videos and he's following me on Mastodon.

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I've conferred with old tech bloke a few times and I've watched many of his videos

42
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,200
he's put out in just under two months and this guy is great.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,600
He's very knowledgeable, he has good equipment, good audio equipment, good video equipment,

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,840
especially for a beginner YouTuber.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Certainly he's got far more, far better equipment than I started with when I started my channel

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,560
and his videos are great, his content's great, solid audio, he's got a good radio kind of

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,680
voice and I can't recommend this guy enough.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,280
He's only got 46 subscribers because again his channel is brand new but I can highly

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,520
recommend you guys check out old tech bloke, give him a subscribe, watch some of his videos

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,360
again, knowledgeable guy and a wide range of topics.

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,240
I mean he's got stuff on here about MX and Debian and Slackware and what's the best video

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,320
editor on Linux and he does good comparison by the way, I watched that video where he

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,640
compared Kaden Live, OpenShot and Shotcut, good content.

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,720
So old tech bloke is the first channel I want to recommend to you guys, keep it techy, keep

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
it techy.

56
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,500
He has 603 subscribers, he's kind of slowed down on his video content creation here lately,

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,140
I'm assuming it's probably work and life related, he's only posted one video really

58
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,760
in the last couple of months but hopefully he'll get back on track but keep it techy

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
is great.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,760
If I go to the about tab I can read a little bit of what keep it techy is about, keep it

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,440
techy is a technology channel started by Josh and he helps raise awareness about the Linux

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
operating system, blah blah blah, I won't read the blurb but basically I can tell you

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,040
his videos typically are a little more advanced, I won't say too advanced but he does some

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,720
server related stuff, of course some desktop related stuff, again he does stuff about audio,

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,440
video and Linux, most YouTubers, most Linux YouTubers are going to cover audio and video

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,520
on Linux because that's a big part of what we do.

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
But again a good mix, good mix of content from this guy because I mean he does everything

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,880
from really simple basic like installations and simple terminal commands that you should

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,560
know all the way into some more advanced server related topics and once again much like old

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,520
tech bloke keep it techy, he's got good equipment, he's got a good microphone, his audio is good

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,800
and once again he's got a good speaking voice, a good radio voice and that's so important

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,960
on YouTube or on radio but especially what we're talking about today YouTube if you

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,000
don't have a good speaking voice combined with pretty decent audio equipment nobody's

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,960
really going to listen to you and keep it techy definitely deserves more eyeballs on

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,480
his stuff.

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,440
And the next YouTuber I want to recommend, Linux related, Red Robo's Workshop, Rob does

77
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:16,320
some good stuff here, he's again got a perfect radio kind of voice, topics, he focuses pretty

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,040
heavily at least here lately on OpenSusa as far as his video content, he does a lot of

79
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,440
stuff about KDE, occasionally he does some off topic stuff, he showed his aquarium with

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,160
some shrimp in a recent video but Rob's great, Rob's a good community member too, he comments

81
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,800
on a lot of other Linux related YouTube channels, you guys probably seen Red Robo's Workshop

82
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,640
you know posting and my live streams and many other folks live streams when I do a live

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,800
stream or whoever.

84
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,320
But Rob is a great guy, great content and deserves far more subscribers than just 361.

85
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,480
Nicholas Bernstein, now Nicholas here is kind of a newer channel again, he's already got

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:10,760
though 549 subscribers once again, good, good voice, good audio, good video and very knowledgeable,

87
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,400
he's a really good teacher.

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,840
Like he explains things very well, he focuses on sysadmin, IT kind of stuff, he focuses on

89
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,080
preparing people for that field and again his explanations are great, you know he doesn't

90
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,480
rush through explanations, kind of like I try to do often times on my tutorial videos,

91
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,160
I kind of take my time talking through stuff, I don't just blow through it talking as fast

92
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,760
as I can, because that is kind of antithetical to trying to cheat somebody that has no idea

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,000
about what you're talking to and I think Nicholas is a fantastic teacher, deserves far more

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,640
subscribers than the 549 he currently has as of recording this video.

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Dark One, Dark One Matt is just a fantastic entertaining guy and the great thing about

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Dark One here is he focuses on a wide range of topics which I think is a real benefit,

97
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,320
because I think some of these channels that we're talking about today, they stay small

98
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,720
because they focus on a very tight niche as far as a topic where Dark One covers Linux

99
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,680
related stuff, Linux news, Linux Rants, he covers other tech related stuff not related

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,680
to Linux, I mean he covers things like Microsoft Surface Tablets and things like that, he talks

101
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,680
even about Mac I think occasionally, of course Windows and of course he does some gaming

102
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,040
stuff, he's a big gamer, covers Windows gaming and Linux gaming and what I really like about

103
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Matt is he's entertaining his hill, he does a lot of reaction videos where he basically

104
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,800
trashes somebody for being dumb, especially people that make really dumb videos about

105
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Linux which I love, so I really love his reaction videos, he does also music video reactions

106
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,800
which are pretty cool and again he's got 821 subscribers as I'm recording this and I think

107
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,400
he deserves far more attention than he's currently getting.

108
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Colin over at PCTLC, now you guys I know many of you guys like when I do my distro review

109
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,400
type videos and I don't do that many of those type videos anymore because I don't find

110
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,760
them that interesting, they don't interest me as far as that's not the content I really

111
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,480
just want to create, but a lot of people out there do want to create that and Colin over

112
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,480
at PCTLC does a great job with those installation videos and review videos, reviewing various

113
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,880
distros, some of the recent ones are Debbie and Tanny's covered probably for the Big Daddy

114
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Linux challenge and they covered Arch, Open Mandreva, most of these are probably following

115
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,480
the schedule of Big Daddy Linux which we may talk about here in a minute, but Colin over

116
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,480
at PCTLC, great guy, just awesome Linux community member and puts out some fantastic content

117
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,280
again, like, subscribe, share, do whatever you can to help out Colin there.

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Sudo Reboot, now Sudo Reboot does nothing but live streams as far as I know of and he

119
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,400
does live streams like almost every day and he typically does long live streams typically

120
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,600
an hour, two hours, three hours or more sometimes and he's not your typical, oh I'm just going

121
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,440
to do a live stream and I have absolutely nothing to talk about, no he's great, he

122
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,000
interacts with the YouTube chat and the community but he also has real content on his live streams

123
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
like he does Linux-y stuff during his live streams, you know, reviewing distros and

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,880
various software programs and things, talks about the news and Sudo Reboot is one of these

125
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,880
guys, he's been around for a long time too as far as on YouTube and I don't know why

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,120
he only has 541 subscribers, I think that's criminal, criminally underrated actually,

127
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,720
you guys please go subscribe to Sudo Reboot, he is absolutely fantastic, great guy as well.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,240
Now this is a bit of a bigger channel but I include it in the list because I still think

129
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,360
it's vastly underrated, Destination Linux, the Destination Linux podcast with Zib, Michael,

130
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,120
Dasgeek and Noah is fantastic, so they put out a weekly podcast and you know typically

131
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,160
about two hours long, they record it live, typically you can watch the live recording

132
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,960
and then they go back and edit it and post it a couple of days after the live recording

133
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
as far as the edited podcast version of Destination Linux, but I think it's maybe the premiere

134
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,840
Linux podcast out there and you know they got a pretty good subscriber base, you know

135
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,560
over 4,000 subscribers but I do think that that's very underrated and I think there's

136
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,240
probably a lot of you guys that are watching this video here that probably have not heard

137
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,840
of Destination Linux and if you have not heard of Destination Linux, please check it out,

138
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,000
Big Daddy Linux, we were talking about that a minute ago with PCTLC, how his distro reviews

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,800
cover usually the weekly distro review from Big Daddy Linux live, Big Daddy Linux live

140
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,800
is a weekly live show, every Saturday night you get a couple of dozen people joining live

141
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,640
on a video conference, anybody's free to join, anybody from the community can join them live

142
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,080
on camera, plus you've got a couple of hundred people joining them live in the YouTube chat

143
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,680
every Saturday night and it is great, it is one of the great community things going on

144
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,680
as far as Linux YouTube community, Rocco Big Daddy Linux is really one of the leaders

145
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,200
as far as the Linux YouTube community, he really brings people together in a way nobody

146
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,200
else is doing and I really want to commend Rocco, I think he is just, I can't say enough

147
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,800
about how important Rocco Big Daddy Linux is to the Linux YouTube community so definitely

148
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,560
subscribe, check out Big Daddy Linux live every Saturday night and here lately Rocco has been

149
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,040
doing these Linux spotlights where he interviews people from the community, Linux YouTubers,

150
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,800
Linux developers, just Linux personalities, he's been doing that and those shows are

151
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,440
great as well, check out Big Daddy Linux, again another bigger channel but I think is

152
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,440
just woefully underrated is HexDSL, HexDSL has over 5,000 subscribers, definitely the

153
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,480
biggest channel I'm covering today but I think this guy should have 10 times the subscriber

154
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,000
base, great guy, Hex is just fantastic, he's entertaining, fun to watch, does pre-recorded

155
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,440
stuff, does live streaming, good content, good mix of content, focuses heavily on Linux

156
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,440
gaming which is why the subscriber base is not that high so Linux itself is a really

157
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,320
niche topic, if you have a channel that focuses primarily on Linux you're not going to get

158
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,920
that many subscribers, there's just not enough of us Linux users out there, if you focus

159
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,640
on Linux gaming as a topic, wow that's a niche inside a niche and I think that's part

160
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,000
of the problem but don't let the topic of the channel fool you, I mean he is focusing

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,840
heavily on Linux gaming but he does a mix of content, he looks at various terminal applications

162
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,400
recently he did a video about Ranger, I know he's covered various tiling window managers

163
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,000
on his show, sometimes he does tutorials, he shows you how to do things like in the

164
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,240
shell and things like that, so there is some tutorial stuff, some nerdy stuff other than

165
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,840
just the gaming stuff and I find his content some of the best out there, I try to catch

166
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,040
as much of Hex DSL's videos as I can, I can't watch everybody, I don't have time to watch

167
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,080
every video from everybody I'm subscribed to but when Hex puts out something I typically

168
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,640
watch it and I think you guys really if you're not subscribed check him out, well that was

169
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,760
the last Linux related channel but I wanted to cover two channels that really aren't

170
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,600
Linux centric but they're pretty close to Linux that I wanted to cover them, first of all Robo

171
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,880
Nuggy, everything free BSD, yes this is a BSD channel and that is why he doesn't have that

172
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,000
many views and subscribers is because think about how niche Linux is, now think about how

173
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,240
niche BSD is, like we probably have a hundred times more Linux users than BSD users and so

174
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,360
just he's fighting an uphill battle as far as getting views and subscribers but if you are

175
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,800
interested in BSD at all please subscribe to Robo Nuggy, even if you're not that interested in BSD

176
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,880
I mean some of what he talks about is applicable to those of us that run Linux on the desktop and

177
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:33,960
especially Linux as a server so please check out Robo Nuggy and Greg Hurrell, now a bigger

178
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,680
channel he's got over 4,000 subscribers this is not strictly Linux content though, his content is

179
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,760
Vim, he covers the Vim text editor, many of you guys are probably interested in Vim, I know I

180
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,360
cover Vim a lot on my channel you guys ask me about Vim a lot, you're looking for good content

181
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:01,320
centered around Vim, you know if you're a potential programmer developer and you're looking to harness

182
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:09,000
the power of Vim please subscribe to Greg Hurrell, a little bit off the beaten path with the Vim

183
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,600
centric channel Greg Hurrell and the free BSD centric channel with Robo Nuggy but I think all

184
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,440
those guys deserve a ton of views but obviously some of the bigger channels that I didn't cover

185
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,240
because they get covered a lot I mean you guys can check out everybody I'm subscribed to there's

186
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,960
always a chance you haven't heard of some of the bigger channels I'm subscribed to I would tell

187
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,120
you I'm often shocked like when I do if I do a colab with somebody even a bigger channel and you

188
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,240
think so much of our content you know I did a colab one time with Luke Smith and you would think

189
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,480
most people that watch my stuff have heard of Luke Smith but no I had people it's like who is Luke

190
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,520
Smith when I announced that I was gonna do that colab with Luke I'm sure Luke had a ton of people

191
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,040
that watch his stuff that had never heard of me so just because they're bigger channels I know some

192
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,160
of you guys probably have never heard of you know Chris Titus Tech and tutorial links and some of

193
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,040
these really big channels just go to my youtube page click the channels tab and anybody that you

194
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,800
haven't heard of that I'm subscribed to please check them out all great channels and I think

195
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,160
because of the community aspect we really want all these people to grow as content creators

196
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,120
because at the end of the day what we really want is more awareness we want to spread more

197
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,400
awareness about this thing we love that is Linux and before I go this show was made possible by

198
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,440
