0	2860	So, what is it that I have against Nano?
2860	5720	What is my problem with the Nano text editor?
5720	8640	People really want me to answer this question.
8640	13200	This is something that has been constantly asked over the years of me doing this YouTube
13200	14200	channel.
14200	19160	For one thing, I spend a lot of time covering really extensible text editors like Vim and
19160	22760	Emacs, and I really never talk about Nano.
22760	27120	When I do talk about Nano, I'll be honest, I don't necessarily talk about Nano in a
27120	28120	good light, right?
28120	31160	A lot of people are like, hey, man, what is it?
31160	32840	What is it that you have against Nano?
32840	35080	Why do you hate Nano so much?
35080	39080	Where does all this built-in dislike for Nano come from?
39080	43960	And I'm just going to go ahead and say this, these people that imagine that I hate Nano,
43960	44960	they're not imagining it.
44960	47320	I really do hate Nano as a text editor.
47320	51880	Now, that being said, there's nothing wrong with you using Nano as your text editor.
51880	54400	If you want to use Nano, keep using it.
54400	55480	You use the software.
55480	56480	You want to use.
56480	58480	I use the software that I want to use.
58480	62760	We all make these personal choices as far as the software we choose to use.
62760	65200	And if Nano is working for you, keep using it.
65200	70200	For me, I'm going to go ahead and tell you, I've got some things against Nano that really
70200	71680	bugged the hell out of me.
71680	76920	Probably my biggest issue with Nano is with any text editor, whether it be Nano, Vim,
76920	81280	Emacs, it really doesn't matter, to get the most out of any text editor, you really need
81280	85000	to learn all the built-in functionality of that editor.
85000	89520	You need to learn all the already assigned key bindings to that editor, right, to get
89520	94120	the most out of it, to learn how to really navigate around a document quickly and make
94120	97840	those edits, you know, much faster to really speed up that process.
97840	102120	You need to learn the key bindings and Nano has a lot of key bindings already assigned
102120	103120	to it.
103120	107880	Many of you Nano users actually don't realize just how many key bindings there are in Nano.
107880	111320	There's an extensive list of key bindings available to you.
111440	116040	Matter of fact, I should actually link to like a Nano cheat sheet of all the key bindings
116040	117640	that are built into it.
117640	118640	There's a lot, right?
118640	122960	So, there's a learning curve to Nano, just like there is with Vim, just like there is
122960	126120	in Emacs, you have a lot of learning to do up front.
126120	127520	You need to learn all those key bindings.
127520	132760	You need to get used to all those key presses, those strokes, right, and here's the thing,
132760	137800	with Nano, that learning curve to learn all that stuff, it's not worth it because Nano
137880	142880	at the end of the day, there's only so powerful, there's only so much you can do with a very
142880	148480	basic plain text editor like Nano, where with Vim and Emacs, yes, there's a huge learning
148480	149480	curve.
149480	153120	You got to learn all these key bindings, you got to learn the plugin system, you may have
153120	159000	to learn how to write in Vim script or Lua or Emacs list if you're using Emacs, you're
159000	163320	going to have to learn some stuff, but it's worth it in the end because of what those editors
163320	169760	ultimately can do, what they can become with you being knowledgeable and how they're scripted
169760	174160	and, you know, with Nano, there's a learning curve to Nano and that learning curve just
174160	175160	isn't worth it.
175160	180680	Also with Nano, just like with Vim and Emacs, there's some basic plugin functionality available,
180680	186080	you know, there's a few Nano plugins, there's a config file, you've got your Nano or C
186080	190160	file, right, that you can play around with, you know, change some settings, but at the
190160	194760	end of the day, there's only so much extending of Nano you can do.
194760	199560	The sky is the limit with Vim and Emacs as far as extensions and what you can turn those
199560	205600	text editors into Emacs can practically become a full IDE, hell, Emacs can practically become
205600	210080	its own desktop environment, you can extend it to that kind of capability, where Nano
210080	214040	at the end of the day is really just a very basic plain text editor.
214040	218120	There's not a lot of plugins out there, there's just a few, you can only do so much with the
218120	224080	config file, even turning on things like basic syntax highlighting and things like that,
224080	225880	you know, it's just not great.
225880	230760	Yeah, it doesn't have the kind of capabilities that both Vim and Emacs, for example, have.
230760	237000	So really, that's my only gripe is when I get into Nano and try to do anything in Nano,
237000	242400	it's got these weird set of key bindings that are not standard, it's a complete different
242400	247420	set of key bindings than you would use in something like Vim or in Emacs or even plain
247420	253220	text editors like G-Editor, Nano has its own weird set of key bindings that you have to
253220	254900	learn, it's just not worth it.
254900	259780	That's really my complaint is it's uncomfortable to use and I don't want to learn it, I don't
259780	263660	want to waste time learning it just because at the end of the day, I just don't think
263660	265460	that that is time well spent.
265460	271860	For me, Nano is not a in-game text editor, that's not ultimately where you want to end
271860	276540	up as far as your text editing software of choice.
276540	281420	I think where you want to end up is something like Vim or Emacs.
281420	286900	What Nano is really good for and what I might would use Nano on occasion for is if I need
286900	293980	to make a quick edit, a really quick, simple edit to a config file on my system or a machine
293980	299140	I remote into, SSH into a machine and maybe Nano is the only editor on that server and
299140	304700	I don't want to install another editor on that server just to make a really quick five
304700	308380	second edit to one config file, I'll just use Nano for that.
308380	309380	Why not?
309380	314420	I can make it work for something really simple, if it's a situation where I don't have to
314420	319060	spend a significant amount of time in an editor, Nano is fine for those tasks.
319060	325420	But where Nano really falls apart is if you're going to do a ton of writing, a ton of programming,
325420	330380	a ton of scripting, creative writing, whatever it happens to be, you're writing your latest
330380	331380	novel.
331380	336040	Nano is definitely not the best tool for a job like that.
336040	340860	That is where tools like Vim and Emacs and those really extensible text editors, that's
340860	346740	where they shine because they have so much more functionality available for you for whatever
346740	347740	task you're doing.
347740	353620	You've got all these thousands of plugins available to help you programmers and developers
353620	358300	or you creative writers or whatever it happens to be that you need that text editor for,
358300	362660	they can make that happen where Nano at the end of the day is just a very basic piece
362660	363660	of software.
363660	367900	And where some of my obvious dislike of Nano comes into play, you guys sometimes see it
367900	368900	on camera.
368900	376980	I spent so many years using Vim and Emacs, I find Nano, it's so damn frustrating when
376980	382860	I end up in Nano in a virtual machine, if I'm checking out a Linux distribution and Nano
382860	385820	is the only editor on it or whatever it happens to be.
385820	390500	If I end up in Nano for some reason, then I have to try to figure out the key bindings
390500	391500	for Nano.
391500	395260	And again, Nano's got this weird set of key bindings that nothing else uses.
395260	399940	It's a complete set of key bindings unlike any other program you've ever used.
399940	403060	And that's part of my hatred of Nano.
403060	409420	I have nothing against GNU, Nano, the text editor, again, you guys that want to use it,
409420	412540	you can for me every time I end up in it.
412540	416660	That frustration builds because I'm a fish out of water, at the end of the day, I'm
416660	418540	just not used to it and that's the problem.
418540	424740	A good analogy is when I end up in Nano compared to Vim or Emacs, when I'm in Nano, it's almost
424740	429420	like I'm typing with both of my hands tied behind my back.
429420	433900	That's how clunky and slow and frustrating I find Nano.
433900	439580	So I hope that answers some of your guys' questions as far as what I have against Nano.
439580	443260	Some of you guys are even asking questions like, what do I have against Nano users?
443260	444980	I've got nothing against Nano users.
444980	447260	I don't care what piece of software you choose to use.
447260	451260	Just like you really shouldn't care what piece of software I choose to use.
451260	452860	You need to worry about yourself.
452860	456180	If you're worried about what other people are doing, you've got some issues to work
456180	457180	out.
457180	461420	Any sane and rational person really isn't concerned about what somebody else is doing
461420	462420	with their life.
462420	467580	So I have no problems with Nano users and when I talk about Nano in a negative light,
467580	470180	I'm not talking about people using Nano.
470180	474980	Some people think when I say a piece of software is not right for me, I dislike a piece of
474980	479460	software, whatever it happens to be, that I'm somehow taking a shot at the people that
479460	483740	use that piece of software and like using that piece of software, that's not the case
483740	484740	at all.
484740	489020	I'm just speaking my personal opinion and many of you guys want my opinions on this
489020	490020	stuff.
490020	494220	So I'm happy to give them, like on this video, I'm very straightforward and honest.
494220	498940	I just don't like Nano and it's not, you know, that you shouldn't like Nano.
498940	504420	Nano is just not the right tool for me for 99% of what I do with my text editing.
504420	504940	Peace guys.
