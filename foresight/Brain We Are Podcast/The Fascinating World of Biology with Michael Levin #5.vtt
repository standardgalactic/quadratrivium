Welcome to BrainVR podcast. We are sitting here with Professor Michael Levin, a distinguished

00:15.440 --> 00:21.120
professor in the biology department at Tufts and Serfs as a director of the Allen Discovery Center

00:21.120 --> 00:26.320
at Tufts as well and the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.280
Your group focuses on understanding the biophysics, biophysical mechanism that implement decision

00:33.280 --> 00:39.840
making during complex pattern regulation and harnessing the endogenous bioelectric dynamics

00:39.840 --> 00:46.720
towards rational control of growth and form. And you also did your postdoctoral training

00:46.720 --> 00:52.080
at Harvard Medical School where you began to uncover a new bioelectrical language by which

00:52.080 --> 01:00.240
cells coordinate their activity during embryogenesis. And you also had independent laboratory

01:00.880 --> 01:08.160
at Forsythe Institute and now you are at Tufts University and you are developing a new molecular

01:08.160 --> 01:14.320
genetic and conceptual tools to probe large-scale information processing in regeneration,

01:14.320 --> 01:21.520
embryogenesis and cancer suppression. Does that sound right? Did I miss something which is

01:21.520 --> 01:27.200
important or is that okay? Oh yeah, it sounds right. I also have an appointment at the VISA

01:27.200 --> 01:33.280
Institute at Harvard but other than that I think we got everything. All right, cool. So we do our

01:33.280 --> 01:39.760
interviews maybe a little bit differently because we are really interested in people that we talk

01:39.760 --> 01:47.280
to so we love your work, we love what you do and what you've discovered. It's just so fascinating

01:47.280 --> 01:52.880
but we would like to kind of dig a little bit into your kind of a story. Like what were the

01:54.160 --> 01:59.440
you know the moments that decided, the most important moments in your life that decided

02:00.160 --> 02:05.440
the path that you're gonna take, the path that got you right where you are right now,

02:05.440 --> 02:10.320
studying what you studied because I think you were also doing before some computational,

02:11.040 --> 02:17.600
basically like helping science with computational stuff and stuff like that. So could you maybe

02:18.480 --> 02:25.200
you know add a little bit of a story behind what you do and behind your path? Sure, yeah. Well I

02:25.200 --> 02:31.440
suppose we could go to the kind of to the beginning when I was a little kid and I was born in Moscow

02:31.440 --> 02:38.240
Russia so I lived there when I was little and I had asthma and what happens with asthma of course

02:38.240 --> 02:42.080
is that your airway closes up and so you get nervous which makes your airway close up more

02:42.080 --> 02:46.960
which makes you more nervous and so it's this kind of like feedback loop. So at the time we didn't

02:46.960 --> 02:52.720
have access to really medication right proper medication for asthma and so as a solution what

02:52.720 --> 02:58.720
my father used to do is you would take the um this TV set which was this giant like wooden thing

02:58.720 --> 03:02.240
with a tiny little screen in the front right I don't know if you can even imagine such a such a

03:02.240 --> 03:08.080
thing but um but you know and inside of so he would turn it around and he would take off the back

03:08.080 --> 03:12.480
yeah take off the back panel and you could see all the vacuum tubes it had these glowing you know

03:12.480 --> 03:16.800
vacuum tubes and all the electronics and all the parts and and and the you know the goal was to

03:16.800 --> 03:20.880
was to of course distract it right so to distract me so that I would forget about the you know the

03:20.880 --> 03:25.760
breathing and so on and so so that worked but you know kind of amazing that that was for me that

03:25.760 --> 03:29.680
was really a very formative moment because I remember staring at this stuff and thinking

03:30.400 --> 03:35.040
it's kind of incredible that somebody knew how to put all that stuff in exactly the right way to

03:35.040 --> 03:40.000
make the cartoons you know come out the front of the of the set right so somebody is who clearly

03:40.000 --> 03:44.560
it wasn't random clearly somebody knew how to do it uh apparently you can teach people to do it

03:44.560 --> 03:48.160
because you know I said well where does this come from right so in the factory they they sort of do

03:48.160 --> 03:53.200
it okay so so that was amazing and and I right from the beginning I kind of decided that okay

03:53.200 --> 03:56.720
that's that's what I want to be I want to be the guy that knows how to put these things together to

03:56.720 --> 04:03.760
make a particular thing come up so so for years after that I was interested in in in engineering

04:03.760 --> 04:09.760
and and and technology and and things like this but uh at the you know when I when I got a little

04:09.760 --> 04:15.520
bit older I had a I had a friend who uh was really into bugs and insects uh and so we would go

04:15.520 --> 04:18.400
outside and we would he was a little bit older but we would go and play and he would show me all

04:18.400 --> 04:22.880
the different you know caterpillars and beetles and all the stuff and I remember thinking that

04:22.880 --> 04:28.320
well this is very interesting because clearly they are made of parts too they're different parts

04:28.320 --> 04:32.800
than what the tv is made of and they do way more stuff and they appear they're pretty different

04:32.800 --> 04:36.400
they they have preferences and they you know they have behaviors and it's clear they like some

04:36.400 --> 04:41.040
things and don't like some things and so on and I said well how does that work and and where

04:41.040 --> 04:44.880
do those parts come from and who put those parts together right so so it's a really kind of a

04:44.880 --> 04:48.880
you know it's kind of a constant and I spend a lot of time and and and you know what's inside

04:48.880 --> 04:56.240
of us like we probably have parts too and um and uh things like that and so when I was uh

04:56.240 --> 05:01.280
when I went to college well prior to that I was uh when when computers first first showed up and

05:01.280 --> 05:06.400
this was like uh when we came to america in 78 so early 80s you know the computer started to show

05:06.400 --> 05:11.040
up I got I was able to I was able to get access to some very simple you know simple computer

05:11.040 --> 05:16.000
stuff and so I was really interested in programming and and really AI right the idea that that could

05:16.000 --> 05:21.840
we could we develop could we develop new minds that we built ourselves right and so so I went to

05:21.840 --> 05:27.440
I went to college for for I majored in computer science was interested in artificial intelligence

05:27.440 --> 05:33.440
and things like that but basically I'm kind of pretty soon it became really clear that

05:34.880 --> 05:40.080
we would have that that it wasn't going to be good enough just to try to do computer science and

05:40.080 --> 05:44.480
and to do on its own because because we really didn't know what we were doing it was really

05:44.560 --> 05:50.080
very unclear where our minds come from except that in biology you see this every day so

05:50.960 --> 05:55.440
we all start life as a single cell you start life as an egg cell and then eventually this

05:55.440 --> 05:59.920
little piece of chemistry and physics becomes a mind and some bastion right during development

05:59.920 --> 06:04.320
so so so that was it I thought I thought okay I have to I have to also do developmental biology

06:04.320 --> 06:09.760
and so so I gotta um right around the same time I got a second uh bachelor's degree in in in biology

06:10.480 --> 06:14.000
and that's you know that's kind of and then I went to grad school and so that that's kind of my

06:14.000 --> 06:23.280
my story well uh yeah this is how minds emerge from chemistry and physics and even just the whole

06:23.280 --> 06:29.600
organism how does it even happen like it's just one of the most fascinating questions that as humans

06:29.600 --> 06:37.280
we can have I think so um I just I would like to go into this basically into this process

06:37.280 --> 06:43.920
and go maybe step by step into how our minds maybe let's go there maybe how our minds emerge from

06:44.880 --> 06:51.120
physics and and chemistry but we have to start at the level maybe of genes at the of the single

06:51.120 --> 06:56.720
cells of the developmental biology that you that you do so could you kind of explain to us and our

06:56.720 --> 07:03.120
listeners how does it even happen that we have some information maybe you know genetic information

07:03.200 --> 07:09.760
how does it happen that from genes there comes this whole thing that's us that's any organism

07:09.760 --> 07:17.040
basically and maybe we have some you know ideas that you know they're encoded I don't know like

07:17.040 --> 07:23.360
plants basically for our limbs and where the head is should be and stuff like that but maybe there's

07:23.360 --> 07:28.320
a little bit different story there because uh that's fairly simplistic I think and we are

07:28.320 --> 07:36.000
both biologists as well so we know it's like this kind of weird you know mechanism that's not really

07:36.000 --> 07:41.520
easily graspable but I think you have some really nice metaphors and uh and you explain it in a

07:41.520 --> 07:46.880
really nice way so could you maybe uh explain to us how how does that even how does it even

07:46.880 --> 07:52.000
happen how is that possible sure um I'll give you my thoughts on it obviously this is very much an

07:52.000 --> 07:58.160
open you know an open area of investigation and and I should point out that uh my view on it is

07:58.160 --> 08:02.560
probably let's say not not in every way the mainstream view so I'm going to tell you what I

08:02.560 --> 08:06.640
think and then you can get the kind of different perspectives from from from others and it's a

08:06.640 --> 08:10.640
pretty different perspective than you would get from a standard let's say developmental biology

08:10.640 --> 08:17.200
course or something like that um the first thing the first thing I would point out is that in placing

08:17.200 --> 08:23.840
the emphasis on genes is already quite a commitment and we need to back up be firm in it because

08:23.840 --> 08:29.680
especially now I mean it was always problematic but especially now we can read genomes right and we

08:29.680 --> 08:35.040
know what's in the genome and when you read the genome of course you don't see anything like what is

08:35.040 --> 08:40.400
your symmetry type how what's the size of this organism how many eyes it has does it have eyes

08:40.400 --> 08:46.800
how many limbs you don't see any of that in in the genome um what you see is uh you see protein

08:46.800 --> 08:52.160
sequences and so so what's in the genome is the is the description of the micro level hardware

08:52.160 --> 08:56.960
that every cell is going to have so genomes are very much a description of the hardware now we've

08:56.960 --> 09:02.080
known for uh for decades now that uh certain kinds of devices and I'm going to argue that

09:02.080 --> 09:07.520
biology is exactly for for many reasons is exactly such a such a device uh yes there's a

09:07.520 --> 09:11.520
hardware layer and you can can manipulate it or try to understand it at the hardware level

09:11.520 --> 09:16.960
layer but there's a much much um more interesting and possibly a more important

09:16.960 --> 09:23.120
software layer to go along with it and we know this right away you know right away that uh we

09:23.120 --> 09:28.160
have something something missing here today because despite all of the amazing progress in

09:28.160 --> 09:32.960
molecular biology and genetics and all of these things they're very basic questions like for

09:32.960 --> 09:37.840
example in my lab we make something called a frog a lotel what's a frog a lotel well it's a

09:37.840 --> 09:45.200
half a frog embryo cells half axolotl cells okay now uh baby axolotls have legs frog larvae or

09:45.200 --> 09:50.240
tadpoles don't have legs so if I make a frog a lotel and I say to you um well here's your here's a

09:50.240 --> 09:55.280
frog genome okay here's a zenithus genome here's a axolotl genome so you have both genomes now I

09:55.280 --> 10:01.280
want you to tell me are frog a lotel is going to have legs or not and now we have a big problem

10:01.280 --> 10:05.440
we have no idea of frog a lotels ahead of time are going to have legs we don't have any way of

10:05.440 --> 10:11.200
making that making that prediction because what what is what because the outcome here

10:11.200 --> 10:16.880
is uh the process of uh of decision making by cells that are going to determine some kind of

10:16.880 --> 10:22.480
morphology and we get so used to we get so comfortable with with reliable development

10:22.480 --> 10:27.520
the idea that okay frog eggs make frogs and acorns make oak trees that we think well of

10:27.520 --> 10:32.400
course that's how it has to be but actually uh there's an i'm sure we'll talk about it today

10:32.400 --> 10:38.000
there's incredible plasticity in that process so something really important is the idea that

10:39.200 --> 10:45.600
the genome encodes for the hardware of the cells right selection meaning meaning that part of

10:45.600 --> 10:51.040
evolution that selects for specific traits that acts on the phenotype that acts on the final

10:51.040 --> 10:55.760
outcome so on the anatomy and on the behavior but the genome but the mapping between the

10:55.760 --> 11:00.880
genotype and the phenotype is really complicated it's not directly straightforward right except

11:00.880 --> 11:04.880
for very you know there's this pair of enzymes and some things like that that are directly sort of

11:04.880 --> 11:10.160
encoded by by the genes but mostly it's not like that and that internal process that software that

11:10.160 --> 11:14.800
developmental physiology that's actually the software that runs the whole thing is to my mind

11:15.360 --> 11:19.040
one of the most important aspects of all of this because it has some incredibly interesting

11:19.040 --> 11:24.880
properties it has some degree of intelligence in the sense of novel problem solving ability in

11:24.880 --> 11:31.520
new circumstances and that has huge implications for biomedicine for for understanding evolution

11:31.520 --> 11:39.040
for basic basic developmental biology that that that layer that that that that the interactions

11:39.040 --> 11:44.960
there are really profound there's a lot of work that's being done by that layer and in addition

11:44.960 --> 11:52.720
to that i want to pretty early in the discussion pull out something else when when we when we try

11:52.720 --> 11:57.760
to explain things so we see something let's say this is here's a creature and it has a particular

11:57.760 --> 12:03.920
style of of hand or it has some eyes or whatever it is and we want to explain this so you can ask

12:03.920 --> 12:10.080
yourself well well where where does that come from right well how do we explain it and i want to

12:10.080 --> 12:14.960
start off by thinking early on about what it means to explain certain kinds of features like what

12:14.960 --> 12:19.280
does that mean how what does it mean to explain where something comes from imagine that i'll give

12:19.280 --> 12:23.120
you i'll give you two simple examples and then you'll see why it matters to developmental biology

12:23.120 --> 12:27.360
um you may have seen this thing it's called a gallatin board so it's a piece of wood like this

12:27.360 --> 12:32.240
you bang a bunch of nails into it just sort of space regular and you take a bag of marbles

12:32.240 --> 12:35.520
and you dump it into the top of the board what happens boom boom boom boom boom that you know

12:35.520 --> 12:39.120
they sort of go around and in the end if you have enough marbles what did they do they land in this

12:39.120 --> 12:43.040
beautiful bell curve at the bottom right you get then it's a tip but you can buy this toy on amazon

12:43.040 --> 12:47.600
whatever so you get this you get this toy so you could ask yourself okay uh where does this beautiful

12:47.600 --> 12:54.000
bell curve shape come from is it in the wood no is it in the description of the nails no is it in

12:54.000 --> 12:59.600
the positioning of the nails no is it in the marbles no where does it come from right so so

12:59.600 --> 13:05.920
that's so that's one simple example another example is if you if you discover a transistor let's say

13:05.920 --> 13:11.280
you discover how to make a transistor and for example biological ion channels are a kind of

13:11.280 --> 13:15.760
transistor because they can be voltage gated right so they're voltage gated current conductances so

13:15.760 --> 13:20.320
they're basically transistors if you figure out how to make a transistor you could connect a few of

13:20.320 --> 13:25.920
those transistors into a logic gate so it could be and or those kinds of logic gates right those

13:25.920 --> 13:31.360
logic gates come with a truth table that tells you how it works yeah for example the and yeah and

13:31.360 --> 13:35.680
with those truth tables especially if you have a knot and an and gate you can make all kinds of

13:35.680 --> 13:41.360
all kinds of things now you can ask yourself where did that truth table come from i didn't

13:41.440 --> 13:47.040
and i didn't have to evolve a truth table what i evolved is a transistor it's a piece of it's a

13:47.040 --> 13:52.800
piece of physics but the truth table came for free once once you have certain things so where do

13:52.800 --> 13:58.480
those things come from so so sometimes they come from specific selection forces other times there

13:58.480 --> 14:02.800
are kind of free lunch in a certain sense and there are many types of these you know in geometry

14:02.800 --> 14:06.800
in in basic i mean mathematicians have been talking about this for a long time right the

14:06.800 --> 14:11.120
truths of of number theory of prime number distributions all these kinds of things they

14:11.120 --> 14:16.480
you don't have to evolve them they're just sort of given to you for free if you have the right kind of

14:16.480 --> 14:22.480
physical machine that to to to take advantage of them so there are laws of biomechanics about

14:22.480 --> 14:28.560
bioelectrics or computation and many things and so what evolution might do so is is is is find a

14:28.560 --> 14:32.560
simple machine that can harness all this stuff and so so i so i think it's important to understand

14:32.560 --> 14:37.680
that when we ask where does it come from there's the part that is genetic but there's also that's

14:37.680 --> 14:42.080
the part that's generic and people like Stuart Stuart Newman or Stu Kaufman have been talking

14:42.080 --> 14:47.040
about this for for many years it's sort of there are generic laws of the universe that that biology

14:47.040 --> 14:51.760
can harness that are not specifically in the genes anymore than that nice bell curve is in the

14:51.760 --> 14:58.080
description of the wood and the nails speaking of intelligence and these these generic laws

14:58.080 --> 15:05.920
how do the cells and cell groups decide what to make and when the process is finished yeah that's

15:05.920 --> 15:11.920
that's that's very important so so there's two ways to to think about that question one way is

15:11.920 --> 15:18.720
how does the decision making work in general so so so how do we scale up so so the the amazing

15:18.720 --> 15:25.360
thing about biology is that evolution unlike unlike a lot of our engineering you know up until

15:25.360 --> 15:30.800
recently when we were engineering we were working with passive materials so you know wood

15:30.800 --> 15:34.560
metal that kind of stuff and the thing about passive materials is that you as the engineer

15:34.560 --> 15:39.360
are responsible for all the outcomes the material basically doesn't do anything except keep its shape

15:39.360 --> 15:44.480
usually and then you are responsible for placing it however it goes evolution can't do that because

15:44.480 --> 15:49.600
evolution is working with an agential material the cells themselves have abilities they have

15:50.480 --> 15:55.920
preferences they have behavioral repertoires so from that perspective evolution evolution is

15:55.920 --> 16:00.240
working with a material that already has all these activities and so what you're really looking at

16:00.240 --> 16:04.720
is behavior shaping it's a lot more like behavior shaping where where what you want is for cells to

16:04.720 --> 16:09.360
give other cells signals so that they do specific things and I can give you some some cool examples

16:09.360 --> 16:17.760
of that but anyway so so what we have to understand is how this process of competent subunits works

16:17.840 --> 16:25.680
together to to to pursue bigger goals right now individual cells are very good at pursuing cell

16:25.680 --> 16:31.760
level goals what's a cell level goal pH hunger level right so some sort of metabolic states all

16:31.760 --> 16:39.120
kinds of like local little little things but multicellular collectives let's say limbs you

16:39.120 --> 16:44.080
know cells of limbs and those kind of things they can work towards much larger goals so for example

16:44.080 --> 16:48.160
in a salamander and they work together to build a limb if you cut off some of the fingers or the

16:48.160 --> 16:53.280
whole wrist or the hand they will rebuild exactly what goes there right they will rebuild the exact

16:53.280 --> 16:57.680
limb and then they stop when they're done so you can see this kind of goal-directed activity

16:57.680 --> 17:02.880
where the system will exert energy to minimize the error between whatever is happening now versus

17:02.880 --> 17:07.520
what it wants to have happened so so of course there's many things not understood about this we

17:07.520 --> 17:14.400
are very actively studying this process but one thing that we can now see is that the process of

17:14.400 --> 17:21.200
connecting the connecting cells into specifically electrical networks okay allows them to do a

17:21.200 --> 17:26.800
very interesting kind of scaling and it's it's a little bit like the the notion of artificial

17:26.800 --> 17:31.600
networks in computer science where you can you can connect these little subunits the subunits by

17:31.600 --> 17:36.080
themselves don't do terribly much although cells of course do but you can connect them in a particular

17:36.080 --> 17:40.640
way that enables the whole thing to have bigger computational properties and i can give you i

17:40.640 --> 17:47.360
can i'll i'll give you just a very very simple example of how it works imagine imagine two cells

17:47.360 --> 17:52.240
that are signaling to each other in the conventional way which means one cell secretes some kind of

17:52.240 --> 17:56.720
signaling molecule that floats around and and it binds the next cell and okay that's a signal

17:56.720 --> 18:01.440
so the thing with that kind of signaling is that the receiver is very clear that this signal came

18:01.440 --> 18:06.080
from outside and once you get a signal from outside you can ignore it you can do something

18:06.080 --> 18:11.760
about it whatever you have many options now imagine evolution invented this amazing thing

18:11.760 --> 18:16.160
called a gap junction a gap junction is this these these proteins that allow cells to stick

18:16.160 --> 18:21.600
together and pass small molecules directly between the intercellular milieu from one

18:21.600 --> 18:25.920
into the other the amazing thing about the gap junction is and i'm simplifying this greatly

18:25.920 --> 18:31.760
but but the interesting piece of this is that when something happens to cell a let's say let's say

18:31.760 --> 18:36.240
it got injured it got poked or something in it and and there's a calcium spike that that went on

18:36.240 --> 18:41.760
that calcium spike or whatever memory molecule will propagate through the gap junction into the other

18:41.760 --> 18:48.080
cell and what i what i what i say about the gap junctions is that they have this property of

18:48.080 --> 18:53.520
wiping identity meaning that when that signal propagates this cell cannot tell that that signal

18:53.520 --> 18:57.760
came from outside because you because because it's calcium spike looks exactly like this other

18:57.760 --> 19:03.360
calcium spike once there is a signal a physiological signal of something now you don't know that it

19:03.360 --> 19:08.640
came from from the outside right so what this means is that there's a kind of mind meld almost a

19:08.640 --> 19:14.560
mental connection between these two cells where memories lose identity they lose ownership so

19:14.560 --> 19:19.920
from the perspective of this single cell that's a fault that that molecule is a false memory

19:19.920 --> 19:24.560
because it this cell never got poked but from the perspective of the collective

19:24.560 --> 19:29.920
that's absolutely a true memory because the collective did get poked and so what happens is

19:29.920 --> 19:35.600
when cells get merged into these tight electrical networks they start to the the the identity the

19:35.600 --> 19:40.480
separated identity starts to fuzz meaning that it's it's they're they're having a hard time keeping

19:40.480 --> 19:45.200
their their knowledge separate and when when when you can't if you and i can't keep our memories

19:45.200 --> 19:50.000
separate then in an important sense we become one larger unit right because that that distinction

19:50.000 --> 19:54.800
starts to break down so when that distinction breaks down and cells connect into larger electrical

19:54.800 --> 20:00.480
networks the three things happen those three things let's go back to the homeostasis right

20:00.480 --> 20:04.400
if you're a single cell and you're trying to keep homeostasis you have to do three things

20:04.400 --> 20:10.960
you have to be able to measure what's going on now what is my ph now then you have to remember

20:10.960 --> 20:15.920
what the correct one is what's my correct ph range and then third you have to take action

20:15.920 --> 20:20.880
to bring the current ph to closer to the correct ph right maybe a dump asset or something like that

20:21.760 --> 20:26.400
imagine what happens to those three things when cells connect connect into large electrical

20:26.400 --> 20:30.960
networks so tissues when you take a measurement because you're gap junctionally connected you

20:30.960 --> 20:35.200
don't you no longer just measure your own local environment because you're all connected you

20:35.200 --> 20:39.520
measure something very large so you're taking non-local measurements right every cell knows

20:39.520 --> 20:43.520
what's going on everywhere else because your measurement is now a function of a much larger

20:43.520 --> 20:49.760
area when you try to remember what is the right set point your computational capacity is now huge

20:49.760 --> 20:53.520
whereas before you might only be able to remember a few very small things well now you're a big

20:53.520 --> 20:57.840
network now you might be able to remember all kinds of things right and your action whereas

20:57.840 --> 21:03.040
before you were a single cell able to take local actions as a collective you might do all kinds

21:03.040 --> 21:06.720
of interesting things you might bend you might deform like a sheet you could do all sorts of

21:06.720 --> 21:11.680
things but they're large things so everything scales up right the other interesting thing that

21:11.680 --> 21:19.760
happens here is that you scale you scale stress and what i mean by that let's just think about this

21:19.760 --> 21:24.960
for a second why when you're when you take a measurement and it's not correct why do you

21:24.960 --> 21:30.320
take any action to fix it the way biology tends to handle it is by stress so stress is proportional

21:30.320 --> 21:35.440
to that delta between the current state and the preferred state and and what it does is try to

21:35.440 --> 21:39.600
minimize stress as long as that stress is high i'm going to take action and when the stress goes

21:39.600 --> 21:44.720
low enough then i can relax everything's cool right that's something like that so what you can

21:44.720 --> 21:51.200
do is so just imagine if you're a single cell by proper by by by releasing your stress molecules

21:51.200 --> 21:56.720
and propagating them out to your neighbors you make your problem becomes their problem whereas

21:56.720 --> 22:00.960
before if you were stressed out let's say you're a cell that is sitting in some other cells and

22:00.960 --> 22:04.480
you're in the wrong location you need to be up here but you're down here and you have some

22:04.480 --> 22:09.200
amount of stress over that if you just keep your stress you will stay there and no one will get out

22:09.200 --> 22:13.840
of your way and you cannot move if you start to propagate your stress outwards remember it's

22:13.840 --> 22:18.400
will be the same stress molecule as all the other cells have so they're stressed too everything gets

22:18.400 --> 22:22.400
a little more plastic everybody everybody's sort of willing to change and it doesn't have to be in

22:22.400 --> 22:26.480
physical space right it could be in physiological states it could be in transcriptional states

22:26.480 --> 22:30.560
whatever but that stresses it makes everything a little more plastic and then you can go where

22:30.560 --> 22:36.320
you need to go and then the stress will drop again so it doesn't make anybody more altruistic

22:36.320 --> 22:40.240
what it does is everybody acts because they want to reduce their stress not because they care about

22:40.240 --> 22:47.040
you but it's a very cool mechanism to take to to to to scale up goals because it because your

22:47.040 --> 22:50.400
local goal becomes everybody's goal because everybody wants you to stop stressing so you

22:50.400 --> 22:55.040
can stop stressing them out so so so that that kind of process and i mean i'm only telling you the

22:55.040 --> 22:58.160
part that we i think we have a little bit of insight to there are many things here that we

22:58.160 --> 23:05.600
don't understand that kind of process enables cells that care about little tiny things okay to

23:05.600 --> 23:10.640
start to have bigger goals the scaling of goals whereas before your goals were physically in

23:10.640 --> 23:14.880
terms of space and time very small now they're starting to get bigger and this is how you have

23:14.880 --> 23:18.880
goal and a talk goals in the anatomical space so let's make you know let's make a limb or whatever

23:18.880 --> 23:26.320
that that could be a story of scaling okay so like right now it just seems like you know it's

23:27.040 --> 23:32.720
for you it's like daily work basically and it's you deal with this on daily basis but basically

23:32.720 --> 23:39.440
what you just said is some really important insight starting by okay there is some bio

23:39.440 --> 23:46.320
electrically imprinted information and not you know neuronally binded so it's just by you know

23:46.320 --> 23:52.240
any cell and it makes sense because you know neurons are also you know a cell so it makes

23:52.240 --> 23:56.560
sense that other cells they have ion channels they have different kind of channels and they can

23:56.560 --> 24:03.760
make gradients as well so why not make bioelectric gradients so this is like the first huge huge

24:03.760 --> 24:10.240
insight and i think you know a lot of your work kind of stands on that as well i think and it's

24:10.240 --> 24:19.120
so important and what is then i was i was listening to your other some other interviews and work as

24:19.120 --> 24:28.000
well and the the thought of agent of agency of individual of self by forgetting who i am and

24:28.000 --> 24:34.480
you know kind of mind melting together that's just that's really brilliant and i wanted to you know

24:36.480 --> 24:42.480
there is this thing where the bio bio electrically imprinted information could could also get

24:42.480 --> 24:50.160
decoupled as well and it just came to my mind because the decoupled did that decoupled bio

24:50.160 --> 24:59.600
electrically imprinted information uh is also um is also similar to what happens with cancer am i

24:59.600 --> 25:07.440
right or yeah yes no yeah i just wanted to i had to thought where if there is like maybe that's just

25:07.440 --> 25:13.040
you know i'm thinking out loud but you were talking about the stress and the amplifying of

25:13.040 --> 25:19.040
stress basically a little bit so what if there is like too much stress and some of the cells kind

25:19.040 --> 25:24.800
of decided oh my god this is like too much out of this whole agent like it's too much i'm gonna you

25:24.800 --> 25:30.800
know head out and leave this entity there and i'm gonna you know play by myself maybe is that

25:30.800 --> 25:36.320
something that we might think about i think that's a very reasonable idea we are testing exactly that

25:36.400 --> 25:41.040
hypothesis uh i don't have the answer for you yet but uh i think by the end of the year we

25:41.040 --> 25:44.960
should know something about this i think i think yeah i think that's completely reasonable i mean

25:44.960 --> 25:50.480
these electrical networks let's just take a take a step back here um if we think about all the cool

25:50.480 --> 25:54.720
things that brains do right so they have memory they can pursue goals they have preferences all

25:54.720 --> 25:59.280
these things where did all these things come from so of course they didn't just sort of evolve out of

25:59.280 --> 26:03.760
the arise out of nowhere they they evolved from much more simple versions of the same thing and

26:03.760 --> 26:10.240
as far as we can tell what basically evolution did was pivot some very early biophysical tricks

26:10.240 --> 26:15.200
into different problem spaces so cells were first solving problems in metabolic space and then

26:15.760 --> 26:21.120
physiological space and then transcriptional space uh and then morpheus space and later

26:21.120 --> 26:26.240
three-dimensional space when muscles and neurons came aboard right so we have to think about about

26:26.240 --> 26:31.760
about this kind of intelligence long before three-dimensional space and in fact evolution

26:31.760 --> 26:37.440
discovered that electrical networks are really great for this kind of thing very long time ago

26:37.440 --> 26:42.160
so for example there's some beautiful work on bacterial biofilms where even even bacterial

26:42.160 --> 26:48.000
biofilms can do some of these brain-like things so ion channels were were at the beginning you

26:48.000 --> 26:51.920
know there's some great neuroscience koshland did some great neuroscience and bacteria should

26:51.920 --> 26:58.560
looking at how ion channels work and now the the modern uh work uh is is is really showing that

26:58.560 --> 27:05.200
this is this stuff is ancient so what it was used for before was to navigate something called morpheus

27:05.200 --> 27:10.400
space which is the space of anatomical configurations right what shape should we be navigating that

27:10.400 --> 27:14.640
space is exactly the same problem as navigating three-dimensional space there are good regions

27:14.640 --> 27:18.720
there are bad regions there are barriers sometimes you find yourself not where you expected you have

27:18.720 --> 27:22.800
to figure out how to get to where you're going you have limited uh energy you have limited ability

27:22.800 --> 27:30.240
to see where what's what's around you exactly the same problems and so and so biology um uh

27:31.360 --> 27:35.120
you know it was was using these electrical networks very early and so and so what happens

27:35.120 --> 27:39.840
in uh in multicellularity is that cells join together into these electrical networks

27:39.840 --> 27:47.120
to more intelligently navigate that space but as you just pointed out that uh that process

27:47.120 --> 27:52.160
can break down it has failure modes and one failure mode is and of course we know that

27:52.240 --> 27:57.280
that all kinds of stresses can lead to cancerous transformation one failure mode is when the

27:57.280 --> 28:01.680
cell is electrically disconnect and it doesn't have to be caused genetically although it can be

28:01.680 --> 28:05.920
the first thing that oncogenes tend to do is to is to electrically uncouple cells

28:05.920 --> 28:09.520
shutting down gap junctions is one of the first things that that oncogenes tend to do

28:11.520 --> 28:16.640
once the cells uh electrically disconnect then as far as they're concerned the rest of the body

28:16.640 --> 28:21.840
is just external environment so that boundary between me and the outside world can grow and shrink

28:22.160 --> 28:27.360
it can grow during evolution uh or and it can shrink during cancer where the cancer cells are

28:27.360 --> 28:33.280
not any more selfish than the other cells they're just have smaller cells right like everybody's

28:33.280 --> 28:37.680
equally selfish in biology just sometimes your self is huge and sometimes your self is sometimes

28:37.680 --> 28:42.640
your self is tiny and and exactly as you said those cells might say okay i'm out of this network

28:42.640 --> 28:48.320
and as soon as you unplug you no longer see the bigger the bigger goal which is to build a nice

28:48.320 --> 28:53.440
limb or a kidney or a liver or something like that what you see is your your ancient unicellular

28:53.440 --> 28:57.920
goals which is what for to become two cells for every cell to become two cells and then to go

28:57.920 --> 29:04.240
wherever life is good and that's metastasis basically so do i understand it well in my mind

29:04.240 --> 29:10.000
just appeared some uh hierarchy of identities uh from the little cell to the multicellular

29:10.720 --> 29:17.520
organism of or a multicellular group and uh i would like to ask you if i understand it well that

29:18.240 --> 29:24.560
what binds these cells together what binds their intention together so they're able to make a limb

29:24.560 --> 29:31.760
is uh these uh electric by bioelectrical networks and in these bioelectrical networks

29:31.760 --> 29:38.640
there is a working some kind of uh memory like can i uh can i can i imagine like that oh yes yes

29:38.640 --> 29:45.280
yes it is literally and it is it is literally a kind of memory and i say that because i mean think

29:45.280 --> 29:51.840
about um so in all of these things all all agency claims okay this is my perspective of course all

29:51.840 --> 29:56.960
agency claims meaning how intelligent is something what kind of agency it has are really engineering

29:56.960 --> 30:00.480
claims they're not philosophical claims they're engineering claims that need to be tested by

30:00.480 --> 30:06.720
experiment so if i tell you if i show you a new device and i say to you this is a homeostatic

30:06.720 --> 30:11.920
device it's a it's i say it's it's it's it's it has the cognitive level of a thermostat it's able to

30:12.240 --> 30:17.120
it's able to pursue local goals and and that's that's what it has right what i'm telling you

30:17.120 --> 30:21.920
really is it's not it's not a you know kind of a philosophical claim it's it's engineering it means

30:21.920 --> 30:27.440
that if you in order to test this idea you should say okay if you are correct then three things have

30:27.440 --> 30:34.640
to be true we have to find how the set point is encoded because because the because the because

30:34.640 --> 30:40.880
any homeostatic system has to encode a set point we have to be able to decode that information meaning

30:40.880 --> 30:45.520
read what is the set point i have to be able to read it and then we have to be able to change it

30:45.520 --> 30:50.320
rewrite it in a way that does not require physically rewiring the rest of the machine

30:51.360 --> 30:56.560
in order to change it if you have to rewire the whole machine then you didn't give me a thermostat

30:56.560 --> 31:00.560
you gave me a mechanical clock or something like this right that does not rise to the level of a

31:00.560 --> 31:06.480
thermostat with the magic about a thermostat is that i don't need to know how the rest of it works

31:06.480 --> 31:11.920
and i don't need to rewire the whole thing all i need to know is where is the set point how do i

31:11.920 --> 31:15.520
read the set point and how do i write the set point and then something beautiful happens i

31:15.520 --> 31:20.000
read i reset the goal and the machine takes care of the rest right that's an engineering dependency

31:20.000 --> 31:25.440
it means that if i if i use this in my you know in my bigger device i don't have to micromanage

31:25.440 --> 31:29.360
the temperature i let this thing take care of it right that's those are that's what an agency

31:29.360 --> 31:34.640
claim is it's how much um how much can you trust something to do in your own absence basically

31:34.640 --> 31:40.080
right that's that's my view of agency so so uh so why do we so so let's let's test this out how do

31:40.080 --> 31:47.840
we call it a memory if if um let's say uh so so here's good to talk about this model system of

31:47.840 --> 31:53.680
flatworms so flatworm is a little free living thing called a planarian it has a head and a tail

31:53.680 --> 31:59.360
and uh you know they're very cute they have a true brain lots of internal tissues and things like that

31:59.360 --> 32:02.880
um they have many interesting properties one of the interesting properties is that you can cut

32:02.880 --> 32:08.320
them into pieces and every piece regrows exactly what's missing not only does it regrow what's

32:08.320 --> 32:12.640
missing but the piece actually shrinks so that by the time the new head and tail come up of course

32:12.640 --> 32:17.600
they're small the whole thing will be proportional right so it's very cool everything is scaled down

32:17.600 --> 32:23.280
and and you get a perfect little worm so you might ask the question okay so you might say okay uh we

32:23.280 --> 32:29.840
here we have two hypotheses hypothesis number one is that this is a a purely emergent mechanical

32:29.840 --> 32:36.320
process so all the cells locally do whatever they do based on local rules and uh that's it

32:36.320 --> 32:42.080
whatever happens happens that's that's the standard null hypothesis uh some years ago i made a different

32:42.080 --> 32:46.800
hypothesis and i said okay i think there's more intelligence here than that i think it's a homeostatic

32:46.800 --> 32:51.920
system which means that i think this thing actually remembers what a correct planarian is supposed to

32:51.920 --> 32:58.080
look like now that's a very that's a very weird kind of claim because uh you know first of all

32:58.080 --> 33:03.200
people like to reserve these kind of terms for complex you know they say what do you mean it

33:03.200 --> 33:07.120
remembers right well i remember things i'm like well you know memory there's all kinds of memories

33:07.120 --> 33:12.080
and you're not the only thing that can remember things um and so and so i said that's okay let's

33:12.080 --> 33:18.160
see let's see if the memory paradigm helps us here at all so so so we started looking and we found

33:18.160 --> 33:24.320
out we found out three things we found out that a if you actually look at the bioelectrical pattern

33:24.320 --> 33:28.400
and the way you do that is using these voltage sense that a fluorescent dye so it's a chemical

33:28.400 --> 33:32.880
you throw it on and it basically glows depending on the local voltage concentration

33:32.880 --> 33:37.120
it's a it's the whole the whole thing by the way is a version of we we i i we steal all kinds of

33:37.120 --> 33:42.160
ideas from neuroscience because it's all the same stuff so so this is basically the notion of neural

33:42.160 --> 33:46.240
decoding right this idea that they have a neuroscience that if we just scan the brain and we if we

33:46.240 --> 33:49.920
understood how to decode it we would see your memories and your plans and your you know all the

33:49.920 --> 33:53.600
mental content that you have so i said okay let's see if we can do this for the rest of the body

33:53.600 --> 33:59.120
let's see i'm going to take seriously the idea that the body is a collective intelligence of cells

33:59.120 --> 34:02.880
the same way that we are a collective intelligence of neurons right we're bags of walking neurons

34:02.880 --> 34:07.120
basically so i said okay let's take seriously this idea that that that there's a collective

34:07.120 --> 34:12.800
intelligence that navigates morpho space now in morpho space there are two headed worms and one

34:12.800 --> 34:17.600
headed worms and triangular heads and flat heads is all this stuff in morpho space these animals

34:17.600 --> 34:22.400
are amazing at navigating that space right the way that rats can navigate mazes these guys navigate

34:23.040 --> 34:27.600
morpho space it's okay well let's take seriously the idea that this is a collective intelligence

34:27.600 --> 34:31.760
it's navigating morpho space that means that somewhere there's going to be a memory of where

34:31.760 --> 34:36.880
it's going let's see if we can see this memory so we found out that yes in fact we can see a

34:36.880 --> 34:43.440
bioelectric pattern that tells you how many heads a piece is supposed to have we then we said well

34:43.440 --> 34:48.640
now let's rewrite it and so the way we can rewrite it is you can make a computational model that will

34:48.640 --> 34:54.880
say this is what the pattern of the tissue looks like now which what what channels do I need to open

34:54.880 --> 34:59.360
or close to make the pattern be different okay and this is of course is what we're working now for

34:59.360 --> 35:03.760
biomedicine this is this is the big you know kind of the big idea is that if you can predict what

35:03.760 --> 35:07.920
what channel opening and closing would get you to the right state maybe you can address all kinds

35:07.920 --> 35:14.240
of defects and things like that so so so we found some some drugs that open and close ion channels

35:14.240 --> 35:21.360
and we converted that one head uh kind of pattern to a two head pattern no genetic change meaning we

35:21.360 --> 35:26.960
don't do no CRISPR no genomic editing no trans genes we don't do anything genetically but what we found

35:26.960 --> 35:34.560
is is two amazing things once you do that if you injure the animal it then will consult the pattern

35:34.560 --> 35:39.120
see that oh two heads okay and it and it builds a two-headed worm right no problem the cells don't

35:39.120 --> 35:43.280
care because that is their reference the cells have no idea that anything is wrong because that is

35:43.280 --> 35:46.880
what tells them what they're supposed to be in the first place so that's the first thing the second

35:46.880 --> 35:52.640
thing we found is that that electric circuit is amazing because it has it it's it's it's really

35:52.640 --> 35:57.360
is a memory because once you convert them to two-headed it stays two-headed so you can cut them

35:57.360 --> 36:03.040
again and again and again and they will continue to wait that that circuit once you've switched it

36:03.040 --> 36:08.480
so so you can think about it like that okay so so so then you ask so where was the number of heads

36:08.560 --> 36:13.360
encoded really right was it encoded in the genome you might want to say that because

36:15.600 --> 36:21.360
all standard worms look the same so maybe the so it has to be somewhere it's right on the other

36:21.360 --> 36:26.320
hand clearly it's not completely determined by the genome because we just made a line of of of

36:26.320 --> 36:31.760
two-headed worms that that has nothing genetically wrong with them so here's the here's the I mean

36:31.840 --> 36:41.040
so here's the kind of analogy that I that I like what the genome gives you is a piece of hardware

36:41.040 --> 36:46.080
meaning that genome sets all the channels and all the other stuff it it it encodes a piece of

36:46.080 --> 36:51.840
hardware that very reliably when the power is first turned on when the thing is first alive

36:51.840 --> 36:58.320
and the physiology is going it very reliably settles into a particular state when you buy a

36:58.320 --> 37:02.400
calculator you imagine you you get it you get a parts list that has a bunch of electronic parts

37:02.400 --> 37:07.360
you assemble them according to the to the schematic you turn on the power and the little lcd it says

37:07.360 --> 37:12.320
zero every single time you do it a thousand times every single time it starts at zero okay great so

37:12.320 --> 37:16.720
it's reliable it says zero but then you realize that hey wait a minute this thing is actually a

37:16.720 --> 37:22.000
programmable calculator which means that if I give it some inputs not to rewire it I can put away my

37:22.000 --> 37:26.240
soldering iron right I don't need to rewire it but I can give it some input some brief you know

37:26.240 --> 37:31.120
taps on the buttons that change the electrical signal just for a brief amount of time then I can

37:31.120 --> 37:35.200
make the thing instead of zero I can make it say something else and in fact it has a memory and tomorrow

37:35.200 --> 37:39.360
it will say something else again it will you know still have the same thing so so this is what I

37:39.360 --> 37:45.760
think happens I think evolution builds hardware that is reprogrammable that has a default a very

37:45.760 --> 37:51.120
reliable default state but that's not the only state and we have many many other interesting

37:51.120 --> 37:56.640
experiments with xenobots and other things that can tell that that tell you that the default

37:56.640 --> 38:01.040
behavior of this thing is not the only behavior that's just the kind of you know the default

38:01.040 --> 38:08.160
behavior so is this feature what you call anatomical homeostasis that like every cell has its

38:08.160 --> 38:15.680
local position in some some group or some or some body and it has some kind of a latent memory

38:15.760 --> 38:22.640
that gets activated in times of need for example in some in some damage or when it needs to

38:23.840 --> 38:31.040
again regenerate something yes except that I don't think it's a single cell level memory

38:31.040 --> 38:34.880
I don't think the single I mean single cells also have memory of course but I think but the

38:34.880 --> 38:40.080
thing that we're talking about now is a property of the network not of individual cells and we've

38:40.080 --> 38:43.760
shown the we have many examples where you can mix things around and it doesn't matter where they go

38:43.760 --> 38:49.200
the whole the the collective it's the collective is what stores and and we're pretty used to this

38:49.200 --> 38:53.040
right with holographic theories of memory with neural networks where it's not the individual

38:53.040 --> 38:56.960
neurons that know anything it's the network that knows something so I think I think that's

38:56.960 --> 39:02.000
the you know bi-electricity is not a single cell the exciting the exciting part of bi-electricity

39:02.000 --> 39:06.800
is not the single cell property it's the network property yes yes I meant it this way like the

39:06.800 --> 39:12.880
the cell perceives the information that flows from the cells around and just this this flow of

39:12.960 --> 39:18.160
information that these cells can perceive their position in the body and their role and what they

39:18.160 --> 39:22.240
are supposed to make as a position and function I mean think about think about you know in the

39:22.240 --> 39:27.840
the more familiar version in the brain your brain is an electrical network that makes decisions

39:27.840 --> 39:32.880
and then issues commands to muscle cells right to implement to implement to move you through

39:32.880 --> 39:37.280
three-dimensional space electrical circuits in the body are exactly the same thing but they

39:37.280 --> 39:42.560
issue commands to other cell types not just muscle to move you through anatomical space

39:42.560 --> 39:45.920
they don't move you through three-dimensional space although there are systems where that's the

39:45.920 --> 39:50.960
sit you know that that merges kind of tightly but but they they're moving you through morpher space

39:50.960 --> 39:55.040
and it's the exact same thing it's the it's the the decision-making in the electrical network and

39:55.040 --> 40:00.880
then signals are passed down to let's activate some genes let's act let's activate some some cell

40:00.880 --> 40:07.680
migration differentiation proliferation cell death all of this stuff is downstream of that

40:07.680 --> 40:12.240
can you tell us more about your experiments for example that one that when you created

40:12.880 --> 40:19.760
an eye a third eye on the frog so okay so so there's two there are two different types of

40:19.760 --> 40:26.880
experiments there the first one has to do with bioelectricity and it's this idea that we we we

40:26.880 --> 40:34.960
we looked at the the early frog embryo and in the early frog embryo you can see that an

40:34.960 --> 40:40.240
electrical pre pattern that tells you where all the organs of the face are going to be right you

40:40.240 --> 40:44.800
can already see them it's it's cool because it's it's a it's an easy pattern to start with because

40:44.800 --> 40:48.720
some of them are incredibly complicated and you don't know what the encoding is the face one is

40:48.720 --> 40:52.400
really nice because you can see it i mean it basically looks like a face so there's not much

40:52.400 --> 40:57.200
decoding that needs to happen it looks like a face some of them are really complicated so so you

40:57.200 --> 41:01.360
can ask the question and we actually did the eye experiments before we even knew about the face but

41:01.360 --> 41:06.640
but you know this i'm telling you in a way that makes the logic clear you might ask the question

41:06.640 --> 41:13.680
if this bioelectrical state tells the system where to put the eye what happens if we if we

41:13.680 --> 41:18.240
copy that state somewhere else because that's how you want to test it because otherwise you might

41:18.240 --> 41:22.240
say well that pattern doesn't do anything it's just kind of a epi phenomenon it's a byproduct right

41:22.240 --> 41:28.240
so so now we got to do the functional experiment so long ago and this is uh this is you know kind

41:28.240 --> 41:33.440
of part of the story storytelling but when when we when we first started my lab i had a i had a

41:33.440 --> 41:37.360
graduate student named Ivy Chen she was actually a dental student she became a dentist afterwards

41:37.360 --> 41:41.920
she's not a scientist but but she but she was doing research in the lab and i had asked her to

41:41.920 --> 41:47.760
inject some ion channels they happen to be curse 6.1 ion channels i asked her to inject some RNA

41:47.760 --> 41:53.760
for curse 6.1 in weird places in the early frog embryo okay uh now at the time this is this was

41:53.760 --> 42:00.480
considered ridiculous because i remember as a postdoc i i um i wrote away to all sorts i wrote

42:00.480 --> 42:06.480
letters to all sorts of people working on uh neuroscience and gut physiology and kidney and

42:06.480 --> 42:11.280
everything and i said look if you've cloned any ion channel genes send them to me and and i'm going

42:11.280 --> 42:15.280
to try to to to you know to reproduce them somewhere else and i said look this is you're

42:15.280 --> 42:20.240
crazy because because voltage is a housekeeping parameter and if you perturb the voltage everything

42:20.240 --> 42:24.240
will just die and you will have uninterpretable phenotypes okay that was the standard assumption

42:24.240 --> 42:27.600
and i was pretty sure that that that was that was wrong so i wanted to test that

42:28.320 --> 42:33.040
so i asked her to to inject these these things and then and so so we inject them then we come back

42:33.040 --> 42:37.440
six days later and uh and she says to me and something funny because she says um you know

42:37.440 --> 42:41.680
they're full of these black dots and they said black dots um what is that let me look so i get

42:41.680 --> 42:45.360
that i sit in front of the microscope together and i said oh my god look carefully at these black

42:45.440 --> 42:50.880
dots these are eyes and so these tadpoles had eyes all over the place because what you what we were

42:50.880 --> 42:57.440
doing is reproducing the electrical uh map that says build an eye here we were reproducing that on

42:57.440 --> 43:01.920
the tail and the gut i mean anywhere and so we found out several important things that day one

43:02.800 --> 43:07.840
is that in fact about voltage is not just a housekeeping parameter it is uh it is

43:07.840 --> 43:13.280
instructive for a very subtle thing for first shape number two it's extremely modular the

43:13.280 --> 43:18.400
architecture of the animal is modular because we didn't have to provide all the information on

43:18.400 --> 43:22.320
how to make an eye i mean can you imagine how many different cell types and the or you know the

43:22.320 --> 43:26.160
positioning this goes back to your first question of where does the shape come from right we didn't

43:26.160 --> 43:29.760
have to say well here's how you make an eye first you need a lens and then a retina then we have to

43:29.760 --> 43:34.320
do any of that we we provide a very simple piece of bioelectric information this is your voltage

43:34.320 --> 43:39.520
pattern so that looks like a very much like a subroutine call right when you program you have

43:39.520 --> 43:44.560
a subroutine call which is a simple trigger that kick starts a very complex set of a set of actions

43:45.200 --> 43:52.800
third uh the eyes formed and then they stopped so again that that that module that subroutine

43:52.800 --> 43:57.040
is self-contained we'd make an eye and then that's it we didn't have to tell it when to stop it didn't

43:57.040 --> 43:59.760
you know sort of make a gigantic eye that took over the whole embryo we've made a

43:59.760 --> 44:04.960
paranormal eye and then it stopped and then so so so so i what that's i guess four things

44:04.960 --> 44:09.920
so the fifth thing is that if you look at the developmental biology textbook it will tell you

44:09.920 --> 44:15.120
that only the anterior norectoderm is competent to make eye right it will tell you that all the

44:15.120 --> 44:20.400
other tissues cannot make eye why does they say that because the pack six master eye gene in frog

44:20.400 --> 44:24.640
anyway only works in front of you know basically in front of the brain the anterior norectoderm

44:25.600 --> 44:30.560
that's wrong many tissues are competent to make eye including gut and tail and all kinds of other

44:30.560 --> 44:35.680
stuff but pack six doesn't do it because pack six is not the top of the hierarchy the top of the

44:35.680 --> 44:39.520
hierarchy is the voltage and the voltage will of course turn on pack six in these other organs

44:39.520 --> 44:43.840
we so we can see it but that's not enough that's not by itself that's not sufficient but but but

44:43.840 --> 44:50.960
what it means is that our our view of the of the competency of these other cells is limited by the

44:50.960 --> 44:55.440
way the way we ask the question how you probe it and that's actually really important not until

44:55.520 --> 45:02.640
fairly recently did it what did i appreciate the irony irony that nowadays we're i'm studying you

45:02.640 --> 45:07.760
know weird unconventional intelligence and telling people that well you can't guess correctly the

45:07.760 --> 45:12.320
intelligence if you don't ask it in the right way but we were already seeing this in 2001 we

45:12.320 --> 45:17.200
were already seeing that really that right that that that's that that's the fact and the other

45:17.200 --> 45:23.360
thing we learned which was also super cool is this imagine that when you inject the RNA into the

45:23.360 --> 45:28.960
embryo you put in a lineage tracer so you can see every cell that gets your RNA becomes blue

45:28.960 --> 45:34.720
with beta gal beta galactosidus so you can tell which cells got your RNA so what we saw was this

45:34.720 --> 45:38.800
was this very interesting thing where if you have a for example a lens sitting in the tail of a

45:38.800 --> 45:43.840
tappel somewhere you take a section through it and you look only half of it is blue so what that

45:43.840 --> 45:50.080
means is that if we don't get if we don't convert enough cells to do this the cells that are making

45:50.160 --> 45:54.880
a lens they will recruit their neighbors they know there's not enough of them to make a good lens

45:54.880 --> 45:59.200
they will recruit a bunch of neighbors that themselves did were not affected by us at all

45:59.200 --> 46:03.840
and say hey you're part of this project now you need to make this lens so there's two levels of

46:03.840 --> 46:07.920
instruction right we instruct the cells hey make a lens right here but i'm not going to tell you how

46:07.920 --> 46:12.560
to do that in fact i'm not even going to affect enough cells and those cells say okay well i'm

46:12.560 --> 46:16.480
going to instruct my neighbors and then we're going to build this thing right so several several

46:16.480 --> 46:21.200
layers of instruction so this was so so that's so that's one story of the eye there's another

46:21.200 --> 46:27.040
eye story which is not bioelectric that story is that Doug Blackiston who was at the time of

46:27.040 --> 46:34.800
postdoc in my group now he's a staff scientist he um he took eye primordia cells so the cells that

46:34.800 --> 46:40.960
are going to later become eye and he stuck them on the back of a tappel they of a frog embryo

46:40.960 --> 46:47.040
they these cells not first of all so here's the amazing things about that first they still make

46:47.040 --> 46:51.040
a great eye even though they're in a completely bizarre environment so instead of being near

46:51.040 --> 46:54.880
the brain they're sitting in the middle of muscle no problem they make they make an eye number two

46:55.440 --> 47:00.000
they have an optic nerve that comes out where does this optic nerve go it doesn't go to the

47:00.000 --> 47:04.960
brain it's it sometimes it goes nowhere sometimes it goes to the spinal cord okay so it synapses

47:04.960 --> 47:09.200
onto the spinal cord number three those animals can see perfectly well out of those eyes because

47:09.200 --> 47:13.600
we tested them this is the craziest part we tested them in this visual learning assay so we

47:13.600 --> 47:20.080
had this like moving blue light and we wanted them to move away from the from the blue light right

47:20.080 --> 47:23.760
and and they do they can see perfectly well if they don't have any other eyes but an eye on

47:23.760 --> 47:28.960
their backs they can see and so and so think about this right this this brain that evolved

47:28.960 --> 47:35.520
for millions of years to expect visual input from specific location now you suddenly you have this

47:35.600 --> 47:40.160
weird patch of itchy tissue on your back that's providing some sort of electrical tingling

47:40.160 --> 47:44.720
up your spinal cord your brain could say oh yeah that's visual data no problem I can work with that

47:44.720 --> 47:49.440
and uh and it's fine right this has this is massive implications for evolution remember at the

47:49.440 --> 47:54.080
beginning I said that that middle layer has competent has intelligence that helps evolution

47:54.080 --> 47:58.560
and think think about this imagine you have a mutation like all like all mutations it has

47:58.560 --> 48:03.680
multiple consequences one mutation is that your eye ends up on your back okay the second the way

48:03.680 --> 48:08.960
but it has other effects that might be good if a right if a creature was hardwired this eye on

48:08.960 --> 48:12.880
your back you wouldn't be able to see your fitness is zero you're dead that's it and so evolution

48:12.880 --> 48:17.760
never experiences the benefits of this other again never explores the benefits of the mutation

48:17.760 --> 48:24.000
whereas here for in this example in other examples if your eye is on the back well I can still see

48:24.000 --> 48:28.320
it's fine so now your fitness is not zero now you get to explore well what else did we what

48:28.320 --> 48:33.760
else do we have that might be good so it turns that competency turns negative mutations which

48:33.760 --> 48:38.320
are most of them right deleterious mutations it turns many of them into neutral mutations because

48:38.320 --> 48:42.480
man we can live with that the the developmental process can can still they can still get their

48:42.480 --> 48:46.880
job done you see this is the the goal directiveness of the eye even though even though its environment

48:46.880 --> 48:51.840
has changed and the genes you know may have changed it it it can still get its job done

48:51.840 --> 48:58.080
and that means that evolution now has a much nicer space to search because because those

48:58.080 --> 49:02.960
competencies help smooth the evolutionary landscape so those are those are our two eye stories

49:03.920 --> 49:10.240
before we get to another experiment I just wanted to kind of reflect and maybe sum up for me for

49:10.240 --> 49:15.920
the listeners for us in this conversation there are many levels to this and we've kind of now

49:15.920 --> 49:23.520
went through in our mind emergent properties that weren't encoded before as you said with the

49:23.520 --> 49:28.080
with the marbles you know coming down and stuff like that this happens in our biology in our

49:28.080 --> 49:34.480
organism and stuff like that and different kind of levels of emergence kind of happen and so right

49:34.480 --> 49:41.440
now it if I understand it correctly right now we can think of these different levels and kind of

49:41.440 --> 49:49.360
choose the level where it's the best for us like where is the best to act on our intention

49:49.360 --> 49:55.520
basically if I if I want to have an eye on the back do I as you said do I you know do the molecule

49:55.520 --> 50:01.840
or things or do I imprint the bioelectric pattern so we found out you found out that okay

50:01.840 --> 50:08.240
that's a better way to imprint the bio bioelectric pattern so right now it's such an interesting

50:08.240 --> 50:20.080
field because there are some I was wondering about a question if if you can basically learn

50:20.080 --> 50:26.320
those goals throughout evolution so in evolution we have this random process that ends up in some

50:26.320 --> 50:33.920
form of organism does it learn to have a goal basically is like it's like some intentionality

50:33.920 --> 50:42.560
or like theological side of things because you've said in interview with chonkerl that the biologist

50:42.560 --> 50:48.160
and biologist like kind of theophobic but there we can see that there are some goal and goal

50:48.160 --> 50:55.360
directedness and it's on many levels not only on the basic level of genes but okay there is this

50:55.360 --> 51:02.800
goal directedness developed on the level that emerged out of you know so that's like so interesting

51:02.800 --> 51:06.960
for me how do you think about that yeah yeah yeah you said many interesting things here um

51:08.160 --> 51:13.520
let's let's uh kind of for a bigger context um the the reason for the teleophobia is that

51:14.560 --> 51:23.280
at the beginning of of science basically there were only two options you you were either uh

51:24.160 --> 51:29.920
very smart like a human or you were very stupid like a rock those were your two options right

51:30.000 --> 51:33.920
there was there was true intelligence and then there was mechanics clocks and you know things

51:33.920 --> 51:39.760
like that when you have those two options and you want to do science of course you know it

51:39.760 --> 51:44.320
forces a binaryization where you start to look at everything as a clock because because no one

51:44.320 --> 51:47.520
knew how to analyze things that were smart like humans so you said fine everything we're going to

51:47.520 --> 51:53.440
pretend everything is a clock and we're going to just find out how the hardware works i i but but

51:53.440 --> 52:00.160
the thing is now now it's time to to realize that since the 40s the 1940s we've had a science of

52:00.160 --> 52:05.200
machines with goals cybernetics control theory okay so it's no longer magic we don't need we there's

52:05.200 --> 52:09.760
nothing theological here there's nothing magical here we don't need any of that what we have now

52:09.760 --> 52:15.280
is a good science that tells us it's a continuum it's not just dumb like rocks and smart like humans

52:15.280 --> 52:20.400
there are uh it's a it's a it's a whole continuum along the way and that means that when you analyze

52:20.400 --> 52:25.280
your system you don't have to pick one or the other you can make engineering claims about

52:25.280 --> 52:30.640
where you think it is and then we will test those theories and either we will find out that oh you

52:30.640 --> 52:35.360
overestimated and it's not really that smart or you underestimated and it's much smarter than you

52:35.360 --> 52:40.560
thought but these are all now uh experimental questions the thing that drives me crazy is that

52:40.560 --> 52:47.200
people will often vocalize their their feelings about oh uh this can't be this and this can't be

52:47.200 --> 52:52.320
that these are not philosophical questions these are these should be empirical questions and so

52:52.960 --> 52:57.360
and so you asked the most um you you you got right on on to the most important thing which is

52:57.360 --> 53:03.440
what is the best level of control because because someone might say and people have said to me is

53:03.440 --> 53:10.880
oh i see uh because you are showing how the bioelectrical decision propagates down to the

53:10.880 --> 53:15.200
gene expression level right so i mean of course it does they say oh well it's just chemistry and

53:15.280 --> 53:18.560
physics i said well what did you think it was going to be of course it's chemistry and physics but

53:18.560 --> 53:24.000
but right underneath everything is chemistry and physics obviously but you are making a very specific

53:24.000 --> 53:30.640
claim if you if you try to manipulate down at the lowest level let's find out let's find out who

53:30.640 --> 53:35.920
has the better control you can try to control 10 000 genes every couple of minutes so but you know

53:35.920 --> 53:41.120
and control it that way or you can go upstream and try to change the the the decision making of the

53:41.120 --> 53:47.680
system okay we've now shown many examples where where the latter is is much much better because

53:47.680 --> 53:53.360
and we already know right we already know that uh when i have the slide that i always show in

53:53.360 --> 53:56.800
talks of what computer programming looked like in the 50s right what do you do you sit there

53:56.800 --> 54:02.720
plugging you know plugging wires back and forth okay that work does does anybody want to program

54:02.720 --> 54:07.120
that way nowadays right for most things i mean it's it's so difficult to program at the hardware

54:07.120 --> 54:13.760
level it's just really hard so neuroscience is kind of on board with these multiple levels because

54:13.760 --> 54:20.720
you know that if you have a problem with maybe it's a molecular problem so maybe somebody's missing

54:20.720 --> 54:26.320
a neurotransmitter fine or maybe it's a it's a sort of behavioral problem so somebody might

54:26.320 --> 54:30.400
need the behavioral modification therapy or something then or maybe it's a psychological

54:30.400 --> 54:36.080
issue or maybe someone has read too much existentialism and now is depressed you know

54:36.080 --> 54:41.360
that's not really a solvable by by neurotransmitter manipulation right that's a that's a that's a

54:41.360 --> 54:46.240
completely different thing so so we kind of know that there are these different levels and and things

54:46.240 --> 54:50.640
are handled at the should be handled at the appropriate level so we've made this so we made

54:50.640 --> 54:58.000
this argument that that a lot of interesting regenerative medicine is only going to be achievable

54:58.000 --> 55:03.360
when we are when we are no longer afraid to deal with the system at higher levels maybe we can

55:03.440 --> 55:09.280
train tissues maybe we can talk about risk assessment by tissues a lot of the things that

55:09.280 --> 55:13.600
are happening you know active inference perceptual control theory a lot of the things that are

55:13.600 --> 55:19.680
happening in neuroscience are directly applicable to to other cells that are not brains and they

55:19.680 --> 55:24.560
require us to understand many levels not just the molecular level maybe not even the bioelectric

55:24.560 --> 55:29.440
level at some point you know we can train right imagine humans have been training animals for

55:29.440 --> 55:33.920
thousands of years knowing zero neuroscience right you don't need to know what's what's inside

55:33.920 --> 55:38.240
the brain as long as you understand that hey the system can learn and i know what the currency of

55:38.240 --> 55:42.240
motivation is meaning rewards and punishments then that's it it doesn't matter what's really in there

55:42.240 --> 55:46.000
so so maybe at some point for some things we can even go beyond and say i don't know what the

55:46.000 --> 55:50.800
correct bio electrical state is but i'm going to train the cells for a specific outcome can you

55:50.800 --> 55:56.320
train a genetic genetic pathway or something like that because i think you've talked about that a

55:56.320 --> 56:01.600
little bit yeah yeah and we're not we're not the first lab to show that Richard Watson's group

56:01.600 --> 56:07.680
and a couple of others shown something similar this is this is a good example of my point that you

56:07.680 --> 56:12.400
can't just have feelings about these things you have to do experiments so for example if i show

56:12.400 --> 56:16.880
you a gene regulatory network right you know so it's a bunch of transcription it's a bunch of

56:16.880 --> 56:20.960
genes and they all transcriptionally regulate each other up or down you look at this thing and you

56:20.960 --> 56:27.760
say wow this is the paradigm of genetic determinism there's no magic here there's no indeterminism

56:27.760 --> 56:32.880
here uh it's i can see exactly how this works it's just it's just it's just physics right it's just a

56:32.880 --> 56:40.880
piece of physics okay but nevertheless the question might become well what cognitive level does it have

56:40.880 --> 56:45.920
if you if you assume from the beginning that it has zero meaning that the only way i can control

56:45.920 --> 56:52.160
this is i can change the trans the promoters so that the i can delete nodes i can add nodes physical

56:52.160 --> 56:58.480
rewiring you can do certain things so we and others as i say have done something like this we took the

56:58.480 --> 57:03.600
made the assumption that actually let's find out right let's find out and so we took this the with

57:03.600 --> 57:08.080
this the models of these of gene regulatory networks and we pretended they were neural

57:08.080 --> 57:12.480
networks and we tried to train them what that means is that you pick some nodes you pick one

57:12.560 --> 57:17.360
gene as your condition stimulus one gene as your unconditioned stimulus one other gene as a

57:17.360 --> 57:22.720
as a response and you simply ask does the history of tweaking meaning up or down regulating these

57:22.720 --> 57:27.520
inputs change the way it reacts to those inputs later on i mean that's learning right that's the

57:27.520 --> 57:32.560
we found so in our work i'll just talk about they'll talk about ours um and this is uh sarama

57:32.560 --> 57:37.680
biz was was the postdoc who did this uh she found six different types of memory including

57:37.680 --> 57:43.680
pavlovian conditioning so like uh you know pavlov's dog right with the so so so she found that

57:43.680 --> 57:50.720
biological networks can have many types of memory like this control random networks right so you just

57:50.720 --> 57:55.760
just you know designed random networks they don't tend to have this property which suggests that

57:55.760 --> 58:00.320
evolution actually likes this for whatever reason evolution actually favors uh this property of

58:00.320 --> 58:06.800
being able to being able to learn and it has it has amazing implications for uh for biomedicine

58:06.800 --> 58:11.600
because it means imagine right imagine the thing about the pavlovian conditioning imagine you have

58:11.600 --> 58:17.600
a drug that is very powerful it works very well in the petri dish but you can't use it in humans

58:17.600 --> 58:25.920
it's too strong so now if your disease circuit has this associative learning property it means that

58:25.920 --> 58:31.280
maybe you can give that drug together with a completely neutral drug which we call we call

58:31.280 --> 58:36.320
that in the in the in the review we call that a um a molecular placebo you take another drug that

58:36.320 --> 58:41.520
doesn't do anything and you pair them together and you just give them together if the system learns

58:41.520 --> 58:46.480
to associate them then maybe after a few presentations now you can just use the the neutral one and you

58:46.480 --> 58:50.160
don't need the you know you don't need the really strong one right so and then maybe at some point

58:50.160 --> 58:53.680
it will give up the way the dog you know if you keep ringing the bell the dog will give up eventually

58:53.680 --> 58:57.760
eventually so maybe then you have to retrain you know I don't know but but but you get the idea so

58:57.760 --> 59:02.880
so so this this is this is just a good example that you can't assume about these things you have to

59:02.880 --> 59:07.520
you have to make hypotheses about cognitive level and then you have to test them I really like this

59:07.520 --> 59:13.200
concept of both ways of control that the first way is bottom up it's from genes that there emerges

59:13.200 --> 59:19.920
proteins and our other emergent structures and the other way around is from top down that these

59:19.920 --> 59:26.000
electrical patterns can influence the genetical level and I would like to ask you like from your

59:26.000 --> 59:32.880
experiment with the eye is it possible to get this eye passed to another generation that it's

59:32.880 --> 59:41.120
like incorporated in the genome uh yeah uh we don't have any evidence that this feeds back into

59:41.120 --> 59:44.960
the genome so it's fine now we haven't done the experiment but but I don't have any reason to

59:44.960 --> 59:51.520
believe that the next generation of frogs would have this eye however um in the case of the planarian

59:51.520 --> 59:57.360
it's a little more subtle because planaria normally reproduced by tearing themselves in half

59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.120
and then regenerating and now you have two worms when that happens a two-headed planaria does give

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.040
rise to another two-headed planarian so it's not the same as sperm and egg reproduction it's not

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.320
classic uh lomarchism because you're not uh changing the hereditary material

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.880
but let's be careful you're not changing the DNA but DNA is not the only hereditary material and in

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.720
planaria the bioelectric circuit is also a hereditary material in fact there's others so so with

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.320
Chris Fields we wrote a something that show that talked about the fact that when you look at you

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.760
you know look at you look at any organism and look at the history all of its parents what molecules

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.520
are directly conserved through that whole lineage well certainly the DNA that's the whole point right

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.400
that the genome is passed on but there's two other things that are passed on one is the cytoskeleton

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.440
every cell's cytoskeleton is directly templated off of the previous cytoskeleton right and it's

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.640
also the cell membrane because the cell membrane also is so so and and also there are bioelectric

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.200
circuits who knows what else right there may be nine other you know media that are that we just don't

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.240
know about yet I don't know but but but at least in planaria you can take advantage of this additional

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:14.880
hereditary medium that's not genetic do do vertebrates have that I don't know there's some

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:22.000
nice work from Oded Rachavi in C. elegans where he studies transgenerational inheritance and so

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.040
there certainly are mechanisms for passing things back into the genome whether the bioelectrics does

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:34.160
this or not I I don't know we were talking about different levels of emergence basically but and

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:41.680
also the phenomenal work of six types of learning of these genetic networks basically and pathways

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:48.320
and stuff like that so I wanted to explore a bit more of these you know higher levels of

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.800
maybe cognition and get to minds because that's also another emergent level and we can think of

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:02.080
okay so right now I could tweak your brain and you would get in very very complicated way

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.320
the same information maybe as I'm speaking to right now but it's much more simple for

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:17.120
simpler for me to speak these words and move in this level of cognition basically and I was wondering

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:26.960
you know this gets us to there are many many weird kind of ideas how to get into with your

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.880
intention how it affects your body basically and it's also possible as well we've talked about it but

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:40.240
this is so interesting because right now we can kind of test it test it scientifically and test

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:49.200
how how could placebo work and what how strong the intention of this level where we kind of move

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.960
together how strong it is and how it actually affects the body and and the whole organism and

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.040
it does right because like you have these like you can think about something I don't know stressful

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.040
and suddenly you know your your body is secreting stress hormones and wow it affects things

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.760
affects the cells and the cells are connected and it affects the whole organism so how do you think

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:19.200
about our intention let's say power of our intention and how it affects the body and and yeah well a

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.800
couple things first you know if I were to tell you that you can voluntarily change the voltage

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.200
potential of cells in your body 30% of the cells in your body you could voluntarily change the

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.200
voltage potential you might say wow that you're crazy how am I going to change voltage potential

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.920
in my cells but in what but when you're lying down in the morning and you decide to stand up

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.080
guess what you're doing right you're changing the bioelectric state of your muscles so so we already

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.720
know that your intention can absolutely change the electrical state of your cells and and of

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.360
course the chemical and many others as you point out so so lots of people study the the

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.200
interface the immune the immune system interface to to the body many many other things people have

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.960
found effects on on stem cells from from meditation and certain kinds of practices so of course the

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:12.080
the link the link is is is strong um the thing that the thing that I would say is that I I

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.240
because because of this continuum right the fact that we were all one cell at one point in your

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.000
life you were one cell nine months and some years later you can say I am you know people

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.720
you get up a human who will say things like I am not a machine I am more than physics well

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.760
you used to be a you used to be a quiescent oocyte is what you used to be and and slowly

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.800
with right and the key the key is developmental biology does not offer any particular point

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.040
where some kind of lightning flash comes in ah now you have a mind before that you were just

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.600
chemistry right okay that doesn't happen so so so this thing is completely slow very you know

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:54.240
sort of step by step gradual so for me this means that if if I like to think backwards a lot of

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.720
people say paramecium has a mind come on single cells don't have mine I like to work it backwards

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.880
if we can agree that we have minds then you owe a story about where they came from and that story

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.240
cannot be well on day 59 you know this happened there's that's that's ridiculous and so so then

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:17.840
the story has to go all the way back and so once you have that you can you can say that I think

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.760
I think we can conclude a couple of things one is that minds change obviously the mind of a cell

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.600
is not the mind that we have now and there are many things in between and there are many alien

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.440
kinds of minds that we make with AI and with various other things and who knows what in the

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:40.080
universe who knows what else is out there they change that's a and b we are I think we are

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.160
very bad at recognizing unconventional intelligence I'll just give you a simple example we are born

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:53.760
with our sense organs looking out into the three-dimensional world where medium size objects

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.040
move around at medium speeds and that is our training set for look for for a for a recognizing

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.840
intelligence so when you see your cat or your neighbor or a bird or something else doing

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.840
something interesting you say oh look at this that's that's intelligence I see that that you know I

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.040
hid the you know I hid the reward from here to there and he still figured out how to get it or

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.560
you know you made the little you know the crows make the little tools to open the locks and do

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:22.320
all this stuff I recognize that as intelligence imagine if you were born with a an internal sense

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.360
of your body chemistry so a multi-dimensional sense of all the different chemicals in your blood

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.960
and you knew exactly what your liver and your pancreas were doing every moment of the day to

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:39.280
to adjust all of that stuff in that case you would understand that there is such a thing as

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.480
physiological space you would understand what intelligence looks like in physiological space

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.920
you would say oh my liver is really intelligent because it's able to do all these amazing things

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:56.240
despite different perturbations you would recognize that implants right like like smart

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.960
insulin pumps and pacemakers and things like that are robots that work in physiological space

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:08.640
right now when I say robot you imagine you know the the the Mars rover that drives around in the

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.840
or a self-driving car yeah that's great that's a robot in three-dimensional space we have robots in

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.640
physiological space right your your insulin pump that measures a bunch of stuff and gives you little

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.920
puffs of of insulin at just the right time it's navigating physiological space right but we don't

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.360
think about it that way right because because we are just you know sort of blind to all that stuff

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.720
because of our training set so I think I think that we need to understand that minds are incredibly

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.680
diverse minds come with all kinds of different bodies that we're not used to and and many more

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.400
will come I mean in your lifetime you're going to see creatures that just you know are completely

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:51.920
alien to us and synthetic and chimeric and cyborg and all that and and mind solve problems in in

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.400
novel spaces it's not all about movement and it's not all about three-dimensional space there are

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.680
there's intelligences all around us that are very hard to to see this brings a lot of ethical

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.800
questions about how we are moving through through the world what's what's your point what's your view

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:15.200
at the concept of the self identity because we are talking about intelligence at many layers

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:22.640
so what's your point on identity uh yeah there many things can be said it's a complex area of

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:30.800
course um I I one one thing that I have done is to try to come up with a framework where highly

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:37.760
diverse intelligences could all be um compared and recognized on the same in the same space so so

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.840
what I wanted to do and this was um this was a challenge put to us a few years ago at a meeting

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.320
in them of the Templeton Foundation they had asked us to come up with a framework to be able

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.640
to compare directly all kinds of unconventional intelligences you know and so and so some people

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.760
think you know octopus uh you know something or insects or something like that I want to go really

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.600
broad I want to be able to think about uh swarms I want to think about alien life forms I want to

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.640
think about AI I want to think about synthetic and chimeric intelligences other spaces like

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.160
really broad and so so what is a self right what what is how do you uh how how can you compare

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.640
all these different different things I think that uh cybernetics got it right with a focus on goals

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.040
so so so here's here's what I think a self is I think a self is a collection of parts that

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.800
are able to work together towards system level goals the goals that belong to that that collection

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.080
not to the individual pieces now one thing we can do is we can map out the size of your goals

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:41.440
so we can add in whatever whatever whatever those goals might be how about the size of them so if

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.680
you are so let's let's think of some examples if you tell me that my biggest goal the biggest thing

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.320
I can work and remember what a goal is a goal is some state that you can exert energy to reach

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.520
that state that's a goal so if you tell me that the biggest goal you can possibly think about

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.240
is the local sucrose concentration then I'm going to guess you're a bacterium of some sort and that

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:11.600
is your level okay if you tell me that uh you can have goals that reach forward a few hours and in

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:18.320
terms of space you can handle things that go on a few you know a few hundred feet in diameter

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.400
but that's about it I'm going to say well maybe maybe you're about the level of a dog meaning

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.640
that your dog has certainly some memory going backwards certainly some predictive capacity

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.960
going forwards it understands some amount of space but you can never get your your goal your dog to

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.720
work towards a goal that's three months from now in the next city over impossible right they just

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.600
can't handle that size of that's now now why do I say this right somebody if somebody somebody

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.600
could prove me wrong and then train their dog to you know to work towards things that are months

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.360
away I mean that's probably you know that's great then I'll change my example but but you understand

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.600
these are empirical claims there are minds that okay that have those kind of limitations then you

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:05.840
might tell me that well I have I have a goal that has to do with the the financial markets of the

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.960
next hundred years or you might tell me that while I'm really I'm really sad that the sun is going to

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.600
burn out you know billions of years from now okay then I'm going to say you're at least a human

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.680
because because your goal your goal and so I call this the cognitive light cone it's sort of the

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.040
boundary it's the size of the kinds of things you can have as goals not not not the distance you

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.200
can sense right because for example the tell it you know the James Webb telescope has a massive

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.400
distance of sensing that's not the point the point isn't about sensing the point is about

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:39.760
goal directedness so so you could be a human but then you might say to me you know uh I I I really

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:47.600
I I really I feel um I feel a certain way when something happens to to a thousand people

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.760
and when the same thing happens to a million people I'm not able to be a thousand times more

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.320
more upset I've just not I don't have that linear range I just can't do it and then we can start to

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.320
think about okay humans are probably not the top of the food chain at some point there will be a

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.160
massive intelligence that can literally in the linear range care about an enormous amount of

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.240
stuff that we can't even wrap our heads around right in terms of being a goal right so for somebody

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.840
like now now now there are of course traditions that talk about this right there are traditions

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.760
that talk about you know some sort of Buddha nature that where some where where something is

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.800
evolved to the point where they can literally care about all the sentient this sentient creatures

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.240
on on earth right maybe that's possible I have no idea if it's possible but you can think about

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:32.160
you know that humans are not the top of this this food chain so so for me in terms of um what a

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:39.920
self is a self is a temporary uh a temporary bundle of activities that works towards specific goals

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.120
so selves have goals they have preferences they have some

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.080
degree of competency in navigating various spaces maybe very high maybe low so so those are those

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.680
are selves and and of course selves are nested so in our body so we are a self we have many

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.480
selves inside of us most of which are nonverbal right not all of them but but most of them are

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.560
nonverbal and we are also part of probably larger selves that are you know social structures or who

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.240
knows what who knows what what's about us um and so yeah that anyway that's that's that's my talk on

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:21.840
the selves that's uh yeah that's um so interesting are you familiar with uh philosopher and Henry

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:31.040
Bergson uh he's yeah so his idea basically of of levels of consciousness was to do something with

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:37.040
indeterminism and it's so interesting and now you know you have uh you you just said okay my goal

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:44.320
is to get this so close okay it's probably a bacterium but you can create a space between the stimuli

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.440
or the goal and the many ways that can achieve that goal and that's basically the inter inter

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.600
indeterminism and that's basically the level of the self and maybe level of consciousness that

01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.200
contains that self as well and i was just interested in the scaling of the goals i was

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:08.400
thinking one day okay what does how am i like how are humans motivated maybe a different

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.160
perspective on that and i was thinking okay so let's stretch out those homo static goals that we

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.840
have you know and the goals of you know the evolution has and if you stretch them out you you you can

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.120
maybe like okay why am i sitting in this room right now why was this building built and stuff

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:32.320
like that and this is basically this just stretched out basic homo static loop of my organism or of

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:39.120
you know this swarm of humans to get to a certain temperature and this is for me is so interesting

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.360
like scaling of goals and right now we are you know in the times of internet and we are connecting

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:53.680
right here right now and it's just um we think maybe this sci-fi that we're gonna get connected and

01:14:53.680 --> 01:15:00.240
have you know or connected there there is going to be some higher level intelligence or self or

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.840
something like that but i think that as you've said we don't have insight into different level of

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.880
minds or different you know different minds all together so maybe there is already something

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.000
like that you know this like kind of this kind of hive mind but you know not really this like

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:25.280
like woo perspective but more like realistic perspective what's happening right now it's it

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:31.520
feels like it's actually here already a little bit so yeah there was just some thoughts on that

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:38.160
yeah i i think i know i think that's very important because we we're we're very bad at

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:45.200
recognizing ourselves at lower levels we're even worse at recognizing them at higher levels

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.520
we don't have really any tools so so so one can ask this question if if you were part of a larger

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.680
mind could you tell first of all could you tell could you gather evidence that you were part of

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:02.240
a larger cognitive system and b could you if if you could could you gain some understanding of

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.480
what the goals of that system were right which is very important because as humans if we're building

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.200
some kind of massive uh political economic structure whatever uh what are the goals of

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.440
that structure right well we this happens all the time we do internet of things we do swarm

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.720
robotics and then you say can okay we have any idea what this thing's gonna want to do when when

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.920
well you know when it when it boots up right so so the thing is that i have a feeling and i don't

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:31.520
know this for a fact but my feeling is that probably with some version of girdle's theorem

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:38.640
tells you that you are never going to really understand what the higher level is doing

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.720
very much like you know when you go to work and you you know you step or don't step on

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.520
some ant on your way to a meeting the ant has absolutely no no capacity to understand the

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.840
context of what it just participated in you know why this is happening right so so it's

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.920
entirely possible that we are the same right and if and people have said that to you know

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.520
why the universe works in mysterious you know ways the bigger patterns right um but maybe it's

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.800
possible and i don't know but but maybe it's possible with some kind of math or you know causal

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:13.520
information theory or something to start to gain evidence or or against the idea that we are part

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.320
of something larger and just to give you an example i spent a lot of time in the last few months

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.680
thinking about what it would be like to be a neuron or a subset of neurons inside a large

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.480
neural network that's being trained and you could imagine two ways imagine this conversation between

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:36.160
like two two neighboring subnets one says oh look uh we live in a cold mechanical universe

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:43.040
doesn't care what we do uh i can learn you know i can learn about things and uh and we live in a

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.280
we are an insignificant spec in this in this giant universe that doesn't care about anything

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.600
there are no larger minds we are the only thing you recognize like this is you recognize this this

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.240
the story this is the this is the standard scientific story of today right we live in this

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.680
you know um mechanical cosmos that doesn't care what we have the other the other the neighbor says

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.920
you know i'm not so sure i i've been i've been tracking things here and i can tell you that

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.640
every time i do certain things life is good but when i do other things this this this massive

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.920
wave of punishment right this back propagation wave comes and smacks me and and forcibly changes

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.960
my voltage and does all this other stuff and i'm starting to think that the universe but at my

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.160
you that our universe actually does care what we do and in particular for some reason right you

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.240
know this have you seen um google deep dream have you seen these things it's like it makes it makes

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:39.200
it and then all these pictures have dogs in them because they're always running around well and so

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.960
i can imagine right so this is total fantasy of course but you get you get you get the idea

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.720
i can imagine that this one says look i i don't know i i cannot comprehend the the the thought of

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:55.360
our universe but i think it likes dogs because every because because every time i find an i like

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.920
every time i output this dog i life is good and otherwise i get you know corrected or something

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:06.320
like this right and and so you could easily imagine right the in in that universe the the

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.720
the one that thinks that it lives in a mindless world is wrong it's it's factually wrong the

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.040
quite right the question so now the question is for us the question is what is the right

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.120
view i mean there are certainly people who feel that there are patterns to life and that they

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.480
can know i mean i who knows right i don't nobody knows but but but i don't think it's crazy to

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:32.240
ask the following question this this is the distinction that i think is really important

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.240
are you learning or are you being trained what's the difference the difference is

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:42.320
in both in in both cases right in both cases you are engaging in something that is designed

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.360
to change your own mind when you are learning you pick up a book and learn stuff with the with

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.440
the inherent purpose of changing your own psychology and and by the way we are complex enough

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.920
that we are even subject to this idea of the thought that breaks the thinker right you can

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.200
imagine that if you're like really a kind of a deep thinker you might come across a piece of

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.720
literature or something that just screws you up completely and spirals you into some sort of

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.640
depression and whatever right but but we are we we know that we can learn and we can change our

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:14.160
mind but when we do that we assume that we are the only agent in that interaction so there's me

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.480
the agent and then there's the outside world and the outside world has zero agency and i'm the boss

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:25.280
i do what i want i can learn or i can not learn whatever the or i am provided with inputs and i

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.840
am changed the way that i would look but i don't know that the outside world has zero agency you

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.920
know that's that's an assumption we don't actually know that and under certain circumstances you

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.440
would be wrong to assume that if you're a neuron in a neural network you'd be wrong to assume that

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.000
so i don't know i'm not claiming i'm making no claims whatsoever about anything like that but

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.240
i'm just saying that i think i don't think it's a crazy question at all to try to develop some

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:52.160
sort of mathematical formalism to try to gain evidence for being part of a larger system even

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.240
knowing that you will never understand the whole goal you don't know what space it works in

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:03.360
but maybe you can see your option space being deformed in some way that is that is consistent

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:13.760
with with a not a zero agency on the other end so you just put a framework to a lot of you know

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:21.920
kind of these i don't know it feels like you are part of the universe you are not separated

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:30.320
from it and there is something maybe something maybe mysterious and you you know you have

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:37.600
subjective experience and whenever someone asks me if i believe in something you know i usually

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.880
say i believe literally i believe in something i can't really i believe there is like something

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:47.440
else that i can actually perceive because i know i can perceive only you know just these little

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:55.280
things and i think this is such a nice logical logical framework to ask ourselves whatever this

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:05.360
mysterious thing might be and only you know only the thoughts that you put out there is so important

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:12.240
because many many people are on in in one camp on one extreme and they say ah definitely there's

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.600
i don't know from panpsychism from eastern philosophical perspective you know we are this one

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:23.280
hive mind one consciousness consciousness and or like transmit we are you know transmitters

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.160
or something like that and now you are putting frame to it and kind of asking real question

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.440
and asking real possibility of kind of you know testing it maybe mathematically some

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:38.240
sometime in the future or something and you are kind of okay so you're not on this extreme

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:44.560
not on this other extreme but you are in the middle and it feels like you are trying to not

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:51.040
to have an agency in in this or or something because yes that's the how it's supposed to be

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.360
done and not wish something is like that or like that because that's like actually going to affect

01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.280
the the stuff that you do and that you are going to you know explore and stuff or discover so this

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.840
for me is really interesting way to putting to to put these things together and and think about it

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.600
and kind of the extreme the the extremize the world that we live in because there is a lot of

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:20.880
extremes and when we can have even as you know scientists and and researchers and everyone

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:29.920
when they can have this kind of um uh you know uh talk or something i or discussion i think it's so

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.440
important because otherwise we can't you know we can't move forward so i really am great grateful

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.200
for what you do and that you put the job that you are putting these frameworks out here out there

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:47.200
so yeah thank you for that well thank you yeah thank you i i do think it's important to two things

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:54.320
one is to as treat as many things as possible as empirical questions right once you say i believe

01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:00.080
whatever it uh it it closes off the ability to test it first of all so we should always be working

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.280
to come up with some some way of making this practical and testable and that's a and b we

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:12.080
should realize that whatever your framework is it can it limits and enables different next steps

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.680
so it constrains you know if you if you never if you can never believe philosophically that

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:22.880
gene regulatory networks could have non-zero agency you will never do the experiment that we did

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:31.360
right planar you know planaria have been um uh have been studied since uh 1903 i believe uh right

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.200
you know and and two-headed animals have been produced right at the beginning of the last century

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:40.240
no one ever thought to cut to recut them to my knowledge no one ever recut them why because it

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.320
was perfectly obvious that that well genetically they're unchanged and when you cut off that second

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.840
head well of course they're going to go back to normal what else could it be and so so there are

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.800
so many experiments like this that we've done because uh each lens has things that it enables

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.760
and other things that it does not let you do and and as much of this as possible and the and the

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:04.880
biggest one of all is look there's a as scientists there's one thing that we all take on faith the

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.360
all science begins with an act of faith which is basically this idea that the world is understandable

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.920
right that there's a pattern behind it and then what we are doing is discovering a pattern nobody

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.920
no scientist can go to work saying i'm going to find a bunch of stuff today but tomorrow it'll

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.760
probably all be different that's great and like nobody believes that but you wouldn't do you couldn't

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.440
do science if you were some kind of you know if if hum was right and we were living in a

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.280
random uh you know just collection of randomness that has pockets of of of just by accident things

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.200
look like they make sense kind kind of in pockets if you had that view you would never be able to

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.200
do science science is predicated on on a complete leap of faith that has no no empirical justification

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.320
that that behind all of this stuff there is some kind of truth that we are getting to so so i think

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:50.400
you know i think we need to be honest with ourselves that that we all start in this in this field

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.440
anyway we all start with a bit of faith and then and then you move as much as you can to experiment

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:05.600
thank you for that michael what is your focus right now oh boy uh that's that's well uh and i

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.400
apologize i have about a minute and then then i have to run but uh you know we do a lot of things

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.520
in our lab i would say the focus of the whole group is to understand different kinds of minds

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:21.040
in various embodiments but that means regenerative medicine it means uh applications and birth

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.560
effects it means uh what cancer we do some uh synthetic biology synthetic morphology to make

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:31.280
artificial new proto organisms we do some artificial intelligence we do a lot of different

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:38.240
things all of them are around this this kind of question yeah uh michael i i'm so grateful for

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.600
your time thank you so much i think there is like questions of consciousness and regenerate

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:49.600
regeneration of limbs and stuff like that uh where do people find you uh you know leave us

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.200
some links or i think you're part of some company as well that is trying to research i think

01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.120
regenerating limbs as well so could you could you link that everything is going to be in the

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.360
description and michael thank you so much for your time thank you so much i appreciate the

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.160
conversation i will i will email you a bunch of links yeah there's a couple of spinoff companies

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.320
all our stuff is on my website that you can see all that so yeah thank you so much and i'm happy

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.200
to talk to you guys anytime we can always do it again cool nice thank you very much bye have a

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:31.040
nice day bye
