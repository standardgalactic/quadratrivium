Checking Brain We Are Podcast/The Fascinating World of Biology with Michael Levin #5.txt
 Michael Levin, a professor from Tufts University, was discussing the importance of approaching scientific questions empirically and the role of faith in science as a starting point. He emphasized that all scientists begin with an assumption that the world is understandable, which allows them to conduct experiments and research. His lab focuses on understanding different kinds of minds across various embodiments, including regenerative medicine, developmental biology, and the effects of birth order. They also work on synthetic biology, synthetic morphology to create artificial proto-organisms, artificial intelligence, and explore questions related to consciousness and the regeneration of limbs.

Michael mentioned that more information about his work and the companies he is involved with can be found on his website, which will be provided in the video description. He was grateful for the opportunity to discuss these topics and expressed a willingness to engage in further conversations. The conversation touched upon the interplay between belief and empirical evidence in scientific research and the importance of being open to various next steps that different frameworks can enable or constrain.
