00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Welcome to BrainVR podcast. We are sitting here with Professor Michael Levin, a distinguished

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,120
professor in the biology department at Tufts and Serfs as a director of the Allen Discovery Center

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,320
at Tufts as well and the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,280
Your group focuses on understanding the biophysics, biophysical mechanism that implement decision

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,840
making during complex pattern regulation and harnessing the endogenous bioelectric dynamics

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,720
towards rational control of growth and form. And you also did your postdoctoral training

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,080
at Harvard Medical School where you began to uncover a new bioelectrical language by which

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:00,240
cells coordinate their activity during embryogenesis. And you also had independent laboratory

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,160
at Forsythe Institute and now you are at Tufts University and you are developing a new molecular

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,320
genetic and conceptual tools to probe large-scale information processing in regeneration,

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,520
embryogenesis and cancer suppression. Does that sound right? Did I miss something which is

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,200
important or is that okay? Oh yeah, it sounds right. I also have an appointment at the VISA

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,280
Institute at Harvard but other than that I think we got everything. All right, cool. So we do our

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,760
interviews maybe a little bit differently because we are really interested in people that we talk

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,280
to so we love your work, we love what you do and what you've discovered. It's just so fascinating

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,880
but we would like to kind of dig a little bit into your kind of a story. Like what were the

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,440
you know the moments that decided, the most important moments in your life that decided

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,440
the path that you're gonna take, the path that got you right where you are right now,

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,320
studying what you studied because I think you were also doing before some computational,

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,600
basically like helping science with computational stuff and stuff like that. So could you maybe

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,200
you know add a little bit of a story behind what you do and behind your path? Sure, yeah. Well I

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,440
suppose we could go to the kind of to the beginning when I was a little kid and I was born in Moscow

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Russia so I lived there when I was little and I had asthma and what happens with asthma of course

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,080
is that your airway closes up and so you get nervous which makes your airway close up more

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,960
which makes you more nervous and so it's this kind of like feedback loop. So at the time we didn't

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,720
have access to really medication right proper medication for asthma and so as a solution what

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
my father used to do is you would take the um this TV set which was this giant like wooden thing

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,240
with a tiny little screen in the front right I don't know if you can even imagine such a such a

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,080
thing but um but you know and inside of so he would turn it around and he would take off the back

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
yeah take off the back panel and you could see all the vacuum tubes it had these glowing you know

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
vacuum tubes and all the electronics and all the parts and and and the you know the goal was to

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,880
was to of course distract it right so to distract me so that I would forget about the you know the

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,760
breathing and so on and so so that worked but you know kind of amazing that that was for me that

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
was really a very formative moment because I remember staring at this stuff and thinking

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,040
it's kind of incredible that somebody knew how to put all that stuff in exactly the right way to

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
make the cartoons you know come out the front of the of the set right so somebody is who clearly

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
it wasn't random clearly somebody knew how to do it uh apparently you can teach people to do it

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,160
because you know I said well where does this come from right so in the factory they they sort of do

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,200
it okay so so that was amazing and and I right from the beginning I kind of decided that okay

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
that's that's what I want to be I want to be the guy that knows how to put these things together to

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,760
make a particular thing come up so so for years after that I was interested in in in engineering

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,760
and and and technology and and things like this but uh at the you know when I when I got a little

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,520
bit older I had a I had a friend who uh was really into bugs and insects uh and so we would go

44
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
outside and we would he was a little bit older but we would go and play and he would show me all

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,880
the different you know caterpillars and beetles and all the stuff and I remember thinking that

46
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,320
well this is very interesting because clearly they are made of parts too they're different parts

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
than what the tv is made of and they do way more stuff and they appear they're pretty different

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
they they have preferences and they you know they have behaviors and it's clear they like some

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
things and don't like some things and so on and I said well how does that work and and where

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
do those parts come from and who put those parts together right so so it's a really kind of a

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
you know it's kind of a constant and I spend a lot of time and and and you know what's inside

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,240
of us like we probably have parts too and um and uh things like that and so when I was uh

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
when I went to college well prior to that I was uh when when computers first first showed up and

54
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,400
this was like uh when we came to america in 78 so early 80s you know the computer started to show

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,040
up I got I was able to I was able to get access to some very simple you know simple computer

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,000
stuff and so I was really interested in programming and and really AI right the idea that that could

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,840
we could we develop could we develop new minds that we built ourselves right and so so I went to

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,440
I went to college for for I majored in computer science was interested in artificial intelligence

59
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,440
and things like that but basically I'm kind of pretty soon it became really clear that

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
we would have that that it wasn't going to be good enough just to try to do computer science and

61
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,480
and to do on its own because because we really didn't know what we were doing it was really

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
very unclear where our minds come from except that in biology you see this every day so

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
we all start life as a single cell you start life as an egg cell and then eventually this

64
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,920
little piece of chemistry and physics becomes a mind and some bastion right during development

65
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,320
so so so that was it I thought I thought okay I have to I have to also do developmental biology

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,760
and so so I gotta um right around the same time I got a second uh bachelor's degree in in in biology

67
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,000
and that's you know that's kind of and then I went to grad school and so that that's kind of my

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,280
my story well uh yeah this is how minds emerge from chemistry and physics and even just the whole

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,600
organism how does it even happen like it's just one of the most fascinating questions that as humans

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,280
we can have I think so um I just I would like to go into this basically into this process

71
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,920
and go maybe step by step into how our minds maybe let's go there maybe how our minds emerge from

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,120
physics and and chemistry but we have to start at the level maybe of genes at the of the single

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,720
cells of the developmental biology that you that you do so could you kind of explain to us and our

74
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,120
listeners how does it even happen that we have some information maybe you know genetic information

75
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,760
how does it happen that from genes there comes this whole thing that's us that's any organism

76
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:17,040
basically and maybe we have some you know ideas that you know they're encoded I don't know like

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,360
plants basically for our limbs and where the head is should be and stuff like that but maybe there's

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,320
a little bit different story there because uh that's fairly simplistic I think and we are

79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,000
both biologists as well so we know it's like this kind of weird you know mechanism that's not really

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,520
easily graspable but I think you have some really nice metaphors and uh and you explain it in a

81
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,880
really nice way so could you maybe uh explain to us how how does that even how does it even

82
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,000
happen how is that possible sure um I'll give you my thoughts on it obviously this is very much an

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,160
open you know an open area of investigation and and I should point out that uh my view on it is

84
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
probably let's say not not in every way the mainstream view so I'm going to tell you what I

85
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,640
think and then you can get the kind of different perspectives from from from others and it's a

86
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,640
pretty different perspective than you would get from a standard let's say developmental biology

87
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,200
course or something like that um the first thing the first thing I would point out is that in placing

88
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,840
the emphasis on genes is already quite a commitment and we need to back up be firm in it because

89
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,680
especially now I mean it was always problematic but especially now we can read genomes right and we

90
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,040
know what's in the genome and when you read the genome of course you don't see anything like what is

91
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,400
your symmetry type how what's the size of this organism how many eyes it has does it have eyes

92
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,800
how many limbs you don't see any of that in in the genome um what you see is uh you see protein

93
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,160
sequences and so so what's in the genome is the is the description of the micro level hardware

94
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,960
that every cell is going to have so genomes are very much a description of the hardware now we've

95
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,080
known for uh for decades now that uh certain kinds of devices and I'm going to argue that

96
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,520
biology is exactly for for many reasons is exactly such a such a device uh yes there's a

97
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,520
hardware layer and you can can manipulate it or try to understand it at the hardware level

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,960
layer but there's a much much um more interesting and possibly a more important

99
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,120
software layer to go along with it and we know this right away you know right away that uh we

100
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,160
have something something missing here today because despite all of the amazing progress in

101
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,960
molecular biology and genetics and all of these things they're very basic questions like for

102
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,840
example in my lab we make something called a frog a lotel what's a frog a lotel well it's a

103
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:45,200
half a frog embryo cells half axolotl cells okay now uh baby axolotls have legs frog larvae or

104
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,240
tadpoles don't have legs so if I make a frog a lotel and I say to you um well here's your here's a

105
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,280
frog genome okay here's a zenithus genome here's a axolotl genome so you have both genomes now I

106
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,280
want you to tell me are frog a lotel is going to have legs or not and now we have a big problem

107
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,440
we have no idea of frog a lotels ahead of time are going to have legs we don't have any way of

108
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,200
making that making that prediction because what what is what because the outcome here

109
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,880
is uh the process of uh of decision making by cells that are going to determine some kind of

110
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,480
morphology and we get so used to we get so comfortable with with reliable development

111
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,520
the idea that okay frog eggs make frogs and acorns make oak trees that we think well of

112
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,400
course that's how it has to be but actually uh there's an i'm sure we'll talk about it today

113
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,000
there's incredible plasticity in that process so something really important is the idea that

114
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,600
the genome encodes for the hardware of the cells right selection meaning meaning that part of

115
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,040
evolution that selects for specific traits that acts on the phenotype that acts on the final

116
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,760
outcome so on the anatomy and on the behavior but the genome but the mapping between the

117
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,880
genotype and the phenotype is really complicated it's not directly straightforward right except

118
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
for very you know there's this pair of enzymes and some things like that that are directly sort of

119
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,160
encoded by by the genes but mostly it's not like that and that internal process that software that

120
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,800
developmental physiology that's actually the software that runs the whole thing is to my mind

121
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
one of the most important aspects of all of this because it has some incredibly interesting

122
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,880
properties it has some degree of intelligence in the sense of novel problem solving ability in

123
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,520
new circumstances and that has huge implications for biomedicine for for understanding evolution

124
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:39,040
for basic basic developmental biology that that that layer that that that that the interactions

125
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,960
there are really profound there's a lot of work that's being done by that layer and in addition

126
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,720
to that i want to pretty early in the discussion pull out something else when when we when we try

127
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,760
to explain things so we see something let's say this is here's a creature and it has a particular

128
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,920
style of of hand or it has some eyes or whatever it is and we want to explain this so you can ask

129
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,080
yourself well well where where does that come from right well how do we explain it and i want to

130
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,960
start off by thinking early on about what it means to explain certain kinds of features like what

131
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,280
does that mean how what does it mean to explain where something comes from imagine that i'll give

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,120
you i'll give you two simple examples and then you'll see why it matters to developmental biology

133
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,360
um you may have seen this thing it's called a gallatin board so it's a piece of wood like this

134
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,240
you bang a bunch of nails into it just sort of space regular and you take a bag of marbles

135
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,520
and you dump it into the top of the board what happens boom boom boom boom boom that you know

136
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,120
they sort of go around and in the end if you have enough marbles what did they do they land in this

137
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
beautiful bell curve at the bottom right you get then it's a tip but you can buy this toy on amazon

138
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,600
whatever so you get this you get this toy so you could ask yourself okay uh where does this beautiful

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,000
bell curve shape come from is it in the wood no is it in the description of the nails no is it in

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,600
the positioning of the nails no is it in the marbles no where does it come from right so so

141
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,920
that's so that's one simple example another example is if you if you discover a transistor let's say

142
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,280
you discover how to make a transistor and for example biological ion channels are a kind of

143
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,760
transistor because they can be voltage gated right so they're voltage gated current conductances so

144
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,320
they're basically transistors if you figure out how to make a transistor you could connect a few of

145
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,920
those transistors into a logic gate so it could be and or those kinds of logic gates right those

146
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,360
logic gates come with a truth table that tells you how it works yeah for example the and yeah and

147
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
with those truth tables especially if you have a knot and an and gate you can make all kinds of

148
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,360
all kinds of things now you can ask yourself where did that truth table come from i didn't

149
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,040
and i didn't have to evolve a truth table what i evolved is a transistor it's a piece of it's a

150
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,800
piece of physics but the truth table came for free once once you have certain things so where do

151
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,480
those things come from so so sometimes they come from specific selection forces other times there

152
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,800
are kind of free lunch in a certain sense and there are many types of these you know in geometry

153
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
in in basic i mean mathematicians have been talking about this for a long time right the

154
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
truths of of number theory of prime number distributions all these kinds of things they

155
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,480
you don't have to evolve them they're just sort of given to you for free if you have the right kind of

156
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,480
physical machine that to to to take advantage of them so there are laws of biomechanics about

157
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,560
bioelectrics or computation and many things and so what evolution might do so is is is is find a

158
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,560
simple machine that can harness all this stuff and so so i so i think it's important to understand

159
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,680
that when we ask where does it come from there's the part that is genetic but there's also that's

160
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,080
the part that's generic and people like Stuart Stuart Newman or Stu Kaufman have been talking

161
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,040
about this for for many years it's sort of there are generic laws of the universe that that biology

162
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,760
can harness that are not specifically in the genes anymore than that nice bell curve is in the

163
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,080
description of the wood and the nails speaking of intelligence and these these generic laws

164
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,920
how do the cells and cell groups decide what to make and when the process is finished yeah that's

165
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,920
that's that's very important so so there's two ways to to think about that question one way is

166
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,720
how does the decision making work in general so so so how do we scale up so so the the amazing

167
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,360
thing about biology is that evolution unlike unlike a lot of our engineering you know up until

168
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,800
recently when we were engineering we were working with passive materials so you know wood

169
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
metal that kind of stuff and the thing about passive materials is that you as the engineer

170
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,360
are responsible for all the outcomes the material basically doesn't do anything except keep its shape

171
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,480
usually and then you are responsible for placing it however it goes evolution can't do that because

172
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
evolution is working with an agential material the cells themselves have abilities they have

173
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,920
preferences they have behavioral repertoires so from that perspective evolution evolution is

174
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,240
working with a material that already has all these activities and so what you're really looking at

175
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
is behavior shaping it's a lot more like behavior shaping where where what you want is for cells to

176
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,360
give other cells signals so that they do specific things and I can give you some some cool examples

177
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,760
of that but anyway so so what we have to understand is how this process of competent subunits works

178
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,680
together to to to pursue bigger goals right now individual cells are very good at pursuing cell

179
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,760
level goals what's a cell level goal pH hunger level right so some sort of metabolic states all

180
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,120
kinds of like local little little things but multicellular collectives let's say limbs you

181
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,080
know cells of limbs and those kind of things they can work towards much larger goals so for example

182
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,160
in a salamander and they work together to build a limb if you cut off some of the fingers or the

183
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,280
whole wrist or the hand they will rebuild exactly what goes there right they will rebuild the exact

184
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,680
limb and then they stop when they're done so you can see this kind of goal-directed activity

185
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
where the system will exert energy to minimize the error between whatever is happening now versus

186
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,520
what it wants to have happened so so of course there's many things not understood about this we

187
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,400
are very actively studying this process but one thing that we can now see is that the process of

188
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,200
connecting the connecting cells into specifically electrical networks okay allows them to do a

189
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,800
very interesting kind of scaling and it's it's a little bit like the the notion of artificial

190
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,600
networks in computer science where you can you can connect these little subunits the subunits by

191
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,080
themselves don't do terribly much although cells of course do but you can connect them in a particular

192
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,640
way that enables the whole thing to have bigger computational properties and i can give you i

193
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,360
can i'll i'll give you just a very very simple example of how it works imagine imagine two cells

194
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,240
that are signaling to each other in the conventional way which means one cell secretes some kind of

195
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
signaling molecule that floats around and and it binds the next cell and okay that's a signal

196
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,440
so the thing with that kind of signaling is that the receiver is very clear that this signal came

197
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
from outside and once you get a signal from outside you can ignore it you can do something

198
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,760
about it whatever you have many options now imagine evolution invented this amazing thing

199
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,160
called a gap junction a gap junction is this these these proteins that allow cells to stick

200
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,600
together and pass small molecules directly between the intercellular milieu from one

201
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,920
into the other the amazing thing about the gap junction is and i'm simplifying this greatly

202
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,760
but but the interesting piece of this is that when something happens to cell a let's say let's say

203
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,240
it got injured it got poked or something in it and and there's a calcium spike that that went on

204
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,760
that calcium spike or whatever memory molecule will propagate through the gap junction into the other

205
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,080
cell and what i what i what i say about the gap junctions is that they have this property of

206
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,520
wiping identity meaning that when that signal propagates this cell cannot tell that that signal

207
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,760
came from outside because you because because it's calcium spike looks exactly like this other

208
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,360
calcium spike once there is a signal a physiological signal of something now you don't know that it

209
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,640
came from from the outside right so what this means is that there's a kind of mind meld almost a

210
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,560
mental connection between these two cells where memories lose identity they lose ownership so

211
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,920
from the perspective of this single cell that's a fault that that molecule is a false memory

212
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,560
because it this cell never got poked but from the perspective of the collective

213
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,920
that's absolutely a true memory because the collective did get poked and so what happens is

214
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,600
when cells get merged into these tight electrical networks they start to the the the identity the

215
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,480
separated identity starts to fuzz meaning that it's it's they're they're having a hard time keeping

216
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,200
their their knowledge separate and when when when you can't if you and i can't keep our memories

217
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
separate then in an important sense we become one larger unit right because that that distinction

218
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,800
starts to break down so when that distinction breaks down and cells connect into larger electrical

219
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,480
networks the three things happen those three things let's go back to the homeostasis right

220
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,400
if you're a single cell and you're trying to keep homeostasis you have to do three things

221
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,960
you have to be able to measure what's going on now what is my ph now then you have to remember

222
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,920
what the correct one is what's my correct ph range and then third you have to take action

223
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,880
to bring the current ph to closer to the correct ph right maybe a dump asset or something like that

224
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,400
imagine what happens to those three things when cells connect connect into large electrical

225
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,960
networks so tissues when you take a measurement because you're gap junctionally connected you

226
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
don't you no longer just measure your own local environment because you're all connected you

227
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,520
measure something very large so you're taking non-local measurements right every cell knows

228
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,520
what's going on everywhere else because your measurement is now a function of a much larger

229
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,760
area when you try to remember what is the right set point your computational capacity is now huge

230
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
whereas before you might only be able to remember a few very small things well now you're a big

231
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,840
network now you might be able to remember all kinds of things right and your action whereas

232
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,040
before you were a single cell able to take local actions as a collective you might do all kinds

233
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,720
of interesting things you might bend you might deform like a sheet you could do all sorts of

234
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,680
things but they're large things so everything scales up right the other interesting thing that

235
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:19,760
happens here is that you scale you scale stress and what i mean by that let's just think about this

236
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,960
for a second why when you're when you take a measurement and it's not correct why do you

237
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,320
take any action to fix it the way biology tends to handle it is by stress so stress is proportional

238
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,440
to that delta between the current state and the preferred state and and what it does is try to

239
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,600
minimize stress as long as that stress is high i'm going to take action and when the stress goes

240
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,720
low enough then i can relax everything's cool right that's something like that so what you can

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,200
do is so just imagine if you're a single cell by proper by by by releasing your stress molecules

242
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,720
and propagating them out to your neighbors you make your problem becomes their problem whereas

243
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,960
before if you were stressed out let's say you're a cell that is sitting in some other cells and

244
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,480
you're in the wrong location you need to be up here but you're down here and you have some

245
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,200
amount of stress over that if you just keep your stress you will stay there and no one will get out

246
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
of your way and you cannot move if you start to propagate your stress outwards remember it's

247
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,400
will be the same stress molecule as all the other cells have so they're stressed too everything gets

248
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
a little more plastic everybody everybody's sort of willing to change and it doesn't have to be in

249
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,480
physical space right it could be in physiological states it could be in transcriptional states

250
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,560
whatever but that stresses it makes everything a little more plastic and then you can go where

251
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,320
you need to go and then the stress will drop again so it doesn't make anybody more altruistic

252
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,240
what it does is everybody acts because they want to reduce their stress not because they care about

253
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,040
you but it's a very cool mechanism to take to to to to scale up goals because it because your

254
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,400
local goal becomes everybody's goal because everybody wants you to stop stressing so you

255
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,040
can stop stressing them out so so so that that kind of process and i mean i'm only telling you the

256
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,160
part that we i think we have a little bit of insight to there are many things here that we

257
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,600
don't understand that kind of process enables cells that care about little tiny things okay to

258
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,640
start to have bigger goals the scaling of goals whereas before your goals were physically in

259
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,880
terms of space and time very small now they're starting to get bigger and this is how you have

260
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
goal and a talk goals in the anatomical space so let's make you know let's make a limb or whatever

261
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,320
that that could be a story of scaling okay so like right now it just seems like you know it's

262
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,720
for you it's like daily work basically and it's you deal with this on daily basis but basically

263
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,440
what you just said is some really important insight starting by okay there is some bio

264
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,320
electrically imprinted information and not you know neuronally binded so it's just by you know

265
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,240
any cell and it makes sense because you know neurons are also you know a cell so it makes

266
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,560
sense that other cells they have ion channels they have different kind of channels and they can

267
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,760
make gradients as well so why not make bioelectric gradients so this is like the first huge huge

268
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,240
insight and i think you know a lot of your work kind of stands on that as well i think and it's

269
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:19,120
so important and what is then i was i was listening to your other some other interviews and work as

270
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:28,000
well and the the thought of agent of agency of individual of self by forgetting who i am and

271
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,480
you know kind of mind melting together that's just that's really brilliant and i wanted to you know

272
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,480
there is this thing where the bio bio electrically imprinted information could could also get

273
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,160
decoupled as well and it just came to my mind because the decoupled did that decoupled bio

274
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:59,600
electrically imprinted information uh is also um is also similar to what happens with cancer am i

275
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,440
right or yeah yes no yeah i just wanted to i had to thought where if there is like maybe that's just

276
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,040
you know i'm thinking out loud but you were talking about the stress and the amplifying of

277
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,040
stress basically a little bit so what if there is like too much stress and some of the cells kind

278
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,800
of decided oh my god this is like too much out of this whole agent like it's too much i'm gonna you

279
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,800
know head out and leave this entity there and i'm gonna you know play by myself maybe is that

280
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,320
something that we might think about i think that's a very reasonable idea we are testing exactly that

281
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,040
hypothesis uh i don't have the answer for you yet but uh i think by the end of the year we

282
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,960
should know something about this i think i think yeah i think that's completely reasonable i mean

283
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,480
these electrical networks let's just take a take a step back here um if we think about all the cool

284
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,720
things that brains do right so they have memory they can pursue goals they have preferences all

285
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,280
these things where did all these things come from so of course they didn't just sort of evolve out of

286
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,760
the arise out of nowhere they they evolved from much more simple versions of the same thing and

287
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,240
as far as we can tell what basically evolution did was pivot some very early biophysical tricks

288
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,200
into different problem spaces so cells were first solving problems in metabolic space and then

289
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,120
physiological space and then transcriptional space uh and then morpheus space and later

290
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,240
three-dimensional space when muscles and neurons came aboard right so we have to think about about

291
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,760
about this kind of intelligence long before three-dimensional space and in fact evolution

292
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,440
discovered that electrical networks are really great for this kind of thing very long time ago

293
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,160
so for example there's some beautiful work on bacterial biofilms where even even bacterial

294
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,000
biofilms can do some of these brain-like things so ion channels were were at the beginning you

295
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,920
know there's some great neuroscience koshland did some great neuroscience and bacteria should

296
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,560
looking at how ion channels work and now the the modern uh work uh is is is really showing that

297
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,200
this is this stuff is ancient so what it was used for before was to navigate something called morpheus

298
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,400
space which is the space of anatomical configurations right what shape should we be navigating that

299
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,640
space is exactly the same problem as navigating three-dimensional space there are good regions

300
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
there are bad regions there are barriers sometimes you find yourself not where you expected you have

301
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,800
to figure out how to get to where you're going you have limited uh energy you have limited ability

302
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,240
to see where what's what's around you exactly the same problems and so and so biology um uh

303
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,120
you know it was was using these electrical networks very early and so and so what happens

304
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,840
in uh in multicellularity is that cells join together into these electrical networks

305
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:47,120
to more intelligently navigate that space but as you just pointed out that uh that process

306
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,160
can break down it has failure modes and one failure mode is and of course we know that

307
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,280
that all kinds of stresses can lead to cancerous transformation one failure mode is when the

308
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,680
cell is electrically disconnect and it doesn't have to be caused genetically although it can be

309
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,920
the first thing that oncogenes tend to do is to is to electrically uncouple cells

310
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,520
shutting down gap junctions is one of the first things that that oncogenes tend to do

311
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,640
once the cells uh electrically disconnect then as far as they're concerned the rest of the body

312
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,840
is just external environment so that boundary between me and the outside world can grow and shrink

313
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,360
it can grow during evolution uh or and it can shrink during cancer where the cancer cells are

314
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,280
not any more selfish than the other cells they're just have smaller cells right like everybody's

315
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,680
equally selfish in biology just sometimes your self is huge and sometimes your self is sometimes

316
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,640
your self is tiny and and exactly as you said those cells might say okay i'm out of this network

317
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,320
and as soon as you unplug you no longer see the bigger the bigger goal which is to build a nice

318
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,440
limb or a kidney or a liver or something like that what you see is your your ancient unicellular

319
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,920
goals which is what for to become two cells for every cell to become two cells and then to go

320
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:04,240
wherever life is good and that's metastasis basically so do i understand it well in my mind

321
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,000
just appeared some uh hierarchy of identities uh from the little cell to the multicellular

322
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,520
organism of or a multicellular group and uh i would like to ask you if i understand it well that

323
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,560
what binds these cells together what binds their intention together so they're able to make a limb

324
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:31,760
is uh these uh electric by bioelectrical networks and in these bioelectrical networks

325
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,640
there is a working some kind of uh memory like can i uh can i can i imagine like that oh yes yes

326
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,280
yes it is literally and it is it is literally a kind of memory and i say that because i mean think

327
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,840
about um so in all of these things all all agency claims okay this is my perspective of course all

328
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,960
agency claims meaning how intelligent is something what kind of agency it has are really engineering

329
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
claims they're not philosophical claims they're engineering claims that need to be tested by

330
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,720
experiment so if i tell you if i show you a new device and i say to you this is a homeostatic

331
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,920
device it's a it's i say it's it's it's it's it has the cognitive level of a thermostat it's able to

332
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,120
it's able to pursue local goals and and that's that's what it has right what i'm telling you

333
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,920
really is it's not it's not a you know kind of a philosophical claim it's it's engineering it means

334
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,440
that if you in order to test this idea you should say okay if you are correct then three things have

335
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,640
to be true we have to find how the set point is encoded because because the because the because

336
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,880
any homeostatic system has to encode a set point we have to be able to decode that information meaning

337
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,520
read what is the set point i have to be able to read it and then we have to be able to change it

338
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,320
rewrite it in a way that does not require physically rewiring the rest of the machine

339
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,560
in order to change it if you have to rewire the whole machine then you didn't give me a thermostat

340
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,560
you gave me a mechanical clock or something like this right that does not rise to the level of a

341
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,480
thermostat with the magic about a thermostat is that i don't need to know how the rest of it works

342
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,920
and i don't need to rewire the whole thing all i need to know is where is the set point how do i

343
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,520
read the set point and how do i write the set point and then something beautiful happens i

344
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,000
read i reset the goal and the machine takes care of the rest right that's an engineering dependency

345
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,440
it means that if i if i use this in my you know in my bigger device i don't have to micromanage

346
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,360
the temperature i let this thing take care of it right that's those are that's what an agency

347
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,640
claim is it's how much um how much can you trust something to do in your own absence basically

348
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,080
right that's that's my view of agency so so uh so why do we so so let's let's test this out how do

349
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,840
we call it a memory if if um let's say uh so so here's good to talk about this model system of

350
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,680
flatworms so flatworm is a little free living thing called a planarian it has a head and a tail

351
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,360
and uh you know they're very cute they have a true brain lots of internal tissues and things like that

352
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
um they have many interesting properties one of the interesting properties is that you can cut

353
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,320
them into pieces and every piece regrows exactly what's missing not only does it regrow what's

354
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,640
missing but the piece actually shrinks so that by the time the new head and tail come up of course

355
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,600
they're small the whole thing will be proportional right so it's very cool everything is scaled down

356
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,280
and and you get a perfect little worm so you might ask the question okay so you might say okay uh we

357
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,840
here we have two hypotheses hypothesis number one is that this is a a purely emergent mechanical

358
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,320
process so all the cells locally do whatever they do based on local rules and uh that's it

359
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,080
whatever happens happens that's that's the standard null hypothesis uh some years ago i made a different

360
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,800
hypothesis and i said okay i think there's more intelligence here than that i think it's a homeostatic

361
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,920
system which means that i think this thing actually remembers what a correct planarian is supposed to

362
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,080
look like now that's a very that's a very weird kind of claim because uh you know first of all

363
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,200
people like to reserve these kind of terms for complex you know they say what do you mean it

364
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
remembers right well i remember things i'm like well you know memory there's all kinds of memories

365
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,080
and you're not the only thing that can remember things um and so and so i said that's okay let's

366
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,160
see let's see if the memory paradigm helps us here at all so so so we started looking and we found

367
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,320
out we found out three things we found out that a if you actually look at the bioelectrical pattern

368
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,400
and the way you do that is using these voltage sense that a fluorescent dye so it's a chemical

369
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,880
you throw it on and it basically glows depending on the local voltage concentration

370
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
it's a it's the whole the whole thing by the way is a version of we we i i we steal all kinds of

371
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,160
ideas from neuroscience because it's all the same stuff so so this is basically the notion of neural

372
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,240
decoding right this idea that they have a neuroscience that if we just scan the brain and we if we

373
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,920
understood how to decode it we would see your memories and your plans and your you know all the

374
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,600
mental content that you have so i said okay let's see if we can do this for the rest of the body

375
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,120
let's see i'm going to take seriously the idea that the body is a collective intelligence of cells

376
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,880
the same way that we are a collective intelligence of neurons right we're bags of walking neurons

377
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,120
basically so i said okay let's take seriously this idea that that that there's a collective

378
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,800
intelligence that navigates morpho space now in morpho space there are two headed worms and one

379
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,600
headed worms and triangular heads and flat heads is all this stuff in morpho space these animals

380
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,400
are amazing at navigating that space right the way that rats can navigate mazes these guys navigate

381
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,600
morpho space it's okay well let's take seriously the idea that this is a collective intelligence

382
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,760
it's navigating morpho space that means that somewhere there's going to be a memory of where

383
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,880
it's going let's see if we can see this memory so we found out that yes in fact we can see a

384
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,440
bioelectric pattern that tells you how many heads a piece is supposed to have we then we said well

385
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,640
now let's rewrite it and so the way we can rewrite it is you can make a computational model that will

386
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,880
say this is what the pattern of the tissue looks like now which what what channels do I need to open

387
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,360
or close to make the pattern be different okay and this is of course is what we're working now for

388
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,760
biomedicine this is this is the big you know kind of the big idea is that if you can predict what

389
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
what channel opening and closing would get you to the right state maybe you can address all kinds

390
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,240
of defects and things like that so so so we found some some drugs that open and close ion channels

391
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,360
and we converted that one head uh kind of pattern to a two head pattern no genetic change meaning we

392
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,960
don't do no CRISPR no genomic editing no trans genes we don't do anything genetically but what we found

393
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:34,560
is is two amazing things once you do that if you injure the animal it then will consult the pattern

394
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,120
see that oh two heads okay and it and it builds a two-headed worm right no problem the cells don't

395
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,280
care because that is their reference the cells have no idea that anything is wrong because that is

396
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
what tells them what they're supposed to be in the first place so that's the first thing the second

397
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,640
thing we found is that that electric circuit is amazing because it has it it's it's it's really

398
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,360
is a memory because once you convert them to two-headed it stays two-headed so you can cut them

399
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,040
again and again and again and they will continue to wait that that circuit once you've switched it

400
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,480
so so you can think about it like that okay so so so then you ask so where was the number of heads

401
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,360
encoded really right was it encoded in the genome you might want to say that because

402
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,360
all standard worms look the same so maybe the so it has to be somewhere it's right on the other

403
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,320
hand clearly it's not completely determined by the genome because we just made a line of of of

404
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,760
two-headed worms that that has nothing genetically wrong with them so here's the here's the I mean

405
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:41,040
so here's the kind of analogy that I that I like what the genome gives you is a piece of hardware

406
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,080
meaning that genome sets all the channels and all the other stuff it it it encodes a piece of

407
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,840
hardware that very reliably when the power is first turned on when the thing is first alive

408
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:58,320
and the physiology is going it very reliably settles into a particular state when you buy a

409
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,400
calculator you imagine you you get it you get a parts list that has a bunch of electronic parts

410
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,360
you assemble them according to the to the schematic you turn on the power and the little lcd it says

411
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,320
zero every single time you do it a thousand times every single time it starts at zero okay great so

412
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
it's reliable it says zero but then you realize that hey wait a minute this thing is actually a

413
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,000
programmable calculator which means that if I give it some inputs not to rewire it I can put away my

414
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
soldering iron right I don't need to rewire it but I can give it some input some brief you know

415
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,120
taps on the buttons that change the electrical signal just for a brief amount of time then I can

416
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,200
make the thing instead of zero I can make it say something else and in fact it has a memory and tomorrow

417
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,360
it will say something else again it will you know still have the same thing so so this is what I

418
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,760
think happens I think evolution builds hardware that is reprogrammable that has a default a very

419
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,120
reliable default state but that's not the only state and we have many many other interesting

420
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,640
experiments with xenobots and other things that can tell that that tell you that the default

421
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,040
behavior of this thing is not the only behavior that's just the kind of you know the default

422
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:08,160
behavior so is this feature what you call anatomical homeostasis that like every cell has its

423
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,680
local position in some some group or some or some body and it has some kind of a latent memory

424
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,640
that gets activated in times of need for example in some in some damage or when it needs to

425
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:31,040
again regenerate something yes except that I don't think it's a single cell level memory

426
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,880
I don't think the single I mean single cells also have memory of course but I think but the

427
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,080
thing that we're talking about now is a property of the network not of individual cells and we've

428
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,760
shown the we have many examples where you can mix things around and it doesn't matter where they go

429
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,200
the whole the the collective it's the collective is what stores and and we're pretty used to this

430
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,040
right with holographic theories of memory with neural networks where it's not the individual

431
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,960
neurons that know anything it's the network that knows something so I think I think that's

432
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,000
the you know bi-electricity is not a single cell the exciting the exciting part of bi-electricity

433
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,800
is not the single cell property it's the network property yes yes I meant it this way like the

434
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,880
the cell perceives the information that flows from the cells around and just this this flow of

435
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,160
information that these cells can perceive their position in the body and their role and what they

436
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,240
are supposed to make as a position and function I mean think about think about you know in the

437
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,840
the more familiar version in the brain your brain is an electrical network that makes decisions

438
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,880
and then issues commands to muscle cells right to implement to implement to move you through

439
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,280
three-dimensional space electrical circuits in the body are exactly the same thing but they

440
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,560
issue commands to other cell types not just muscle to move you through anatomical space

441
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,920
they don't move you through three-dimensional space although there are systems where that's the

442
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,960
sit you know that that merges kind of tightly but but they they're moving you through morpher space

443
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,040
and it's the exact same thing it's the it's the the decision-making in the electrical network and

444
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,880
then signals are passed down to let's activate some genes let's act let's activate some some cell

445
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,680
migration differentiation proliferation cell death all of this stuff is downstream of that

446
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,240
can you tell us more about your experiments for example that one that when you created

447
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,760
an eye a third eye on the frog so okay so so there's two there are two different types of

448
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,880
experiments there the first one has to do with bioelectricity and it's this idea that we we we

449
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:34,960
we looked at the the early frog embryo and in the early frog embryo you can see that an

450
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,240
electrical pre pattern that tells you where all the organs of the face are going to be right you

451
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,800
can already see them it's it's cool because it's it's a it's an easy pattern to start with because

452
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,720
some of them are incredibly complicated and you don't know what the encoding is the face one is

453
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,400
really nice because you can see it i mean it basically looks like a face so there's not much

454
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,200
decoding that needs to happen it looks like a face some of them are really complicated so so you

455
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,360
can ask the question and we actually did the eye experiments before we even knew about the face but

456
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,640
but you know this i'm telling you in a way that makes the logic clear you might ask the question

457
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,680
if this bioelectrical state tells the system where to put the eye what happens if we if we

458
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,240
copy that state somewhere else because that's how you want to test it because otherwise you might

459
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,240
say well that pattern doesn't do anything it's just kind of a epi phenomenon it's a byproduct right

460
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,240
so so now we got to do the functional experiment so long ago and this is uh this is you know kind

461
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,440
of part of the story storytelling but when when we when we first started my lab i had a i had a

462
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,360
graduate student named Ivy Chen she was actually a dental student she became a dentist afterwards

463
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,920
she's not a scientist but but she but she was doing research in the lab and i had asked her to

464
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,760
inject some ion channels they happen to be curse 6.1 ion channels i asked her to inject some RNA

465
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,760
for curse 6.1 in weird places in the early frog embryo okay uh now at the time this is this was

466
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,480
considered ridiculous because i remember as a postdoc i i um i wrote away to all sorts i wrote

467
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,480
letters to all sorts of people working on uh neuroscience and gut physiology and kidney and

468
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,280
everything and i said look if you've cloned any ion channel genes send them to me and and i'm going

469
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,280
to try to to to you know to reproduce them somewhere else and i said look this is you're

470
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,240
crazy because because voltage is a housekeeping parameter and if you perturb the voltage everything

471
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,240
will just die and you will have uninterpretable phenotypes okay that was the standard assumption

472
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,600
and i was pretty sure that that that was that was wrong so i wanted to test that

473
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,040
so i asked her to to inject these these things and then and so so we inject them then we come back

474
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,440
six days later and uh and she says to me and something funny because she says um you know

475
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,680
they're full of these black dots and they said black dots um what is that let me look so i get

476
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,360
that i sit in front of the microscope together and i said oh my god look carefully at these black

477
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,880
dots these are eyes and so these tadpoles had eyes all over the place because what you what we were

478
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,440
doing is reproducing the electrical uh map that says build an eye here we were reproducing that on

479
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,920
the tail and the gut i mean anywhere and so we found out several important things that day one

480
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,840
is that in fact about voltage is not just a housekeeping parameter it is uh it is

481
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,280
instructive for a very subtle thing for first shape number two it's extremely modular the

482
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,400
architecture of the animal is modular because we didn't have to provide all the information on

483
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,320
how to make an eye i mean can you imagine how many different cell types and the or you know the

484
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,160
positioning this goes back to your first question of where does the shape come from right we didn't

485
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,760
have to say well here's how you make an eye first you need a lens and then a retina then we have to

486
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,320
do any of that we we provide a very simple piece of bioelectric information this is your voltage

487
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,520
pattern so that looks like a very much like a subroutine call right when you program you have

488
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,560
a subroutine call which is a simple trigger that kick starts a very complex set of a set of actions

489
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:52,800
third uh the eyes formed and then they stopped so again that that that module that subroutine

490
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,040
is self-contained we'd make an eye and then that's it we didn't have to tell it when to stop it didn't

491
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,760
you know sort of make a gigantic eye that took over the whole embryo we've made a

492
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,960
paranormal eye and then it stopped and then so so so so i what that's i guess four things

493
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,920
so the fifth thing is that if you look at the developmental biology textbook it will tell you

494
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,120
that only the anterior norectoderm is competent to make eye right it will tell you that all the

495
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,400
other tissues cannot make eye why does they say that because the pack six master eye gene in frog

496
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,640
anyway only works in front of you know basically in front of the brain the anterior norectoderm

497
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,560
that's wrong many tissues are competent to make eye including gut and tail and all kinds of other

498
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,680
stuff but pack six doesn't do it because pack six is not the top of the hierarchy the top of the

499
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,520
hierarchy is the voltage and the voltage will of course turn on pack six in these other organs

500
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,840
we so we can see it but that's not enough that's not by itself that's not sufficient but but but

501
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:50,960
what it means is that our our view of the of the competency of these other cells is limited by the

502
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,440
way the way we ask the question how you probe it and that's actually really important not until

503
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,640
fairly recently did it what did i appreciate the irony irony that nowadays we're i'm studying you

504
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,760
know weird unconventional intelligence and telling people that well you can't guess correctly the

505
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,320
intelligence if you don't ask it in the right way but we were already seeing this in 2001 we

506
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,200
were already seeing that really that right that that that's that that's the fact and the other

507
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,360
thing we learned which was also super cool is this imagine that when you inject the RNA into the

508
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,960
embryo you put in a lineage tracer so you can see every cell that gets your RNA becomes blue

509
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,720
with beta gal beta galactosidus so you can tell which cells got your RNA so what we saw was this

510
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,800
was this very interesting thing where if you have a for example a lens sitting in the tail of a

511
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,840
tappel somewhere you take a section through it and you look only half of it is blue so what that

512
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,080
means is that if we don't get if we don't convert enough cells to do this the cells that are making

513
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,880
a lens they will recruit their neighbors they know there's not enough of them to make a good lens

514
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,200
they will recruit a bunch of neighbors that themselves did were not affected by us at all

515
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,840
and say hey you're part of this project now you need to make this lens so there's two levels of

516
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,920
instruction right we instruct the cells hey make a lens right here but i'm not going to tell you how

517
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,560
to do that in fact i'm not even going to affect enough cells and those cells say okay well i'm

518
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,480
going to instruct my neighbors and then we're going to build this thing right so several several

519
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,200
layers of instruction so this was so so that's so that's one story of the eye there's another

520
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,040
eye story which is not bioelectric that story is that Doug Blackiston who was at the time of

521
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,800
postdoc in my group now he's a staff scientist he um he took eye primordia cells so the cells that

522
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,960
are going to later become eye and he stuck them on the back of a tappel they of a frog embryo

523
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,040
they these cells not first of all so here's the amazing things about that first they still make

524
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,040
a great eye even though they're in a completely bizarre environment so instead of being near

525
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,880
the brain they're sitting in the middle of muscle no problem they make they make an eye number two

526
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,000
they have an optic nerve that comes out where does this optic nerve go it doesn't go to the

527
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,960
brain it's it sometimes it goes nowhere sometimes it goes to the spinal cord okay so it synapses

528
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,200
onto the spinal cord number three those animals can see perfectly well out of those eyes because

529
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,600
we tested them this is the craziest part we tested them in this visual learning assay so we

530
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,080
had this like moving blue light and we wanted them to move away from the from the blue light right

531
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,760
and and they do they can see perfectly well if they don't have any other eyes but an eye on

532
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,960
their backs they can see and so and so think about this right this this brain that evolved

533
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,520
for millions of years to expect visual input from specific location now you suddenly you have this

534
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,160
weird patch of itchy tissue on your back that's providing some sort of electrical tingling

535
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,720
up your spinal cord your brain could say oh yeah that's visual data no problem I can work with that

536
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,440
and uh and it's fine right this has this is massive implications for evolution remember at the

537
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,080
beginning I said that that middle layer has competent has intelligence that helps evolution

538
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,560
and think think about this imagine you have a mutation like all like all mutations it has

539
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,680
multiple consequences one mutation is that your eye ends up on your back okay the second the way

540
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,960
but it has other effects that might be good if a right if a creature was hardwired this eye on

541
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,880
your back you wouldn't be able to see your fitness is zero you're dead that's it and so evolution

542
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,760
never experiences the benefits of this other again never explores the benefits of the mutation

543
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,000
whereas here for in this example in other examples if your eye is on the back well I can still see

544
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,320
it's fine so now your fitness is not zero now you get to explore well what else did we what

545
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,760
else do we have that might be good so it turns that competency turns negative mutations which

546
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,320
are most of them right deleterious mutations it turns many of them into neutral mutations because

547
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,480
man we can live with that the the developmental process can can still they can still get their

548
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,880
job done you see this is the the goal directiveness of the eye even though even though its environment

549
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,840
has changed and the genes you know may have changed it it it can still get its job done

550
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:58,080
and that means that evolution now has a much nicer space to search because because those

551
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,960
competencies help smooth the evolutionary landscape so those are those are our two eye stories

552
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,240
before we get to another experiment I just wanted to kind of reflect and maybe sum up for me for

553
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,920
the listeners for us in this conversation there are many levels to this and we've kind of now

554
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:23,520
went through in our mind emergent properties that weren't encoded before as you said with the

555
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,080
with the marbles you know coming down and stuff like that this happens in our biology in our

556
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,480
organism and stuff like that and different kind of levels of emergence kind of happen and so right

557
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,440
now it if I understand it correctly right now we can think of these different levels and kind of

558
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:49,360
choose the level where it's the best for us like where is the best to act on our intention

559
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:55,520
basically if I if I want to have an eye on the back do I as you said do I you know do the molecule

560
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,840
or things or do I imprint the bioelectric pattern so we found out you found out that okay

561
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,240
that's a better way to imprint the bio bioelectric pattern so right now it's such an interesting

562
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:20,080
field because there are some I was wondering about a question if if you can basically learn

563
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,320
those goals throughout evolution so in evolution we have this random process that ends up in some

564
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:33,920
form of organism does it learn to have a goal basically is like it's like some intentionality

565
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:42,560
or like theological side of things because you've said in interview with chonkerl that the biologist

566
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:48,160
and biologist like kind of theophobic but there we can see that there are some goal and goal

567
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,360
directedness and it's on many levels not only on the basic level of genes but okay there is this

568
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:02,800
goal directedness developed on the level that emerged out of you know so that's like so interesting

569
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,960
for me how do you think about that yeah yeah yeah you said many interesting things here um

570
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,520
let's let's uh kind of for a bigger context um the the reason for the teleophobia is that

571
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:23,280
at the beginning of of science basically there were only two options you you were either uh

572
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,920
very smart like a human or you were very stupid like a rock those were your two options right

573
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,920
there was there was true intelligence and then there was mechanics clocks and you know things

574
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,760
like that when you have those two options and you want to do science of course you know it

575
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,320
forces a binaryization where you start to look at everything as a clock because because no one

576
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,520
knew how to analyze things that were smart like humans so you said fine everything we're going to

577
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,440
pretend everything is a clock and we're going to just find out how the hardware works i i but but

578
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,160
the thing is now now it's time to to realize that since the 40s the 1940s we've had a science of

579
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,200
machines with goals cybernetics control theory okay so it's no longer magic we don't need we there's

580
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,760
nothing theological here there's nothing magical here we don't need any of that what we have now

581
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,280
is a good science that tells us it's a continuum it's not just dumb like rocks and smart like humans

582
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,400
there are uh it's a it's a it's a whole continuum along the way and that means that when you analyze

583
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,280
your system you don't have to pick one or the other you can make engineering claims about

584
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,640
where you think it is and then we will test those theories and either we will find out that oh you

585
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,360
overestimated and it's not really that smart or you underestimated and it's much smarter than you

586
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,560
thought but these are all now uh experimental questions the thing that drives me crazy is that

587
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,200
people will often vocalize their their feelings about oh uh this can't be this and this can't be

588
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,320
that these are not philosophical questions these are these should be empirical questions and so

589
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,360
and so you asked the most um you you you got right on on to the most important thing which is

590
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,440
what is the best level of control because because someone might say and people have said to me is

591
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:10,880
oh i see uh because you are showing how the bioelectrical decision propagates down to the

592
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,200
gene expression level right so i mean of course it does they say oh well it's just chemistry and

593
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,560
physics i said well what did you think it was going to be of course it's chemistry and physics but

594
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,000
but right underneath everything is chemistry and physics obviously but you are making a very specific

595
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,640
claim if you if you try to manipulate down at the lowest level let's find out let's find out who

596
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,920
has the better control you can try to control 10 000 genes every couple of minutes so but you know

597
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,120
and control it that way or you can go upstream and try to change the the the decision making of the

598
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:47,680
system okay we've now shown many examples where where the latter is is much much better because

599
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,360
and we already know right we already know that uh when i have the slide that i always show in

600
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,800
talks of what computer programming looked like in the 50s right what do you do you sit there

601
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,720
plugging you know plugging wires back and forth okay that work does does anybody want to program

602
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,120
that way nowadays right for most things i mean it's it's so difficult to program at the hardware

603
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,760
level it's just really hard so neuroscience is kind of on board with these multiple levels because

604
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,720
you know that if you have a problem with maybe it's a molecular problem so maybe somebody's missing

605
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,320
a neurotransmitter fine or maybe it's a it's a sort of behavioral problem so somebody might

606
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,400
need the behavioral modification therapy or something then or maybe it's a psychological

607
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,080
issue or maybe someone has read too much existentialism and now is depressed you know

608
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,360
that's not really a solvable by by neurotransmitter manipulation right that's a that's a that's a

609
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,240
completely different thing so so we kind of know that there are these different levels and and things

610
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,640
are handled at the should be handled at the appropriate level so we've made this so we made

611
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:58,000
this argument that that a lot of interesting regenerative medicine is only going to be achievable

612
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,360
when we are when we are no longer afraid to deal with the system at higher levels maybe we can

613
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:09,280
train tissues maybe we can talk about risk assessment by tissues a lot of the things that

614
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,600
are happening you know active inference perceptual control theory a lot of the things that are

615
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:19,680
happening in neuroscience are directly applicable to to other cells that are not brains and they

616
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,560
require us to understand many levels not just the molecular level maybe not even the bioelectric

617
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,440
level at some point you know we can train right imagine humans have been training animals for

618
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,920
thousands of years knowing zero neuroscience right you don't need to know what's what's inside

619
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,240
the brain as long as you understand that hey the system can learn and i know what the currency of

620
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,240
motivation is meaning rewards and punishments then that's it it doesn't matter what's really in there

621
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,000
so so maybe at some point for some things we can even go beyond and say i don't know what the

622
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,800
correct bio electrical state is but i'm going to train the cells for a specific outcome can you

623
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,320
train a genetic genetic pathway or something like that because i think you've talked about that a

624
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:01,600
little bit yeah yeah and we're not we're not the first lab to show that Richard Watson's group

625
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:07,680
and a couple of others shown something similar this is this is a good example of my point that you

626
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,400
can't just have feelings about these things you have to do experiments so for example if i show

627
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,880
you a gene regulatory network right you know so it's a bunch of transcription it's a bunch of

628
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,960
genes and they all transcriptionally regulate each other up or down you look at this thing and you

629
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:27,760
say wow this is the paradigm of genetic determinism there's no magic here there's no indeterminism

630
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,880
here uh it's i can see exactly how this works it's just it's just it's just physics right it's just a

631
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:40,880
piece of physics okay but nevertheless the question might become well what cognitive level does it have

632
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,920
if you if you assume from the beginning that it has zero meaning that the only way i can control

633
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,160
this is i can change the trans the promoters so that the i can delete nodes i can add nodes physical

634
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,480
rewiring you can do certain things so we and others as i say have done something like this we took the

635
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,600
made the assumption that actually let's find out right let's find out and so we took this the with

636
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,080
this the models of these of gene regulatory networks and we pretended they were neural

637
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,480
networks and we tried to train them what that means is that you pick some nodes you pick one

638
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,360
gene as your condition stimulus one gene as your unconditioned stimulus one other gene as a

639
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,720
as a response and you simply ask does the history of tweaking meaning up or down regulating these

640
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,520
inputs change the way it reacts to those inputs later on i mean that's learning right that's the

641
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,560
we found so in our work i'll just talk about they'll talk about ours um and this is uh sarama

642
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,680
biz was was the postdoc who did this uh she found six different types of memory including

643
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,680
pavlovian conditioning so like uh you know pavlov's dog right with the so so so she found that

644
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,720
biological networks can have many types of memory like this control random networks right so you just

645
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,760
just you know designed random networks they don't tend to have this property which suggests that

646
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,320
evolution actually likes this for whatever reason evolution actually favors uh this property of

647
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:06,800
being able to being able to learn and it has it has amazing implications for uh for biomedicine

648
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,600
because it means imagine right imagine the thing about the pavlovian conditioning imagine you have

649
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,600
a drug that is very powerful it works very well in the petri dish but you can't use it in humans

650
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:25,920
it's too strong so now if your disease circuit has this associative learning property it means that

651
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,280
maybe you can give that drug together with a completely neutral drug which we call we call

652
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,320
that in the in the in the review we call that a um a molecular placebo you take another drug that

653
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,520
doesn't do anything and you pair them together and you just give them together if the system learns

654
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,480
to associate them then maybe after a few presentations now you can just use the the neutral one and you

655
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,160
don't need the you know you don't need the really strong one right so and then maybe at some point

656
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,680
it will give up the way the dog you know if you keep ringing the bell the dog will give up eventually

657
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,760
eventually so maybe then you have to retrain you know I don't know but but but you get the idea so

658
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,880
so so this this is this is just a good example that you can't assume about these things you have to

659
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,520
you have to make hypotheses about cognitive level and then you have to test them I really like this

660
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,200
concept of both ways of control that the first way is bottom up it's from genes that there emerges

661
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,920
proteins and our other emergent structures and the other way around is from top down that these

662
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,000
electrical patterns can influence the genetical level and I would like to ask you like from your

663
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,880
experiment with the eye is it possible to get this eye passed to another generation that it's

664
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:41,120
like incorporated in the genome uh yeah uh we don't have any evidence that this feeds back into

665
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,960
the genome so it's fine now we haven't done the experiment but but I don't have any reason to

666
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:51,520
believe that the next generation of frogs would have this eye however um in the case of the planarian

667
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,360
it's a little more subtle because planaria normally reproduced by tearing themselves in half

668
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,120
and then regenerating and now you have two worms when that happens a two-headed planaria does give

669
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,040
rise to another two-headed planarian so it's not the same as sperm and egg reproduction it's not

670
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,320
classic uh lomarchism because you're not uh changing the hereditary material

671
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,880
but let's be careful you're not changing the DNA but DNA is not the only hereditary material and in

672
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,720
planaria the bioelectric circuit is also a hereditary material in fact there's others so so with

673
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,320
Chris Fields we wrote a something that show that talked about the fact that when you look at you

674
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,760
you know look at you look at any organism and look at the history all of its parents what molecules

675
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,520
are directly conserved through that whole lineage well certainly the DNA that's the whole point right

676
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,400
that the genome is passed on but there's two other things that are passed on one is the cytoskeleton

677
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,440
every cell's cytoskeleton is directly templated off of the previous cytoskeleton right and it's

678
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,640
also the cell membrane because the cell membrane also is so so and and also there are bioelectric

679
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,200
circuits who knows what else right there may be nine other you know media that are that we just don't

680
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,240
know about yet I don't know but but but at least in planaria you can take advantage of this additional

681
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,880
hereditary medium that's not genetic do do vertebrates have that I don't know there's some

682
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:22,000
nice work from Oded Rachavi in C. elegans where he studies transgenerational inheritance and so

683
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,040
there certainly are mechanisms for passing things back into the genome whether the bioelectrics does

684
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:34,160
this or not I I don't know we were talking about different levels of emergence basically but and

685
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:41,680
also the phenomenal work of six types of learning of these genetic networks basically and pathways

686
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:48,320
and stuff like that so I wanted to explore a bit more of these you know higher levels of

687
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,800
maybe cognition and get to minds because that's also another emergent level and we can think of

688
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:02,080
okay so right now I could tweak your brain and you would get in very very complicated way

689
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,320
the same information maybe as I'm speaking to right now but it's much more simple for

690
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:17,120
simpler for me to speak these words and move in this level of cognition basically and I was wondering

691
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:26,960
you know this gets us to there are many many weird kind of ideas how to get into with your

692
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,880
intention how it affects your body basically and it's also possible as well we've talked about it but

693
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:40,240
this is so interesting because right now we can kind of test it test it scientifically and test

694
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:49,200
how how could placebo work and what how strong the intention of this level where we kind of move

695
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,960
together how strong it is and how it actually affects the body and and the whole organism and

696
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:01,040
it does right because like you have these like you can think about something I don't know stressful

697
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,040
and suddenly you know your your body is secreting stress hormones and wow it affects things

698
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,760
affects the cells and the cells are connected and it affects the whole organism so how do you think

699
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:19,200
about our intention let's say power of our intention and how it affects the body and and yeah well a

700
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:26,800
couple things first you know if I were to tell you that you can voluntarily change the voltage

701
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,200
potential of cells in your body 30% of the cells in your body you could voluntarily change the

702
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,200
voltage potential you might say wow that you're crazy how am I going to change voltage potential

703
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,920
in my cells but in what but when you're lying down in the morning and you decide to stand up

704
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,080
guess what you're doing right you're changing the bioelectric state of your muscles so so we already

705
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,720
know that your intention can absolutely change the electrical state of your cells and and of

706
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,360
course the chemical and many others as you point out so so lots of people study the the

707
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,200
interface the immune the immune system interface to to the body many many other things people have

708
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,960
found effects on on stem cells from from meditation and certain kinds of practices so of course the

709
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:12,080
the link the link is is is strong um the thing that the thing that I would say is that I I

710
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:18,240
because because of this continuum right the fact that we were all one cell at one point in your

711
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:24,000
life you were one cell nine months and some years later you can say I am you know people

712
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,720
you get up a human who will say things like I am not a machine I am more than physics well

713
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,760
you used to be a you used to be a quiescent oocyte is what you used to be and and slowly

714
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,800
with right and the key the key is developmental biology does not offer any particular point

715
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,040
where some kind of lightning flash comes in ah now you have a mind before that you were just

716
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,600
chemistry right okay that doesn't happen so so so this thing is completely slow very you know

717
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:54,240
sort of step by step gradual so for me this means that if if I like to think backwards a lot of

718
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,720
people say paramecium has a mind come on single cells don't have mine I like to work it backwards

719
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,880
if we can agree that we have minds then you owe a story about where they came from and that story

720
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,240
cannot be well on day 59 you know this happened there's that's that's ridiculous and so so then

721
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:17,840
the story has to go all the way back and so once you have that you can you can say that I think

722
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,760
I think we can conclude a couple of things one is that minds change obviously the mind of a cell

723
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,600
is not the mind that we have now and there are many things in between and there are many alien

724
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,440
kinds of minds that we make with AI and with various other things and who knows what in the

725
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:40,080
universe who knows what else is out there they change that's a and b we are I think we are

726
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:46,160
very bad at recognizing unconventional intelligence I'll just give you a simple example we are born

727
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:53,760
with our sense organs looking out into the three-dimensional world where medium size objects

728
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,040
move around at medium speeds and that is our training set for look for for a for a recognizing

729
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,840
intelligence so when you see your cat or your neighbor or a bird or something else doing

730
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,840
something interesting you say oh look at this that's that's intelligence I see that that you know I

731
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,040
hid the you know I hid the reward from here to there and he still figured out how to get it or

732
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,560
you know you made the little you know the crows make the little tools to open the locks and do

733
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:22,320
all this stuff I recognize that as intelligence imagine if you were born with a an internal sense

734
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:27,360
of your body chemistry so a multi-dimensional sense of all the different chemicals in your blood

735
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,960
and you knew exactly what your liver and your pancreas were doing every moment of the day to

736
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,280
to adjust all of that stuff in that case you would understand that there is such a thing as

737
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,480
physiological space you would understand what intelligence looks like in physiological space

738
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,920
you would say oh my liver is really intelligent because it's able to do all these amazing things

739
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,240
despite different perturbations you would recognize that implants right like like smart

740
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:02,960
insulin pumps and pacemakers and things like that are robots that work in physiological space

741
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,640
right now when I say robot you imagine you know the the the Mars rover that drives around in the

742
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,840
or a self-driving car yeah that's great that's a robot in three-dimensional space we have robots in

743
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,640
physiological space right your your insulin pump that measures a bunch of stuff and gives you little

744
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,920
puffs of of insulin at just the right time it's navigating physiological space right but we don't

745
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,360
think about it that way right because because we are just you know sort of blind to all that stuff

746
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,720
because of our training set so I think I think that we need to understand that minds are incredibly

747
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,680
diverse minds come with all kinds of different bodies that we're not used to and and many more

748
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,400
will come I mean in your lifetime you're going to see creatures that just you know are completely

749
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:51,920
alien to us and synthetic and chimeric and cyborg and all that and and mind solve problems in in

750
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,400
novel spaces it's not all about movement and it's not all about three-dimensional space there are

751
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,680
there's intelligences all around us that are very hard to to see this brings a lot of ethical

752
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,800
questions about how we are moving through through the world what's what's your point what's your view

753
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:15,200
at the concept of the self identity because we are talking about intelligence at many layers

754
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:22,640
so what's your point on identity uh yeah there many things can be said it's a complex area of

755
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:30,800
course um I I one one thing that I have done is to try to come up with a framework where highly

756
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:37,760
diverse intelligences could all be um compared and recognized on the same in the same space so so

757
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,840
what I wanted to do and this was um this was a challenge put to us a few years ago at a meeting

758
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,320
in them of the Templeton Foundation they had asked us to come up with a framework to be able

759
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,640
to compare directly all kinds of unconventional intelligences you know and so and so some people

760
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,760
think you know octopus uh you know something or insects or something like that I want to go really

761
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:01,600
broad I want to be able to think about uh swarms I want to think about alien life forms I want to

762
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,640
think about AI I want to think about synthetic and chimeric intelligences other spaces like

763
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,160
really broad and so so what is a self right what what is how do you uh how how can you compare

764
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:18,640
all these different different things I think that uh cybernetics got it right with a focus on goals

765
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,040
so so so here's here's what I think a self is I think a self is a collection of parts that

766
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:30,800
are able to work together towards system level goals the goals that belong to that that collection

767
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,080
not to the individual pieces now one thing we can do is we can map out the size of your goals

768
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,440
so we can add in whatever whatever whatever those goals might be how about the size of them so if

769
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:47,680
you are so let's let's think of some examples if you tell me that my biggest goal the biggest thing

770
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,320
I can work and remember what a goal is a goal is some state that you can exert energy to reach

771
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:57,520
that state that's a goal so if you tell me that the biggest goal you can possibly think about

772
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,240
is the local sucrose concentration then I'm going to guess you're a bacterium of some sort and that

773
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:11,600
is your level okay if you tell me that uh you can have goals that reach forward a few hours and in

774
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,320
terms of space you can handle things that go on a few you know a few hundred feet in diameter

775
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,400
but that's about it I'm going to say well maybe maybe you're about the level of a dog meaning

776
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,640
that your dog has certainly some memory going backwards certainly some predictive capacity

777
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,960
going forwards it understands some amount of space but you can never get your your goal your dog to

778
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,720
work towards a goal that's three months from now in the next city over impossible right they just

779
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,600
can't handle that size of that's now now why do I say this right somebody if somebody somebody

780
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,600
could prove me wrong and then train their dog to you know to work towards things that are months

781
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,360
away I mean that's probably you know that's great then I'll change my example but but you understand

782
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,600
these are empirical claims there are minds that okay that have those kind of limitations then you

783
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:05,840
might tell me that well I have I have a goal that has to do with the the financial markets of the

784
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,960
next hundred years or you might tell me that while I'm really I'm really sad that the sun is going to

785
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,600
burn out you know billions of years from now okay then I'm going to say you're at least a human

786
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,680
because because your goal your goal and so I call this the cognitive light cone it's sort of the

787
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:25,040
boundary it's the size of the kinds of things you can have as goals not not not the distance you

788
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,200
can sense right because for example the tell it you know the James Webb telescope has a massive

789
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,400
distance of sensing that's not the point the point isn't about sensing the point is about

790
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:39,760
goal directedness so so you could be a human but then you might say to me you know uh I I I really

791
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:47,600
I I really I feel um I feel a certain way when something happens to to a thousand people

792
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,760
and when the same thing happens to a million people I'm not able to be a thousand times more

793
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,320
more upset I've just not I don't have that linear range I just can't do it and then we can start to

794
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,320
think about okay humans are probably not the top of the food chain at some point there will be a

795
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:06,160
massive intelligence that can literally in the linear range care about an enormous amount of

796
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,240
stuff that we can't even wrap our heads around right in terms of being a goal right so for somebody

797
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,840
like now now now there are of course traditions that talk about this right there are traditions

798
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,760
that talk about you know some sort of Buddha nature that where some where where something is

799
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,800
evolved to the point where they can literally care about all the sentient this sentient creatures

800
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,240
on on earth right maybe that's possible I have no idea if it's possible but you can think about

801
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,160
you know that humans are not the top of this this food chain so so for me in terms of um what a

802
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:39,920
self is a self is a temporary uh a temporary bundle of activities that works towards specific goals

803
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,120
so selves have goals they have preferences they have some

804
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,080
degree of competency in navigating various spaces maybe very high maybe low so so those are those

805
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,680
are selves and and of course selves are nested so in our body so we are a self we have many

806
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:00,480
selves inside of us most of which are nonverbal right not all of them but but most of them are

807
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,560
nonverbal and we are also part of probably larger selves that are you know social structures or who

808
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,240
knows what who knows what what's about us um and so yeah that anyway that's that's that's my talk on

809
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:21,840
the selves that's uh yeah that's um so interesting are you familiar with uh philosopher and Henry

810
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:31,040
Bergson uh he's yeah so his idea basically of of levels of consciousness was to do something with

811
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:37,040
indeterminism and it's so interesting and now you know you have uh you you just said okay my goal

812
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:44,320
is to get this so close okay it's probably a bacterium but you can create a space between the stimuli

813
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,440
or the goal and the many ways that can achieve that goal and that's basically the inter inter

814
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:55,600
indeterminism and that's basically the level of the self and maybe level of consciousness that

815
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,200
contains that self as well and i was just interested in the scaling of the goals i was

816
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:08,400
thinking one day okay what does how am i like how are humans motivated maybe a different

817
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,160
perspective on that and i was thinking okay so let's stretch out those homo static goals that we

818
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:19,840
have you know and the goals of you know the evolution has and if you stretch them out you you you can

819
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,120
maybe like okay why am i sitting in this room right now why was this building built and stuff

820
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:32,320
like that and this is basically this just stretched out basic homo static loop of my organism or of

821
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:39,120
you know this swarm of humans to get to a certain temperature and this is for me is so interesting

822
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:45,360
like scaling of goals and right now we are you know in the times of internet and we are connecting

823
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:53,680
right here right now and it's just um we think maybe this sci-fi that we're gonna get connected and

824
01:14:53,680 --> 01:15:00,240
have you know or connected there there is going to be some higher level intelligence or self or

825
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,840
something like that but i think that as you've said we don't have insight into different level of

826
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,880
minds or different you know different minds all together so maybe there is already something

827
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,000
like that you know this like kind of this kind of hive mind but you know not really this like

828
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:25,280
like woo perspective but more like realistic perspective what's happening right now it's it

829
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:31,520
feels like it's actually here already a little bit so yeah there was just some thoughts on that

830
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:38,160
yeah i i think i know i think that's very important because we we're we're very bad at

831
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,200
recognizing ourselves at lower levels we're even worse at recognizing them at higher levels

832
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:51,520
we don't have really any tools so so so one can ask this question if if you were part of a larger

833
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,680
mind could you tell first of all could you tell could you gather evidence that you were part of

834
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:02,240
a larger cognitive system and b could you if if you could could you gain some understanding of

835
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,480
what the goals of that system were right which is very important because as humans if we're building

836
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,200
some kind of massive uh political economic structure whatever uh what are the goals of

837
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,440
that structure right well we this happens all the time we do internet of things we do swarm

838
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,720
robotics and then you say can okay we have any idea what this thing's gonna want to do when when

839
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:25,920
well you know when it when it boots up right so so the thing is that i have a feeling and i don't

840
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,520
know this for a fact but my feeling is that probably with some version of girdle's theorem

841
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:38,640
tells you that you are never going to really understand what the higher level is doing

842
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,720
very much like you know when you go to work and you you know you step or don't step on

843
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,520
some ant on your way to a meeting the ant has absolutely no no capacity to understand the

844
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,840
context of what it just participated in you know why this is happening right so so it's

845
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,920
entirely possible that we are the same right and if and people have said that to you know

846
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,520
why the universe works in mysterious you know ways the bigger patterns right um but maybe it's

847
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,800
possible and i don't know but but maybe it's possible with some kind of math or you know causal

848
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:13,520
information theory or something to start to gain evidence or or against the idea that we are part

849
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,320
of something larger and just to give you an example i spent a lot of time in the last few months

850
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,680
thinking about what it would be like to be a neuron or a subset of neurons inside a large

851
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,480
neural network that's being trained and you could imagine two ways imagine this conversation between

852
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:36,160
like two two neighboring subnets one says oh look uh we live in a cold mechanical universe

853
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:43,040
doesn't care what we do uh i can learn you know i can learn about things and uh and we live in a

854
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,280
we are an insignificant spec in this in this giant universe that doesn't care about anything

855
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,600
there are no larger minds we are the only thing you recognize like this is you recognize this this

856
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,240
the story this is the this is the standard scientific story of today right we live in this

857
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,680
you know um mechanical cosmos that doesn't care what we have the other the other the neighbor says

858
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,920
you know i'm not so sure i i've been i've been tracking things here and i can tell you that

859
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,640
every time i do certain things life is good but when i do other things this this this massive

860
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,920
wave of punishment right this back propagation wave comes and smacks me and and forcibly changes

861
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,960
my voltage and does all this other stuff and i'm starting to think that the universe but at my

862
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,160
you that our universe actually does care what we do and in particular for some reason right you

863
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,240
know this have you seen um google deep dream have you seen these things it's like it makes it makes

864
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,200
it and then all these pictures have dogs in them because they're always running around well and so

865
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,960
i can imagine right so this is total fantasy of course but you get you get you get the idea

866
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,720
i can imagine that this one says look i i don't know i i cannot comprehend the the the thought of

867
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:55,360
our universe but i think it likes dogs because every because because every time i find an i like

868
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,920
every time i output this dog i life is good and otherwise i get you know corrected or something

869
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:06,320
like this right and and so you could easily imagine right the in in that universe the the

870
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:12,720
the one that thinks that it lives in a mindless world is wrong it's it's factually wrong the

871
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,040
quite right the question so now the question is for us the question is what is the right

872
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,120
view i mean there are certainly people who feel that there are patterns to life and that they

873
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,480
can know i mean i who knows right i don't nobody knows but but but i don't think it's crazy to

874
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,240
ask the following question this this is the distinction that i think is really important

875
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,240
are you learning or are you being trained what's the difference the difference is

876
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:42,320
in both in in both cases right in both cases you are engaging in something that is designed

877
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,360
to change your own mind when you are learning you pick up a book and learn stuff with the with

878
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:53,440
the inherent purpose of changing your own psychology and and by the way we are complex enough

879
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,920
that we are even subject to this idea of the thought that breaks the thinker right you can

880
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,200
imagine that if you're like really a kind of a deep thinker you might come across a piece of

881
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,720
literature or something that just screws you up completely and spirals you into some sort of

882
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,640
depression and whatever right but but we are we we know that we can learn and we can change our

883
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:14,160
mind but when we do that we assume that we are the only agent in that interaction so there's me

884
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,480
the agent and then there's the outside world and the outside world has zero agency and i'm the boss

885
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:25,280
i do what i want i can learn or i can not learn whatever the or i am provided with inputs and i

886
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,840
am changed the way that i would look but i don't know that the outside world has zero agency you

887
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,920
know that's that's an assumption we don't actually know that and under certain circumstances you

888
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,440
would be wrong to assume that if you're a neuron in a neural network you'd be wrong to assume that

889
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:42,000
so i don't know i'm not claiming i'm making no claims whatsoever about anything like that but

890
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,240
i'm just saying that i think i don't think it's a crazy question at all to try to develop some

891
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:52,160
sort of mathematical formalism to try to gain evidence for being part of a larger system even

892
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,240
knowing that you will never understand the whole goal you don't know what space it works in

893
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:03,360
but maybe you can see your option space being deformed in some way that is that is consistent

894
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:13,760
with with a not a zero agency on the other end so you just put a framework to a lot of you know

895
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:21,920
kind of these i don't know it feels like you are part of the universe you are not separated

896
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:30,320
from it and there is something maybe something maybe mysterious and you you know you have

897
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:37,600
subjective experience and whenever someone asks me if i believe in something you know i usually

898
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,880
say i believe literally i believe in something i can't really i believe there is like something

899
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,440
else that i can actually perceive because i know i can perceive only you know just these little

900
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:55,280
things and i think this is such a nice logical logical framework to ask ourselves whatever this

901
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:05,360
mysterious thing might be and only you know only the thoughts that you put out there is so important

902
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:12,240
because many many people are on in in one camp on one extreme and they say ah definitely there's

903
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,600
i don't know from panpsychism from eastern philosophical perspective you know we are this one

904
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,280
hive mind one consciousness consciousness and or like transmit we are you know transmitters

905
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,160
or something like that and now you are putting frame to it and kind of asking real question

906
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,440
and asking real possibility of kind of you know testing it maybe mathematically some

907
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,240
sometime in the future or something and you are kind of okay so you're not on this extreme

908
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:44,560
not on this other extreme but you are in the middle and it feels like you are trying to not

909
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:51,040
to have an agency in in this or or something because yes that's the how it's supposed to be

910
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,360
done and not wish something is like that or like that because that's like actually going to affect

911
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,280
the the stuff that you do and that you are going to you know explore and stuff or discover so this

912
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:07,840
for me is really interesting way to putting to to put these things together and and think about it

913
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,600
and kind of the extreme the the extremize the world that we live in because there is a lot of

914
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:20,880
extremes and when we can have even as you know scientists and and researchers and everyone

915
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:29,920
when they can have this kind of um uh you know uh talk or something i or discussion i think it's so

916
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,440
important because otherwise we can't you know we can't move forward so i really am great grateful

917
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:41,200
for what you do and that you put the job that you are putting these frameworks out here out there

918
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:47,200
so yeah thank you for that well thank you yeah thank you i i do think it's important to two things

919
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:54,320
one is to as treat as many things as possible as empirical questions right once you say i believe

920
01:23:54,320 --> 01:24:00,080
whatever it uh it it closes off the ability to test it first of all so we should always be working

921
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,280
to come up with some some way of making this practical and testable and that's a and b we

922
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:12,080
should realize that whatever your framework is it can it limits and enables different next steps

923
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:17,680
so it constrains you know if you if you never if you can never believe philosophically that

924
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,880
gene regulatory networks could have non-zero agency you will never do the experiment that we did

925
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:31,360
right planar you know planaria have been um uh have been studied since uh 1903 i believe uh right

926
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,200
you know and and two-headed animals have been produced right at the beginning of the last century

927
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,240
no one ever thought to cut to recut them to my knowledge no one ever recut them why because it

928
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,320
was perfectly obvious that that well genetically they're unchanged and when you cut off that second

929
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,840
head well of course they're going to go back to normal what else could it be and so so there are

930
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,800
so many experiments like this that we've done because uh each lens has things that it enables

931
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,760
and other things that it does not let you do and and as much of this as possible and the and the

932
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:04,880
biggest one of all is look there's a as scientists there's one thing that we all take on faith the

933
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,360
all science begins with an act of faith which is basically this idea that the world is understandable

934
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,920
right that there's a pattern behind it and then what we are doing is discovering a pattern nobody

935
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,920
no scientist can go to work saying i'm going to find a bunch of stuff today but tomorrow it'll

936
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,760
probably all be different that's great and like nobody believes that but you wouldn't do you couldn't

937
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,440
do science if you were some kind of you know if if hum was right and we were living in a

938
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,280
random uh you know just collection of randomness that has pockets of of of just by accident things

939
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,200
look like they make sense kind kind of in pockets if you had that view you would never be able to

940
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:41,200
do science science is predicated on on a complete leap of faith that has no no empirical justification

941
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:46,320
that that behind all of this stuff there is some kind of truth that we are getting to so so i think

942
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,400
you know i think we need to be honest with ourselves that that we all start in this in this field

943
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,440
anyway we all start with a bit of faith and then and then you move as much as you can to experiment

944
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:05,600
thank you for that michael what is your focus right now oh boy uh that's that's well uh and i

945
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,400
apologize i have about a minute and then then i have to run but uh you know we do a lot of things

946
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,520
in our lab i would say the focus of the whole group is to understand different kinds of minds

947
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:21,040
in various embodiments but that means regenerative medicine it means uh applications and birth

948
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,560
effects it means uh what cancer we do some uh synthetic biology synthetic morphology to make

949
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,280
artificial new proto organisms we do some artificial intelligence we do a lot of different

950
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:38,240
things all of them are around this this kind of question yeah uh michael i i'm so grateful for

951
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,600
your time thank you so much i think there is like questions of consciousness and regenerate

952
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,600
regeneration of limbs and stuff like that uh where do people find you uh you know leave us

953
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,200
some links or i think you're part of some company as well that is trying to research i think

954
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:01,120
regenerating limbs as well so could you could you link that everything is going to be in the

955
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,360
description and michael thank you so much for your time thank you so much i appreciate the

956
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:10,160
conversation i will i will email you a bunch of links yeah there's a couple of spinoff companies

957
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,320
all our stuff is on my website that you can see all that so yeah thank you so much and i'm happy

958
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,200
to talk to you guys anytime we can always do it again cool nice thank you very much bye have a

959
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:31,040
nice day bye
