Checking YPO/Carlo Rovelli – The Illusion of Time – YPO EDGE 2019.txt
1. Regarding the question about looking into one's past or having foresight, the physicist explains that while these phenomena may seem real to individuals, they are often illusions and not true in a scientific sense. Physics, through theoretical predictions like the position of Venus tomorrow, can predict future events, but these are different from the personal experiences some individuals report.

2. The physicist clarifies that while time travel to correct past mistakes within a day is something many would like, it is unlikely to be physically possible due to chemical reactions and other constraints.

3. The physicist acknowledges that the perception of time varies among individuals and can be influenced by personality types, activities, and personal experiences. Different animals perceive time differently based on their processing speeds, and humans' perception of time flow is subjective and depends on brain activity, speech rate, and memory capacity.

4. When asked about being an optimist or pessimist about humanity, the physicist expresses pessimism due to concerns over humanity's destructive impact on the planet, global warming, and international conflicts. The physicist fears that instead of collaborating, humanity is working against itself and becoming increasingly aggressive toward its own survival. However, the physicist expresses a hope to be proven wrong.
