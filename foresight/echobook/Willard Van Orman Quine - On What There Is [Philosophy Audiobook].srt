00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,300
On What There Is by Willard Van Orman Quine, published in 1948.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,600
A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,040
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,400
What is there?

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,760
It can be answered, moreover, in a wordâ€”everything.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,200
And everyone will accept this answer as true.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,960
However, this is merely to say that there is what there is.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,400
There remains room for disagreement over cases, and so the issue has stayed alive down the

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
centuries.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Suppose now that two philosophers, MacX and I, differ over ontology.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Suppose MacX maintains there is something which I maintain there is not.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,120
MacX can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe our difference of opinion

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,320
by saying that I refuse to recognize certain entities.

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,160
I should protest, of course, that he is wrong in his formulation of our disagreement, for

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,080
I maintain that there are no entities of the kind which he alleges, for me to recognize.

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,560
But my finding him wrong in his formulation of our disagreement is unimportant, for I

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,400
am committed to considering him wrong in his ontology anyway.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,440
When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand, I seem to be in

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,360
a predicament.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,400
I cannot admit that there are some things which MacX countenances and I do not, for,

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,560
in admitting that there are such things, I should be contradicting my own rejection of

22
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,400
them.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,840
It would appear, if this reasoning were sound, that, in any ontological dispute, the proponent

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,440
of the negative side suffers the disadvantage of not being able to admit that his opponent

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,000
disagrees with him.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,560
This is the old platonic riddle of non-being.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,480
Non-being must, in some sense, be.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,440
This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's Beard.

30
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,240
Historically, it is proved tough, frequently dulling the edge of Occam's razor.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,080
It is some such line of thought that leads philosophers like MacX to impute being where

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,600
they might otherwise be quite content to recognize that there is nothing.

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Thus, take Pegasus.

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,600
If Pegasus were not, MacX argues, we should not be talking about anything when we use the

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
word.

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,480
Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,380
Thinking to show thus that the denial of Pegasus cannot be coherently maintained, he concludes

38
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,520
that Pegasus is.

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:44,320
MacX cannot, indeed, quite persuade himself that any region of space-time near or remote

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,600
contains a flying horse of flesh and blood.

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:57,120
Pressed for further details on Pegasus, then, he says that Pegasus is an idea in men's minds.

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Here, however, a confusion begins to be apparent.

43
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,960
We may, for the sake of argument, concede that there is an entity, and even a unique

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,840
entity, though this is rather implausible, which is the mental Pegasus idea.

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,920
But this mental entity is not what people are talking about when they deny Pegasus.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,680
MacX confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon idea.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:38,600
The Parthenon is physical, the Parthenon idea is mental, according anyway to MacX's version

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,000
of ideas, and I have no better to offer.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,280
The Parthenon is visible, the Parthenon idea is invisible.

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,560
We cannot easily imagine two things more unlike, and less liable to confusion, than the Parthenon

51
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
and the Parthenon idea.

52
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,200
But when we shift from the Parthenon to Pegasus, the confusion sets in.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,720
For no other reason than MacX would sooner be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,320
counterfeit than grant the non-being of Pegasus.

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,080
The notion that Pegasus must be, because it would otherwise be nonsense to say even that

56
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:35,640
Pegasus is not, has been seen to lead MacX into an elementary confusion.

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,540
Subtler minds, taking the same precept as their starting point, come out with theories

58
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:49,240
of Pegasus which are less patently misguided than MacX's, and correspondingly more difficult

59
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
to eradicate.

60
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,600
One of these subtler minds is named, let us say, Wyman.

61
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:06,900
Pegasus, Wyman maintains, has his being as an unactualized possible.

62
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,480
When we say of Pegasus that there is no such thing, we are saying more precisely that Pegasus

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,000
does not have the special attribute of actuality.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,320
Saying that Pegasus is not actual is on par, logically, with saying that the Parthenon is

65
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,820
not red.

66
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:37,640
In either case, we are saying something about an entity whose being is unquestioned.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Wyman, by the way, is one of those philosophers who have united in ruining the good old word

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,040
exist.

69
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Despite his espousal of unactualized possibilities, he limits the word existence to actuality,

70
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,560
thus preserving an illusion of ontological agreement between himself and us who repudiate

71
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,320
the rest of his bloated universe.

72
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,320
We have all been prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that we have all been

73
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:20,680
prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that Pegasus does not exist, meaning

74
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,320
simply that there is no such entity at all.

75
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,680
If Pegasus existed, he would indeed be in space and time.

76
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:41,960
But only because the word Pegasus has spatiotemporal connotations, and not because exists has

77
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,160
spatiotemporal connotations.

78
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,960
If spatiotemporal reference is lacking when we affirm the existence of the cube root of

79
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:01,880
twenty-seven, this is simply because a cube root is not a spatiotemporal kind of thing,

80
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,600
and not because we are being ambiguous in our use of exist.

81
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:16,280
However, Wyman, in an ill-conceived effort to appear agreeable, genially grants us the

82
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:24,200
non-existence of Pegasus, and then, contrary to what we meant by non-existence of Pegasus,

83
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,440
insists that Pegasus is.

84
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,880
Existence is one thing, he says, and subsistence is another.

85
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,560
The only way I know of coping with this obfuscation of issues is to give Wyman the word exist.

86
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,400
I'll not try to use it again, I still have is.

87
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,160
So much for lexicography, let's go back to Wyman's ontology.

88
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,100
Wyman's overpopulated universe is, in many ways, unlovely.

89
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,340
It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes, but this is

90
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,980
not the worst of it.

91
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,820
Wyman's slum of possibles is a breeding ground for disorderly elements.

92
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:25,340
Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway, and again, the possible bald

93
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,780
man in that doorway.

94
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,340
Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?

95
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,140
How do we decide?

96
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,460
How many possible men are there in that doorway?

97
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,300
Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?

98
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,860
How many of them are alike?

99
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,500
Or would their being alike make them one?

100
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,900
Are no two possible things alike?

101
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,580
Is this the same as saying that it is impossible for two things to be alike?

102
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:10,860
Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable to unactualized possibles?

103
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,540
But what sense can be found in talking of entities which cannot meaningfully be said

104
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,620
to be identical with themselves and distinct from one another?

105
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,180
These elements are well nigh incorrigible.

106
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:35,900
By a Phragian therapy of individual concepts, some effort might be made at rehabilitation,

107
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:43,740
but I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum and be done with it.

108
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:51,620
Possibility, along with other modalities of necessity and impossibility and contingency,

109
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,020
poses problems upon which I do not mean to imply that we should turn our backs.

110
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:04,460
But we can at least limit modalities to whole statements.

111
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:12,580
We may impose the adverb possibly upon a statement as a whole, and we may well worry about the

112
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:20,620
semantical analysis of such usage, but little real advance in such analysis is to be hoped

113
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,020
for in expanding our universe to include so-called possible entities.

114
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,460
I suspect that the main motive for this expansion is simply the old notion that Pegasus, for

115
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:42,620
example, must be because otherwise it would be nonsense to say even that he is not.

116
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,180
Still, all the rank luxuriance of Wyman's universe of possibles would seem to come to

117
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,820
not when we make a slight change in the example and speak not of Pegasus, but of the round

118
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,780
square cupula on Berkeley College.

119
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:10,900
If unless Pegasus were, it would be nonsense to say that he is not, then by the same token,

120
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,700
unless the round square cupula on Berkeley College were, it would be nonsense to say

121
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,740
that it is not.

122
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:28,340
But unlike Pegasus, the round square cupula on Berkeley College cannot be admitted even

123
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,240
as an unactualized possible.

124
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,100
Can we drive Wyman now to admitting also a realm of unactualizable impossibles?

125
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,200
If so, a good many embarrassing questions could be asked about them.

126
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,100
We might even hope to trap Wyman in contradictions by getting him to admit that certain of these

127
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,980
entities are at once round and square.

128
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:03,180
But the wily Wyman chooses the other horn of the dilemma and concludes that it is nonsense

129
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,960
to say that the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not.

130
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,120
He says that the phrase round square cupula is meaningless.

131
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,760
Wyman was not the first to embrace this alternative.

132
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,800
The doctrine of the meaninglessness of contradictions runs away back.

133
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,400
The tradition survives, moreover, in writers who seem to share none of Wyman's motivations.

134
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,120
Still, I wonder whether the first temptation to such a doctrine may not have been substantially

135
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,920
the motivation which we have observed in Wyman.

136
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:53,880
Certainly, the doctrine has no intrinsic appeal, and it has led its devotees to such quixotic

137
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,480
extremes as that of challenging the method of proof by reductio ad absurdum, a challenge

138
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,000
in which I sense a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine itself.

139
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Moreover, the doctrine of meaninglessness of contradictions has the severe methodological

140
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:21,000
drawback that it makes it impossible, in principle, ever to devise an effective test of what is

141
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,600
meaningful and what is not.

142
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,560
It would be forever impossible for us to devise systematic ways of deciding whether a string

143
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:39,840
of signs made sense, even to us individually, let alone other people, or not.

144
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,080
For it follows from a discovery in mathematical logic, due to church, that there can be no

145
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,280
generally applicable test of contradictoryness.

146
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:58,040
I have spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard, and hinted that it is tangled.

147
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,720
I have dwelt at length on the inconveniences of putting up with it.

148
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
It is time to think about taking steps.

149
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,480
Russell, in his theory of so-called singular descriptions, showed clearly how we might

150
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,280
meaningfully use seeming names without supposing that there be entities allegedly named.

151
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,560
The names to which Russell's theory directly applies are complex, descriptive names, such

152
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:35,000
as the author of Waverly, the present king of France, the round square cupula on Berkeley

153
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
College.

154
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Russell analyses such phrases systematically as fragments of the whole sentences in which

155
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
they occur.

156
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:55,200
The sentence, the author of Waverly was a poet, for example, is explained as a whole as meaning

157
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:05,320
someone, better, something, wrote Waverly, and was a poet, and nothing else wrote Waverly.

158
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,400
The point of this added clause is to affirm the uniqueness, which is implicit in the word

159
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,080
the, in the author of Waverly.

160
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:22,440
The sentence, the round square cupula on Berkeley College is pink, is explained as something

161
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:30,320
is round and square, and is a cupula on Berkeley College, and is pink, and nothing else is round

162
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,400
and square and a cupula on Berkeley College.

163
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:43,720
The virtue of this analysis is that the seeming name, a descriptive phrase, is paraphrased

164
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,240
in context as a so-called incomplete symbol.

165
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,920
No unified expression is offered as an analysis of the descriptive phrase, but the statement

166
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,480
as a whole, which was the context of that phrase, still gets its full quota of meaning,

167
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,800
whether true or false.

168
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,680
The unanalyzed statement, the author of Waverly was a poet, contains a part, the author of

169
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:20,240
Waverly, which is wrongly supposed by McEx and Wyman, to demand objective reference

170
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,320
in order to be meaningful at all.

171
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,040
But in Russell's translation, something wrote Waverly and was a poet, and nothing else

172
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:37,520
wrote Waverly, the burden of objective reference, which had been put upon the descriptive phrase,

173
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,160
is now taken over by words of the kind that logicians call bound variables, variables

174
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:53,680
of quantification, namely words like something, nothing, everything.

175
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,600
These words, far from purporting to be names specifically of the author of Waverly, do

176
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
not purport to be names at all.

177
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:12,560
They refer to entities generally, with a kind of studied ambiguity peculiar to themselves.

178
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:20,920
These quantificational words or bound variables are, of course, a basic part of language,

179
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,480
and their meaningfulness, at least in context, is not to be challenged.

180
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,880
But their meaningfulness in no way presupposes there being either the author of Waverly or

181
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:43,080
the round square cupula on Berkeley College or any other specifically pre-assigned objects.

182
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,280
Where descriptions are concerned, there is no longer any difficulty in affirming or denying

183
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,960
being.

184
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,600
There is the author of Waverly, is explained by Russell as meaning someone, or more strictly

185
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,760
something, wrote Waverly and nothing else wrote Waverly.

186
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,880
The author of Waverly is not, is explained correspondingly as the alternation, either

187
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,080
each thing failed to write Waverly or two or more things wrote Waverly.

188
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,760
This alternation is false, but meaningful, and it contains no expression purporting to

189
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,040
name the author of Waverly.

190
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:40,240
The statement the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not, is analyzed in similar fashion.

191
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,640
So the old notion that statements of non-being defeat themselves goes by the board.

192
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,280
When a statement of being or non-being is analyzed by Russell's theory of descriptions,

193
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,680
it ceases to contain any expression which even purports to name the alleged entity whose

194
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,200
being is in question, so that the meaningfulness of the statement no longer can be thought

195
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,360
to presuppose that there be such an entity.

196
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,280
Now what of Pegasus?

197
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,080
This being a word rather than a descriptive phrase, Russell's argument does not immediately

198
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,960
apply to it.

199
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,720
However, it can easily be made to apply.

200
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,120
We have only to rephrase Pegasus as a description in any way that seems adequately to single

201
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:43,120
out our idea, say, the winged horse that was captured by Balerophon.

202
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,600
Substituting such a phrase for Pegasus, we can then proceed to analyze the statement

203
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Pegasus is or Pegasus is not, precisely on the analogy of Russell's analysis of the

204
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,040
author of Waverly is and the author of Waverly is not.

205
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,680
In order thus to subsume a one-word name or a legend name such as Pegasus under Russell's

206
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:18,080
theory of description, we must, of course, be able first to translate the word into a

207
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,720
description.

208
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,040
But this is no real restriction.

209
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:30,800
If the notion of Pegasus had been so obscure or so basic a one that no pat translation

210
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,560
into a descriptive phrase had offered itself along familiar lines, we could still have

211
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,520
availed ourselves of the following artificial and trivial seeming device.

212
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:51,040
We could have appealed to the ex-hypothesis unanalyzable, irreducible attribute of being

213
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:59,600
Pegasus, adopting for its expression the verb is Pegasus or Pegasizes.

214
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:07,040
The noun Pegasus itself could then be treated as derivative and identified, after all, with

215
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:15,160
a description, the thing that is Pegasus, the thing that Pegasizes.

216
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,400
If the importing of such a predicate as Pegasizes seems to commit us to recognizing that there

217
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,560
is a corresponding attribute Pegasizing in Plato's heaven or in the minds of men, well

218
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:39,380
and good, neither we nor Wyman nor MacX could have been contending thus far about the being

219
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,840
or non-being of universals, but rather about that of Pegasus.

220
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,880
If in terms of Pegasizing we can interpret the noun Pegasus as a description, subject

221
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,440
to Russell's theory of descriptions, then we have disposed of the old notion that Pegasus

222
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,520
cannot be said not to be without presupposing that in some sense Pegasus is.

223
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,560
Our argument is now quite general.

224
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:19,040
MacX and Wyman supposed that we could not meaningfully affirm a statement of the form

225
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:27,040
so-and-so is not, with a simple or descriptive singular noun in place of so-and-so unless

226
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
so-and-so is.

227
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:38,440
This supposition is now seen to be quite generally groundless, since the singular noun in question

228
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:46,480
can always be expanded into a singular description, trivially or otherwise, and then analyzed out

229
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,640
of Russell.

230
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,580
We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing numbers when we say there are prime numbers

231
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,600
larger than a million.

232
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,000
We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing centars when we say there are centars.

233
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,840
And we commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus when we say Pegasus is.

234
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:19,480
But we do not commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus or the author of Waverly or the round

235
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,640
square cupula on Berkeley College when we say that Pegasus or the author of Waverly

236
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,160
or the cupula in question is not.

237
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,240
We need no longer labor under the delusion that the meaningfulness of a statement containing

238
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,440
a singular term presupposes an entity named by the term.

239
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,800
A singular term need not name to be significant.

240
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:56,800
An inkling of this might have dawned on Wyman and McEx even without benefit of Russell if

241
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:06,600
they had only noticed, as so few of us do, that there is a gulf between meaning and naming.

242
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,360
Even in the case of a singular term, which is genuinely a name of an object, the following

243
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,040
example from Frege will serve.

244
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:25,360
The phrase evening star names a certain large physical object of spherical form which is

245
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,280
hurtling through space some scores of millions of miles from here.

246
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,760
The phrase morning star names the same thing, as was probably first established by some

247
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,880
observant Babylonian, but the two phrases cannot be regarded as having the same meaning.

248
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,560
Otherwise, that Babylonian could have dispensed with his observations and contented himself

249
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,800
with reflecting on the meanings of his words.

250
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,440
The meanings then, being different from one another, must be other than the named object,

251
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,160
which is one and the same in both cases.

252
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,960
Confusion of meaning with naming not only made McEx think he could not meaningfully repudiate

253
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,240
Pegasus, a continuing confusion of meaning with naming no doubt helped and gender his

254
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,240
absurd notion that Pegasus is an idea, a mental entity.

255
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
The structure of his confusion is as follows.

256
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:43,160
He confused the alleged named object Pegasus with the meaning of the word Pegasus, therefore

257
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,160
concluding that Pegasus must be in order that the word have meaning.

258
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,040
But what sorts of things are meanings?

259
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,440
This is a moot point, however, one might quite plausibly explain meanings as ideas in the

260
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,040
mind, supposing we can make clear sense in turn of the idea of ideas in the mind.

261
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:16,880
Or Pegasus, initially confused with a meaning, ends up as an idea in the mind.

262
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,960
It is the more remarkable that Wyman, subject to the same initial motivation as McEx, should

263
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,960
have avoided this particular blunder and wound up with unactualized possibles instead.

264
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Now let us return to the ontological problem of universals.

265
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:45,160
The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,

266
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:53,160
functions, McEx, characteristically enough, thinks there are.

267
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,720
Speaking of attributes, he says, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

268
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,880
This much is pre-philosophical common sense in which we must all agree.

269
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,000
These houses, roses, and sunsets, then, have something in common, and this, which they

270
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,640
have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.

271
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,880
For McEx, thus, their being attributes is even more obvious and trivial than the obvious

272
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,680
and trivial fact of their being red houses, roses, and sunsets.

273
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:41,720
This, I think, is characteristic of metaphysics, or at least of that part of metaphysics called

274
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,480
ontology.

275
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,920
One who regards a statement on the subject as true at all must regard it as trivially

276
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,960
true.

277
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,480
One's ontology is basic to the conceptual scheme by which he interprets all experiences,

278
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,040
even the most commonplace ones.

279
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,920
Within some particular conceptual scheme, and how else is judgment possible, an ontological

280
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:18,880
statement goes without saying, standing in need of no separate justification at all.

281
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,720
Ontological statements follow immediately from all manner of causal statements of commonplace

282
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,960
fact, just as, from the point of view anyway of McEx's conceptual scheme, there is an

283
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:41,440
attribute, follows from, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

284
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:49,040
Judged in another conceptual scheme, an ontological statement which is axiomatic to McEx's mind

285
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:56,440
may, with equal immediacy and triviality, be a judged false.

286
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:03,760
One may admit that there are red houses, roses, and sunsets, but deny, except as a popular

287
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,480
and misleading manner of speaking, that they have anything in common.

288
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:18,160
The words, houses, roses, and sunsets are true of sundry individual entities which are

289
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:26,440
houses and roses and sunsets, and the word red, or red object, is true of each of sundry

290
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,040
individual entities which are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

291
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:39,560
But there is not, in addition, any entity whatever, individual or otherwise, which is

292
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:51,400
named by the word redness, nor, for that matter, by the word househood, rosehood, sunsethood.

293
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,760
That the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and

294
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,040
irreducible, and it may be held that McEx is no better off, in point of real explanatory

295
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:15,400
power, for all the occult entities which he posits under such names as redness.

296
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,680
One means by which McEx might naturally have tried to impose his ontology of universals

297
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:28,120
on us was already removed before we turn to the problem of universals.

298
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:35,720
McEx cannot argue that predicates such as red or is red, which we all concur in using,

299
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,520
must be regarded as names, each of a single universal entity, in order that they be meaningful

300
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,600
at all.

301
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:53,240
For we have seen that being a name of something is much more special feature than being meaningful.

302
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,120
He cannot even charge us, at least not by that argument, with having posited an attribute

303
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,400
of Pegasizing by our adoption of the predicate Pegasizes.

304
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,040
However, McEx hits upon a different stratagem.

305
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:18,680
Let us grant, he says, this distinction between meaning and naming of which you make so much.

306
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Let us even grant that is red, Pegasizes, etc., are not names of attributes.

307
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,520
Still, you admit they have meanings, but these meanings, whether they are named or not,

308
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:40,200
are still universals, and I venture to say that some of them might even be the very

309
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,720
things that I call attributes, or something to much the same purpose in the end.

310
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:55,080
For McEx, this is an unusually penetrating speech, and the only way I know to counter

311
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,880
it is by refusing to admit meanings.

312
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:06,600
However, I feel no reluctance towards refusing to admit meanings, for I do not thereby deny

313
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,800
that words and statements are meaningful.

314
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:17,080
McEx and I may agree to the letter in our classification of linguistic forms into the

315
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:24,200
meaningful and the meaningless, even though McEx construes meaningfulness as the having,

316
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,440
in some sense of having, of some abstract entity which he calls a meaning, whereas I do not.

317
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:41,000
I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful,

318
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:49,000
or significant, as I prefer to say, so as not to invite hypostasis of meanings as entities,

319
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:58,760
is an ultimate and irreducible matter of fact, or I may undertake to analyze it in terms

320
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,560
directly of what people do in the presence of the linguistic utterance in question,

321
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,760
and other utterances similar to it.

322
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:17,080
The useful ways in which people ordinarily talk or seem to talk about meanings boil down to two,

323
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:26,040
the having of meanings, which is significance, and sameness of meaning, or synonymy.

324
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:35,480
What is called giving the meaning of an utterance is simply the uttering of a synonym couched ordinarily

325
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:44,040
in clearer language than the original. If we are allergic to meanings as such, we can speak directly

326
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:54,600
of utterances as significant or insignificant, and as synonymous or heteronymous, one with another.

327
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,200
The problem of explaining these adjectives significant and synonymous with some degree

328
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,880
of clarity and rigor, preferably as I see it in terms of behavior, is as difficult as it is

329
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:20,600
important. But the explanatory value of special and irreducible intermediary entities called

330
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:32,520
meanings is surely illusory. Up to now, I have argued that we can use singular terms significantly

331
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,080
in sentences without presupposing that there are entities which those terms purport to name.

332
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:48,040
I have argued further that we can use general terms, for example predicates, without conceding

333
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:56,200
them to be names of abstract entities. I have argued further that we can view utterances as

334
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:05,640
significant, and as synonymous, or heteronymous, with one another, without countenancing a realm

335
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:14,760
of entities called meanings. At this point, mcx begins to wonder whether there is any limit at all

336
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,440
to our ontological immunity. Does nothing we may say commit us to the assumption of universals,

337
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:30,040
or other entities which we may find unwelcome? I have already suggested a negative answer to

338
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:37,080
this question, in speaking of bound variables, or variables of quantification, in connection with

339
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:44,920
Russell's theory of descriptions. We can very easily involve ourselves in ontological commitments

340
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:53,400
by saying, for example, that there is something, bound variable, which red houses and sunsets

341
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:01,160
have in common, or that there is something which is a prime number larger than a million.

342
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:10,440
But this is essentially the only way we can involve ourselves in ontological commitments,

343
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:19,640
by our use of bound variables. The use of alleged names is no criterion, for we can repudiate their

344
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:26,920
namehood at the drop of a hat, unless the assumption of a corresponding entity can be spotted in the

345
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:36,040
things we affirm in terms of bound variables. Names are, in fact, altogether immaterial to the

346
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:43,880
ontological issue, for I have shown, in connection with Pegasus and Pegasize, that names can be

347
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,040
converted to descriptions, and Russell has shown that descriptions can be eliminated.

348
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,360
Whatever we say with the help of names can be said in a language which shuns names altogether.

349
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:06,680
To be assumed as an entity is, purely and simply, to be reckoned as the value of a variable.

350
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,640
In terms of the categories of traditional grammar, this amounts roughly to saying that

351
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:24,200
to be is to be in the range of reference of a pronoun. Pronouns are the basic media of reference.

352
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,120
Nouns might better have been named pronouns. The variables of quantification,

353
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,960
something, nothing, everything, range over our whole ontology, whatever it may be,

354
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,480
and we are convinced of a particular ontological presupposition if, and only if,

355
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:56,600
the alleged presuppositum has to be reckoned among the entities over which our variables range

356
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:06,520
in order to render one of our affirmations true. We may say, for example, that some dogs are white

357
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,480
and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood or whiteness as entities.

358
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:23,560
Some dogs are white says that some things that are dogs are white, and in order that this statement

359
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:32,360
be true, the things over which the bound variable something ranges must include some white dogs,

360
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:40,600
but need not include dogness or whiteness. On the other hand, when we say that some

361
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,960
zoological species are cross-fertile, we are committing ourselves to recognizing as entities

362
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:55,000
the several species themselves, abstract though they are. We remain so committed,

363
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,560
at least until we devise some way of so paraphrasing the statement,

364
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,280
as to show that the seeming reference to species on the part of our bound variable

365
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:13,000
was unavoidable manner of speaking. Classical mathematics, as the example of

366
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,520
primes larger than a million clearly illustrates, is up to its neck in commitments to an ontology

367
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:28,120
of abstract entities. Thus it is that the great medieval controversy over universals

368
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:36,440
has flared up anew in the modern philosophy of mathematics. The issue is clearer now than of old

369
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,800
because we now have a more explicit standard whereby to decide what ontology a given theory

370
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:54,120
or form of discourse is committed to. A theory is committed to those and only those entities to which

371
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:02,120
the bound variables of the theory must be capable of referring in order that the affirmations made

372
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:12,120
in the theory be true. Because this standard of ontological presupposition did not emerge clearly

373
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:18,680
in the philosophical tradition, the modern philosophical mathematicians have not on the whole

374
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:25,720
recognized that they were debating the same old problem of universals in a newly clarified form.

375
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:34,040
But the fundamental cleavages among modern points of view on foundations of mathematics

376
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,600
do come down pretty explicitly to disagreements as to the range of entities to which the bound

377
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,080
variables should be permitted to refer. The three main medieval points of view regarding

378
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:59,800
universals are designated by historians as realism, conceptualism, and nominalism. Essentially,

379
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,280
these same three doctrines reappear in 20th century surveys of the philosophy of mathematics

380
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,200
under the new names, logicism, intuitionism, and formalism.

381
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,120
Realism, as the word is used in connection with the medieval controversy over universals,

382
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,840
is the platonic doctrine that universals or abstract entities have being independently of the mind.

383
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:43,880
The mind may discover them but cannot create them. Logicism, represented by Frege, Russell,

384
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:52,360
Whitehead, Church, and Carnap condones the use of bound variables to refer to abstract entities

385
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,960
known and unknown, specifiable and unspecifiable indiscriminately.

386
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:09,880
Conceptualism holds that there are universals but they are mind-made. Intuitionism, espoused in

387
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:19,880
modern times in one form or another by PoincarÃ©, Brower, Veil, and others, countenances the use

388
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:28,920
of bound variables to refer to abstract entities only when those entities are capable of being

389
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,920
cooked up individually from ingredients specified in advance. As Frankel has put it,

390
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:45,960
logicism holds that classes are discovered while intuitionism holds that they are invented.

391
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,680
A fair statement indeed of the old opposition between realism and conceptualism.

392
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:02,440
This opposition is no mere quibble. It makes an essential difference in the amount of classical

393
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:12,440
mathematics to which one is willing to subscribe. Logicists or realists are able on their assumptions

394
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:20,760
to get Cantor's ascending orders of infinity. Intuitionists are compelled to stop with the

395
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:28,360
lowest order of infinity and as an indirect consequence to abandon even some of the classical

396
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:37,960
laws of real numbers. The modern controversy between logicism and intuitionism arose, in fact,

397
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:47,720
from disagreements over infinity. Formalism, associated with the name of Hilbert, echoes

398
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:55,320
intuitionism in deploring the logicist unbridled recourse to universals. But

399
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:05,320
formalism also finds intuitionism unsatisfactory. This could happen for either of two opposite

400
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:13,400
reasons. The formalist might, like the logicist, object to the crippling of classical mathematics.

401
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:22,440
Or he might, like the nominalists of old, object to admitting abstract entities at all,

402
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:32,200
even in the restrained sense of mind-made entities. The upshot is the same. The formalist

403
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:39,960
keeps classical mathematics as a play of insignificant notations. This play of notations

404
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,760
can still be of utility, whatever utility it has already shown itself to have as a crutch

405
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:55,640
for physicists and technologists. But utility need not imply significance in any literal

406
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:03,320
linguistic sense. Nor need the marked success of mathematicians in spinning out theorems,

407
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,480
and in finding objective basis for agreement with one another's results, imply significance.

408
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:17,480
For an adequate basis for agreement among mathematicians can be found simply in the rules

409
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:25,320
which govern the manipulation of the notations. These syntactical rules being, unlike the

410
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:33,720
notations themselves, quite significant and intelligible. I have argued that the sort of

411
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:41,320
ontology we adopt can be consequential, notably in connection with mathematics, although this

412
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:51,720
is only an example. Now, how are we to adjudicate among rival ontologies? Certainly, the answer

413
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:58,520
is not provided by the semantical formula to be is to be the value of a variable.

414
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,600
This formula serves, rather conversely, in testing the conformity of a given remark

415
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:15,160
or doctrine to a prior ontological standard. We look to bound variables in connection with ontology,

416
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:23,080
not in order to know what there is, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine,

417
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:33,480
ours or someone else's, says there is. And this much is quite properly a problem involving language,

418
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:43,240
but what there is is another question. In debating over what there is, there are still

419
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:50,760
reasons for operating on a semantical plane. One reason is to escape from the predicament

420
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,640
noted at the beginning of this essay, the predicament of my not being able to admit

421
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:07,080
that there are things which MacX countenances and I do not. So long as I adhere to my ontology,

422
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:15,320
as opposed to MacX's, I cannot allow my bound variables to refer to entities which belong

423
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:24,680
to MacX's ontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently describe our disagreement

424
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:32,520
by characterizing the statements which MacX affirms, provided merely that my ontology

425
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,760
countenances linguistic forms, or at least concrete inscriptions and utterances,

426
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:46,840
I can talk about MacX's sentences. Another reason for withdrawing to a semantical plane

427
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:56,360
is to find common ground on which to argue. Disagreement in ontology involves basic disagreement

428
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,920
in conceptual schemes, yet MacX and I, despite these basic disagreements,

429
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,360
find that our conceptual schemes converge sufficiently in their intermediate and upper

430
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:17,480
ramifications to enable us to communicate successfully on topics such as politics,

431
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:27,560
weather, and, in particular, language. Insofar as our basic controversy over ontology

432
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,720
can be translated upward into a semantical controversy about words and what to do with them,

433
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,480
the collapse of the controversy into question begging may be delayed.

434
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,920
It is no wonder, then, that ontological controversy should tend into controversy over

435
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:57,000
language, but we must not jump to the conclusion that what there is depends on words. Translate

436
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,600
ability of a question into semantical terms is no indication that the question is linguistic.

437
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:12,520
To see Naples is to bear a name which, when prefixed to the words C's Naples,

438
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:20,520
yields a true sentence. Still, there is nothing linguistic about seeing Naples.

439
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:31,320
Our acceptance of an ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our acceptance of a

440
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:41,960
scientific theory, say a system of physics. We adopt, at least insofar as we are reasonable,

441
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:49,080
the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of raw experience

442
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:57,640
can be fitted and arranged. Our ontology is determined once we have fixed upon the

443
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,320
overall conceptual scheme which is to accommodate science in the broadest sense,

444
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,960
and the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of any part of that

445
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:17,640
conceptual scheme, for example, the biological or the physical part, are not different in kind

446
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,680
from the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of the whole.

447
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:29,960
To whatever extent the adoption of any system of scientific theory may be said to be a matter

448
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:37,240
of language, the same, but no more, may be said of the adoption of an ontology.

449
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:46,680
But simplicity as a guiding principle in constructing conceptual schemes is not a clear

450
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:57,640
and unambiguous idea, and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.

451
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:06,680
Imagine, for example, that we have devised the most economical set of concepts adequate to the

452
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:15,720
play-by-play reporting of immediate experience. The entities under this scheme, the values of

453
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:24,680
bound variables, are, let us suppose, individual subjective events of sensation or reflection.

454
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:34,040
We should still find, no doubt, that a physicalistic conceptual scheme purporting to talk about

455
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:40,520
external objects offers great advantages in simplifying our overall reports.

456
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:48,280
By bringing together scattered sense events and treating them as perceptions of one object,

457
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:56,040
we reduce the complexity of our stream of experience to a manageable conceptual simplicity.

458
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:03,400
The rule of simplicity is indeed our guiding maxim in assigning sense data to objects.

459
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,680
We associate an earlier and a later round-sensum with the same so-called penny,

460
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:18,440
or with two different so-called pennies, in obedience to the demands of maximum simplicity

461
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,680
in our total world picture.

462
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:34,040
Here we have two competing conceptual schemes, a phenomenalistic one and a physicalistic one,

463
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:44,040
which should prevail. Each has its advantages. Each has its special simplicity in its own way.

464
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:53,000
Each, I suggest, deserves to be developed. Each may be said, indeed, to be the more fundamental,

465
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:02,280
though in different senses. The one is epistemologically, the other physically fundamental.

466
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:11,400
The physical conceptual scheme simplifies our account of experience because of the way

467
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,240
myriad scattered sense events come to be associated with single so-called objects.

468
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:25,240
Still, there is no likelihood that each sentence about physical objects can actually be translated,

469
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,320
however deviously and complexly, into the phenomenalistic language.

470
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:41,160
Physical objects are postulated entities, which round out and simplify our account of the flux

471
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:48,920
of experience, just as the introduction of irrational numbers simplifies laws of arithmetic.

472
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,520
From the point of view of the conceptual scheme of the elementary arithmetic of

473
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:03,400
rational numbers alone, the broader arithmetic of rational and irrational numbers would have

474
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:10,840
the status of a convenient myth, simpler than the literal truth, namely the arithmetic of

475
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:20,120
rationals, and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part. Similarly, from a

476
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:27,080
phenomenalistic point of view, the conceptual scheme of physical objects is a convenient myth,

477
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:34,280
simpler than the literal truth and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part.

478
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,320
Now, what of classes or attributes of physical objects, in turn?

479
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:49,960
A Platonistic ontology of this sort is, from the point of view of a strictly physicalistic

480
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:58,840
conceptual scheme, as much a myth as that physicalistic conceptual scheme itself is for phenomenalism.

481
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:09,480
This higher myth is a good and useful one, in turn, insofar as it simplifies our account of physics.

482
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:17,560
Since mathematics is an integral part of this higher myth, the utility of this myth for physical

483
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:25,880
science is evident enough. In speaking of it nevertheless as a myth, I echo that philosophy

484
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:35,000
of mathematics to which I alluded earlier under the name of formalism. But an attitude of formalism

485
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:42,440
may with equal justice be adopted toward the physical conceptual scheme, in turn, by the pure

486
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:51,320
ascete or phenomenalist. The analogy between the myth of mathematics and the myth of physics is,

487
00:56:52,040 --> 00:57:00,040
in some additional and perhaps fortuitous ways, strikingly close. Consider, for example,

488
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,400
the crisis which was precipitated in the foundations of mathematics at the turn of

489
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:11,640
the century by the discovery of Russell's paradox and other antinomies of set theory.

490
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:21,960
These contradictions had to be obviated by unintuitive ad hoc devices. Our mathematical

491
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:31,880
myth making became deliberate and evident to all. But what of physics? An antinomy rose between the

492
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,520
undular and corpuscular accounts of light, and if this was not as out and out a contradiction

493
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:46,280
as Russell's paradox, I suspect that the reason is that physics is not as out and out as mathematics.

494
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:55,640
Again, the second great modern crisis in the foundations of mathematics, precipitated in 1931

495
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,680
by Gertl's prove that there are bound to be undecidable statements in arithmetic,

496
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,480
has its companion piece in physics, in Heisenberg's indeterminancy principle.

497
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:16,680
In earlier pages, I undertook to show that some common arguments in favor of certain ontologies

498
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:23,960
are fallacious. Further, I advanced an explicit standard whereby to decide what the ontological

499
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:31,800
commitments of a theory are. But the question what ontology actually to adopt still stands open,

500
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,600
and the obvious counsel is tolerance and an experimental spirit.

501
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:44,280
Let us by all means see how much of the physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a

502
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:53,480
phenomenalistic one. Still, physics also naturally demands pursuing, irreducible in Toto, though it

503
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:02,200
may be. Let us see how, or to what degree, natural science may be rendered independent

504
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:10,040
of Platonistic mathematics. But let us also pursue mathematics and delve into its Platonistic

505
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:17,800
foundations. From among the various conceptual schemes best suited to these various pursuits,

506
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:28,600
one, the phenomenalistic, claims epistemological priority. Viewed from within the phenomenalistic

507
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:36,120
conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects and mathematical objects are myths.

508
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:46,040
The quality of myth, however, is relative. Relative, in this case, to the epistemological

509
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:55,800
point of view. This point of view is one among various, corresponding to one among our various

510
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:05,560
interests and purposes.
