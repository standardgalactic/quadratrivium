 The passage discusses the relationship between two competing conceptual schemes for understanding reality: phenomenalism (focused on direct experience) and physicalism (focused on material objects and physical laws). The author suggests that both schemes have their advantages and are fundamental in different ways—epistemologically for phenomenalism and physically for physicalism.

Key points include:

1. **Phenomenalism**: This is the view that all we can know are our sensory experiences. It simplifies the account of experience by associating scattered sense events with single objects, much like how irrational numbers simplify arithmetic by filling gaps between rational numbers.

2. **Physicalism**: This is the view that reality is fundamentally composed of physical objects and forces. It simplifies our understanding of experience by postulating these entities to organize our sensory data. Like the introduction of irrational numbers, physical objects are postulated to make the account more coherent, even if they cannot be directly observed.

3. **Classes or Attributes**: Both phenomenalism and physicalism can be seen as "myths" in a non-pejorative sense—useful fictions that simplify our understanding of a more complex reality. This includes the mathematical concepts that underpin much of physics.

4. **Mathematics as Myth**: The author compares both phenomenalism and physicalism to myths, drawing an analogy with the formalist view of mathematics, where mathematical truths are considered "myths" that we accept for their utility in organizing our experiences rather than for their correspondence to an external reality.

5. **Crises in Foundations**: The author points out that both physics and mathematics have faced crises (like the antinomies in set theory and Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle) that highlight the provisional nature of these conceptual schemes.

6. **Ontological Tolerance**: The author advocates for an experimental approach to adopting ontologies, suggesting that we should be open to reducing aspects of physicalism to phenomenalism where possible and exploring the independence of natural science from Platonistic mathematics.

7. **Epistemological Priority**: Phenomenalism is presented as having epistemological priority because it relates directly to our sensory experiences, while physicalism has ontological priority because it is fundamental to the practice of science.

In summary, the author argues for a pragmatic and tolerant approach to understanding reality, recognizing that both phenomenalism and physicalism are useful conceptual schemes with their own domains of applicability. Mathematics, which underpins much of physics, is also treated as a useful fiction or myth. The true nature of reality may be beyond direct comprehension, but our conceptual frameworks help us navigate and make sense of the world around us.
