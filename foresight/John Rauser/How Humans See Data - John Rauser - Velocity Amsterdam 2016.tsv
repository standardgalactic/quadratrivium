0	11200	Yeah, so I'm John Rouser, I'm here to talk to you today about how humans see data.
11200	17960	So this is a talk about visualization, which is taking raw data, numbers, and labels, and
17960	22180	turning it into images for the purposes of communication.
22180	25400	So that is a super important idea, so I will say it again.
25400	31080	The act of creating a visualization is fundamentally an act of communication.
31080	38080	Your goal with a visualization is to make new ideas appear in the heads of other people.
38080	41600	More specifically, this is a talk about how to make better visualizations.
41600	47320	I want to make you better at helping humans solve analytical problems quickly and accurately
47320	49000	with visualization.
49000	54560	I want to make you more effective at getting ideas into other people's heads.
54560	60760	I feel like I should start by justifying visualization as a technique in the first place.
60760	63760	Some people say, well, you don't really need visualizations because you can communicate
63760	71200	just a tremendous amount of information using tables of data, like the stock listings page.
71200	73000	So we'll do a little exercise.
73000	76920	Here's some data, 24 points each with an X and a Y value.
76920	80560	You are a very clever audience, so I'm certain that if I let you work at it for just a little
80560	85400	bit, you'd figure out what the relationship is between X and Y, but if I just show you
85400	88200	this, it's immediately obvious.
88200	94880	So what just happened in your head happened in about 250 milliseconds without any conscious
94880	95880	effort.
95880	99760	In fact, there is no way that you can stop it from happening.
99760	105280	Your eyes are a direct high bandwidth channel directly into your brain.
105280	110920	You recognize this as a circle because of what's called pre-attentive processing, which
110920	116240	is the subconscious accumulation of information from the environment.
116240	122160	And the best visualizations, they make the information that you want to communicate available
122160	127800	pre-attentively so that the user doesn't even have to think about what they are seeing.
127800	132600	That's not always possible, but it's what you should be striving for.
132600	138360	And the point, really, of this little exercise is that a graph is an encoding of data, which
138360	146000	is to say that this table and this chart contain the exact same information, but in this display,
146000	151200	the information is encoded in a way that makes it accessible to your incredibly powerful
151200	153160	visual system.
153160	155560	But not all encodings are equally good.
155560	160560	So here I've mapped the X value to position on the horizontal axis and the Y value to
160560	162320	position on the vertical axis.
162320	163320	That choice has a name.
163320	165600	This is called a scatter plot.
165600	167360	But I could have made different choices.
167360	172360	I could have taken the exact same data and treated it as an ordered sequence and then
172360	175120	plotted two lines like this.
175120	180280	So this is the same data, but now it's not at all obvious what the relationship is.
180280	186040	So this is akin to a time series plot, which is ubiquitous, of course, in operational dashboards.
186040	191880	The time series plot is incredibly useful if time is critical to the analysis, which
191880	194360	may or may not be the case.
194360	196800	It's certainly not the case here.
196800	202800	So a good reason to visualize is that it can make salient features of the data available
202800	206080	pre-attentively without any effort at all.
206080	209600	Good visualizations optimize for the human visual system.
209600	213640	If that's true, then it seems like it'd be really good to know how the human visual
213640	219080	system works or more precisely how the human visual system decodes a graph.
219080	223520	The good news is that there's been a lot of research into this question, and what I want
223520	228040	to do now is I want to walk you through some of that research using a framework that comes
228040	229600	from this book.
229600	234600	So Bill Cleveland did some of the most important original research in this area, and this book
234600	238440	summarizes that research into a coherent framework.
238440	245000	One of the most important parts of that framework is what he calls the three visual operations
245000	246760	of pattern perception.
246760	248000	So I'll define them.
248000	249600	First, detection.
249600	256520	Detection is the visual recognition that a geometric object encodes a physical value.
256520	262800	Assembly then is the grouping of detected graphical elements, and estimation is the visual
262800	268920	assessment of the relative magnitude of two or more quantitative physical values.
268920	272600	So I'm going to go through these, but I want to go through them in reverse order.
272600	278480	I want to start with estimation, because that's where I see people making the most mistakes.
278480	283880	So Cleveland lays out three different levels of estimation, where one level down in sort
283880	285200	of this hierarchy of concepts.
285200	288240	So we're going to talk about three different levels of estimation.
288240	291720	The first is discrimination, where all you can do is just tell that two values are or
291720	293040	aren't the same.
293040	296000	Next is ranking, where you can impose some order on the values.
296000	300840	And then the last one is ratioing, where you can say with some precision what the ratio
300840	303920	between two values is.
303920	308320	Notice that all of these involve comparison.
308320	315640	Efficient comparison between different data points is nearly always the point of a visualization.
315640	321520	If I just wanted to report the individual data without comparison or any further analysis,
321520	325400	then a simple table would be completely fine or maybe better just like a USB key with the
325400	326880	data.
326880	331120	But when you're trying to think with data, you are always making comparisons.
331120	337040	As Edward Tufty says, a famous writer about information visualization, he says at the
337040	342600	heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question as compared to what.
342600	347320	So when we're making a visualization, what we want to do is to get as far down this list
347320	352280	as possible with efficiency and with accuracy.
352280	357160	Some of the best research on this question is summarized in this amazing paper by Cleveland
357160	358160	and McGill.
358160	361000	You can get this online for free.
361000	367040	This paper is a treasure trove of insight, but I want to focus on one little table.
367040	368760	I see people like getting out their phones.
368760	369760	They want to take a photo.
369760	372720	I'm going to tweet slides afterwards, so don't worry about it.
372720	373720	Sorry.
373720	375480	Look, there it is.
375480	376480	You want to take a photo?
376480	377480	Awesome.
377480	383120	So I want to focus on this one little table buried on the third page of the report because
383120	388000	I want to claim that this table might be the single most important thing that you can possibly
388000	389920	know about visualizing data.
389920	396080	What this table shows is how accurate humans are at estimating quantities that are encoded
396080	397080	in different ways.
397080	400040	So here's the table in a more readable format.
400040	405280	What Cleveland is doing here is he's giving us seven different ways to encode a quantitative
405280	410440	value, and he ranks them from most effective to least effective.
410440	414720	We are most accurate when decoding position on a common scale and least accurate when
414720	416560	decoding hue.
416560	421200	And what you should do when you're making a graphic is think, what is the most important
421200	424560	comparison that I want the user to make?
424560	429320	Whatever that is, you should encode that thing using position on a common scale.
429320	434060	As you pack more and more different dimensions of data into the same chart, you have to go
434060	437060	further down this list, you're just forced to.
437060	441140	If you have several different comparisons, all of which are very important, and you might
441140	443460	have to make multiple charts.
443460	447660	What I want to do now is I want to take you through these in order, in order to give you
447660	450180	an intuitive sense for how they work.
450180	453340	So I'll start with hue, and we'll work our way up.
453340	458460	Before I can even get started, I need to talk about how color works because human color
458460	461220	perception is incredibly complicated.
461220	466940	As Tamara Munzner says, the first rule of color is do not talk about color because color
466940	468620	is not a single thing.
468620	470620	Color is really three things.
470620	475260	There are three channels that are encoded in any one color.
475260	479860	The first is luminance, which is roughly how bright a color is.
479860	484780	Contrast in luminance is really important for edge detection in complex scenes.
484780	490020	The next is saturation, which is roughly how colorful the color is.
490060	494380	Low saturation is like a muted pink, high saturation is a bright red.
494380	499620	And finally, hue, which is what we mean when we say color in common speech.
499620	502780	So here's a chart that encodes information using hue.
502780	509420	So this is a data set of 32 cars that were tested in a 1974 issue of Motor Trend Magazine.
509420	516940	What I've plotted here is the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, or MPG, so a higher number
516940	519660	is better, more miles per gallon.
519700	522820	Let me say up front that this is a terrible plot.
522820	528340	You would never make a plot like this in real life, but let's try to extract some value
528340	529340	from it.
529340	532700	So the first of Cleveland's estimation tasks is discrimination.
532700	537380	So what do you think of these two, the Firebird versus the Merck 450 SLC, are they the same
537380	538380	or different?
538380	539380	Different.
539380	540460	Very easy, right?
540460	541660	Because they're right next to each other.
541660	542780	What if I make it harder?
542780	547660	The Merck 450 SLC versus the Dodge Challenger, same or different?
548660	552180	Okay, I find it impossible to tell.
552180	559060	People vary in their ability to perceive differences in hue, so I can't really tell.
559060	562300	Maybe you can tell if you can, you're better at this than me.
562300	565660	I think they're actually different, very, very slightly different.
565660	567740	Okay, so much for discrimination.
567740	568740	What about ranking?
568740	569740	Here's an easy one.
569740	575060	The Toyota Corolla versus the Chrysler Imperial, which has better fuel efficiency, right?
575060	576460	You can do that just with domain knowledge.
576460	579340	You don't even need the chart.
579340	585260	You can do that accurately, but it's slow because it requires a table lookup.
585260	591260	You have to refer to the legend to recall if red is at the high end of the scale or at
591260	592740	the low end of the scale.
592740	597420	And you have to refer to the scale because hue does not have a natural ordering.
597420	602820	The process of table lookup is really expensive and you should seek to avoid it as much as
602820	603820	possible.
604580	608540	As soon as we talk about ranking, it becomes obvious that there is something else dreadfully
608540	615540	wrong with this chart, aside from using hue as a scale to encode a continuous variable.
615540	619860	How have I ordered the models on the Y-axis alphabetical?
619860	620860	Why?
620860	621980	Because that's the default.
621980	623540	Is that a good encoding?
623540	624540	No.
624540	627180	It turns out that this is an important observation.
627180	633220	The default ordering of a categorical variable is almost never the right ordering for a
633260	634500	visualization.
634500	638820	You almost always want to re-rank a categorical variable somehow.
638820	642740	In our case, of course, the best way is by efficiency.
642740	647900	Now, ranking any two is trivial, provided that you can discriminate between them, which
647900	649780	still is not easy.
649780	654420	For example, I believe all of these have slightly different efficiency, but I find it really
654420	656420	hard to tell from this plot.
656420	658940	We'll leave hue behind.
658940	660180	We'll move up.
660220	667060	Three-dimensional volume, density of points or objects more generally, and color saturation
667060	669700	are all roughly tied at the next level.
669700	672100	I'm going to talk about saturation.
672100	675140	Saturation has two big advantages over hue.
675140	679260	The first is that there is a natural ordering to saturation.
679260	684140	If I gave you this, but then I hid the legend and I asked you to put these in order with
684140	689540	no other information, you would naturally and easily arrive back at this.
689580	694660	The other big advantage saturation has over hue is that your eye can give a quantitative
694660	696900	estimate of saturation.
696900	703500	If I extend the lower end of the scale down to zero, you can start to do the third of
703500	705500	Cleveland's levels of estimation.
705500	707860	You can do ratioing.
707860	713700	I can ask you, how much more fuel efficient is the Toyota Corolla at the top compared
713700	715500	to the Cadillac at the bottom?
715500	716980	Is it two times more efficient?
716980	719180	Is it three times more efficient?
719180	720740	Maybe it's four.
720740	725020	You should be able to come up with a guess without even referring to the legend.
725020	728380	That guess will be reasonably accurate.
728380	733140	Maybe you can get one significant figure out of that guess.
733140	736180	Moving up one more, come to two-dimensional area.
736180	740900	Here's the same data with fuel efficiency encoded by two-dimensional area.
740900	746420	This is the first time where accurate ratioing becomes possible.
746420	750500	If I ask again, how much more fuel efficient is the Corolla at the top compared to the
750500	755460	Continental, expressed as a multiple of the Continental?
755460	759260	This is the first time that you'll be able to give an answer with any confidence without
759260	762140	referring to the legend.
762140	768460	It's important to note that this is only possible because I have scaled the area of each point.
768460	772420	Not the radius, not the diameter, but the area with efficiency.
772420	776380	Humans perceive the size of something according to its area.
776420	780580	Also, because the points are scaled so that a point representing zero miles per gallon
780580	786300	would have zero area, I make these points because two-dimensional area is an extremely
786300	789780	useful encoding for data.
789780	795140	You can put another dimension of your data on area, but you have to do it carefully,
795140	797940	otherwise you're going to mislead.
797940	800340	This particular plot, again, is pretty strange.
800340	805100	You'd never make a plot exactly like this in real life, but we use area to encode information
805100	809660	all the time, like in a bubble chart, where the area of each point usually encodes the
809660	813060	amount of data that's in that point.
813060	815700	Moving up one more level, we come to angle.
815700	818020	Here's the same efficiency data encoded with angle.
818020	823900	Again, it is super important that I have set this plot up so that a horizontal line means
823900	828700	zero miles per gallon and a vertical line is the maximum of the data set.
828700	833300	Because I have done that, it's trivial for you to say that the Cadillac is about a third
833300	838500	as efficient as the Corolla, and about half as efficient as the Dotson 710.
838500	840660	Again, this is a silly chart.
840660	845700	You would never make a chart using angle in this way, but we use angle to encode information
845700	850580	all the time, like here's a chart of world population broken out by continent.
850580	855940	Here because population is plotted directly on the y-axis, the rate of population growth
855940	862060	is encoded as the angle of the line, and it's hard to see whether, say, Oceania at the bottom
862060	866780	is growing faster or slower than Asia at the top.
866780	868340	Next up, length.
868340	869660	Here's data encoded as length.
869660	873580	I had to jitter the bars so that you couldn't compare against a common baseline.
873580	875780	That's the next level up in the hierarchy.
875780	881540	With length, you're getting more accurate ratioing than with area or with angle.
881540	886460	For example, the valiant here, you can estimate that it's one and a half times more efficient
886460	888180	than the Cadillac.
888180	892300	Not much precision would have been difficult with area or with slope.
892300	897860	We still have not achieved very much improvement in discrimination or in ranking, so take,
897860	899340	for example, this pair.
899340	903220	Even though they are right next to each other, it is hard to tell if the Maserati Bora is
903220	907660	better or worse than the Chrysler Imperial or if they're tied.
907660	910940	I think they're different, but it's hard to tell.
910940	914740	You might say that this is a weird plot, but we use length of unaligned segments to encode
914740	921420	information all the time, like in this plot, where error bars use length to encode the
921420	924340	size of a confidence interval.
924340	927940	Moving on, we'll come to position on identical but nonaligned scales.
927940	932020	Here's the fuel efficiency data encoded with identical but nonaligned scales.
932020	938540	You can decode position much more accurately than anything that has come before.
938540	944420	Taking the last example, you can just barely see that the Chrysler Imperial on the left
944420	947900	is ever so slightly worse than the Maserati Bora.
947900	953580	Again, this is a dumb chart that no one would ever make, but we use identical but nonaligned
953580	958260	scales all the time, like in this pair of time series, where the time axis is identical
958260	961460	between the panels, but the y-axis varies.
961460	966140	Finally, we've arrived at the top, position on a common scale.
966140	970060	This, of course, is the way I should have plotted the data from the very beginning.
970060	975420	In this display, you can take the ratio of any two points to two significant digits with
975420	980220	very little effort, and both ranking and discrimination are trivial.
980220	983580	Here's the Maserati Bora versus the Chrysler Imperial comparison.
983580	987220	You can easily read off that the Bora gets 15 miles per gallon and the Imperial gets
987220	990140	about 14 and a half.
990140	994420	Now that you understand these, and you have a little bit of intuition for how they work
994420	1000020	and what are the benefits of each, we can look at the implications of this research.
1000980	1003380	Here's an observation.
1003380	1006700	Stacked anything is nearly always a mistake.
1006700	1012140	Here's a data set of, this is a chart from a data set of 54,000 diamonds.
1012140	1017060	Each row in the data set encodes the cut, the color, the clarity, the price, other data,
1017060	1019260	like the table size, and so on.
1019260	1025820	This chart is just showing the count of diamonds in each combination of cut and clarity.
1025820	1032460	Because we have only two dimensions of space, an X and a Y axis, we have to encode cut with
1032460	1033580	another channel.
1033580	1034580	We pick hue.
1034580	1037940	It's totally fine to use hue to encode categorical data.
1037940	1040060	It's very effective at that.
1040060	1044700	Then we stack the bars for each type of cut on top of each other.
1044700	1046860	This is called a stacked bar chart.
1046860	1049860	This chart is showing two different sets of data.
1049860	1056940	First it's showing the number of diamonds in each clarity class, so 13,000 in SI1, 12,000
1056940	1059420	in SI2, and so on.
1059420	1064020	That's encoded by the total length of the bars, which you can read off of a common scale,
1064020	1065980	the Y axis.
1065980	1071740	The second kind of information is the count of diamonds that are in each cut clarity combination.
1071740	1075140	That is encoded by the length of each of the little colored bars.
1075140	1079020	So tell me, the premium cut is the blue bars.
1079020	1084060	Are there more SI1 premium diamonds or more SI2 premium diamonds?
1084060	1085860	It's hard to tell.
1085860	1087700	I can't tell.
1087700	1092220	If you care about communicating the count in each combination of cut and clarity, then
1092220	1096300	encode that information using position on a common scale.
1096300	1101980	This is called a parallel coordinates plot, and it is nearly always preferable to a stacked
1101980	1103460	bar chart.
1103460	1108660	With this, I'll admit, you have lost some summary information about how many diamonds
1108660	1113540	are in each clarity group, but if you want that, then just use two charts.
1113540	1117700	So often what people want to do is they want to cram all of the information into a single
1117700	1122380	chart, and they end up with one chart that doesn't do anything well.
1122380	1127020	If you don't have space for two charts, then you just have to decide which is the more
1127020	1130820	important comparison and leave out the other views.
1130820	1135620	Editing is hard, but it's what your users want you to do.
1135780	1141500	Stacking forces the reader to decode lengths, not position on a common scale.
1141500	1146260	Decoding lengths is less efficient and less precise than position on a common scale, which
1146260	1150260	is why stacked charts are almost always a mistake.
1150260	1152380	There are exceptions to every rule.
1152380	1155100	This graph has a point.
1155100	1162460	Android growth is dominating everything else, including iOS, despite what you might think
1162460	1165380	if you're wealthy and you work in tech.
1165380	1173820	You could communicate this exact same information with a line chart, but this has more impact.
1173820	1177020	Next observation, pie charts.
1177020	1178700	Pie charts are always a mistake.
1178700	1180620	Here's Coda Hale on the topic.
1180620	1186260	The information visualization equivalent of a roofing hammer to the frontal lobe.
1186260	1193860	They are as professional as a pair of assless chaps.
1193860	1194860	I'm preaching to the choir.
1194860	1199700	I suspect you have doubtless heard people rail against pie charts before telling you not
1199700	1202380	to use them, but now you know why.
1202380	1204340	You know why pie charts are bad.
1204340	1210180	Pie charts encode quantitative data using angle, which is fourth on our list.
1210180	1212380	You can do better than angle.
1212380	1216620	Worse, most pie charts only show a tiny amount of data.
1216620	1223020	Here's a topical chart from the US presidential election.
1223020	1228780	This graph appeared on Politico, showing who won the third US presidential debate.
1228780	1232820	This entire graphic encodes one number.
1232820	1233820	One number.
1233820	1239820	If you click on the little among Democrats tab at the top, you get another number.
1239820	1241420	So exciting.
1241420	1248060	For a solution, we will turn to Tufti, who says pie charts should never be used.
1248060	1252900	Instead, he says, tables are preferable to graphics for small data sets.
1252900	1256100	This is so much better than a pie chart.
1256100	1261020	If you have more than a handful of categories, a dot plot is an excellent alternative.
1261020	1268940	And if you have a lot of categories for the love of all that is holy, do not do this.
1268940	1274980	Find some sensible way to summarize or model your data.
1274980	1277020	All good pie charts are jokes.
1277020	1284020	I will bring you my favorite from all time.
1284020	1290860	Okay, onward.
1290860	1294500	Next observation is that comparison is trivial on a common scale.
1294500	1300100	So I showed this plot briefly a couple of minutes ago, but let's look at it more closely.
1300100	1305300	I'm plotting two metrics here, CPU utilization and service latency separately in different
1305300	1306540	panels.
1306540	1310660	Mostly all operational dashboards do this, and they do it mainly for the convenience
1310660	1314900	of the person who made the chart or the convenience of the person who wrote the operational dashboard
1314900	1318980	software and the user is just forced into this choice.
1318980	1320940	So what's it mean for the user?
1320940	1324700	The two spikes, are they aligned in time or not?
1324700	1329620	They're not, and it's easy for you to tell, but it did require some effort.
1329620	1334740	Because I'm using nonaligned scales, it requires two table lookups and a slot in your working
1334740	1335860	memory.
1335860	1336900	So we can do better than that.
1336900	1341420	If you put them on a common scale, the top of the hierarchy, it's trivial to see that
1341420	1346340	the spikes don't line up, but now you see why people don't typically mix metrics on
1346340	1351380	a common time scale because the magnitude of the two series is different.
1351380	1357220	But there is an easy, nearly universal fix, which is to standardize, that's a technical
1357220	1363500	term from statistics, to standardize each series by subtracting its mean and dividing
1363500	1365380	by its standard deviation.
1365380	1370780	And now we have this nice plot that lets us compare the anomalies in the two series.
1370780	1374260	And it's true that we have lost some information here.
1374260	1377820	We don't know the absolute magnitude of the spikes anymore.
1377820	1384380	So if all we had was this view, we wouldn't know what they were in an absolute sense.
1384380	1389900	And it matters if the spike in CPU is to 12% or to 100%.
1389900	1394940	So the truth is that sometimes you want this plot and sometimes you want this one, and
1394940	1400140	you can't know in advance, and so your monitoring software should make it easy for you to flip
1400140	1403980	back and forth between these two different views.
1403980	1409500	Which brings up an aside, which is that the dashboard metaphor is fundamentally flawed.
1409500	1416580	The systems that we work with are so complex, so much more complex than operating a car,
1416580	1423060	that no static set of metrics could possibly work, like even half the time.
1423060	1428580	This is a truth that I think our industry really has yet to come to grips with.
1428580	1434580	The affordances for transforming, rearranging, and replotting data are all clunky and slow
1434580	1438100	in the monitoring software that I'm aware of anyway.
1438100	1443780	I think this is a deep weakness in our tool chain, and it is a huge opportunity for people
1443780	1446820	who are motivated to fix it.
1446820	1450220	As long as we're talking about weaknesses in modern monitoring software, let's talk
1450220	1452220	about time series plots.
1452220	1457700	With most monitoring software, all you can do is plot time series like these, where time
1457700	1463020	marches from left to right, and some metric is plotted as a line.
1463020	1466500	Imagine that this is the latency of some service and its dependency.
1466500	1470420	So all you can say about these two is that they go up and down together.
1470420	1472220	But there's more to their relationship than that.
1472220	1476900	If I put them together so that the metrics are on a common scale, you get a hint maybe
1476900	1477900	at what's going on.
1477940	1483140	But the observation here is that a scatter plot will show the relationship directly.
1483140	1489740	If you want to show how two metrics move in relation to one another, there is no better
1489740	1491940	tool than a scatter plot.
1491940	1496380	So what I've done here is just take each point in time as an observation and put the service
1496380	1499780	on the y-axis and its dependency on the x-axis.
1499780	1502940	I can make it look nicer if I put a smoother over it.
1502940	1505260	And now you see that the relationship isn't linear.
1505260	1510500	The service's latency goes up faster than the dependency, which means that it's somehow
1510500	1512300	bottlenecked on that dependency.
1512300	1516420	And the dependency represents a key scaling risk for that service.
1516420	1521300	I don't know of monitoring software that makes it easy, that helps you to make scatterplots
1521300	1522300	like this.
1522300	1525620	And again, this just feels like a missed opportunity.
1525620	1530300	My last observation in this section is that growth charts usually aren't.
1530300	1534180	So here's a plot of world population again by continent over time.
1534580	1539300	The y-axis is on a log scale because population growth is exponential.
1539300	1545020	You have almost certainly seen a chart similar to this showing daily active users or monthly
1545020	1548860	active users or something like that relevant to your business.
1548860	1551740	These charts are typically presented as growth charts.
1551740	1553980	Look how we're growing, isn't it lovely?
1553980	1557860	You can barely tell anything about growth from this chart.
1557860	1564220	As I asked before, which is growing faster in the 1960s, Oceania or Asia?
1564220	1566620	How about in the 1980s?
1566620	1569060	It is impossible to tell.
1569060	1571820	Growth is the derivative of this curve.
1571820	1576660	If you care about growth, then plot growth directly on a common scale.
1576660	1580180	So here's the same data as before, but now I've plotted the percentage growth directly
1580180	1581780	on the y-axis.
1581780	1586420	And now it's obvious that Asia in orange has been growing faster than Oceania in blue,
1586420	1589860	except for a brief period in the early 1960s.
1589860	1596540	I think more interesting, it's now obvious that growth is trending down across all continents,
1596540	1601340	which is completely non-obvious from the original chart.
1601340	1603780	So if growth is important, plot it directly.
1603780	1609100	Okay, so that's all I wanted to say about this hierarchy and its implications for estimation.
1609100	1613620	I want to move back one step in Cleveland's operations.
1613620	1616100	So I want to talk about assembly.
1616100	1621200	All that assembly is the grouping of detected graphical elements.
1621200	1624900	The most useful research here comes from Gestalt psychology.
1624900	1626700	The word Gestalt is German.
1626700	1630180	It translates roughly to shape or form.
1630180	1633180	The School of Thought goes back to the 1890s.
1633180	1638660	And the central idea is that when your mind forms a Gestalt, a shape, the whole has a
1638660	1642620	reality that is entirely separate from the parts.
1642620	1643620	So what do I mean by that?
1643620	1646020	So here's a concrete example.
1646020	1652100	All I am showing you is some blobs of black color on a white background, but you perceive
1652100	1654020	this as a panda bear.
1654020	1656820	So this is an example of reification.
1656820	1662700	The Gestalt principle of reification says that you experience more spatial information
1662700	1667300	than is explicitly present in an image.
1667300	1673820	Another Gestalt principle is emergence, which is best demonstrated by an example.
1673820	1675780	So this is the famous dog picture.
1675780	1678500	Does everybody see the dog?
1678500	1679820	Does anyone not see the dog?
1679820	1680820	I'm curious.
1680820	1681820	Oh.
1681820	1682820	OK, a couple of people.
1682820	1684820	And you said it was a dog.
1684820	1685820	Oh.
1685820	1686820	OK, interesting.
1686820	1691120	So this fellow here says they only saw it as a dog when I said that it was a dog.
1691120	1693420	It's hard to see, I think.
1693420	1700220	The point about emergence is that you don't recognize this as a dog by first identifying
1700220	1703860	its feet, and then its tail, and then its head, and so on.
1703860	1708900	The dog just appears all at once as a complete object.
1708900	1713880	That's similar to the circle that we saw before, which just appears independent of the little
1713880	1716940	dots that suggest its form.
1716940	1721300	When we are thinking about making charts, the most useful idea from Gestalt psychology
1721300	1724940	is prognons or pithiness.
1724940	1733080	The principle of prognons says that we strongly prefer to interpret stimuli as regular and
1733080	1737260	simple and orderly.
1737260	1743260	Gestalt psychologists have identified a number of rules that will describe and predict how
1743260	1745500	we will simplify visual input.
1745500	1750980	So one we've seen before, the law of closure, which is what turns the dots into a circle.
1750980	1755060	Another of the Gestalt laws of grouping is the law of continuity, which says that we
1755060	1759740	will group together objects that follow an established direction.
1759740	1764340	So it's hard for us to make sense of this, where the cars are sorted alphabetically.
1764340	1768700	In fact, you will psychologically recoil from this chart.
1768700	1770020	You're like, I have to do work.
1770020	1772140	This is so unpleasant.
1772140	1778140	But if we sort them by efficiency, it becomes effortless for us to do all of Cleveland's
1778140	1783540	estimation operations, discrimination, ranking, and race showing.
1783540	1789260	So that's another observation, that good plots organize the data to take advantage of continuity
1789260	1793380	and to help the viewer assemble an overall Gestalt.
1793380	1797980	This is also happening when we make a scatter plot, like this one from the car's data showing
1797980	1803100	the relationship between the weight of a car and its efficiency as weight increases, efficiency
1803100	1804100	decreases.
1804100	1806940	Notice that the continuity does not have to be perfect.
1806940	1809940	It just has to be suggestive.
1809940	1812180	But we can add more information to the scatter plot.
1812180	1816580	We can use Hue to encode the number of cylinders in the engine of each car.
1816580	1821220	If we do that, you can easily pick out that there are three distinct groups of points.
1821220	1825500	So what's happening here is we're leveraging the law of similarity, which says that we tend
1825500	1830900	to see elements that are physically similar to each other as part of the same object,
1830900	1834540	and then things that are different as parts of different objects.
1834540	1839660	We use this all the time to put categorical information on charts, and there are lots
1839660	1843340	of different ways to encode categorical information.
1843340	1845180	Not all encodings are equally good.
1845180	1850300	So here I'm just using shape, and this is pretty clearly worse than color.
1850300	1853620	But if we use different shapes, it's much better, right?
1853620	1860980	This works so well because your eye is really good at picking out differences in curvature.
1860980	1865740	In fact, you can use degree of curvature to encode quantitative information.
1865740	1869820	It's not in the list of seven that I showed earlier, but I think it's about tied with
1869820	1871820	angle.
1871820	1875820	So the circles, they really pop out, and as we learned before, we're also pretty good
1875820	1881900	at detecting the slopes of lines, and so the triangles stand out from the little plus signs.
1881900	1885660	To see what I mean about curvature, here's an encoding that you'd think would work really
1885660	1890340	well, but it's terrible because the curvature of the sixes is too much like the curvature
1890340	1892220	of the eights.
1892220	1896740	And there's no good reason to, you can't use two channels to encode the same information
1896740	1897740	redundantly.
1897740	1902180	In fact, that's often a good choice, and we can even take this a step further.
1902180	1906500	We can add a linear model to each subset of the data, and now we're taking advantage of
1906500	1910660	another Gestalt grouping law by enclosing regions of space.
1910660	1915580	Okay, the last grouping law I want to talk about is the law of proximity, which says
1915580	1921340	that we tend to group elements that are near each other into a complete object.
1921340	1925500	So proximity is a very strong grouping principle.
1925500	1929700	This is the same diamonds data I was showing before as a stacked bar chart, but now instead
1929700	1936300	of stacking the bars, I've dodged them from side to side so that they don't overlap.
1936300	1942540	Proximity strongly encourages you to make eight objects from this image, one for each
1942540	1944220	level of clarity.
1944220	1950380	I personally find it very difficult to assemble the Gestalt of the blue bars and then compare
1950380	1953100	them with the greenish bars.
1953100	1959120	And again, the solution is to just use a parallel coordinates plot where you can very easily
1959120	1964820	see the rise and fall of each cut, and you can compare the shape of each cut to the others.
1964820	1970420	So another observation is that dodged bar charts are pretty much always a bad idea.
1970420	1973420	They allow you to do two things, but neither of them well.
1973420	1981020	Okay, now I want to move back up to the top, to the first of Cleveland's three operations
1981020	1982380	of pattern perception.
1982380	1985040	I want to talk about detection.
1985040	1989300	Detection is the operation of recognizing that a geometric object encodes a physical
1989300	1990300	value.
1990300	1996060	And so most trivially, it's the recognition that each point in this scatter plot represents
1996060	2001900	a car and encodes both the fuel efficiency and the weight of the car.
2001900	2006740	So I say that detection is trivial, but it's not.
2006740	2011780	Lots of people, the only charts they ever see are time series charts where a line moves
2011780	2014580	from left to right, encoding a metric over time.
2014580	2018780	If you show those people any other kind of chart, they are going to have to go to some
2018780	2023860	effort to try to figure out what the different shapes mean and how the image is conveying
2023860	2025420	information.
2025420	2028340	It is very easy to make it harder than it needs to be.
2028340	2032180	So most commonly, people give too little visual weight to the objects that are encoding the
2032180	2037140	data, either by having too little luminance contrast between the foreground and the background,
2037140	2040740	or by making the objects encoding the data too small.
2040740	2046100	Another problem is introducing other objects that compete with the data, like the lines
2046100	2049940	for a grid and a border around the plot area.
2049940	2054520	So that's not so bad, but if I amp it up a little bit, it gets really bad really quickly.
2054520	2061960	In the extreme, you start to introduce visual artifacts that aren't even real.
2061960	2068800	So for example, do you see the faint gray circles in the intersections of the lines?
2068800	2071760	That's an illusion, the name of which is escaping me right now.
2071760	2074520	It's named after a German fellow.
2074520	2078320	It's worth noting that in this regard, Excel's defaults are pretty bad.
2078320	2082440	So the default is to have only horizontal grid lines, I don't know why, and for them
2082480	2087440	to be fully saturated, and I get those same little gray dots where the blue line intersects
2087440	2088840	the grid lines.
2088840	2094120	So another observation is the detection is perhaps not as trivial as it might seem.
2094120	2098720	Be sure that the data has a lot of contrast with the background, and if you include grid
2098720	2102920	lines, make them muted so that they don't interfere with detection.
2102920	2106360	As Tufti says, above all else, show the data.
2106360	2110520	So talking about grid lines brings me to part five.
2110600	2113520	This is actually my favorite part, so I'm glad you stayed to the end.
2113520	2117720	In this part, I want to review a few more useful results from psychology research.
2117720	2122920	And the first one, this is my favorite part, Weber's law, which says that the just noticeable
2122920	2128960	difference, the smallest difference that you can detect between two things is proportional
2128960	2131720	to the size or the intensity of those two things.
2131720	2134240	That it's proportional is really surprising.
2134240	2138320	So this statement is extremely abstract, I'll make it more concrete.
2138320	2142520	If I gave you two weights, one of which was 10 kilograms, the other of which was 20 kilograms,
2142520	2145960	you would very easily be able to tell me which one was heavier.
2145960	2149760	But if I gave you two more weights, one of which was 100 kilograms and one of which was
2149760	2154840	110, you would have a much harder time telling me if they were the same or if they were different.
2154840	2160560	And so even though the absolute difference is the same, 10 kilograms in each case, the
2160560	2166520	top comparison, the heavier one is double the weight, and in the bottom it's only 10%.
2167040	2170680	10% is about the just noticeable difference.
2170680	2174400	Another example are these two lines the same length, they're different.
2174400	2179680	It's hard to tell, maybe if you work at it, they're different.
2179680	2185240	What if I put these little blue boxes on, or the blue boxes different or the same?
2185240	2187160	Super easy to tell that they're different.
2187160	2191280	It turns out that the total height of each bar is the same, 12 units.
2191280	2195840	And so that means that the difference between the two white bars is exactly the same as
2195840	2201040	the two blue bars in absolute terms, but you can distinguish between the blue bars because
2201040	2205520	the difference is large compared to their size.
2205520	2211920	So now we have another observation, Weber's law is why grid lines are useful, excuse me.
2211920	2216360	And Weber's law dictates the use of grid lines, how many you should have and whether or not
2216360	2217720	you should have them at all.
2217720	2223160	So here are eight curves all plotting the same class of function with different parameters.
2223160	2226400	So of this pair, which one dips down lower?
2226400	2227400	Hard to tell.
2227400	2228400	Okay.
2228400	2229400	How about now?
2229400	2231720	It's trivial.
2231720	2238120	It's easy because putting that dip in a much smaller box makes the just noticeable difference
2238120	2241000	proportionately smaller.
2241000	2244480	So here's another Tufti quote, erase non-data ink.
2244480	2247440	People sometimes take this to mean that you should erase grid lines because grid lines
2247440	2249360	aren't data, right?
2249360	2250520	This is a misquote.
2250520	2254320	What Tufti really wrote is erase non-data ink within reason.
2254320	2258320	My version is erase non-data ink that interferes with detection or doesn't assist with assembly
2258320	2264120	or estimation, which is not as pithy as Tufti, but perhaps a little more accurate.
2264120	2265120	Okay.
2265120	2269560	New topic, another interesting result is that you are best at detecting variation in slope
2269560	2272240	near 45 degrees.
2272240	2278280	So this is the same data plotted three different ways and the change in slope is most obvious
2278640	2284280	when the line is near 45 degrees, which brings up a super useful idea called banking to 45.
2284280	2288640	The idea of banking to 45 is that you should set the aspect ratio of your plot so that
2288640	2291560	the average slope is 45 degrees.
2291560	2293040	Here's a demonstration.
2293040	2296320	This plot shows the monthly average sunspot number.
2296320	2301360	The raw data is the partly saturated white points and a smooth series is then laid over
2301360	2302680	in blue.
2302680	2307160	From this data, about all you can tell is that sunspots have some kind of cycle and
2307160	2310520	the peak of that cycle is varied over time.
2310520	2317040	But if I break the series up into three 55-year chunks and then I stretch them out, then you
2317040	2321840	can see a lot more nuance in the onset and the decay of each cycle.
2321840	2327000	It looks like maybe the onset is more sharp and then the decline is more gradual.
2327000	2329800	I'd never have been able to see that in the original chart.
2329800	2334200	And so a good rule of thumb is to set the aspect ratio of your plots so that the average
2334200	2338640	line segment is roughly 45 degrees.
2338640	2340040	You don't have to get all scientific about it.
2340040	2342920	You can just eyeball it and it'll be fine.
2342920	2348280	This data brings up another aside, which is, should I include zero on my scale?
2348280	2350200	This is the panel that was at the lower left.
2350200	2354800	To make it so flat, all I did was extend the y-axis down to 800,000.
2354800	2358520	If I extend the y-axis all the way down to zero, you have a really hard time seeing the
2358520	2359520	variation.
2359960	2366280	So the real answer to whether or not you should include zero on your scale is it depends.
2366280	2368760	Here's the truth as compact as I can make it.
2368760	2375760	If your encoding relies on intensity for accurate estimation, then you have to include zero
2375760	2378200	in your scale.
2378200	2380200	On the other hand, you're using position.
2380200	2381200	It's up to you.
2381200	2388520	So this is the saturation chart before, relies on pre-attentive judgment of intensity of
2388760	2390360	position, so it has to go to zero.
2390360	2393720	Same deal with area, with the dot plot, I'm using position.
2393720	2397320	I'm free to clip the x-axis at 10.
2397320	2401480	In fact, it's a good idea to do so because it gives you more resolution.
2401480	2406480	With bars, people sometimes argue that what the viewer is doing with a bar chart is they're
2406480	2409040	comparing the position of the end of the bars.
2409040	2410560	I say that's a mistake.
2410560	2416120	What you're actually encouraging the user to do with a bar chart is to compare lengths.
2416320	2422520	In a bar chart, the axis has to start at zero because if you don't, you're going to mislead
2422520	2424640	your users.
2424640	2425640	Here's a bar chart.
2425640	2426640	You can't see the variation.
2426640	2430080	If you abandon the bars, then it's completely obvious.
2430080	2436680	Above all else, show the data, or I say show the variation in the data.
2436680	2438160	I have negative 30 seconds.
2438160	2441760	I want to say just two words about tools.
2441800	2448560	Every plot in this talk was made using the ggplot2 library in R, which is the best graphing
2448560	2452040	toolset that I have ever used by far.
2452040	2457040	If you want to learn more about it, I've published the source code to all these charts as our
2457040	2461880	markdown document on GitHub, and I have put the rendered document up on our pubs.
2461880	2464760	I'll also put this presentation up on SlideShare.
2464760	2469560	I will tweet all these links under my username, Jay Rouser.
