1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Yeah, so I'm John Rouser, I'm here to talk to you today about how humans see data.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,960
So this is a talk about visualization, which is taking raw data, numbers, and labels, and

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,180
turning it into images for the purposes of communication.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,400
So that is a super important idea, so I will say it again.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,080
The act of creating a visualization is fundamentally an act of communication.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Your goal with a visualization is to make new ideas appear in the heads of other people.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,600
More specifically, this is a talk about how to make better visualizations.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,320
I want to make you better at helping humans solve analytical problems quickly and accurately

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,000
with visualization.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,560
I want to make you more effective at getting ideas into other people's heads.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,760
I feel like I should start by justifying visualization as a technique in the first place.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Some people say, well, you don't really need visualizations because you can communicate

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,200
just a tremendous amount of information using tables of data, like the stock listings page.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
So we'll do a little exercise.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,920
Here's some data, 24 points each with an X and a Y value.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,560
You are a very clever audience, so I'm certain that if I let you work at it for just a little

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,400
bit, you'd figure out what the relationship is between X and Y, but if I just show you

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,200
this, it's immediately obvious.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,880
So what just happened in your head happened in about 250 milliseconds without any conscious

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
effort.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,760
In fact, there is no way that you can stop it from happening.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,280
Your eyes are a direct high bandwidth channel directly into your brain.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,920
You recognize this as a circle because of what's called pre-attentive processing, which

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,240
is the subconscious accumulation of information from the environment.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,160
And the best visualizations, they make the information that you want to communicate available

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,800
pre-attentively so that the user doesn't even have to think about what they are seeing.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,600
That's not always possible, but it's what you should be striving for.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,360
And the point, really, of this little exercise is that a graph is an encoding of data, which

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,000
is to say that this table and this chart contain the exact same information, but in this display,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
the information is encoded in a way that makes it accessible to your incredibly powerful

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
visual system.

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,560
But not all encodings are equally good.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,560
So here I've mapped the X value to position on the horizontal axis and the Y value to

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,320
position on the vertical axis.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
That choice has a name.

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,600
This is called a scatter plot.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
But I could have made different choices.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,360
I could have taken the exact same data and treated it as an ordered sequence and then

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,120
plotted two lines like this.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,280
So this is the same data, but now it's not at all obvious what the relationship is.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,040
So this is akin to a time series plot, which is ubiquitous, of course, in operational dashboards.

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,880
The time series plot is incredibly useful if time is critical to the analysis, which

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,360
may or may not be the case.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,800
It's certainly not the case here.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
So a good reason to visualize is that it can make salient features of the data available

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
pre-attentively without any effort at all.

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Good visualizations optimize for the human visual system.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,640
If that's true, then it seems like it'd be really good to know how the human visual

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,080
system works or more precisely how the human visual system decodes a graph.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,520
The good news is that there's been a lot of research into this question, and what I want

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,040
to do now is I want to walk you through some of that research using a framework that comes

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
from this book.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
So Bill Cleveland did some of the most important original research in this area, and this book

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,440
summarizes that research into a coherent framework.

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,000
One of the most important parts of that framework is what he calls the three visual operations

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,760
of pattern perception.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
So I'll define them.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
First, detection.

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,520
Detection is the visual recognition that a geometric object encodes a physical value.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,800
Assembly then is the grouping of detected graphical elements, and estimation is the visual

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,920
assessment of the relative magnitude of two or more quantitative physical values.

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,600
So I'm going to go through these, but I want to go through them in reverse order.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,480
I want to start with estimation, because that's where I see people making the most mistakes.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,880
So Cleveland lays out three different levels of estimation, where one level down in sort

65
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,200
of this hierarchy of concepts.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,240
So we're going to talk about three different levels of estimation.

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,720
The first is discrimination, where all you can do is just tell that two values are or

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,040
aren't the same.

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
Next is ranking, where you can impose some order on the values.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,840
And then the last one is ratioing, where you can say with some precision what the ratio

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,920
between two values is.

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,320
Notice that all of these involve comparison.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Efficient comparison between different data points is nearly always the point of a visualization.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,520
If I just wanted to report the individual data without comparison or any further analysis,

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,400
then a simple table would be completely fine or maybe better just like a USB key with the

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,880
data.

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
But when you're trying to think with data, you are always making comparisons.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,040
As Edward Tufty says, a famous writer about information visualization, he says at the

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,600
heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question as compared to what.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,320
So when we're making a visualization, what we want to do is to get as far down this list

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,280
as possible with efficiency and with accuracy.

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,160
Some of the best research on this question is summarized in this amazing paper by Cleveland

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
and McGill.

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,000
You can get this online for free.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,040
This paper is a treasure trove of insight, but I want to focus on one little table.

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,760
I see people like getting out their phones.

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
They want to take a photo.

88
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm going to tweet slides afterwards, so don't worry about it.

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Sorry.

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Look, there it is.

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
You want to take a photo?

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Awesome.

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,120
So I want to focus on this one little table buried on the third page of the report because

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to claim that this table might be the single most important thing that you can possibly

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
know about visualizing data.

96
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,080
What this table shows is how accurate humans are at estimating quantities that are encoded

97
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
in different ways.

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,040
So here's the table in a more readable format.

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,280
What Cleveland is doing here is he's giving us seven different ways to encode a quantitative

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,440
value, and he ranks them from most effective to least effective.

101
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,720
We are most accurate when decoding position on a common scale and least accurate when

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
decoding hue.

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,200
And what you should do when you're making a graphic is think, what is the most important

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,560
comparison that I want the user to make?

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,320
Whatever that is, you should encode that thing using position on a common scale.

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,060
As you pack more and more different dimensions of data into the same chart, you have to go

107
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,060
further down this list, you're just forced to.

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,140
If you have several different comparisons, all of which are very important, and you might

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,460
have to make multiple charts.

110
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,660
What I want to do now is I want to take you through these in order, in order to give you

111
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,180
an intuitive sense for how they work.

112
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,340
So I'll start with hue, and we'll work our way up.

113
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,460
Before I can even get started, I need to talk about how color works because human color

114
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,220
perception is incredibly complicated.

115
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,940
As Tamara Munzner says, the first rule of color is do not talk about color because color

116
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,620
is not a single thing.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
Color is really three things.

118
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,260
There are three channels that are encoded in any one color.

119
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,860
The first is luminance, which is roughly how bright a color is.

120
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,780
Contrast in luminance is really important for edge detection in complex scenes.

121
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,020
The next is saturation, which is roughly how colorful the color is.

122
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,380
Low saturation is like a muted pink, high saturation is a bright red.

123
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,620
And finally, hue, which is what we mean when we say color in common speech.

124
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,780
So here's a chart that encodes information using hue.

125
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,420
So this is a data set of 32 cars that were tested in a 1974 issue of Motor Trend Magazine.

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:36,940
What I've plotted here is the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, or MPG, so a higher number

127
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,660
is better, more miles per gallon.

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,820
Let me say up front that this is a terrible plot.

129
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,340
You would never make a plot like this in real life, but let's try to extract some value

130
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
from it.

131
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,700
So the first of Cleveland's estimation tasks is discrimination.

132
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,380
So what do you think of these two, the Firebird versus the Merck 450 SLC, are they the same

133
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
or different?

134
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Different.

135
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,460
Very easy, right?

136
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,660
Because they're right next to each other.

137
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,780
What if I make it harder?

138
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,660
The Merck 450 SLC versus the Dodge Challenger, same or different?

139
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,180
Okay, I find it impossible to tell.

140
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,060
People vary in their ability to perceive differences in hue, so I can't really tell.

141
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,300
Maybe you can tell if you can, you're better at this than me.

142
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,660
I think they're actually different, very, very slightly different.

143
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,740
Okay, so much for discrimination.

144
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
What about ranking?

145
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Here's an easy one.

146
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,060
The Toyota Corolla versus the Chrysler Imperial, which has better fuel efficiency, right?

147
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,460
You can do that just with domain knowledge.

148
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,340
You don't even need the chart.

149
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,260
You can do that accurately, but it's slow because it requires a table lookup.

150
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,260
You have to refer to the legend to recall if red is at the high end of the scale or at

151
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,740
the low end of the scale.

152
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,420
And you have to refer to the scale because hue does not have a natural ordering.

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,820
The process of table lookup is really expensive and you should seek to avoid it as much as

154
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
possible.

155
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,540
As soon as we talk about ranking, it becomes obvious that there is something else dreadfully

156
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,540
wrong with this chart, aside from using hue as a scale to encode a continuous variable.

157
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,860
How have I ordered the models on the Y-axis alphabetical?

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Why?

159
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,980
Because that's the default.

160
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,540
Is that a good encoding?

161
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
No.

162
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,180
It turns out that this is an important observation.

163
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,220
The default ordering of a categorical variable is almost never the right ordering for a

164
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,500
visualization.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,820
You almost always want to re-rank a categorical variable somehow.

166
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,740
In our case, of course, the best way is by efficiency.

167
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,900
Now, ranking any two is trivial, provided that you can discriminate between them, which

168
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,780
still is not easy.

169
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,420
For example, I believe all of these have slightly different efficiency, but I find it really

170
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
hard to tell from this plot.

171
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,940
We'll leave hue behind.

172
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,180
We'll move up.

173
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Three-dimensional volume, density of points or objects more generally, and color saturation

174
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,700
are all roughly tied at the next level.

175
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
I'm going to talk about saturation.

176
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,140
Saturation has two big advantages over hue.

177
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,260
The first is that there is a natural ordering to saturation.

178
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,140
If I gave you this, but then I hid the legend and I asked you to put these in order with

179
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,540
no other information, you would naturally and easily arrive back at this.

180
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,660
The other big advantage saturation has over hue is that your eye can give a quantitative

181
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,900
estimate of saturation.

182
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,500
If I extend the lower end of the scale down to zero, you can start to do the third of

183
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Cleveland's levels of estimation.

184
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,860
You can do ratioing.

185
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,700
I can ask you, how much more fuel efficient is the Toyota Corolla at the top compared

186
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,500
to the Cadillac at the bottom?

187
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,980
Is it two times more efficient?

188
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,180
Is it three times more efficient?

189
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,740
Maybe it's four.

190
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,020
You should be able to come up with a guess without even referring to the legend.

191
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,380
That guess will be reasonably accurate.

192
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,140
Maybe you can get one significant figure out of that guess.

193
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,180
Moving up one more, come to two-dimensional area.

194
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,900
Here's the same data with fuel efficiency encoded by two-dimensional area.

195
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,420
This is the first time where accurate ratioing becomes possible.

196
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,500
If I ask again, how much more fuel efficient is the Corolla at the top compared to the

197
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,460
Continental, expressed as a multiple of the Continental?

198
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,260
This is the first time that you'll be able to give an answer with any confidence without

199
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,140
referring to the legend.

200
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,460
It's important to note that this is only possible because I have scaled the area of each point.

201
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,420
Not the radius, not the diameter, but the area with efficiency.

202
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,380
Humans perceive the size of something according to its area.

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,580
Also, because the points are scaled so that a point representing zero miles per gallon

204
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,300
would have zero area, I make these points because two-dimensional area is an extremely

205
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,780
useful encoding for data.

206
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,140
You can put another dimension of your data on area, but you have to do it carefully,

207
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,940
otherwise you're going to mislead.

208
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,340
This particular plot, again, is pretty strange.

209
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,100
You'd never make a plot exactly like this in real life, but we use area to encode information

210
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,660
all the time, like in a bubble chart, where the area of each point usually encodes the

211
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,060
amount of data that's in that point.

212
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,700
Moving up one more level, we come to angle.

213
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,020
Here's the same efficiency data encoded with angle.

214
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,900
Again, it is super important that I have set this plot up so that a horizontal line means

215
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,700
zero miles per gallon and a vertical line is the maximum of the data set.

216
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,300
Because I have done that, it's trivial for you to say that the Cadillac is about a third

217
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,500
as efficient as the Corolla, and about half as efficient as the Dotson 710.

218
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,660
Again, this is a silly chart.

219
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,700
You would never make a chart using angle in this way, but we use angle to encode information

220
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,580
all the time, like here's a chart of world population broken out by continent.

221
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,940
Here because population is plotted directly on the y-axis, the rate of population growth

222
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,060
is encoded as the angle of the line, and it's hard to see whether, say, Oceania at the bottom

223
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,780
is growing faster or slower than Asia at the top.

224
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,340
Next up, length.

225
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,660
Here's data encoded as length.

226
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,580
I had to jitter the bars so that you couldn't compare against a common baseline.

227
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,780
That's the next level up in the hierarchy.

228
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,540
With length, you're getting more accurate ratioing than with area or with angle.

229
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,460
For example, the valiant here, you can estimate that it's one and a half times more efficient

230
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,180
than the Cadillac.

231
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,300
Not much precision would have been difficult with area or with slope.

232
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,860
We still have not achieved very much improvement in discrimination or in ranking, so take,

233
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,340
for example, this pair.

234
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,220
Even though they are right next to each other, it is hard to tell if the Maserati Bora is

235
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,660
better or worse than the Chrysler Imperial or if they're tied.

236
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,940
I think they're different, but it's hard to tell.

237
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,740
You might say that this is a weird plot, but we use length of unaligned segments to encode

238
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:21,420
information all the time, like in this plot, where error bars use length to encode the

239
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,340
size of a confidence interval.

240
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,940
Moving on, we'll come to position on identical but nonaligned scales.

241
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,020
Here's the fuel efficiency data encoded with identical but nonaligned scales.

242
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:38,540
You can decode position much more accurately than anything that has come before.

243
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,420
Taking the last example, you can just barely see that the Chrysler Imperial on the left

244
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,900
is ever so slightly worse than the Maserati Bora.

245
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,580
Again, this is a dumb chart that no one would ever make, but we use identical but nonaligned

246
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,260
scales all the time, like in this pair of time series, where the time axis is identical

247
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,460
between the panels, but the y-axis varies.

248
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,140
Finally, we've arrived at the top, position on a common scale.

249
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,060
This, of course, is the way I should have plotted the data from the very beginning.

250
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,420
In this display, you can take the ratio of any two points to two significant digits with

251
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,220
very little effort, and both ranking and discrimination are trivial.

252
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,580
Here's the Maserati Bora versus the Chrysler Imperial comparison.

253
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,220
You can easily read off that the Bora gets 15 miles per gallon and the Imperial gets

254
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,140
about 14 and a half.

255
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,420
Now that you understand these, and you have a little bit of intuition for how they work

256
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,020
and what are the benefits of each, we can look at the implications of this research.

257
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,380
Here's an observation.

258
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,700
Stacked anything is nearly always a mistake.

259
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,140
Here's a data set of, this is a chart from a data set of 54,000 diamonds.

260
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,060
Each row in the data set encodes the cut, the color, the clarity, the price, other data,

261
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,260
like the table size, and so on.

262
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,820
This chart is just showing the count of diamonds in each combination of cut and clarity.

263
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,460
Because we have only two dimensions of space, an X and a Y axis, we have to encode cut with

264
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,580
another channel.

265
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
We pick hue.

266
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,940
It's totally fine to use hue to encode categorical data.

267
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,060
It's very effective at that.

268
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,700
Then we stack the bars for each type of cut on top of each other.

269
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,860
This is called a stacked bar chart.

270
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,860
This chart is showing two different sets of data.

271
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,940
First it's showing the number of diamonds in each clarity class, so 13,000 in SI1, 12,000

272
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,420
in SI2, and so on.

273
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,020
That's encoded by the total length of the bars, which you can read off of a common scale,

274
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,980
the Y axis.

275
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,740
The second kind of information is the count of diamonds that are in each cut clarity combination.

276
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,140
That is encoded by the length of each of the little colored bars.

277
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,020
So tell me, the premium cut is the blue bars.

278
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,060
Are there more SI1 premium diamonds or more SI2 premium diamonds?

279
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,860
It's hard to tell.

280
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,700
I can't tell.

281
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,220
If you care about communicating the count in each combination of cut and clarity, then

282
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,300
encode that information using position on a common scale.

283
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,980
This is called a parallel coordinates plot, and it is nearly always preferable to a stacked

284
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,460
bar chart.

285
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,660
With this, I'll admit, you have lost some summary information about how many diamonds

286
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,540
are in each clarity group, but if you want that, then just use two charts.

287
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,700
So often what people want to do is they want to cram all of the information into a single

288
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,380
chart, and they end up with one chart that doesn't do anything well.

289
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,020
If you don't have space for two charts, then you just have to decide which is the more

290
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,820
important comparison and leave out the other views.

291
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,620
Editing is hard, but it's what your users want you to do.

292
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,500
Stacking forces the reader to decode lengths, not position on a common scale.

293
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,260
Decoding lengths is less efficient and less precise than position on a common scale, which

294
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,260
is why stacked charts are almost always a mistake.

295
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,380
There are exceptions to every rule.

296
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,100
This graph has a point.

297
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,460
Android growth is dominating everything else, including iOS, despite what you might think

298
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,380
if you're wealthy and you work in tech.

299
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,820
You could communicate this exact same information with a line chart, but this has more impact.

300
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,020
Next observation, pie charts.

301
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,700
Pie charts are always a mistake.

302
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Here's Coda Hale on the topic.

303
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,260
The information visualization equivalent of a roofing hammer to the frontal lobe.

304
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:53,860
They are as professional as a pair of assless chaps.

305
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm preaching to the choir.

306
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,700
I suspect you have doubtless heard people rail against pie charts before telling you not

307
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,380
to use them, but now you know why.

308
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,340
You know why pie charts are bad.

309
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,180
Pie charts encode quantitative data using angle, which is fourth on our list.

310
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
You can do better than angle.

311
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,620
Worse, most pie charts only show a tiny amount of data.

312
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,020
Here's a topical chart from the US presidential election.

313
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,780
This graph appeared on Politico, showing who won the third US presidential debate.

314
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,820
This entire graphic encodes one number.

315
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
One number.

316
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,820
If you click on the little among Democrats tab at the top, you get another number.

317
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,420
So exciting.

318
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:48,060
For a solution, we will turn to Tufti, who says pie charts should never be used.

319
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,900
Instead, he says, tables are preferable to graphics for small data sets.

320
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,100
This is so much better than a pie chart.

321
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,020
If you have more than a handful of categories, a dot plot is an excellent alternative.

322
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,940
And if you have a lot of categories for the love of all that is holy, do not do this.

323
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,980
Find some sensible way to summarize or model your data.

324
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,020
All good pie charts are jokes.

325
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I will bring you my favorite from all time.

326
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:30,860
Okay, onward.

327
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,500
Next observation is that comparison is trivial on a common scale.

328
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,100
So I showed this plot briefly a couple of minutes ago, but let's look at it more closely.

329
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm plotting two metrics here, CPU utilization and service latency separately in different

330
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,540
panels.

331
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,660
Mostly all operational dashboards do this, and they do it mainly for the convenience

332
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,900
of the person who made the chart or the convenience of the person who wrote the operational dashboard

333
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,980
software and the user is just forced into this choice.

334
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,940
So what's it mean for the user?

335
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,700
The two spikes, are they aligned in time or not?

336
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,620
They're not, and it's easy for you to tell, but it did require some effort.

337
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,740
Because I'm using nonaligned scales, it requires two table lookups and a slot in your working

338
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,860
memory.

339
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,900
So we can do better than that.

340
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,420
If you put them on a common scale, the top of the hierarchy, it's trivial to see that

341
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,340
the spikes don't line up, but now you see why people don't typically mix metrics on

342
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,380
a common time scale because the magnitude of the two series is different.

343
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,220
But there is an easy, nearly universal fix, which is to standardize, that's a technical

344
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,500
term from statistics, to standardize each series by subtracting its mean and dividing

345
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,380
by its standard deviation.

346
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,780
And now we have this nice plot that lets us compare the anomalies in the two series.

347
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,260
And it's true that we have lost some information here.

348
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,820
We don't know the absolute magnitude of the spikes anymore.

349
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,380
So if all we had was this view, we wouldn't know what they were in an absolute sense.

350
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,900
And it matters if the spike in CPU is to 12% or to 100%.

351
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,940
So the truth is that sometimes you want this plot and sometimes you want this one, and

352
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,140
you can't know in advance, and so your monitoring software should make it easy for you to flip

353
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,980
back and forth between these two different views.

354
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,500
Which brings up an aside, which is that the dashboard metaphor is fundamentally flawed.

355
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,580
The systems that we work with are so complex, so much more complex than operating a car,

356
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:43,060
that no static set of metrics could possibly work, like even half the time.

357
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,580
This is a truth that I think our industry really has yet to come to grips with.

358
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,580
The affordances for transforming, rearranging, and replotting data are all clunky and slow

359
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,100
in the monitoring software that I'm aware of anyway.

360
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,780
I think this is a deep weakness in our tool chain, and it is a huge opportunity for people

361
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,820
who are motivated to fix it.

362
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,220
As long as we're talking about weaknesses in modern monitoring software, let's talk

363
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
about time series plots.

364
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,700
With most monitoring software, all you can do is plot time series like these, where time

365
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,020
marches from left to right, and some metric is plotted as a line.

366
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,500
Imagine that this is the latency of some service and its dependency.

367
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,420
So all you can say about these two is that they go up and down together.

368
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,220
But there's more to their relationship than that.

369
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,900
If I put them together so that the metrics are on a common scale, you get a hint maybe

370
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
at what's going on.

371
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,140
But the observation here is that a scatter plot will show the relationship directly.

372
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,740
If you want to show how two metrics move in relation to one another, there is no better

373
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,940
tool than a scatter plot.

374
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,380
So what I've done here is just take each point in time as an observation and put the service

375
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,780
on the y-axis and its dependency on the x-axis.

376
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,940
I can make it look nicer if I put a smoother over it.

377
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,260
And now you see that the relationship isn't linear.

378
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,500
The service's latency goes up faster than the dependency, which means that it's somehow

379
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,300
bottlenecked on that dependency.

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,420
And the dependency represents a key scaling risk for that service.

381
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,300
I don't know of monitoring software that makes it easy, that helps you to make scatterplots

382
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
like this.

383
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,620
And again, this just feels like a missed opportunity.

384
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,300
My last observation in this section is that growth charts usually aren't.

385
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,180
So here's a plot of world population again by continent over time.

386
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,300
The y-axis is on a log scale because population growth is exponential.

387
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:45,020
You have almost certainly seen a chart similar to this showing daily active users or monthly

388
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,860
active users or something like that relevant to your business.

389
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,740
These charts are typically presented as growth charts.

390
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,980
Look how we're growing, isn't it lovely?

391
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,860
You can barely tell anything about growth from this chart.

392
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:04,220
As I asked before, which is growing faster in the 1960s, Oceania or Asia?

393
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,620
How about in the 1980s?

394
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,060
It is impossible to tell.

395
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,820
Growth is the derivative of this curve.

396
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,660
If you care about growth, then plot growth directly on a common scale.

397
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,180
So here's the same data as before, but now I've plotted the percentage growth directly

398
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,780
on the y-axis.

399
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,420
And now it's obvious that Asia in orange has been growing faster than Oceania in blue,

400
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,860
except for a brief period in the early 1960s.

401
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:36,540
I think more interesting, it's now obvious that growth is trending down across all continents,

402
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,340
which is completely non-obvious from the original chart.

403
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,780
So if growth is important, plot it directly.

404
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:49,100
Okay, so that's all I wanted to say about this hierarchy and its implications for estimation.

405
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,620
I want to move back one step in Cleveland's operations.

406
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,100
So I want to talk about assembly.

407
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,200
All that assembly is the grouping of detected graphical elements.

408
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,900
The most useful research here comes from Gestalt psychology.

409
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,700
The word Gestalt is German.

410
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,180
It translates roughly to shape or form.

411
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,180
The School of Thought goes back to the 1890s.

412
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,660
And the central idea is that when your mind forms a Gestalt, a shape, the whole has a

413
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,620
reality that is entirely separate from the parts.

414
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,620
So what do I mean by that?

415
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,020
So here's a concrete example.

416
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:32,100
All I am showing you is some blobs of black color on a white background, but you perceive

417
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,020
this as a panda bear.

418
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,820
So this is an example of reification.

419
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,700
The Gestalt principle of reification says that you experience more spatial information

420
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,300
than is explicitly present in an image.

421
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,820
Another Gestalt principle is emergence, which is best demonstrated by an example.

422
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,780
So this is the famous dog picture.

423
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,500
Does everybody see the dog?

424
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,820
Does anyone not see the dog?

425
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
I'm curious.

426
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
Oh.

427
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
OK, a couple of people.

428
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
And you said it was a dog.

429
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Oh.

430
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
OK, interesting.

431
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,120
So this fellow here says they only saw it as a dog when I said that it was a dog.

432
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,420
It's hard to see, I think.

433
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,220
The point about emergence is that you don't recognize this as a dog by first identifying

434
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,860
its feet, and then its tail, and then its head, and so on.

435
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,900
The dog just appears all at once as a complete object.

436
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,880
That's similar to the circle that we saw before, which just appears independent of the little

437
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,940
dots that suggest its form.

438
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,300
When we are thinking about making charts, the most useful idea from Gestalt psychology

439
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,940
is prognons or pithiness.

440
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:53,080
The principle of prognons says that we strongly prefer to interpret stimuli as regular and

441
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,260
simple and orderly.

442
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Gestalt psychologists have identified a number of rules that will describe and predict how

443
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,500
we will simplify visual input.

444
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,980
So one we've seen before, the law of closure, which is what turns the dots into a circle.

445
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,060
Another of the Gestalt laws of grouping is the law of continuity, which says that we

446
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,740
will group together objects that follow an established direction.

447
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,340
So it's hard for us to make sense of this, where the cars are sorted alphabetically.

448
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,700
In fact, you will psychologically recoil from this chart.

449
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,020
You're like, I have to do work.

450
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,140
This is so unpleasant.

451
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,140
But if we sort them by efficiency, it becomes effortless for us to do all of Cleveland's

452
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,540
estimation operations, discrimination, ranking, and race showing.

453
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,260
So that's another observation, that good plots organize the data to take advantage of continuity

454
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,380
and to help the viewer assemble an overall Gestalt.

455
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,980
This is also happening when we make a scatter plot, like this one from the car's data showing

456
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,100
the relationship between the weight of a car and its efficiency as weight increases, efficiency

457
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
decreases.

458
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,940
Notice that the continuity does not have to be perfect.

459
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,940
It just has to be suggestive.

460
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,180
But we can add more information to the scatter plot.

461
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,580
We can use Hue to encode the number of cylinders in the engine of each car.

462
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,220
If we do that, you can easily pick out that there are three distinct groups of points.

463
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,500
So what's happening here is we're leveraging the law of similarity, which says that we tend

464
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,900
to see elements that are physically similar to each other as part of the same object,

465
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,540
and then things that are different as parts of different objects.

466
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,660
We use this all the time to put categorical information on charts, and there are lots

467
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,340
of different ways to encode categorical information.

468
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,180
Not all encodings are equally good.

469
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,300
So here I'm just using shape, and this is pretty clearly worse than color.

470
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,620
But if we use different shapes, it's much better, right?

471
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:00,980
This works so well because your eye is really good at picking out differences in curvature.

472
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,740
In fact, you can use degree of curvature to encode quantitative information.

473
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,820
It's not in the list of seven that I showed earlier, but I think it's about tied with

474
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
angle.

475
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,820
So the circles, they really pop out, and as we learned before, we're also pretty good

476
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:21,900
at detecting the slopes of lines, and so the triangles stand out from the little plus signs.

477
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,660
To see what I mean about curvature, here's an encoding that you'd think would work really

478
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,340
well, but it's terrible because the curvature of the sixes is too much like the curvature

479
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,220
of the eights.

480
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,740
And there's no good reason to, you can't use two channels to encode the same information

481
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
redundantly.

482
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,180
In fact, that's often a good choice, and we can even take this a step further.

483
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,500
We can add a linear model to each subset of the data, and now we're taking advantage of

484
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,660
another Gestalt grouping law by enclosing regions of space.

485
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,580
Okay, the last grouping law I want to talk about is the law of proximity, which says

486
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,340
that we tend to group elements that are near each other into a complete object.

487
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,500
So proximity is a very strong grouping principle.

488
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,700
This is the same diamonds data I was showing before as a stacked bar chart, but now instead

489
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:16,300
of stacking the bars, I've dodged them from side to side so that they don't overlap.

490
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:22,540
Proximity strongly encourages you to make eight objects from this image, one for each

491
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,220
level of clarity.

492
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,380
I personally find it very difficult to assemble the Gestalt of the blue bars and then compare

493
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,100
them with the greenish bars.

494
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:39,120
And again, the solution is to just use a parallel coordinates plot where you can very easily

495
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,820
see the rise and fall of each cut, and you can compare the shape of each cut to the others.

496
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,420
So another observation is that dodged bar charts are pretty much always a bad idea.

497
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,420
They allow you to do two things, but neither of them well.

498
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:01,020
Okay, now I want to move back up to the top, to the first of Cleveland's three operations

499
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,380
of pattern perception.

500
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,040
I want to talk about detection.

501
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,300
Detection is the operation of recognizing that a geometric object encodes a physical

502
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,300
value.

503
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,060
And so most trivially, it's the recognition that each point in this scatter plot represents

504
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,900
a car and encodes both the fuel efficiency and the weight of the car.

505
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,740
So I say that detection is trivial, but it's not.

506
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,780
Lots of people, the only charts they ever see are time series charts where a line moves

507
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,580
from left to right, encoding a metric over time.

508
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,780
If you show those people any other kind of chart, they are going to have to go to some

509
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,860
effort to try to figure out what the different shapes mean and how the image is conveying

510
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,420
information.

511
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,340
It is very easy to make it harder than it needs to be.

512
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,180
So most commonly, people give too little visual weight to the objects that are encoding the

513
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,140
data, either by having too little luminance contrast between the foreground and the background,

514
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,740
or by making the objects encoding the data too small.

515
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,100
Another problem is introducing other objects that compete with the data, like the lines

516
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,940
for a grid and a border around the plot area.

517
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,520
So that's not so bad, but if I amp it up a little bit, it gets really bad really quickly.

518
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,960
In the extreme, you start to introduce visual artifacts that aren't even real.

519
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,800
So for example, do you see the faint gray circles in the intersections of the lines?

520
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
That's an illusion, the name of which is escaping me right now.

521
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,520
It's named after a German fellow.

522
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,320
It's worth noting that in this regard, Excel's defaults are pretty bad.

523
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,440
So the default is to have only horizontal grid lines, I don't know why, and for them

524
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,440
to be fully saturated, and I get those same little gray dots where the blue line intersects

525
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,840
the grid lines.

526
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,120
So another observation is the detection is perhaps not as trivial as it might seem.

527
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,720
Be sure that the data has a lot of contrast with the background, and if you include grid

528
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,920
lines, make them muted so that they don't interfere with detection.

529
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,360
As Tufti says, above all else, show the data.

530
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,520
So talking about grid lines brings me to part five.

531
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,520
This is actually my favorite part, so I'm glad you stayed to the end.

532
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,720
In this part, I want to review a few more useful results from psychology research.

533
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,920
And the first one, this is my favorite part, Weber's law, which says that the just noticeable

534
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,960
difference, the smallest difference that you can detect between two things is proportional

535
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,720
to the size or the intensity of those two things.

536
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,240
That it's proportional is really surprising.

537
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,320
So this statement is extremely abstract, I'll make it more concrete.

538
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,520
If I gave you two weights, one of which was 10 kilograms, the other of which was 20 kilograms,

539
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,960
you would very easily be able to tell me which one was heavier.

540
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,760
But if I gave you two more weights, one of which was 100 kilograms and one of which was

541
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,840
110, you would have a much harder time telling me if they were the same or if they were different.

542
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,560
And so even though the absolute difference is the same, 10 kilograms in each case, the

543
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,520
top comparison, the heavier one is double the weight, and in the bottom it's only 10%.

544
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,680
10% is about the just noticeable difference.

545
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,400
Another example are these two lines the same length, they're different.

546
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,680
It's hard to tell, maybe if you work at it, they're different.

547
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,240
What if I put these little blue boxes on, or the blue boxes different or the same?

548
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,160
Super easy to tell that they're different.

549
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,280
It turns out that the total height of each bar is the same, 12 units.

550
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,840
And so that means that the difference between the two white bars is exactly the same as

551
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,040
the two blue bars in absolute terms, but you can distinguish between the blue bars because

552
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,520
the difference is large compared to their size.

553
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,920
So now we have another observation, Weber's law is why grid lines are useful, excuse me.

554
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,360
And Weber's law dictates the use of grid lines, how many you should have and whether or not

555
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,720
you should have them at all.

556
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,160
So here are eight curves all plotting the same class of function with different parameters.

557
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,400
So of this pair, which one dips down lower?

558
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Hard to tell.

559
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay.

560
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
How about now?

561
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,720
It's trivial.

562
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,120
It's easy because putting that dip in a much smaller box makes the just noticeable difference

563
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,000
proportionately smaller.

564
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,480
So here's another Tufti quote, erase non-data ink.

565
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
People sometimes take this to mean that you should erase grid lines because grid lines

566
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,360
aren't data, right?

567
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,520
This is a misquote.

568
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,320
What Tufti really wrote is erase non-data ink within reason.

569
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,320
My version is erase non-data ink that interferes with detection or doesn't assist with assembly

570
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,120
or estimation, which is not as pithy as Tufti, but perhaps a little more accurate.

571
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Okay.

572
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,560
New topic, another interesting result is that you are best at detecting variation in slope

573
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,240
near 45 degrees.

574
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,280
So this is the same data plotted three different ways and the change in slope is most obvious

575
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,280
when the line is near 45 degrees, which brings up a super useful idea called banking to 45.

576
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,640
The idea of banking to 45 is that you should set the aspect ratio of your plot so that

577
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,560
the average slope is 45 degrees.

578
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,040
Here's a demonstration.

579
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,320
This plot shows the monthly average sunspot number.

580
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,360
The raw data is the partly saturated white points and a smooth series is then laid over

581
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,680
in blue.

582
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,160
From this data, about all you can tell is that sunspots have some kind of cycle and

583
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,520
the peak of that cycle is varied over time.

584
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,040
But if I break the series up into three 55-year chunks and then I stretch them out, then you

585
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,840
can see a lot more nuance in the onset and the decay of each cycle.

586
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,000
It looks like maybe the onset is more sharp and then the decline is more gradual.

587
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,800
I'd never have been able to see that in the original chart.

588
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,200
And so a good rule of thumb is to set the aspect ratio of your plots so that the average

589
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,640
line segment is roughly 45 degrees.

590
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,040
You don't have to get all scientific about it.

591
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,920
You can just eyeball it and it'll be fine.

592
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,280
This data brings up another aside, which is, should I include zero on my scale?

593
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,200
This is the panel that was at the lower left.

594
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,800
To make it so flat, all I did was extend the y-axis down to 800,000.

595
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,520
If I extend the y-axis all the way down to zero, you have a really hard time seeing the

596
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
variation.

597
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,280
So the real answer to whether or not you should include zero on your scale is it depends.

598
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,760
Here's the truth as compact as I can make it.

599
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,760
If your encoding relies on intensity for accurate estimation, then you have to include zero

600
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,200
in your scale.

601
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
On the other hand, you're using position.

602
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
It's up to you.

603
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,520
So this is the saturation chart before, relies on pre-attentive judgment of intensity of

604
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,360
position, so it has to go to zero.

605
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,720
Same deal with area, with the dot plot, I'm using position.

606
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,320
I'm free to clip the x-axis at 10.

607
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,480
In fact, it's a good idea to do so because it gives you more resolution.

608
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,480
With bars, people sometimes argue that what the viewer is doing with a bar chart is they're

609
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,040
comparing the position of the end of the bars.

610
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,560
I say that's a mistake.

611
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,120
What you're actually encouraging the user to do with a bar chart is to compare lengths.

612
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,520
In a bar chart, the axis has to start at zero because if you don't, you're going to mislead

613
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,640
your users.

614
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Here's a bar chart.

615
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
You can't see the variation.

616
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,080
If you abandon the bars, then it's completely obvious.

617
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,680
Above all else, show the data, or I say show the variation in the data.

618
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,160
I have negative 30 seconds.

619
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,760
I want to say just two words about tools.

620
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,560
Every plot in this talk was made using the ggplot2 library in R, which is the best graphing

621
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,040
toolset that I have ever used by far.

622
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,040
If you want to learn more about it, I've published the source code to all these charts as our

623
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,880
markdown document on GitHub, and I have put the rendered document up on our pubs.

624
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,760
I'll also put this presentation up on SlideShare.

625
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,560
I will tweet all these links under my username, Jay Rouser.

626
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
That's all I have.
