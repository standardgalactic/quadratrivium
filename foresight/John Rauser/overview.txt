Processing Overview for John Rauser
============================
Checking John Rauser/How Humans See Data - John Rauser - Velocity Amsterdam 2016.txt
1. **Data Ink vs. Non-Data Ink**: The principle that ink on a chart should either carry data or aid in the interpretation of data. Ink that doesn't serve either purpose can be considered non-data ink and should be minimized or eliminated.

2. **Slope Perception**: Humans are particularly good at detecting variation in slope, especially when the line is near 45 degrees. This is due to our ability to judge angles effectively.

3. **Banking to 45**: To maximize the visibility of data trends, it's often beneficial to plot lines so that their average slope is approximately 45 degrees by adjusting the aspect ratio of the plot.

4. **Sunspot Data Example**: Demonstrating the sunspot number data over time, showing how different segments can be more clearly analyzed when extended and plotted with a focus on the average slope being 45 degrees.

5. **Plot Scales**: The choice of including zero on a plot's scale depends on whether intensity or position is used to communicate data. If intensity is key, include zero; if position is key, it can be omitted if it enhances resolution and clarity.

6. **Bar Charts**: Bar charts should always start at zero because this format encourages comparison of lengths rather than positions, to avoid misleading the viewer.

7. **Tools**: The presentation was created using the ggplot2 library in R, a powerful toolset for data visualization. The source code and rendered plots are available on GitHub and the presentation will be shared on SlideShare.

8. **Final Takeaway**: Always prioritize clear and accurate representation of data in your visualizations to ensure the viewer can effectively understand and analyze the information being presented.
