1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
All right, so we are now in Wonderworks here. Let's check this place out.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,440
Oh, we got one of these things. I know how much Morgan loves these.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,120
All right, you go first.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
They can actually see it underneath, too.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,320
Whoo! I'm already dizzy.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:44,000
Whoo-hoo!

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,040
I did one of these at the entertainment junction the other day, a couple weeks ago, I guess.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,720
Whoo!

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,120
Yeah, I love those things.

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,720
I'm like all dizzy.

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,160
All right, so I guess that's like the entrance to like all the exhibits here.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,360
Pretty cool.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,680
It's like one big tunnel.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Yeah.

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Like an earthquake simulator or something.

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh,

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:10,400
here we are.
