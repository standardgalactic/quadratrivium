All right, so we are now in Wonderworks here. Let's check this place out.
Oh, we got one of these things. I know how much Morgan loves these.
All right, you go first.
They can actually see it underneath, too.
Whoo! I'm already dizzy.
Whoo-hoo!
I did one of these at the entertainment junction the other day, a couple weeks ago, I guess.
Whoo!
Yeah, I love those things.
I'm like all dizzy.
All right, so I guess that's like the entrance to like all the exhibits here.
Pretty cool.
It's like one big tunnel.
Yeah.
Like an earthquake simulator or something.
Oh,
here we are.
