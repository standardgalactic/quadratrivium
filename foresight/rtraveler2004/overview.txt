Checking rtraveler2004/entering through the spinning tunnel into Wonderworks in Pigeon Forge (May 10th, 2017).txt
 It appears you and a companion have just arrived at WonderWorks, an interactive science museum with an upside-down exterior designed to look like a hurricane hit a traditional funnel of academic buildings. Upon entering, you encountered one of the popular attractionsâ€”a large vertical rotation device. Your excitement about this exhibit is evident as it made both of you feel dizzy after your turn on it. You mention that you had previously enjoyed a similar experience at the Entertainment Junction a couple of weeks prior. As you moved through the entrance, you noted its design as a large tunnel, which may have included an earthquake simulator or similar attraction. You were both impressed and excited to explore the rest of the exhibits within WonderWorks.
