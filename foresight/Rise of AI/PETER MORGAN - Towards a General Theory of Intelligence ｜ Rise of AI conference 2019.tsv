0	19560	Hi everybody, I'm Peter Morgan, so I represent a company called Deep Learning Partnership
19560	26480	which is an AI consulting company, so it's plain old deep learning for my bread and butter.
26480	34800	But today I'm going to talk outside of that into what I see as the future.
34800	43320	So here's a little book that I wrote for O'Reilly, it's free to download, so go ahead, machine
43320	48040	learning is changing the rules, there's my company website, there's my Twitter handle.
48040	53960	I tweet on sort of what I'm going to be talking about today a lot, so you can sort of keep
53960	57680	up to date if you so desire.
57680	60240	So what am I going to talk about?
60240	65760	So what is intelligence, a good place to start, if we're trying to solve it, we need to ask
65760	70400	what it is, figure out exactly what it is we're trying to solve.
70400	77960	So I'll start by outlining what I think intelligence is, I'll answer that question today.
77960	83000	And then we'll look at physical systems, biological, non-biological, so the non-biological ones
83000	94400	being computers, silicon, that type of thing, biological systems being us, we are what we
94400	100040	are trying to model, this is it, we're trying to model the human brain.
100040	106600	And not only the human brain, but how biology does intelligence, how biology does intelligence.
106720	113920	The aim of my talk is to describe that and a system that might actually build it.
113920	119760	And then we'll do a quick recap, a very quick recap on deep learning, because I've just
119760	125520	tried to convey that, you know, biology isn't actually deep learning at all, and a lot of
125520	130600	the talks today, particularly the neuroscience talk I saw earlier before lunch, made that
130600	137160	very clear, we're not deep learning won't get us to intelligence, right?
137160	141520	And I'll explain exactly why, well basically it's statistical in what we want as a physical
141520	143040	theory of intelligence, right?
143040	147280	So I'll go more into the physics and the neuroscience.
147280	154360	Finally we'll have a look at a theory of AGI, and I'll talk about that, so that's the very
154360	155760	end of the talk.
155760	165200	Okay, so without further ado, if, yeah, so why do we, okay, hopefully the clicker will
165200	166200	work.
166200	170640	So why do we want to build AGI, well we want to solve intelligence, we want to understand
170640	176840	intelligence, so we want to build systems that we can use to do all these tasks and
176840	183800	then make money from that, or just do all the automate all the boring stuff, and ultimately
183800	186800	if it's general intelligence, we can automate everything.
186800	193240	So then we got to ask, you know, philosophically what do we do, right, if we build these systems,
193240	197240	and my answer to that is we'll just get back to being more human, right?
197240	203360	We won't have to work in factories and production lines, and you know, even though we, a lot
203360	206920	of people have convinced themselves, you know, this is what the true meaning of life is,
206920	211240	I don't buy it, so once we build it, it'll become more obvious what we'll have to do
211240	212240	with ourselves.
212240	216280	Okay, nothing to get too worried about, okay.
216280	220840	I'm not a doomsayer, I'm not here to say, oh my God, you know, the world's ending.
220840	224720	But you know, the conversation at some point always goes there, so I thought I'd just get
224720	226920	that out of the way at the beginning.
226920	231360	So let's focus on trying to build it for the rest of the talk.
231360	233880	So what is general intelligence?
233880	239800	Are any of these, general intelligence, AlphaGo, AlphaStar, playing StarCraft from DeepMind,
239800	244000	you know, I've come over from London where DeepMind are based, the Google company, DeepBlue
244000	252280	from IBM, back in the late 90s, IBM Watson, winning at Jeopardy, natural language processing,
252280	255800	none of those are even close to general intelligence.
255800	259600	They do very specific things, they're completely dumb, they're completely stupid, they use
259600	264040	statistical methods, so no, they're super clever, it's like they can totally outperform
264040	268360	us just like a calculator outperforms us with multiplication, right?
268360	273240	So not dismissing it entirely, but it's not general intelligence, that's not what I'm
273240	275000	here to talk about.
275000	279680	That's what DeepMind does, it's not what I'm trying to do, although ultimately they do
279680	283800	want to do that, and they've said that very, very, very clearly.
283800	286400	But right now they're not doing it.
286400	287400	So what is intelligence?
287400	290680	Well here's the answer, it's not one thing, it's many things.
290680	296720	So it's basically we are agents in our environment, so it's our adaptation to our environment.
296720	300720	If we were living in a different universe with different laws of physics, gravity goes
300720	305000	up instead of down, we would be adapted to that, and so that would be, our intelligence
305000	308880	would be adapted to that environment, okay?
308880	313600	So it's simply adapting to our environment, exploiting our environment, modeling our
313600	318440	environment and predicting, successfully predicting what's going to happen next in our environment.
318440	322160	If you think about it, it just kind of boils down, it's, you know, deflate everything
322160	325400	right now, it just kind of boils down to that, whether we're trying to win the lottery or
325400	330040	build a rocket to the moon, or even build journal intelligence, we're just trying to
330040	331320	model our environment.
331320	334960	It just so happens that we're trying to model our brain, okay, with journal intelligence.
334960	338520	So we've done a pretty good job, you know, we've done, you know, the laws of physics,
338520	344280	we've had Newton, we've had Einstein, we've had Feynman, we've had some super clever computer
344280	348480	scientists, biologists, neuroscientists, but it's all the same thing, we're just trying
348480	353040	to model, just trying to model our environment, okay?
353040	357680	So it's not just Einstein, that's not the only thing that has to do with intelligence,
357680	363720	it's spatially, you know, we have athletes, you know, that are way better than Einstein
363720	365240	at doing the high jump, right?
365240	369560	So he was crap at that, but very good at modeling general relativity.
369560	374080	But when it came to hurling himself over a high bar at seven feet, you know, he would
374080	375600	just fail miserably.
375600	380120	When the high jumper goes to solve, you know, to understand the universe right down mathematically,
380120	381120	he would fail.
381400	384880	There's not one type of intelligence, okay, there's many.
384880	388560	And that's what the G and AGI stands for, it's general, okay?
388560	393880	So we're trying to build things that are spatially intelligent, aware of the environment, we're
393880	399120	not doing a very good job there, are we, with climate change and everything like that, Donald
399120	401240	Trump, blah, blah, blah, right?
401240	405520	So, you know, that's, for me, is a big part of intelligence is to understanding our environment,
405520	408800	not destroying our environment, but, you know, kind of living in harmony, that might be a
408880	414520	definition in naturalist intelligence, not getting too political, but, you know, that's
414520	415520	what I believe.
415520	424080	Musical, you know, Mozart, Beethoven, the Beatles, whatever type of music you like, and
424080	428680	I've managed to turn that off, that is a type of musical intelligence.
428680	433480	Not everyone can create, write a beautiful melody or a symphony, but some people can,
433480	434480	right?
435000	439680	These are all the different types of intelligence, linguistic, you know, Shakespeare, or, you
439680	446160	know, who can write a great poem, et cetera, et cetera, interpersonal people relationships,
446160	453160	how we relate to one another, social intelligence, emotional intelligence, introspection, how
453160	459200	we understand ourselves, you know, how we react in society, how we go about, you know,
459440	465760	place in the world, and then you build it up hierarchically into nations, you know,
465760	469640	do we go to war, do we not, I mean, how do we keep peace internationally?
469640	473880	These are all different types of intelligence that these machines will have to do if they're
473880	476080	truly general intelligence, okay?
476080	479360	So it's not just the building the Einstein, you can see that now, it's everything.
479360	483920	It's physical, it's political, it's social, it's emotional, okay?
483920	488400	A big ask, a big ask, but we do that in three pounds in our skull, right?
488440	493120	So biology has done it, using 100 billion neurons, roughly, somebody said 86 billion,
493120	499760	but it's of that order of magnitude, and perhaps it's the connections, 1,000 to 10,000 synapses
499760	503000	per neuron, so it's a very complex system.
503000	507200	So it's no wonder, you know, we can't give ourselves too hard a time that we haven't
507200	512400	built it yet, because, you know, it's complex, and also, you know, the earth's 4 billion
512400	518120	years old, we've had a few years, okay, we didn't just come up with this stuff yesterday,
518120	522800	you know, we can go back 10,000 years, 20,000 years, we were pretty much living in caves,
522800	523800	right?
523800	527840	It's only the last 100 or so years that we've kind of, you know, hit this exponential where
527840	531400	we're taking off, and the singularity is there, and all that kind of stuff, right?
531400	536040	So we're living in very interesting times, but this is where intelligence has brought
536040	540080	us, and this is where we are, we're sitting in this conference talking about it, right?
540080	543880	We wouldn't have been doing this maybe even 10 years ago, okay?
543880	545200	So we're ready to build it.
545200	546720	How far have we come?
546720	549280	I would argue not very far.
549280	554080	All these talks we've seen today have all been about deep learning and statistical methods.
554080	560560	The best we've done, I think, is around 50% for logical, mathematical, linguistic.
560560	563720	The last talk was on BERT, it's super impressive stuff.
563720	569480	There's GPT2 with open AI, there's BERT with Google, you know, Facebook, Microsoft, everyone,
569480	574560	all the big tech companies are plowing ahead with these statistical methods, but there's
574600	578880	nothing to do with general intelligence, so, you know, statistics will only get us so far,
578880	579880	right?
579880	583680	And in fact, when it comes to introspection, thinking about the universe, they're actually
583680	585800	zero, they're not even off the ground, okay?
585800	589880	They haven't even started, haven't even begun, and they never will do because it's, statistics
589880	591640	won't do it.
591640	593160	Physics will, statistics won't.
593160	598640	I'm not trying to discredit anyone here, I'm just trying to focus on general intelligence,
598640	599640	okay?
599640	601400	Okay, so how will we get there?
601440	606160	Well, it takes a village to create an AGI, just as it takes a village to raise a child,
606160	607160	right?
607160	610560	It's going to take a village to build these things, so it's not just physicists, it's
610560	615680	not just computer scientists, it's not just, you know, psychologists, it's all of us together,
615680	621680	so it's neuroscientists, psychologists, physicists, computer scientists, everybody, politicians,
621680	626320	because this is general intelligence, we need everybody in the room together.
627320	634560	Okay, so, you know, so physically, you know, biology, biologically and non-biologically,
634560	641680	let's have a, take a look at, you know, how, how physically intelligence manifests, okay?
641680	650960	So, biology, very clever, we start with bacteria, no, no central nervous system, no neurons,
650960	655400	nothing, and yet they survive, they reproduce, they're intelligent, okay?
655400	658640	They're much more intelligent than us, maybe they'll survive longer than us, the rate we're
658640	664200	going, I'm not putting my bets right now, so, you know, that is intelligence without
664200	669360	even a single neuron anywhere to be seen, so they're using chemical gradients, they're
669360	674160	just using the laws of physics to wiggle and wobble about, but they've learned how to reproduce,
674160	675560	create DNA and reproduce.
675560	681880	They haven't learned anything, right, that's a, that's an anthropomorphism, you know, this
681880	689480	is, this is what the laws of physics can do and has done, you know, in terms of biology.
689480	695360	The first thing with the central nervous system is the C. elegans, I think it has 130 odd
695360	702520	neurons, so arguably this is the dumbest thing with the central nervous system, so, but yet
702520	707880	it can, you know, understand, it can survive, it eats, it reproduces, the bumblebee has
707880	713160	about a million neurons, this is how biology does things, it can navigate, it does its
713160	719400	wiggle dance, it's societal, it lives in a society, and right up to us, the brain, the
719400	725200	human brain in fact, you know, you've got all the mammal elephants, fish, chimpanzees,
725200	732240	us, right, so there's a whole spectrum here of intelligence, you know, assuming, assuming
732600	738480	we'll start with the, you know, the simplest systems and build up, but is there something
738480	745360	here that unites these, all of these systems here, you know, because I'm interested in
745360	750240	understanding theoretically what intelligence is, in other words, you know, writing down
750240	755400	the mathematical equations that we will use to guide us when we build these things, okay,
755400	760120	not just sort of trying, does this work, does this work, I'll add another neuron, another
760120	764360	layer to my deep neural network, I want to understand the basic physical, the physics
764360	770840	of intelligence, or, you know, we do as a community, the AGI community, okay, so the
770840	777680	first thing we notice is that biology is hierarchical, we start off with atoms, they're certainly
777680	783680	not intelligent, molecules, neurons, they're not intelligent unto themselves, but when
783680	788920	you start connecting these things together, they connect home, then intelligence emerges
788920	795360	from there, and then we have us, you know, agents, and then we have societies and nations
795360	802800	and finally the world, so, you know, the whole thing is hierarchical from atoms up to nations,
802800	808320	so this general theory will have to explain the whole lot, okay, so it's a big ask, right,
808320	812320	we're actually trying to describe the whole thing and not just bits of it, okay, so just
812320	817080	to kind of sort of expand your mind, put it all in perspective.
817080	821420	So we're coming up with a truly general theory of intelligence, and that's what a neuron
821420	825760	looks like, it's super complex, do we need to go to this level, you know, there's a lot
825760	832800	of open questions, we don't know, we'll see, okay, we'll just see, nature does, clearly,
832800	838080	because that's what a neuron looks like, but when we build these systems will we have to,
838080	843160	it's a very, very, very interesting and open question right now, okay, but it won't stop
843160	846680	us perhaps coming up with the underlying theory.
846680	850920	So this is what a brain looks like, this is what intelligence looks like, it's organized
850920	857320	into structures, repeating structures of about two million neurons in these so-called cortical
857320	864320	columns, again and over and over and over again, so if somebody goes blind, God forbid,
864320	870360	some of those neurons that we use to process visual information are quickly repurposed
870400	877240	into processing sound, okay, so the kind of general, there's a generality there, these
877240	883120	are just information, these are information processing systems that seem to have some
883120	888880	sort of generality, so we do know that, that's something we do know so far, and I'm going
888880	894680	up the hierarchy here, here's the connectome, so it's all connected, besides these tens
894680	899960	of tens of thousands of synapses between each neuron, these things are organized into
899960	904520	some larger, if you go up one level in this hierarchy, then you start to see this connectome
904520	909720	forming, whether that's in humans or even bees, you know, there's this layer above
909720	915480	the neuron set, maybe that's the right layer to start with, okay, and then above that then
915480	922160	that's attached to a central nervous system and all living beings, a fish, a bee, a human,
922160	927480	so it's not just a brain and a jar, although some might argue Stephen Hawking was kind
927480	931440	of that because he had that terrible disease and there are people, so we can function like
931440	936520	that, but we're really interested in building the whole physical as well, but the brain
936520	940600	is the main thing, once we've cracked that, we've cracked intelligence, I'm just saying
940600	947200	we connect it to the rest of our system, do we need kidneys? I doubt it, I doubt we'll
947200	953520	have this thing, a system with kidneys and lungs and everything else, right, but that's
953520	959800	how biology has done it in every single thing, so there's this other part, 90%, you know,
959800	964400	which I think we need to worry about the brain more than the rest of it, but the rest of
964400	969920	it's super clever, but kind of clunky, it's just, nature's put us together like that,
969920	975440	we may not need to go down to that, consider that so much, but if we're building robotics
975560	983120	we will, but a robot might not have kidneys, but it needs to be able to move around fluidly,
983120	987600	and we haven't quite got that yet, even though Atlas does nice backflips and super, I mean
987600	992880	it's getting pretty good, isn't it, every month Boston Dynamics comes out with a new
992880	999160	video, it's like, oh my God, it's like so human, and then they beat themselves, but
999160	1005400	it's not intelligent, it can't play chess, it can't ponder the universe, its own existence,
1005600	1008880	it doesn't even know it's alive, that's how dumb it is, but it's very good with the
1008880	1014920	physical part, okay, that's all part of intelligence, and then the social systems, we talk about
1014920	1025000	cloud robotics, form robotics, social intelligence, that's the final layer, okay, so here's where
1025000	1030280	we are with the non-biological, you know, we've started off with CPUs of von Neumann
1030320	1036560	architecture we've heard about today, separating the processing from the memory, and then we've
1036560	1040600	also heard that biology doesn't do that, it does the processing in the memory on the
1040600	1046240	same thing, Neuron is both a memory and a processor, so none of these, there's this
1046240	1051520	little von Neumann architecture, okay, so that's what it looks like, it's beautiful,
1051520	1056720	we saw a picture of a TPU version 3 in the last slide, it's like a supercomputer, it
1056720	1064840	does like a petaflop or something or more, graph core, there's 100 petaflops in like
1064840	1069680	eight racks, you know, that's the world's most powerful supercomputer, almost, not quite,
1069680	1075360	but it's getting up there, so these are ASICs, they're specifically designed to multiply
1075360	1080600	huge matrix, billion by billion matrices together, which the brain isn't doing clearly, and you
1080600	1084240	know, that's how many times bigger than the brain is that, right, it's got nothing to
1084280	1088520	do with general intelligence, but it's super good at multiplying, it's good at linear algebra,
1088520	1095680	it'll statistically, you know, calculate things, that's why BERT will get statistically brilliant,
1095680	1100560	but it'll never understand Shakespeare, because it can't, because it's linear algebra, right,
1100560	1106560	linear algebra doesn't do that, okay, and there is the world's biggest, it's 3x a flop,
1106560	1114240	it's summit, chock full of GPUs and I think AMD processors, super impressive, but it's
1114240	1120160	as dumb as a brick, right, doesn't do anything, it's a big calculator, so what are we missing,
1120160	1128320	so we do all that in three pound, right, we don't need three football fields or 10 megawatts,
1129600	1135840	we need a couple of sandwiches and apple and a drink, you know, and we can discover the laws
1135840	1144400	of the universe, okay, so clearly we're not even close by any of those other approaches,
1144400	1151600	maybe one approach in hardware is neuromorphic computing, which stated aim is to replicate
1151600	1156320	the brain, okay, in hardware, and so there's a project called Spinnaker, part of the human
1156320	1161120	brain project, which is doing that, Steve Furber, who was part of ARM, based at University of
1161120	1167200	Manchester, been working for the last 20 years, he's built, their team there have built, now under
1167200	1172720	the wing of the human brain project, have built, I think, a billion artificial neurons, so they're
1172720	1181280	analog, they process the information using analog, not digital, and it's more, it's not the von Neumann,
1181280	1187280	it's kind of combined, so they call that memristors, where the memory and the processing is combined in
1187280	1192480	the same place, and the architecture looks completely different, there it is, that's a
1192480	1197920	billion neurons right there, so immediately we see, you know, it's a little bit smaller than
1197920	1206480	the others, that's all analog computing, and that's what it looks like, so yeah, we start off with
1206480	1211680	a thousand neurons per core, and then we put them into chips, and it's hierarchical, then we put 48
1211680	1217120	chips on a board, 24 boards in a rack, we have 10 racks, right, and that's sitting in a data center
1217120	1222640	in Manchester today, and you can log in now if you want to, set up an account, log in and start
1222640	1229040	processing stuff using neuromorphic computing, and you can put in the MNIST data set, you can
1229040	1234480	place a doku, you can play chess, and it doesn't do deep learning at all, it's processing it with
1234480	1240000	neuromorphic algorithms and hardware, okay, so for me this is definitely a step in the right
1240000	1245120	direction, so hardware is important, it's not everything, obviously the algorithms need to be
1245120	1250400	there as well, but I think we need to be running it on the right hardware, otherwise it's a simulation,
1250400	1255040	you can always simulate anything on a chip, but you need, you know, they've done that in the human
1255040	1261600	brain project using, you know, the von Neumann architecture, I think they processed a second
1261600	1267200	of what the brain can do, it took them like a week in the whole data center, so you know,
1267200	1271520	you can always simulate things, but it's not efficient, so you can actually simulate in real
1271520	1276160	time using this neuromorphic architecture, because it runs efficiently like the brain,
1276160	1282960	I think it's about a thousand times less efficient than biology, whereas the CPUs and
1282960	1288640	everything else that we saw, digital is about a million times less efficient, so it's definitely
1288640	1293360	a step, and this is the first generation, so we're going to iterate just like we did with the CPU
1293360	1298640	processing and the digital, we've had 50 years, we've got 10 billion transistors on a thing,
1298640	1303760	a centimeter big, right, so we'll do the same with neuromorphic, we'll have generation upon
1303760	1308640	generation, and soon we'll have 100 billion neurons, because it's Moore's law, it's exponential,
1309200	1315760	and we will see, you know, sort of human level intelligence, whether it will be sentient and
1316880	1322000	is down to the algorithms, actually, so I think we have the hardware, we're at the very beginning
1322000	1326560	of this journey with the hardware, but we need algorithms, so let's look at the algorithms, so
1327120	1330880	that's another one, the brain scales, that's the University of Heidelberg here in Germany,
1330880	1335920	that's part of the human brain project as a spinnaker versus the Google TPUs, I would argue
1335920	1341280	the one on the left with neuromorphic is the right hardware to be working on for general
1341280	1346160	intelligence, okay, and it's quantum computing, nothing to do with how the brain works, but,
1346160	1351520	you know, sexy pictures, so I put it up there, and it is, it is like the last form of computing,
1351600	1356320	right, you cannot forget it, it's a big deal, it's going to come online, but I don't think it will be,
1357120	1362480	you know, used to, you know, understand nature too well, I think biology doesn't use it, so I
1362480	1366800	doubt we might have to go to the quantum level, but the quantum will be very important in other
1366800	1372560	aspects, perhaps not general intelligence, okay, so there's the four summary of everything I've
1372560	1377360	talked about, the four different types of hardware, the digital, the neuromorphic, quantum, and then
1377360	1385920	biology, right, so we want to try to build the thing in the lower right hand corner here,
1385920	1392160	and I think neuromorphic is getting, that's the way we'll do it, and that's what they look like,
1392160	1396800	okay, so the brain, you see the similarity a little bit, the neurons in the brain, the digital,
1396800	1401520	the neuromorphic, and quantum looks a bit out on its own weird, but ultimately it's these little
1401520	1408400	units of information processing, okay, and then the data center of the future won't just be classical
1408400	1416880	computing, it'll be a mix of quantum, neuromorphic, and classical, so deep learning, quick recap,
1416880	1422000	that's what it looks like, this is what general intelligence isn't, so it's not that, it's not
1422000	1429280	that, and that's, you know, deep learning is not AGI, so AGI is linear algebra, so you know,
1429280	1433680	you're just summing up the weights times these vectors, and billion by billion matrices,
1433680	1439680	it does not give us a neuron, absolutely, not even close, but never will do, and it was never,
1439680	1444000	it was never meant to, to be honest, if you talk to the researchers like Jan Lacoon and Jeff Hinton,
1444000	1449360	they, we're not trying to imitate the brain at all, we just found the stuff that works really well,
1449360	1454880	but, and then Jeff Hinton, he's in my last slide, says that, you know, if we think really hard about
1454880	1459280	how nature does it, biology will, that's how we're going to do it, and he's recently said,
1459280	1462720	everything I've ever done on deep learning is sort of, I'm going to have to put that to one
1462720	1466960	side now, because to get to the next level, and I saw a slide in some other presentation today,
1468080	1471840	you know, it's starting to get a bit mainstream now, you know, deep learning is running out of
1471840	1476480	steam, you know, we can maybe tweak the knobs and get another two or three percent of accuracy,
1476480	1480320	but yeah, where do we go, it's not general, it's very specific, it's not going to give us those
1480320	1485360	nine types of intelligence, and I think that's what people are trying to say, even though they
1485360	1490400	don't quite realize perhaps what they're saying, but that thing on the left is what we're trying to
1490400	1495920	build, not that little bit of linear algebra on the right. Okay, so what is the theory, okay,
1496800	1501040	you know, I'd be, I could just walk off the stage now and say, ah, you know, we don't,
1501040	1507280	I don't know, thanks for coming, you know, spending all your money, but I'll try, I'll try, I'll give
1507840	1516160	you something, a bit more than that, so let's see, so I mentioned earlier that it's not statistical,
1516160	1521040	right, so what is it, it's physics, right, everything is built using the laws of physics,
1521040	1526480	so why not the brain, right, why not, let's start there, it's nice and simple, so what do we know
1526480	1531760	about physics, right, well we know Newton's laws, we know relativity, we know general relativity,
1531760	1537440	we have Maxwell's equations from last century, we're standing on shoulders of so many giants
1537440	1543040	here, Maxwell, Newton, you know, all the greats, Helmholtz, Boltzmann, Gibbs, you know, we got the
1543040	1549280	laws of thermodynamics, we got quantum mechanics, we don't think we'll need that, but we still have
1549280	1552800	it, we have relevance at quantum mechanics, we have dark energy, we have stuff we don't know,
1552800	1557600	dark energy, dark matter, we're probably not involved with intelligence, the thing is that
1557600	1562160	all of that can be encapsulated in something called the principle of least action,
1563280	1569920	which says that nature behaves to minimize the free energy of any system, you know,
1570640	1575440	whether that's microscopic or macroscopic, whether it's a millisecond, a nanosecond,
1575440	1580240	or the age of the universe, there's this fundamental underlying principle of physics,
1580240	1585520	if you did a PhD in physics, who did a PhD in physics, yes, so a couple of people here
1585520	1589920	will have seen this principle of least action, and you write it down, it's a nice beautiful
1589920	1595040	formulation, you can write it down in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian form, but it's, you know, one line
1595040	1603440	and you can use it in principle to describe any system, okay, I say in principle because, you
1603440	1607600	know, nature is complicated, you know, the brain's complicated, as soon as you get more than a few
1607600	1613360	atoms, you know, or a few molecules, it's hard, right, so, but in principle, this is the underlying
1613360	1617200	principle, so that's where I'm going to start, right, with the theory of intelligent, I'm going
1617200	1622000	to say if we can use it for everything else, then let's apply it to the brain, see how far we get,
1622560	1627040	that's what it looks like, there's a beautiful book just written, I think, yeah, last year at Cambridge
1627040	1631440	University Press, surprisingly, there's nothing else before this, because it's been around about
1631440	1636000	100 years, it's called the principle of least action, it's got all the different examples in the world
1636000	1642720	of thermodynamics, classical mechanics, steam trains, computers, digital, quantum, everything,
1642720	1646800	chapter on each, how it's applied, how it's applied, how it's applied, how it's applied,
1647600	1652080	so they need an extra chapter on how it's applied to the brain, I think, but that's what it looks
1652080	1659920	like, you know, that s is the action, the q is momentum, t is time, and q dots, you know, the
1659920	1666800	dv dt, the change of momentum with change in time, and delta s equals zero is all the physics,
1667360	1672880	it's the change in action, nature acts so that delta s, where s is the action,
1674320	1679280	is, it tries to minimize that quantity where s is that in terms of Lagrangian, okay, don't
1679280	1684080	worry about the math or the physics, we're not going to go there, but so let's apply that to the
1684080	1690720	intelligence and see how far we get, because it works for everything else, okay, so again, it's not
1690720	1695760	just about pattern recognition, it's about modeling the world, okay, we model stuff, we can imagine,
1695840	1701040	we problem solve, we can build new models, we can understand, right, we don't just do statistical
1701040	1706720	analysis, otherwise it'd be zombies, right, or we'd be a silicon chip, we'd be built into our
1706720	1714640	factory and we're not, so here are some theoretical approaches, I'm going to choose the Friston
1714640	1720560	active inference one, which uses the delta s equals zero, the others don't, but these are, these are
1720560	1729040	very, very, very, you know, credible attempts at general intelligence and all of these people
1729040	1733200	have been working at least 30 years on these theories, so they're certainly not to be dismissed,
1733200	1737760	and let's pick this one and just do all the others are wrong, there's going to be bits of each that
1737760	1744640	it kind of have, have some, there's going to be overlap, so you know, we've, Helmholtz started
1744640	1751600	with statistical physics, right, it's, the brain is 100 billion neurons, it's a big messy, warm,
1751600	1755360	complex system, so statistical physics is over 100 years old.
1762960	1771280	Okay, so I will wind it up, yeah, let me wind it up, so yeah, 30 years for all of these, right,
1771280	1779120	I'm going to pick Friston in the last two minutes, okay, now active inference, we can look this up,
1780400	1785200	again it uses the free energy, it's minimizing the free energy, let me just flick through and then I'll
1785200	1791360	sum it up, there's Professor Friston there and we, we don't have time to hear, so this is what it
1791360	1795760	looks like, we can draw diagrams and pretty pictures, we can write down equations, we can have
1795760	1800720	me, us in the environment, the environment acting back on the agent, the agent acting back on the
1800720	1805920	environment, all the physics is in place, we can write down the equations for it, we can do it for
1805920	1811200	bacteria or the brain, so it works on all systems, there's the math that's super, super ugly, but
1811200	1817520	it's, you know, it's, that's theoretical neuroscience and this is, that's the equation of, that's like
1817520	1822480	the general theory of relativity for, for the brain, right, so there you saw it, he's got loads of
1822480	1828960	papers, can we build it, I say yes, we have the data, we have the theory, we have the algorithms
1828960	1835600	and we have the hardware, okay, and there's some AGI project, there's Merrick's here, Ben's here,
1835600	1840400	there's a, Jürgen Schmidt-Huber's not here, these are all super clever people doing super clever
1840400	1847120	things and I picked our active inference as one because I feel it's the one most based on physics
1847120	1851680	and I'd say we're at the beginning of our journey, it might take us five or ten years to sort of
1851680	1856320	build us as we wait for the hardware especially to mature, I believe we have the algorithms,
1856400	1861680	it's a super bold statement to be saying, but I encourage you to read some of the papers
1861680	1866000	and there's Jeff Hinton saying at the very end, you know, this is three years ago,
1866000	1870080	the conceptual breakthroughs will take us, we need new conceptual breakthroughs,
1870080	1874240	I believe the breakthroughs are going to come when we understand the brain, thank you very much.
1876960	1881360	I'm, I'm so sorry for being so rushed, I also would like to know more,
1881840	1886640	can I steal five minutes of the Q&A, so like for just one question, I know that he overtake,
1886640	1890480	he's going to make it up to you. Okay, one question. He owes you five minutes of lifetime,
1890480	1895760	yeah, I'll make sure you get that. I do, I do. Five minutes of your lifetime to him. Thank you so
1895760	1903120	much. Thank you so much for the question, sorry for your time, just in taking one question,
1903120	1908640	so I'm just going to be very quick to keep on schedule, so I'm going to just speak in very
1908640	1914640	short words, so Richard Feynman, you know, you've been a music producer, besides all your other
1914640	1919200	work in the academia, and you've shown us a great slide where you said for AGI we need
1919200	1926240	computer sciences, physics, neurosciences, and psychology, so bringing these four things together,
1926240	1931200	I mean, the question is, and you've been in academia, in our society every, every incentive
1931200	1936240	is to be very specialized and to really focus on one subject and then people don't talk and connect
1936320	1941440	enough with each other, and I think we need that for AGI. What are you doing or what can we do as
1941440	1945440	a society to bring these four groups together? Is there conferences to exchange with those four
1945440	1949440	groups? I mean, how do you get these different people, these different tribes talking with each
1949440	1953440	other? Is that the short question? Is that the short question? Well, it was a long question, I hope he
1953440	1958560	has a short answer, but yeah, okay, yeah, so Professor Friston's group's a neuroscience group,
1958560	1963200	it's a theoretical neuroscience group, they have very strong mathematicians, very strong computer
1963200	1967920	scientists, DeepMind's a bit of a, you know, case study in this, they get neuroscientists,
1967920	1971840	computer science, sitting in the same room, so it's the very beginning, but I think you need
1971840	1979520	more, I think you need psychologists, yeah, so we need a little bit more input from other science
1979520	1986800	sectors to begin with, and yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, ultimately you have to build these
1986800	1994320	things, the theory is going to come from a very, very strong scientific, mathematically competent
1994320	1999760	person, okay, you can get all the psychologists talking in a room and everybody else, but ultimately
1999760	2004320	someone or a couple of people have to write down a scientific theory, just like Einstein wrote down
2004320	2008960	the theory of relativity, so maybe I was a little bit generous, you know, we need everybody, we need
2008960	2013920	the ideas from everywhere, but the actual person himself or herself is going to be, have to be
2014000	2019120	super strong a math, we saw some of the math, it's not simple, it takes a while, right, it's a huge,
2019120	2023920	just like the theory of general relativity, and I'll end here, you know, we can understand the
2023920	2028400	concepts, but the actual math is really, really, really hard, right, I don't know if you've ever
2028400	2034320	tried it to solve the, no, the field equations, I have, they're not easy, right, yeah, so don't
2034320	2040720	expect this to be easy, it's going to be simple, but the math is still going to be, you know, hard,
2040720	2046400	okay, yeah, okay, thank you. Okay, Peter, one more question, where can we find your slides,
2046400	2051760	are you going to upload them somewhere? Yeah, I thought the conference was going to upload them,
2051760	2058640	if not, then my slide share is, they're available on my slide share, so if you go to
2058640	2063600	slide share and just Google Peter Morgan, I guess, you'll find you, you'll find him, okay,
2064560	2068800	I think that's the best way, and the other thing is just to look at Carl Friston, he has a great
2068800	2073840	website with all his papers, which is super heavy going, but if you're really, really,
2074560	2078000	I don't know, you know, if you really believe you want to try and solve intelligence,
2078000	2084720	that's the best place to start.
