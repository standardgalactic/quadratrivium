Checking Rise of AI/PETER MORGAN - Towards a General Theory of Intelligence ï½œ Rise of AI conference 2019.txt
1. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: To advance AI (Artificial Intelligence) towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), it's crucial to bring together computer science, physics, neuroscience, and psychology. These fields offer different perspectives and tools that can contribute to the understanding of human-level intelligence.

2. **Bridging the Gap**: In academia, there's a trend towards hyper-specialization, which can hinder interdisciplinary communication and collaboration. Efforts should be made to encourage dialogue and cooperation between different scientific communities.

3. **Examples of Collaboration**: Organizations like DeepMind already exemplify this by integrating neuroscientists, computer scientists, and other experts. However, there's a need for more input from psychology and potentially other fields.

4. **The Role of Theory**: A comprehensive scientific theory akin to Einstein's theory of relativity will be crucial in guiding the development of AGI. This theory must be grounded in strong mathematical foundations.

5. **Accessing Resources**: Peter Morgan's slides from his talk are available on SlideShare, and Carl Friston's research papers can be found on his personal website, which is a valuable resource for those interested in the science behind AGI.

6. **The Difficulty of the Math**: The math involved in developing such theories is complex and challenging, similar to solving Einstein's field equations, and should not be underestimated.

In summary, the path to AGI requires a concerted effort from multiple scientific disciplines working together, with a strong foundation in mathematics to develop a comprehensive theory that can guide AI development towards human-level intelligence.
