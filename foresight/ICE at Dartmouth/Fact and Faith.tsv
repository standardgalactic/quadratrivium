0	7440	Welcome everyone. We'll try to start on time. My name is Marcelo Gleiser. I'm a professor
7440	13640	of physics and astronomy here at Dartmouth, and I also direct the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary
13640	21340	Engagement, which is short, the short for the institute is ICE, but I say it's the
21340	27040	good ICE, you know, because there's another ICE out there. So it's the good ICE, or as
27040	31840	a previous cell said, the coolest ICE, you know. So if you want to know more about what
31840	39320	we do, I'll write a little website for you. One of the things that we do is we have a
39320	45480	fellows program somewhat similar to the Montgomery Fellows where I invite wonderful people that
45480	50600	do cross the boundaries between the sciences and the humanities to spend some time here
50600	57440	and think and talk to people and give public lectures. And so today we're very, very fortunate
57440	64280	to have, as our current fellow, Alan Leitman, who I'm sure you know, as a physicist and
64280	72760	as a novelist. Alan was educated in Princeton and at Caltech, where he did his PhD in theoretical
72760	79600	physics, I guess, with Keith Thorn, who just got the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves.
79600	86720	And then he was at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics as an assistant professor,
86720	93120	and then at MIT, where he had this distinction of having both a position in the physics and
93120	97760	in the humanities, which is something I'm very jealous of, I have to say. I think that's
97760	104280	a wonderful thing. And in fact, he became the John Bertrand Professor of the humanities.
104280	109480	And then he decided to take some time off a little bit from academia, and so now he's
109480	114640	just an adjunct professor there where he teaches science writing because he wants to dedicate
114640	121240	more time to his fiction writing and non-fiction writing. So as you know, he's the author
121240	126080	of five novels, two collections of essays, a book-length narrative poem, and many, many
126080	132000	books on science. And he's written for The Atlantic, granted The New Yorker, The New
132000	137720	York Review of Books, and many, many other publications. His novel Einstein's Dreams was
137720	144640	an international bestseller, has been translated into 30 languages. And his novel The Diagnosis
144640	150200	was a finalist for the 2000 National Book Award in Fiction. His most recent books are
150200	156200	Screening Room, A Memoir of the South, named one of the best books of 2015 by The Washington
156200	164080	Post, and The Accidental Universe, named by Brain Pickings, Maria Popova's blog, as one
164080	172480	of the best books of 2016. He's also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
172480	180400	He's received many, many awards and five honorary degrees. And on top of all that, Alan also
180400	185960	is the founding director of the Harpswell Foundation, which works to empower a new generation
185960	191400	of women leaders in Cambodia. So he goes there quite often to do this work, which is quite
191400	198640	wonderful. So today, he's going to talk to us about fact and faith. I always said fact
198640	206040	and fiction, fact and faith, which is really the main theme of an upcoming book of his that
206040	209840	I'm sure he will mention Alan is talking about. So Alan, please welcome.
209840	224800	So Alan will talk for about 45 minutes, and then we'll open for questions from the audience.
224800	233400	When you ask a question, I'm going to give a microphone because we are videotaping everything.
233400	243320	Thank you, Marcello. I very much admire the work that Marcello has done with this institute
243320	249320	here to bring the sciences and the humanities. Together, I've had a great experience being
249320	258240	here for a week, and I'll be here another 10 days or so, and I've had some enjoyable
258240	263800	meetings with some of the students here. So thank you, Marcello. Thank you, Ice. Cool
263800	276920	Ice. Thank you, Dartmouth. For many years, my wife and I have spent our summers on a
276920	285480	small island in Maine. There are only six families who live there. There are no roads
285480	295480	or bridges to the island, and everybody on the island has to have their own boat. And
295480	305480	the story I wanted to tell concerned a particular night. It was after midnight, and I was coming
305480	315240	back to the island alone in the boat. I was very quiet, and as I was rounding the tip
315240	324960	of the island, I decided to turn off the running lights of the boat. So what little light there
324960	332000	was disappeared was completely dark, and then I decided to turn off the engine of the boat,
332000	338040	and it got completely silent. And I just lay down in the bottom of the boat and looked
338040	344200	up at the stars. And I don't know whether any of you have looked at the stars from the
344200	356000	ocean on a quiet night, but it is a mystical experience. And after a few minutes, the boat
356000	364440	disappeared, my body disappeared, and I felt like I was falling into infinity. I felt like
364440	374200	I was connected to the stars, and not only connected to the stars, but connected to nature.
374200	385720	I felt like I was part of something much bigger than myself. I felt like I was part of something
386040	394560	eternal. And after a few minutes, I turned on the engine of the boat. I didn't even know how
394560	405360	long I'd been lying there. So as Marcelo said, I've worked as a physicist for many years,
405360	414560	and I've always held a purely scientific view of the world. And by that, I mean that I believe,
414720	421160	and I think that most scientists do, that the world is made out of material, and nothing but material.
421160	432400	And that material is governed by a small number of fundamental forces and laws. And that everything
432400	442200	in the world, including humans and stars, is material and will eventually return to their
442240	451440	component parts. And even at the age of 12 or 13, I was impressed by the logic and the
451440	460120	materiality of the world. I built a little homemade laboratory for myself and did experiments.
460120	468200	And one of the experiments I did was to measure the swing of a pendulum. And I'd read in popular
468240	474200	science or some such magazine that the time it takes a pendulum to make one complete swing
474200	483800	was proportional to the square root of the length of the string of the pendulum. And it was a
483800	492600	beautiful law, which I verified with the help of a watch and a ruler. And it seemed to me that
492600	500320	everything in the world was quantitative and logical, that cause and effect governed everything.
500320	508160	And as far as I could tell, there was no reason to believe in a supernatural being or anything
508160	515560	supernatural. And that's pretty much still my view. But after that experience in the boat,
516520	525640	many years later, I understood the powerful attraction of the spiritual world. I understood
525640	536760	the powerful allure of believing in the eternal and the non-material and the ethereal and things
536840	545960	that were unchanging and eternal and sacred, believing in things and experiences that are
545960	557120	not reducible by logic. And at the same time, and perhaps paradoxically, I remained a scientist.
557120	566520	I remained committed to the material world. I have a good friend in Cambodia. I go there twice
566600	573480	a year. I have a good friend who is a venerated Buddhist monk. And sometimes I talk to him about
573480	581400	scientific and theological matters. And as some of you may know, the Buddhists believe in something
581400	589400	called the Four Noble Truths, which deal with suffering and how to relieve that suffering.
590280	600080	And my monk friend was careful to explain to me that Buddhists come to the belief in the Four
600080	607120	Noble Truths by experience with the world. But there are other things that Buddhists believe in,
607120	612320	like the fact that the universe has gone through an infinite number of cycles,
613320	622960	that are based exclusively on the word of the Buddha, who was a person, a human being named
622960	633680	Siddhartha Gautama. One of the names for the Buddha is the Lakavidu, which in Pali means the
633680	642320	knower of worlds. And a lot of the authority of what the Buddhists believe comes from the
642320	651120	statements of the Buddha, the Lakavidu. And I wondered, how do we know that the Buddha was
651120	662680	the knower of worlds? Were Einstein and Darwin also knowers of worlds? The truths and the laws
663040	670040	that we believe about the physical universe and the spiritual universe, why do we believe them
670040	680200	and on whose authority? Science and religion differ profoundly in the way that truths are
680200	690480	discovered. Can everybody hear me? Good, because I'm not too close to the microphone here. In
691080	700600	religion and theology, these truths and beliefs seem to have two origins. One origin is the sacred
700600	711280	books, like the Bible or the Koran or the Vedas or the Pali Canon. And believers have faith
711600	720520	that these sacred books express the true word of God. And therefore, the authority comes from the
720520	729240	infinite wisdom associated with God or with other divine beings. The second origin of truth
729480	741000	and religious knowledge is more personal. It's what one might call the transcendent experience. So
741000	748440	I wanted to talk a little bit about these two kinds of knowledge and religion. And then I'll turn
748440	758000	to the knowledge and method of science and try to contrast the two. Quotations from the sacred
758040	765920	books are used to declare truths ranging from the origin of the universe to the question of free
765920	775160	will, even to reproductive biology. And let me quote a passage from Islamic Hadith, which is supposed
775160	786960	to be a quotation spoken by the prophet Mohammed. This concerns reproductive biology. He is created
787000	795440	of both he being man and woman. He is created of both the semen of the man and the semen of the
795440	803480	woman. The man's semen is thick and forms the bones and the tendons. The woman's semen is fine
803480	810880	and forms the flesh and the blood. And still today, there are many religious thinkers who
811840	818520	attribute absolute authority to the teachings of the sacred books, which is called Divine
818520	826160	Revelation. Let me quote from a part of the announcement of the Second Vatican Constitution
826160	834880	endorsed by Pope Paul VI. This was in the mid 1960s. And I quote, the books of scripture must be
834880	842560	acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully, and without error, the truth which God wanted put
842560	851960	into sacred writings for the sake of salvation. I do respect the notions of God and other divine
851960	859760	beings. However, I insist on one thing. I insist that any statements about the physical world,
860640	867360	and that would include the origin of the universe, reproductive biology, and so on. I insist that
867360	876080	statements about the physical world be tested by the methods of science and rejected if found to
876080	885360	contradict experiment. The spiritual world has its own domain, but the physical world must be the
885360	894920	province of science. In the physical world, the laws of nature cannot apply to some phenomena and
894920	903960	not others and apply at some times and not other times. It's not okay with me if the principles
903960	915000	of aerodynamics work on some of my airplane flights, but not on others. Most religions take
915320	925800	God to lie outside the physical world, outside of time and space. Because science is restricted to
925800	934600	the physical world, science can never disprove the existence of God. And I am impatient and frustrated
934600	942040	with some of my scientific colleagues like Richard Dawkins and Larry Krauss who attempt to use the
942040	948240	methods of science to disprove the existence of God. I think they are just totally missing the point.
948240	956920	Likewise, we can never prove the existence of God. Belief in God must be taken as a matter of faith.
956920	966680	Let me turn to the transcendent experience, which for me as both a scientist and a humanist is the
966680	973760	strongest and most compelling evidence that we have for a spiritual world. By transcendent
973760	981360	experience, I mean the immediate and vital experience of being connected to something larger than
981360	990080	ourselves, of feeling some unseen order in the world. And by the spiritual world, I mean the
990080	997840	totality of these experiences. The experience I had in Maine lying at the bottom of the boat
997840	1004840	looking up at the sky was a transcendent experience. I've had many others and I'm sure that all of
1004840	1012760	you have had transcendent experience as well. The transcendent experience may or may not involve a
1012760	1020920	supreme being. Unlike the received wisdom of the sacred books or the teachings of the institutions of
1020920	1030680	religion, the transcendent experience is intensely personal and the authority of that experience rests
1030680	1038480	on the experience itself. There's no one who can refute a personal transcendent experience that
1038480	1047200	you've had. It cannot be disproved and often the transcendent experience is a unique one-time event.
1047200	1057800	The transcendent experience as an avenue to truth is a deeply human experience. In fact,
1057800	1065360	there are some philosophers and theologians who believe that truth exists only in the realm of
1065600	1073600	humanity and the human mind. Such a belief runs head-on against the beliefs of science which are
1073600	1082480	that there is truth and reality outside of the human mind. Doesn't the parabolic arc of a toss coin
1082480	1094040	exist whether or not there's a human mind to conceive it? These opposing views between whether
1094760	1103720	truth can exist outside of the human mind or must necessarily be within the human mind were
1103720	1111000	highlighted in an extraordinary conversation between Einstein and the great Bengali poet and
1111000	1119840	philosopher Rabindranath Tagore who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Einstein and Tagore had a
1119840	1130400	great admiration for each other and they met a couple of times. Once was in July 14th 1930 at
1130400	1138320	Einstein's house in Kaputh near Berlin and I want to read you a portion of their conversation.
1139280	1148600	Einstein, truth then or beauty is not independent of mind of man question mark.
1148600	1160480	Tagore, no. Einstein, I agree with regard to the conception of beauty but not with regard to truth.
1161440	1171200	Tagore, why not? Truth is realized through man. This is before political correctness whereas
1171200	1182200	it's gender tilted. Einstein, I cannot prove that scientific truth must be conceived as a truth
1182680	1190520	that is valid independent of humanity but I believe it firmly. I believe, for example,
1190520	1197560	that the Pythagorean theorem and geometry state something that is true independent of the existence
1197560	1205640	of man. Anyway, there is a reality independent of man and there is also a truth relative to this
1205640	1216520	reality. Tagore, truth which is one with the universal being must essentially be human otherwise
1217080	1223400	whatever individuals realize is true can never be called truth at least the truth which is
1223400	1229960	described as scientific in which only can be reached through the process of logic in other words
1229960	1239640	by an organ of thought which is human. Einstein, the problem begins whether truth is independent
1239640	1247480	of our consciousness. Tagore, what we call truth lies in the rational harmony between
1247480	1254040	subjective and objective aspects of reality. I think it's a wonderful exchange.
1255000	1261720	Well, I want now to discuss the knowledge and science and the way that we arrive at that
1262920	1269160	knowledge and I think scientific knowledge is of two types. First is there's the description
1269960	1277560	of physical objects such as the mass and the size of a raindrop, the measurement and description
1278280	1284840	and second there are the laws that govern the physical world which we call the laws of nature.
1286680	1293480	One of the first human beings to formulate a law of nature was 2000 years ago
1293480	1299320	Archimedes, his law of floating bodies and let me quote that law for you.
1300280	1308600	Any solid lighter than a fluid and lighter meaning less dense than a fluid will if placed in the
1308600	1314840	fluid be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the fluid
1314840	1327800	displaced. We can speculate on how Archimedes arrived at this law. 2000 years ago there were
1327800	1331720	scales and balances for weighing things because there was trade at the market.
1332760	1342440	So Archimedes could have taken a rectangular box filled with some fluid, put an object
1343240	1349800	in the fluid, first he would have weighed the object on the scales. Then he take a rectangular
1349800	1357560	box filled with fluid, put the object in the box, measured how much the water or fluid
1357560	1365800	level rose, how many centimeters it rose. Then multiply that by the area of the container to
1365800	1373400	get the volume of water displaced. Then in another container fill it up with that volume of water
1373400	1379000	and weigh the amount of water and then compare that with the original weight of the object.
1379800	1385560	And he would have done this many times to arrive at his law. He also would have used fluids other
1385560	1394040	than water like mercury to get to the generality of the law. And in fact all laws of the physical
1394040	1400760	world are like Archimedes' law. They're precise, they're quantitative, and they are general,
1400760	1414280	applying to a large range of phenomena. It's possible that nature wouldn't
1414360	1422280	obey laws at all. For example, it's possible that we would live in a universe where 2 plus 2
1422280	1434120	equal 4 and 2 plus 2 equal 3, a universe like that. But most scientists believe that the universes
1434120	1439560	that didn't obey laws would have self-contradictions like that mathematical one I just said.
1440360	1445480	Certainly it would be an unlawful universe would be a very frightening place to live.
1447880	1454200	In the last 200 years we have discovered laws that govern the behavior of the insides of atoms,
1454920	1463560	the expansion of the universe, the orbits of planets, and many other phenomena. And from those
1463560	1470600	laws we've been able to explain in quantitative detail everything from the color of the sky,
1470600	1474760	to the orbits of planets, to the mass and size of raindrops.
1478120	1486920	And we have seen no evidence to contradict the notion that all phenomena in the physical universe
1487000	1491720	are governed by laws. And here's a wonderful law of nature that you can
1494760	1505240	confirm this yourself. Take any object like a pen and drop it to the floor from a height of four feet
1505240	1510280	and time how long it will take to reach the floor and the gravity of the earth and you'll get a half
1510280	1518600	a second. Now drop the object from a height of eight feet and you'll get about 0.7 seconds
1519320	1526280	and drop then drop it from a height of 16 feet and you'll get one second. And what you find if
1526280	1533240	you drop the object from several different heights is that the time it takes to fall doubles with
1533240	1542440	every quadrupling of the height. This is a rule of nature, a law of nature. It was discovered first
1542440	1551080	by Galileo in 1590. It's called his law of falling bodies. And with this rule which you can do yourself
1551080	1559240	at home you have discovered the lawfulness of the physical world. The law of the swinging pendulum
1559320	1570280	that I confirm myself at age 12 was an example very closely related to Galileo's law of falling
1570280	1577640	bodies. And I didn't believe it was true because I read it in popular science. I didn't believe it
1577640	1583320	was true because I wanted it to be true. I didn't believe it was true because the great Galileo
1583320	1590120	had said that it was true. I believe that it was true because it worked. It evidently described a
1590120	1600360	real property of nature. Let me describe the methods and the manner of science. Galileo's
1600360	1608520	law of falling bodies is a special case of Newton's more general law of gravity. Newton discovered
1608520	1618120	his law about 50 years later by analyzing the orbits of planets. For two centuries Newton's law
1618120	1625160	worked beautifully. But then in the mid-19th century it was found that the orbit of the planet
1625160	1632360	Mercury didn't quite fit Newton's law of gravity. It was off by a very tiny amount, amounting to
1632360	1640520	about one hundredth of an angular degree every century. An incredibly tiny discrepancy, but the
1640520	1647480	telescopes were so good at that time the observations so careful that scientists agreed that there was
1647480	1657560	a problem. Then in 1915 Albert Einstein proposed a new law of gravity replacing Newton's theory of
1657560	1665960	gravity which explained this orbit of Mercury perfectly also predicted gravitational waves
1665960	1671720	which were discovered about a year and a half ago and many other phenomena. Now the important point,
1673560	1681880	we know that Einstein's theory as beautiful and accurate as it is will also be replaced
1681880	1689720	someday by a more accurate theory. Now all of the laws of nature discovered by scientists
1689720	1696200	are considered provisional. They're considered to be approximations to deeper laws.
1697640	1705320	They're constantly being revised as new experimental data comes in and as new ideas come
1705320	1711240	forth and are tested. In fact what we call the laws of nature should really be called
1711240	1720360	approximate laws of nature because in any given time we're only working with approximations
1721400	1728200	even if they're final laws of nature, perfect laws of nature. At any one time we're working with
1728200	1736200	approximations to those final laws and it is in this process of revision that we see the strongest
1736200	1744120	difference between science and religion. As I've said everything in the physical world
1744120	1751000	is subject to laws but we have only approximations to those ultimate laws which we're constantly
1751000	1758440	revising. The beliefs and knowledge of religion coming either from the divine authority of
1758440	1765960	the sacred books or from the transcendent experience are not subject to revision.
1767080	1774920	They are not approximations. Religion does not revise itself in the way that science does.
1775800	1782280	There is something that scientists believe that cannot be tested according to the methods of science
1782280	1790040	and that is a principle I call the central doctrine of science and that principle says
1791320	1799960	that the physical world is governed by laws and that those laws are always true everywhere
1800920	1808680	and at every time in the universe. I call the central doctrine of science a doctrine
1809880	1816440	because despite its past success it cannot be proven. No matter what laws we have
1818440	1827160	we can't be sure that tomorrow we might observe some phenomena that is a miracle that just cannot
1827400	1837960	be explained by any laws. Our faith in the doctrine is so strong that when we find physical
1837960	1847960	phenomena that seem to be unlawful like the orbit of the planet Mercury we don't abandon belief
1848760	1857400	in a lawful universe. When it was found that the orbit of Mercury disagreed a little bit with
1857400	1864200	Newton's theory of gravity we did not attribute the discrepancy to something mysterious,
1864840	1872120	to the action of a whimsical god or something that was intrinsically unexplainable. We
1872120	1883800	realized that our theory needed revision and in fact I can't imagine any event in the physical
1883800	1891480	universe that would cause scientists to label it as a miracle to abandon belief in a lawful
1891480	1899880	universe. If this table started floating right now scientists would look for some magnetic levitation
1899880	1910360	or some other law that they hadn't yet discovered but not a miracle. We are deeply committed to
1910360	1916600	the central doctrine. There's another belief in science that cannot be proven
1918280	1925320	and that is belief that there is a final theory that is perfect that is beyond approximation
1925720	1936200	and many physicists call this a final theory. Such a belief has not emerged from science itself.
1936200	1941640	In fact the history of science shows that we're constantly revising and revising and revising
1941640	1950120	and revising so belief in a final theory is just a matter of faith and the irony here is that even
1950200	1959480	if we were in the possession of a final theory we wouldn't know it because you couldn't prove
1959480	1966840	that tomorrow you might observe a phenomena that disagreed with the theory so we believe it
1966840	1976760	as a matter of faith. In his book Dreams of a Final Theory the Nobel Prize-winning physicist
1976760	1984040	Stephen Weinberg writes quote our present theories are only of limited validity still
1984040	1991000	tentative and incomplete but behind them now and then we catch glimpses of a final theory
1991720	1998040	one that would be of unlimited validity and entirely satisfactory in its completeness
1998040	2005800	and consistency. My own guess is that there is a final theory and we are capable of discovering it.
2006520	2010200	A final theory is really an extension of the central doctrine of science
2011960	2017320	and some I would argue that despite the huge differences between science and religion and
2017320	2025720	the way that knowledge is acquired that both share a certain degree of faith
2025720	2033080	of belief and commitment to the unprovable science experimentally tests everything that it believes
2034040	2039400	with the exception of the fundamental belief the belief in the central doctrine of science.
2041960	2048760	I wanted to end by talking about some of these issues in a more a more personal way in specific
2048760	2057800	way and that is my personal attitude towards death. One could argue that many of our religious and
2057880	2064840	spiritual beliefs are motivated by a knowledge of our own impending death.
2067160	2079800	We confront our own physical demise with invoking the eternal the immortal soul god and so on.
2080280	2089160	All material things are made out of atoms and molecules and the energy that holds them together
2090040	2096440	and the forces and energies that hold them together and atoms and molecules are part
2096440	2104280	of the physical world and according to the view of science all material is governed by laws.
2105240	2113240	Immortality is not allowed by the laws. Disembodied existence is not allowed by the laws.
2114120	2117880	Insubstantiality is not allowed by the laws.
2121080	2128440	I'm a materialist as I said when I started but I consider myself a spiritual person so
2129400	2137720	you might call me a spiritual materialist. So the question is how does a spiritual materialist
2139480	2141880	think about his own impending death?
2146360	2151160	I believe that this distinction between life and death is overrated.
2151320	2160440	I've come to believe that death occurs gradually through the diminishing of consciousness
2161560	2163560	and let me explain what I mean.
2166280	2172120	According to the scientific view we are made of material atoms and nothing more.
2172120	2179160	In fact to be precise the average person is made out of about 7000 trillion trillion atoms.
2179800	2185880	The totality of our tissues and organs are composed of these atoms.
2186840	2190520	And according to the scientific view there's nothing else.
2191800	2199880	To a vast cosmic being each of us human beings would appear as an assemblage of atoms
2200680	2207880	humming with our various electrical and chemical energies. To be sure it's a special assemblage
2208680	2216120	a rock does not behave like a person but the mental sensations that we experience
2216120	2224280	as consciousness and thought according to science are purely material consequences
2224280	2230600	of the purely material electrical and chemical interactions between atoms.
2230840	2238360	And when we die this special assemblage disassembles.
2239800	2245880	The total number of our atoms in our body say the same but they are scattered about.
2248200	2255720	Particularly special in these considerations is the brain and the view of science the brain
2255720	2265800	is where our self-awareness originates our self-identity our ego our consciousness our
2265800	2273400	eyeness. Neuroscientists have studied the brain in great detail they know a lot about the brain
2273400	2279880	there's a lot that's that's still unknown. There's a there's good evidence that the processing and
2279880	2285960	storage of information in the brain occurs principally through the neurons we have about
2285960	2293320	a hundred billion neurons in our brain these are brain cells. The electrical and chemical
2293320	2299480	interactions between the neurons are largely understood the matter the manner in which electrical
2299480	2307400	signals speed down a neuron then are converted to a flow of chemicals that go to the next neuron
2307400	2314840	these these things are understood very well the long-term memory that we have upon so much of our
2316360	2323240	self-identity rest is accomplished by the material generation of new connections between
2323240	2329640	neurons and the reinforcement of existing connections by specific proteins we've seen
2330280	2335160	new synapses grow between neurons we've seen we know which proteins are involved.
2338120	2345960	Despite all of this despite the known material nature of the brain the sensation of consciousness
2345960	2356520	the ego the eyeness is so powerful and compelling so fundamental to our being and yet so difficult
2356520	2365400	to describe that we endow ourselves and other human beings with a mystical quality some magnificent
2365400	2374040	and non-material essence that goes far beyond the individual atoms in our brain to some people
2374680	2382440	that mystical thing is the soul to some it is the self to others it is consciousness
2384600	2392520	the soul is commonly understood we cannot discuss scientifically so i will not even attempt to discuss
2392600	2400920	it but that's not the case with consciousness and the closely related self isn't the experience
2400920	2407960	of consciousness and self an illusion caused by those trillions and trillions of neuronal
2408760	2414040	connections the connections between neurons and the electrical and chemical flows and if you don't
2414040	2420440	like the word illusion then you can stick with the sensation itself you can say that the self
2421160	2426600	is a name that we that we give to that sensation of all of those electrical and chemical
2427240	2433240	flows between the neurons and and by saying this i don't want to diminish any way
2435720	2445000	the brain the human brain is capable of wondrous feasts of imagination creativity self reflection
2445000	2454840	thought by do claim that it's all atoms and molecules if the giant cosmic being that i
2454840	2464760	referred to earlier examined a human being in detail he she or it would see fluids flowing
2465320	2472600	sodium and potassium gates opening and closing on neurons electrical electricity races between
2472600	2483720	the nerve cells the chemical flows between synapses but he she or it would not find a self
2485240	2490920	the self and consciousness i think are names we give to those sensations
2494120	2499160	having said that the consciousness is simply a name we give to those sensations
2500120	2508520	i want to to to make the point that i don't think that consciousness can be understood simply
2508520	2517000	by the microscopic analysis of individual neurons the brain has roughly a hundred million neurons
2517000	2524440	in it and when you have very low a very large system like that composed of many many elemental
2524520	2535160	parts then there is a behavior of the system as a whole that cannot be predicted and which is
2535160	2542680	qualitatively qualitatively different than what individual elements do and this is called an
2542680	2551960	emergent phenomena another example of an emergent phenomena is a snowflake uh snowflakes are made
2551960	2561080	out of crystalline ice ice is water water is made out of molecules molecules are atoms of
2561080	2568360	hydrogen and oxygen and we can know everything about the orbits of electrons and atoms and and
2568360	2576760	hydrogen and oxygen uh we can know how those atoms join together to make molecules we can even
2576760	2584280	understand the six-sided symmetry of a snowflake but when you put billions and trillions of those
2584280	2592120	molecules together including very tiny interactions with the environment of the snowflake then it is
2592120	2601560	impossible to predict the zillions of different patterns that snowflakes form it cannot be understood
2601560	2614600	by analyzing individual elements now let me come back to death if someone began disassembling my brain
2615320	2624280	one neuron at a time depending on where the process began i might first lose a few motor skills
2625160	2631640	then some memories then perhaps the ability to find particular words and sentences
2632600	2640600	the ability to recognize faces the ability to know where i was during this slow process of
2640600	2650840	taking apart my brain i would become more and more confused disoriented everything that i
2650840	2658600	associated with myself with my ego with my self-identity would gradually dissolve away
2658600	2666920	in a bog of confusion and minimal existence the doctors and their blue and green scrub suits
2666920	2674120	who were taking apart my brain one neuron neuron at a time they could drop those neurons each one
2674200	2683800	in a metal bowl each would be a tiny gray gelatinous blob each would have the spindly dendrites and
2683800	2689960	axons coming out of it you wouldn't hear each one drop because they're very soft
2692280	2700520	likewise the doctors and their blue and green scrub suits could create consciousness by building
2700520	2709080	a brain from scratch one neuron at a time they could slowly add neurons together delicately
2709080	2716120	arranging the connections between neurons one neuron at a time and the doctors might hook up
2716120	2722760	an electrical device to monitor the electrical activity of these neurons and for a long time
2722760	2729800	there would just be noise but at some point presumably a qualitative change would occur
2730520	2738360	some coherent signal an unusual hum that would translate roughly into yikes something is messing
2738360	2751240	with me if we conceive of death as nothingness then we cannot imagine it but if we conceive of death
2751880	2757880	as the complete loss of consciousness a view supported by the understanding of the brain
2757880	2768760	as a material object then we can approach death in a gradual stages as consciousness
2768760	2777240	fades and dissolves the distinction between life and death would then no longer be an all or nothing
2777240	2786840	proposition the neuroscientist Antonio Demasio has defined several levels of consciousness
2787560	2794600	the lowest level he calls the protocell the protocell and that's just an organism that is able
2794600	2802600	to carry on the most basic processes of life but nothing else an amoeba an amoeba has a protocell
2804200	2809960	I would not associated this this level with consciousness surely you need a minimum number
2809960	2817880	of neurons to have consciousness next comes what Demasio calls core consciousness
2818840	2825480	its self-awareness and the ability to think and reason in the present moment but without
2825480	2830440	memories of the past and certain people with brain disorders have core consciousness
2832680	2838360	you would be able to understand the world around you but you would exist only in the present
2838520	2844760	um you cannot form memories that last more than a few minutes you cannot remember what happened
2844760	2852200	to you in the past except for isolated periods you cannot make plans for the future you're trapped
2852200	2860680	in the moment in the highest level of consciousness uh which all healthy people have is what Demasio
2860680	2869240	calls extended consciousness here we remember most of our past life we can remember our view of the
2869240	2879080	world based on past experiences we can remember places that we've been we can remember what we
2879080	2887320	like and what we don't like self-identity as most psychologists define it probably requires
2887320	2893240	extended consciousness that is long-term memories these of course are very difficult issues
2896120	2902600	the slow dismantling of a human brain whether by my imaginary doctors and their blue and green
2902600	2911480	scrub suits or by the deterioration of the brain and a neural disease might proceed from extended
2911480	2918920	consciousness to core consciousness to the proto-self or perhaps it might proceed in a
2918920	2925000	less orderly manner by removing chunks of extended consciousness here chunks of core
2925000	2932040	consciousness there until one is left with a proto-self either way one begins with full
2932040	2941240	consciousness and ends with an amoeba like existence one begins with a full life and ends
2941240	2949720	with death or the equivalent of death and this process can happen gradually so that there may
2949720	2958600	may be some awareness of the increasing loss of awareness personal accounts of early dementia
2958680	2963480	provide the best knowledge we have of approaching death in this manner
2965160	2972040	in the early stages of dementia where enough of the mind remains to understand and articulate
2972040	2980760	what's happening you can you can understand how consciousness is gradually being lost
2981720	2990360	but in later stages the person has slipped into an abyss of confusion somewhere in the
2990360	2999720	intermediate zone the sense of self dissolves and is gone I know this is a very grim subject
2999720	3006280	many of you probably know people or have relatives who about dementia I've had some loved ones who
3006360	3012840	have had dementia I currently have a friend who lives in michigan who is dying of alzheimer's
3012840	3020040	and she writes me letters frequently and I can see the loss of her herself fading away
3023400	3027080	now I wanted to end with something truly personal
3027800	3037240	from a scientific point of view I believe everything that I've said about the materiality
3037880	3041000	of the brain I've laid it out
3043400	3045960	but I'm not satisfied with this picture
3046920	3058040	in my mind I can still see my mother dancing the bossa nova bossa nova in my mind I can still
3058600	3066200	hear my father telling his kushmaker joke and the last the punchline is it went kush
3066760	3069240	and I can have another one up in 15 minutes
3069560	3079080	I often wonder where are they now my deceased parents my father and mother
3079800	3086440	I know the materials explanation which I've just told you but that does nothing to relieve
3086440	3093320	my longing for them and the impossible truth that they do not exist anymore
3094040	3108360	I am alive and I'm enjoying it aching joints and all despite my belief that I am only a collection
3108360	3120040	of atoms that my awareness is passing away neuron by neuron I am content with the illusion of life
3120040	3126760	I'll take it and even though I do not believe in a heaven or hell when I do not believe in
3126760	3134440	the immortal soul I find a pleasure in knowing that a hundred years from now and even a thousand
3134440	3142520	years from now that most of my atoms will remain those atoms will not know where they came from
3143240	3152600	but they will have been mine some of them will have been part of the memory of my mother
3154680	3161800	some of them will be the vinegary smell of my first apartment the memory of that
3163000	3170600	some of them will once have been my hand and if I could label each of my atoms at this moment
3170600	3179560	write my social security number on each of my atoms someone could follow those atoms for the next
3179560	3188840	thousand years as they floated in the air mixed with the soil became parts of plants and trees
3189400	3197800	dissolved in the ocean and then floated into the air again some of my atoms a thousand years
3197800	3205560	from now will be parts of other people some will be parts of other lives other memories
3207080	3212680	and some after that long journey will return to the island in Maine
3214680	3220200	so that's how a spiritual materialist thinks of his own death
3220520	3229800	science and religion have been the two greatest forces that have shaped human civilization
3230520	3236440	I think they both expressed something deeply human about us they're both here to stay
3236440	3248680	and so let the dialogue continue thank you
3267000	3278520	this works yes good um so thank you so much for this and I'm sure some people may have questions
3278520	3284440	comments wow oh there you go we can start there
3289880	3293640	hey thanks on behalf probably of everybody here I much appreciate the talk
3294200	3297400	it seems if there's something in common between the scientific approach
3298040	3303960	and the faith-based approach and that both are asking why why did that happen why did
3303960	3310040	something happen and with science we we test hypotheses and some of them when you come across
3310040	3315720	consciousness and you say well we can't understand it it's sort of mystical in a way and it's not
3315720	3321640	surprising to me therefore that some people would say well there must be something bigger something
3321640	3325880	greater involved so it's not surprising to me that there's this difference in part because
3325880	3333800	they seem to both be asking the same question good comment yeah I don't think I need to
3334600	3339800	respond to that I agree with what you said okay there was a hand yeah
3343960	3350200	um it perhaps you've provided an answer to this question and uh caused me to find some comfort
3351000	3358760	but I've always been uh troubled by the uncertain uncertainty of quantum mechanics the further
3358760	3366680	you investigate into material the less certain it becomes um you you've kind of addressed that but
3366680	3372840	perhaps it's worth some additional thought from your side how it fits in and how it's explained
3373800	3380520	well it's it's not true it's not quite true that the further we investigate quantum mechanics
3380520	3387560	the more uncertain it becomes um the the uncertainty in quantum mechanics uh
3390120	3397320	well what it says uh explicitly is that you uh for example that you can't know
3398280	3403560	precisely where a particle is and at the same time know precisely how fast it's moving
3404680	3412520	but there is a uh a quantitative relationship a quantitative equation that tells you exactly
3412520	3420360	how much that trade-off is that uncertainty is between position and motion and uh
3421240	3429240	uh we uh when we have large numbers of particles uh we can we can convert that uncertainty to
3429240	3436760	probabilities and we can predict very accurately how a large number of particles will behave um
3437320	3439320	um so um
3442600	3451240	there is there is a fundamental uh fuzziness of of nature at at the smallest scales
3452040	3457960	but I I don't think that it's true that that that uncertainty is getting larger and larger
3457960	3463720	as we learn more and more I think we have been able to put a box around that uncertainty
3463720	3473480	and even quantify it and we actually have equations that express that uncertainty uh so
3477800	3486520	there there there are a lot of uh philosophers and ethicists and uh theologians have have
3486520	3494520	invoked quantum mechanics or the uncertainty in quantum mechanics to express uh uh theological
3494520	3501640	and ethical issues philosophical issues such as whether uh we can have free will uh versus
3501640	3506920	determined whether whether we have a free will in making choices or whether our actions are
3506920	3513400	completely determined um if there's a little bit of uncertainty maybe that explains uh some
3513480	3521000	arbitrariness in our actions uh but I think that most of those arguments are are misusing
3522040	3531560	quantum mechanics um so I I don't mean to uh to uh dismiss your your question at at all
3532520	3539960	but I do think that that quantum mechanics is not the place to look for this uh uh
3539960	3545000	union or sympathy between science and religion
3555240	3562600	we all seem to struggle with this concept of consciousness and life itself in fact
3563400	3573080	and I might offer the concept that the universe and everything in it is in fact alive is conscious
3573080	3580120	and sentient and is intelligent and therefore the phenomena that we see that we don't understand
3581000	3589720	do have an intelligence behind them even though it is not of our understanding I don't accept
3589720	3595880	the supernatural but I know that there are phenomena that we do not cannot explain today
3597080	3601720	but that that certainly can be part of our natural universe
3613000	3618600	thank you for your talk um I have no question just a couple of observations that are
3618600	3626520	personal about consciousness um and I'll just let them float out there to my youngest students I used
3626520	3639240	to say uh accept that if we accept that the universe is just a series and I'm a non-scientist
3639240	3644520	this will be pretty clear to you but if we accept that the universe is just a series of random
3644520	3650680	accidents of physics and chemistry isn't it pretty remarkable that it ends up with you
3651720	3658760	on one level and uh another thing I think about quite a lot although I have not read up on it
3660040	3671240	is that and this is about my personal consciousness who writes scripts casts and directs my dreams
3671240	3682600	because it is not me the comments are floating okay
3690680	3695880	thank you so much for your talk um I was wondering so um as a Muslim from a religious
3695880	3700840	point of view I can understand where ethics and morality derives from in terms of
3700840	3705480	okay assuming god created you god understands you best he knows how this whole machine works
3705480	3712520	and you follow the rules prescribed by god where do um I guess where the ethic or the word where's
3712520	3721400	the source of ethics and morality from a more materialistic or scientific worldview um and um
3722920	3724520	yeah I guess that's primarily yeah yeah
3731080	3740120	um well uh first of all I I I do not think that you need a divine being or a creator
3741000	3749160	to develop for human beings develop a sense of ethics and morality um that doesn't mean that
3749160	3754440	that such a being doesn't exist but it just means I don't think it's necessary um
3754520	3761320	um I think that that some of our ethics and morality
3763880	3774040	evolved and maybe all of it from evolutionary forces that is uh for our own survival
3777080	3783720	and I think that you know Wilson might have written a book uh on the altruistic gene
3784520	3786920	um Marcel am I right about that
3791480	3799880	wrote a lot about altruism yeah and and uh according to that idea uh and of course we we can't
3799880	3808440	prove the idea because evolution happened over millions of years that that you're uh you're
3808440	3814520	feeling uh your your tender feelings for other people and the desire to help them
3816680	3825240	could have originated from the desire to preserve your community not just yourself but
3825960	3834120	your family if one of your family members uh survives then they can help take care of you
3835080	3840120	uh and so uh through the process of evolution when lots of different uh
3843720	3848600	random processes were occurring and some were beneficial for survival and some weren't
3849480	3856760	the the desire to help your fellow human being in certain ways could have been had survival
3856760	3867880	benefit for you and thus would have been uh preserved uh that trait um the the very strong
3867880	3876840	feeling that you have for a mate uh is clearly of evolutionary benefit uh to form a union that
3876840	3882840	allows the protection of the children while they're they're growing up um I know this is a very cold
3882840	3890840	hearted explanation of of of ethics and morality uh but this would be the materialist explanation
3890840	3891400	I believe
3900440	3909400	hello yeah so as you're sitting there with these men in the uh blue and green suits
3909400	3916280	and uh having your your brain dismantled uh neuron by neuron um they're they're taking the
3916280	3923320	neurons and and putting them into a jar and and remaking another brain that that has the
3923320	3928840	exact same shape as the one that they're dismantling just in a different place and slowly as your
3928840	3935880	consciousness goes down to to the point where it disappears and the consciousness of of the brain
3935880	3941720	that's forming in the jar slowly peaks up into a yikes what's happening to me um
3944440	3951400	what are your thoughts there on the continuity of self and is is the the consciousness that
3951400	3957880	wakes up in the jar a continuity of of you sitting at the table well that's that's that's the basis
3957880	3965000	of a wonderful science fiction story and uh I of course don't know the answer to that
3965560	3977000	but I think would be a great a great um here here's where uh I do think that that uh physics
3977000	3983560	would come in and that is I think that you could show that it's impossible to recreate
3985320	3990680	the brain exactly starting from scratch that is if you're if you're given all of the
3991400	3997480	positions the positions of all of the atoms in my brain um I think it would be impossible to
3997480	4005720	to recreate that exactly so there'd be little errors here and there you know this one nerve
4005720	4010600	filament was supposed to connect to this neuron and it didn't it connected to that one instead
4011400	4017400	and uh so I I don't think that it would be actually possible uh but if it were possible
4017400	4025800	uh that it's a great question of whether my consciousness would suddenly appear somewhere
4025800	4035960	else um and uh I think that that eventually when we understand the brain well enough
4037320	4044520	that we may be able to download a lot of the information in our neurons and put it on a piece
4044520	4051320	of silicon and then the answer is does does that have a consciousness and how is it related to the
4051320	4061480	original consciousness but it's a great question and uh I I hope that you will write a sci-fi story
4061480	4070280	based on it having a public dialogue in Boston in the spring of 2018 on transhumanism which is
4070280	4075640	pretty much one of the things that deals with this kind of stuff one last question there was a
4075640	4085800	lady here did you still have a question while you were speaking I was just kind of remembering
4085800	4093320	this counterculture Catholic church group I was in back in the 70s in California and the Catholic
4093320	4098440	priest during communion you know we'd have communion together he would say now you know
4098440	4107560	we can be imagining um that we're just sharing in now all of what creation is made of and the
4107560	4114520	body and blood of Jesus and the stuff of all of what creation is made of and it's all material
4114520	4123240	and it's all spiritual someday we'll know that it all goes together so thank you
4123240	4128040	note I'll thank you all for coming and stay tuned for more thank you
