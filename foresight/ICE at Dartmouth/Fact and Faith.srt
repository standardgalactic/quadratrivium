1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Welcome everyone. We'll try to start on time. My name is Marcelo Gleiser. I'm a professor

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,640
of physics and astronomy here at Dartmouth, and I also direct the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:21,340
Engagement, which is short, the short for the institute is ICE, but I say it's the

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,040
good ICE, you know, because there's another ICE out there. So it's the good ICE, or as

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,840
a previous cell said, the coolest ICE, you know. So if you want to know more about what

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,320
we do, I'll write a little website for you. One of the things that we do is we have a

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,480
fellows program somewhat similar to the Montgomery Fellows where I invite wonderful people that

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,600
do cross the boundaries between the sciences and the humanities to spend some time here

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,440
and think and talk to people and give public lectures. And so today we're very, very fortunate

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,280
to have, as our current fellow, Alan Leitman, who I'm sure you know, as a physicist and

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,760
as a novelist. Alan was educated in Princeton and at Caltech, where he did his PhD in theoretical

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,600
physics, I guess, with Keith Thorn, who just got the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,720
And then he was at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics as an assistant professor,

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,120
and then at MIT, where he had this distinction of having both a position in the physics and

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,760
in the humanities, which is something I'm very jealous of, I have to say. I think that's

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,280
a wonderful thing. And in fact, he became the John Bertrand Professor of the humanities.

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,480
And then he decided to take some time off a little bit from academia, and so now he's

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,640
just an adjunct professor there where he teaches science writing because he wants to dedicate

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,240
more time to his fiction writing and non-fiction writing. So as you know, he's the author

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,080
of five novels, two collections of essays, a book-length narrative poem, and many, many

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,000
books on science. And he's written for The Atlantic, granted The New Yorker, The New

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,720
York Review of Books, and many, many other publications. His novel Einstein's Dreams was

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,640
an international bestseller, has been translated into 30 languages. And his novel The Diagnosis

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,200
was a finalist for the 2000 National Book Award in Fiction. His most recent books are

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Screening Room, A Memoir of the South, named one of the best books of 2015 by The Washington

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,080
Post, and The Accidental Universe, named by Brain Pickings, Maria Popova's blog, as one

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:52,480
of the best books of 2016. He's also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,400
He's received many, many awards and five honorary degrees. And on top of all that, Alan also

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,960
is the founding director of the Harpswell Foundation, which works to empower a new generation

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,400
of women leaders in Cambodia. So he goes there quite often to do this work, which is quite

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,640
wonderful. So today, he's going to talk to us about fact and faith. I always said fact

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,040
and fiction, fact and faith, which is really the main theme of an upcoming book of his that

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm sure he will mention Alan is talking about. So Alan, please welcome.

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:44,800
So Alan will talk for about 45 minutes, and then we'll open for questions from the audience.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:53,400
When you ask a question, I'm going to give a microphone because we are videotaping everything.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:03,320
Thank you, Marcello. I very much admire the work that Marcello has done with this institute

37
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,320
here to bring the sciences and the humanities. Together, I've had a great experience being

38
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:18,240
here for a week, and I'll be here another 10 days or so, and I've had some enjoyable

39
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,800
meetings with some of the students here. So thank you, Marcello. Thank you, Ice. Cool

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Ice. Thank you, Dartmouth. For many years, my wife and I have spent our summers on a

41
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:45,480
small island in Maine. There are only six families who live there. There are no roads

42
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:55,480
or bridges to the island, and everybody on the island has to have their own boat. And

43
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,480
the story I wanted to tell concerned a particular night. It was after midnight, and I was coming

44
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:15,240
back to the island alone in the boat. I was very quiet, and as I was rounding the tip

45
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:24,960
of the island, I decided to turn off the running lights of the boat. So what little light there

46
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,000
was disappeared was completely dark, and then I decided to turn off the engine of the boat,

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,040
and it got completely silent. And I just lay down in the bottom of the boat and looked

48
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,200
up at the stars. And I don't know whether any of you have looked at the stars from the

49
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:56,000
ocean on a quiet night, but it is a mystical experience. And after a few minutes, the boat

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,440
disappeared, my body disappeared, and I felt like I was falling into infinity. I felt like

51
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:14,200
I was connected to the stars, and not only connected to the stars, but connected to nature.

52
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:25,720
I felt like I was part of something much bigger than myself. I felt like I was part of something

53
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:34,560
eternal. And after a few minutes, I turned on the engine of the boat. I didn't even know how

54
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:45,360
long I'd been lying there. So as Marcelo said, I've worked as a physicist for many years,

55
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:54,560
and I've always held a purely scientific view of the world. And by that, I mean that I believe,

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,160
and I think that most scientists do, that the world is made out of material, and nothing but material.

57
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:12,400
And that material is governed by a small number of fundamental forces and laws. And that everything

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:22,200
in the world, including humans and stars, is material and will eventually return to their

59
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,440
component parts. And even at the age of 12 or 13, I was impressed by the logic and the

60
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:40,120
materiality of the world. I built a little homemade laboratory for myself and did experiments.

61
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,200
And one of the experiments I did was to measure the swing of a pendulum. And I'd read in popular

62
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,200
science or some such magazine that the time it takes a pendulum to make one complete swing

63
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:03,800
was proportional to the square root of the length of the string of the pendulum. And it was a

64
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,600
beautiful law, which I verified with the help of a watch and a ruler. And it seemed to me that

65
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,320
everything in the world was quantitative and logical, that cause and effect governed everything.

66
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:28,160
And as far as I could tell, there was no reason to believe in a supernatural being or anything

67
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,560
supernatural. And that's pretty much still my view. But after that experience in the boat,

68
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:45,640
many years later, I understood the powerful attraction of the spiritual world. I understood

69
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:56,760
the powerful allure of believing in the eternal and the non-material and the ethereal and things

70
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:05,960
that were unchanging and eternal and sacred, believing in things and experiences that are

71
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:17,120
not reducible by logic. And at the same time, and perhaps paradoxically, I remained a scientist.

72
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:26,520
I remained committed to the material world. I have a good friend in Cambodia. I go there twice

73
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,480
a year. I have a good friend who is a venerated Buddhist monk. And sometimes I talk to him about

74
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,400
scientific and theological matters. And as some of you may know, the Buddhists believe in something

75
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:49,400
called the Four Noble Truths, which deal with suffering and how to relieve that suffering.

76
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,080
And my monk friend was careful to explain to me that Buddhists come to the belief in the Four

77
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Noble Truths by experience with the world. But there are other things that Buddhists believe in,

78
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,320
like the fact that the universe has gone through an infinite number of cycles,

79
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:22,960
that are based exclusively on the word of the Buddha, who was a person, a human being named

80
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:33,680
Siddhartha Gautama. One of the names for the Buddha is the Lakavidu, which in Pali means the

81
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:42,320
knower of worlds. And a lot of the authority of what the Buddhists believe comes from the

82
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:51,120
statements of the Buddha, the Lakavidu. And I wondered, how do we know that the Buddha was

83
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:02,680
the knower of worlds? Were Einstein and Darwin also knowers of worlds? The truths and the laws

84
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,040
that we believe about the physical universe and the spiritual universe, why do we believe them

85
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:20,200
and on whose authority? Science and religion differ profoundly in the way that truths are

86
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:30,480
discovered. Can everybody hear me? Good, because I'm not too close to the microphone here. In

87
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:40,600
religion and theology, these truths and beliefs seem to have two origins. One origin is the sacred

88
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:51,280
books, like the Bible or the Koran or the Vedas or the Pali Canon. And believers have faith

89
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,520
that these sacred books express the true word of God. And therefore, the authority comes from the

90
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:09,240
infinite wisdom associated with God or with other divine beings. The second origin of truth

91
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:21,000
and religious knowledge is more personal. It's what one might call the transcendent experience. So

92
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,440
I wanted to talk a little bit about these two kinds of knowledge and religion. And then I'll turn

93
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:38,000
to the knowledge and method of science and try to contrast the two. Quotations from the sacred

94
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,920
books are used to declare truths ranging from the origin of the universe to the question of free

95
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:55,160
will, even to reproductive biology. And let me quote a passage from Islamic Hadith, which is supposed

96
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:06,960
to be a quotation spoken by the prophet Mohammed. This concerns reproductive biology. He is created

97
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,440
of both he being man and woman. He is created of both the semen of the man and the semen of the

98
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,480
woman. The man's semen is thick and forms the bones and the tendons. The woman's semen is fine

99
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,880
and forms the flesh and the blood. And still today, there are many religious thinkers who

100
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,520
attribute absolute authority to the teachings of the sacred books, which is called Divine

101
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:46,160
Revelation. Let me quote from a part of the announcement of the Second Vatican Constitution

102
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,880
endorsed by Pope Paul VI. This was in the mid 1960s. And I quote, the books of scripture must be

103
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,560
acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully, and without error, the truth which God wanted put

104
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:11,960
into sacred writings for the sake of salvation. I do respect the notions of God and other divine

105
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,760
beings. However, I insist on one thing. I insist that any statements about the physical world,

106
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,360
and that would include the origin of the universe, reproductive biology, and so on. I insist that

107
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:36,080
statements about the physical world be tested by the methods of science and rejected if found to

108
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:45,360
contradict experiment. The spiritual world has its own domain, but the physical world must be the

109
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:54,920
province of science. In the physical world, the laws of nature cannot apply to some phenomena and

110
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:03,960
not others and apply at some times and not other times. It's not okay with me if the principles

111
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:15,000
of aerodynamics work on some of my airplane flights, but not on others. Most religions take

112
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:25,800
God to lie outside the physical world, outside of time and space. Because science is restricted to

113
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:34,600
the physical world, science can never disprove the existence of God. And I am impatient and frustrated

114
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:42,040
with some of my scientific colleagues like Richard Dawkins and Larry Krauss who attempt to use the

115
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,240
methods of science to disprove the existence of God. I think they are just totally missing the point.

116
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,920
Likewise, we can never prove the existence of God. Belief in God must be taken as a matter of faith.

117
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:06,680
Let me turn to the transcendent experience, which for me as both a scientist and a humanist is the

118
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,760
strongest and most compelling evidence that we have for a spiritual world. By transcendent

119
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:21,360
experience, I mean the immediate and vital experience of being connected to something larger than

120
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:30,080
ourselves, of feeling some unseen order in the world. And by the spiritual world, I mean the

121
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,840
totality of these experiences. The experience I had in Maine lying at the bottom of the boat

122
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,840
looking up at the sky was a transcendent experience. I've had many others and I'm sure that all of

123
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,760
you have had transcendent experience as well. The transcendent experience may or may not involve a

124
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:00,920
supreme being. Unlike the received wisdom of the sacred books or the teachings of the institutions of

125
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:10,680
religion, the transcendent experience is intensely personal and the authority of that experience rests

126
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:18,480
on the experience itself. There's no one who can refute a personal transcendent experience that

127
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:27,200
you've had. It cannot be disproved and often the transcendent experience is a unique one-time event.

128
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:37,800
The transcendent experience as an avenue to truth is a deeply human experience. In fact,

129
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,360
there are some philosophers and theologians who believe that truth exists only in the realm of

130
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,600
humanity and the human mind. Such a belief runs head-on against the beliefs of science which are

131
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,480
that there is truth and reality outside of the human mind. Doesn't the parabolic arc of a toss coin

132
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:14,040
exist whether or not there's a human mind to conceive it? These opposing views between whether

133
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:23,720
truth can exist outside of the human mind or must necessarily be within the human mind were

134
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,000
highlighted in an extraordinary conversation between Einstein and the great Bengali poet and

135
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,840
philosopher Rabindranath Tagore who won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Einstein and Tagore had a

136
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:50,400
great admiration for each other and they met a couple of times. Once was in July 14th 1930 at

137
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,320
Einstein's house in Kaputh near Berlin and I want to read you a portion of their conversation.

138
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:08,600
Einstein, truth then or beauty is not independent of mind of man question mark.

139
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:20,480
Tagore, no. Einstein, I agree with regard to the conception of beauty but not with regard to truth.

140
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:31,200
Tagore, why not? Truth is realized through man. This is before political correctness whereas

141
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:42,200
it's gender tilted. Einstein, I cannot prove that scientific truth must be conceived as a truth

142
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:50,520
that is valid independent of humanity but I believe it firmly. I believe, for example,

143
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,560
that the Pythagorean theorem and geometry state something that is true independent of the existence

144
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:05,640
of man. Anyway, there is a reality independent of man and there is also a truth relative to this

145
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:16,520
reality. Tagore, truth which is one with the universal being must essentially be human otherwise

146
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,400
whatever individuals realize is true can never be called truth at least the truth which is

147
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,960
described as scientific in which only can be reached through the process of logic in other words

148
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:39,640
by an organ of thought which is human. Einstein, the problem begins whether truth is independent

149
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,480
of our consciousness. Tagore, what we call truth lies in the rational harmony between

150
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,040
subjective and objective aspects of reality. I think it's a wonderful exchange.

151
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Well, I want now to discuss the knowledge and science and the way that we arrive at that

152
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,160
knowledge and I think scientific knowledge is of two types. First is there's the description

153
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,560
of physical objects such as the mass and the size of a raindrop, the measurement and description

154
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:24,840
and second there are the laws that govern the physical world which we call the laws of nature.

155
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:33,480
One of the first human beings to formulate a law of nature was 2000 years ago

156
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Archimedes, his law of floating bodies and let me quote that law for you.

157
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Any solid lighter than a fluid and lighter meaning less dense than a fluid will if placed in the

158
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,840
fluid be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the fluid

159
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:07,800
displaced. We can speculate on how Archimedes arrived at this law. 2000 years ago there were

160
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,720
scales and balances for weighing things because there was trade at the market.

161
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:22,440
So Archimedes could have taken a rectangular box filled with some fluid, put an object

162
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,800
in the fluid, first he would have weighed the object on the scales. Then he take a rectangular

163
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:37,560
box filled with fluid, put the object in the box, measured how much the water or fluid

164
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:45,800
level rose, how many centimeters it rose. Then multiply that by the area of the container to

165
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:53,400
get the volume of water displaced. Then in another container fill it up with that volume of water

166
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,000
and weigh the amount of water and then compare that with the original weight of the object.

167
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,560
And he would have done this many times to arrive at his law. He also would have used fluids other

168
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:14,040
than water like mercury to get to the generality of the law. And in fact all laws of the physical

169
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:20,760
world are like Archimedes' law. They're precise, they're quantitative, and they are general,

170
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:34,280
applying to a large range of phenomena. It's possible that nature wouldn't

171
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:42,280
obey laws at all. For example, it's possible that we would live in a universe where 2 plus 2

172
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:54,120
equal 4 and 2 plus 2 equal 3, a universe like that. But most scientists believe that the universes

173
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,560
that didn't obey laws would have self-contradictions like that mathematical one I just said.

174
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,480
Certainly it would be an unlawful universe would be a very frightening place to live.

175
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,200
In the last 200 years we have discovered laws that govern the behavior of the insides of atoms,

176
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:23,560
the expansion of the universe, the orbits of planets, and many other phenomena. And from those

177
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:30,600
laws we've been able to explain in quantitative detail everything from the color of the sky,

178
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,760
to the orbits of planets, to the mass and size of raindrops.

179
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:46,920
And we have seen no evidence to contradict the notion that all phenomena in the physical universe

180
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,720
are governed by laws. And here's a wonderful law of nature that you can

181
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:05,240
confirm this yourself. Take any object like a pen and drop it to the floor from a height of four feet

182
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,280
and time how long it will take to reach the floor and the gravity of the earth and you'll get a half

183
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:18,600
a second. Now drop the object from a height of eight feet and you'll get about 0.7 seconds

184
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:26,280
and drop then drop it from a height of 16 feet and you'll get one second. And what you find if

185
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,240
you drop the object from several different heights is that the time it takes to fall doubles with

186
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:42,440
every quadrupling of the height. This is a rule of nature, a law of nature. It was discovered first

187
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:51,080
by Galileo in 1590. It's called his law of falling bodies. And with this rule which you can do yourself

188
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:59,240
at home you have discovered the lawfulness of the physical world. The law of the swinging pendulum

189
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:10,280
that I confirm myself at age 12 was an example very closely related to Galileo's law of falling

190
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:17,640
bodies. And I didn't believe it was true because I read it in popular science. I didn't believe it

191
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,320
was true because I wanted it to be true. I didn't believe it was true because the great Galileo

192
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,120
had said that it was true. I believe that it was true because it worked. It evidently described a

193
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:40,360
real property of nature. Let me describe the methods and the manner of science. Galileo's

194
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:48,520
law of falling bodies is a special case of Newton's more general law of gravity. Newton discovered

195
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:58,120
his law about 50 years later by analyzing the orbits of planets. For two centuries Newton's law

196
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,160
worked beautifully. But then in the mid-19th century it was found that the orbit of the planet

197
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,360
Mercury didn't quite fit Newton's law of gravity. It was off by a very tiny amount, amounting to

198
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:20,520
about one hundredth of an angular degree every century. An incredibly tiny discrepancy, but the

199
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,480
telescopes were so good at that time the observations so careful that scientists agreed that there was

200
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:37,560
a problem. Then in 1915 Albert Einstein proposed a new law of gravity replacing Newton's theory of

201
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:45,960
gravity which explained this orbit of Mercury perfectly also predicted gravitational waves

202
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,720
which were discovered about a year and a half ago and many other phenomena. Now the important point,

203
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:01,880
we know that Einstein's theory as beautiful and accurate as it is will also be replaced

204
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,720
someday by a more accurate theory. Now all of the laws of nature discovered by scientists

205
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,200
are considered provisional. They're considered to be approximations to deeper laws.

206
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:25,320
They're constantly being revised as new experimental data comes in and as new ideas come

207
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,240
forth and are tested. In fact what we call the laws of nature should really be called

208
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:40,360
approximate laws of nature because in any given time we're only working with approximations

209
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,200
even if they're final laws of nature, perfect laws of nature. At any one time we're working with

210
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:56,200
approximations to those final laws and it is in this process of revision that we see the strongest

211
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:04,120
difference between science and religion. As I've said everything in the physical world

212
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,000
is subject to laws but we have only approximations to those ultimate laws which we're constantly

213
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,440
revising. The beliefs and knowledge of religion coming either from the divine authority of

214
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,960
the sacred books or from the transcendent experience are not subject to revision.

215
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:34,920
They are not approximations. Religion does not revise itself in the way that science does.

216
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,280
There is something that scientists believe that cannot be tested according to the methods of science

217
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:50,040
and that is a principle I call the central doctrine of science and that principle says

218
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:59,960
that the physical world is governed by laws and that those laws are always true everywhere

219
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:08,680
and at every time in the universe. I call the central doctrine of science a doctrine

220
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,440
because despite its past success it cannot be proven. No matter what laws we have

221
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:27,160
we can't be sure that tomorrow we might observe some phenomena that is a miracle that just cannot

222
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:37,960
be explained by any laws. Our faith in the doctrine is so strong that when we find physical

223
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:47,960
phenomena that seem to be unlawful like the orbit of the planet Mercury we don't abandon belief

224
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:57,400
in a lawful universe. When it was found that the orbit of Mercury disagreed a little bit with

225
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:04,200
Newton's theory of gravity we did not attribute the discrepancy to something mysterious,

226
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:12,120
to the action of a whimsical god or something that was intrinsically unexplainable. We

227
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:23,800
realized that our theory needed revision and in fact I can't imagine any event in the physical

228
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:31,480
universe that would cause scientists to label it as a miracle to abandon belief in a lawful

229
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:39,880
universe. If this table started floating right now scientists would look for some magnetic levitation

230
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:50,360
or some other law that they hadn't yet discovered but not a miracle. We are deeply committed to

231
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,600
the central doctrine. There's another belief in science that cannot be proven

232
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:05,320
and that is belief that there is a final theory that is perfect that is beyond approximation

233
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:16,200
and many physicists call this a final theory. Such a belief has not emerged from science itself.

234
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,640
In fact the history of science shows that we're constantly revising and revising and revising

235
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:30,120
and revising so belief in a final theory is just a matter of faith and the irony here is that even

236
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:39,480
if we were in the possession of a final theory we wouldn't know it because you couldn't prove

237
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,840
that tomorrow you might observe a phenomena that disagreed with the theory so we believe it

238
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:56,760
as a matter of faith. In his book Dreams of a Final Theory the Nobel Prize-winning physicist

239
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,040
Stephen Weinberg writes quote our present theories are only of limited validity still

240
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:11,000
tentative and incomplete but behind them now and then we catch glimpses of a final theory

241
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,040
one that would be of unlimited validity and entirely satisfactory in its completeness

242
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:25,800
and consistency. My own guess is that there is a final theory and we are capable of discovering it.

243
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,200
A final theory is really an extension of the central doctrine of science

244
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,320
and some I would argue that despite the huge differences between science and religion and

245
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:45,720
the way that knowledge is acquired that both share a certain degree of faith

246
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:53,080
of belief and commitment to the unprovable science experimentally tests everything that it believes

247
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,400
with the exception of the fundamental belief the belief in the central doctrine of science.

248
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,760
I wanted to end by talking about some of these issues in a more a more personal way in specific

249
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:17,800
way and that is my personal attitude towards death. One could argue that many of our religious and

250
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,840
spiritual beliefs are motivated by a knowledge of our own impending death.

251
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:39,800
We confront our own physical demise with invoking the eternal the immortal soul god and so on.

252
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:49,160
All material things are made out of atoms and molecules and the energy that holds them together

253
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,440
and the forces and energies that hold them together and atoms and molecules are part

254
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:04,280
of the physical world and according to the view of science all material is governed by laws.

255
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Immortality is not allowed by the laws. Disembodied existence is not allowed by the laws.

256
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,880
Insubstantiality is not allowed by the laws.

257
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:28,440
I'm a materialist as I said when I started but I consider myself a spiritual person so

258
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:37,720
you might call me a spiritual materialist. So the question is how does a spiritual materialist

259
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,880
think about his own impending death?

260
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,160
I believe that this distinction between life and death is overrated.

261
00:35:51,320 --> 00:36:00,440
I've come to believe that death occurs gradually through the diminishing of consciousness

262
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
and let me explain what I mean.

263
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,120
According to the scientific view we are made of material atoms and nothing more.

264
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,160
In fact to be precise the average person is made out of about 7000 trillion trillion atoms.

265
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,880
The totality of our tissues and organs are composed of these atoms.

266
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,520
And according to the scientific view there's nothing else.

267
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:39,880
To a vast cosmic being each of us human beings would appear as an assemblage of atoms

268
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,880
humming with our various electrical and chemical energies. To be sure it's a special assemblage

269
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,120
a rock does not behave like a person but the mental sensations that we experience

270
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:04,280
as consciousness and thought according to science are purely material consequences

271
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,600
of the purely material electrical and chemical interactions between atoms.

272
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:18,360
And when we die this special assemblage disassembles.

273
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,880
The total number of our atoms in our body say the same but they are scattered about.

274
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,720
Particularly special in these considerations is the brain and the view of science the brain

275
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:45,800
is where our self-awareness originates our self-identity our ego our consciousness our

276
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:53,400
eyeness. Neuroscientists have studied the brain in great detail they know a lot about the brain

277
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,880
there's a lot that's that's still unknown. There's a there's good evidence that the processing and

278
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,960
storage of information in the brain occurs principally through the neurons we have about

279
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:13,320
a hundred billion neurons in our brain these are brain cells. The electrical and chemical

280
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,480
interactions between the neurons are largely understood the matter the manner in which electrical

281
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:27,400
signals speed down a neuron then are converted to a flow of chemicals that go to the next neuron

282
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:34,840
these these things are understood very well the long-term memory that we have upon so much of our

283
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:43,240
self-identity rest is accomplished by the material generation of new connections between

284
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,640
neurons and the reinforcement of existing connections by specific proteins we've seen

285
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,160
new synapses grow between neurons we've seen we know which proteins are involved.

286
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:05,960
Despite all of this despite the known material nature of the brain the sensation of consciousness

287
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:16,520
the ego the eyeness is so powerful and compelling so fundamental to our being and yet so difficult

288
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:25,400
to describe that we endow ourselves and other human beings with a mystical quality some magnificent

289
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:34,040
and non-material essence that goes far beyond the individual atoms in our brain to some people

290
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:42,440
that mystical thing is the soul to some it is the self to others it is consciousness

291
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:52,520
the soul is commonly understood we cannot discuss scientifically so i will not even attempt to discuss

292
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:00,920
it but that's not the case with consciousness and the closely related self isn't the experience

293
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,960
of consciousness and self an illusion caused by those trillions and trillions of neuronal

294
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
connections the connections between neurons and the electrical and chemical flows and if you don't

295
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,440
like the word illusion then you can stick with the sensation itself you can say that the self

296
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,600
is a name that we that we give to that sensation of all of those electrical and chemical

297
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,240
flows between the neurons and and by saying this i don't want to diminish any way

298
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:45,000
the brain the human brain is capable of wondrous feasts of imagination creativity self reflection

299
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,840
thought by do claim that it's all atoms and molecules if the giant cosmic being that i

300
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:04,760
referred to earlier examined a human being in detail he she or it would see fluids flowing

301
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:12,600
sodium and potassium gates opening and closing on neurons electrical electricity races between

302
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:23,720
the nerve cells the chemical flows between synapses but he she or it would not find a self

303
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,920
the self and consciousness i think are names we give to those sensations

304
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,160
having said that the consciousness is simply a name we give to those sensations

305
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:48,520
i want to to to make the point that i don't think that consciousness can be understood simply

306
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:57,000
by the microscopic analysis of individual neurons the brain has roughly a hundred million neurons

307
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,440
in it and when you have very low a very large system like that composed of many many elemental

308
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:15,160
parts then there is a behavior of the system as a whole that cannot be predicted and which is

309
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:22,680
qualitatively qualitatively different than what individual elements do and this is called an

310
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:31,960
emergent phenomena another example of an emergent phenomena is a snowflake uh snowflakes are made

311
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:41,080
out of crystalline ice ice is water water is made out of molecules molecules are atoms of

312
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:48,360
hydrogen and oxygen and we can know everything about the orbits of electrons and atoms and and

313
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:56,760
hydrogen and oxygen uh we can know how those atoms join together to make molecules we can even

314
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,280
understand the six-sided symmetry of a snowflake but when you put billions and trillions of those

315
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:12,120
molecules together including very tiny interactions with the environment of the snowflake then it is

316
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:21,560
impossible to predict the zillions of different patterns that snowflakes form it cannot be understood

317
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:34,600
by analyzing individual elements now let me come back to death if someone began disassembling my brain

318
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:44,280
one neuron at a time depending on where the process began i might first lose a few motor skills

319
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,640
then some memories then perhaps the ability to find particular words and sentences

320
00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:00,600
the ability to recognize faces the ability to know where i was during this slow process of

321
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:10,840
taking apart my brain i would become more and more confused disoriented everything that i

322
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:18,600
associated with myself with my ego with my self-identity would gradually dissolve away

323
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:26,920
in a bog of confusion and minimal existence the doctors and their blue and green scrub suits

324
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,120
who were taking apart my brain one neuron neuron at a time they could drop those neurons each one

325
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:43,800
in a metal bowl each would be a tiny gray gelatinous blob each would have the spindly dendrites and

326
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,960
axons coming out of it you wouldn't hear each one drop because they're very soft

327
00:44:52,280 --> 00:45:00,520
likewise the doctors and their blue and green scrub suits could create consciousness by building

328
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:09,080
a brain from scratch one neuron at a time they could slowly add neurons together delicately

329
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,120
arranging the connections between neurons one neuron at a time and the doctors might hook up

330
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:22,760
an electrical device to monitor the electrical activity of these neurons and for a long time

331
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:29,800
there would just be noise but at some point presumably a qualitative change would occur

332
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:38,360
some coherent signal an unusual hum that would translate roughly into yikes something is messing

333
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:51,240
with me if we conceive of death as nothingness then we cannot imagine it but if we conceive of death

334
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,880
as the complete loss of consciousness a view supported by the understanding of the brain

335
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:08,760
as a material object then we can approach death in a gradual stages as consciousness

336
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:17,240
fades and dissolves the distinction between life and death would then no longer be an all or nothing

337
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:26,840
proposition the neuroscientist Antonio Demasio has defined several levels of consciousness

338
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:34,600
the lowest level he calls the protocell the protocell and that's just an organism that is able

339
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:42,600
to carry on the most basic processes of life but nothing else an amoeba an amoeba has a protocell

340
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,960
I would not associated this this level with consciousness surely you need a minimum number

341
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:57,880
of neurons to have consciousness next comes what Demasio calls core consciousness

342
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:05,480
its self-awareness and the ability to think and reason in the present moment but without

343
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,440
memories of the past and certain people with brain disorders have core consciousness

344
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,360
you would be able to understand the world around you but you would exist only in the present

345
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,760
um you cannot form memories that last more than a few minutes you cannot remember what happened

346
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:32,200
to you in the past except for isolated periods you cannot make plans for the future you're trapped

347
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:40,680
in the moment in the highest level of consciousness uh which all healthy people have is what Demasio

348
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:49,240
calls extended consciousness here we remember most of our past life we can remember our view of the

349
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:59,080
world based on past experiences we can remember places that we've been we can remember what we

350
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:07,320
like and what we don't like self-identity as most psychologists define it probably requires

351
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:13,240
extended consciousness that is long-term memories these of course are very difficult issues

352
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:22,600
the slow dismantling of a human brain whether by my imaginary doctors and their blue and green

353
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:31,480
scrub suits or by the deterioration of the brain and a neural disease might proceed from extended

354
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:38,920
consciousness to core consciousness to the proto-self or perhaps it might proceed in a

355
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,000
less orderly manner by removing chunks of extended consciousness here chunks of core

356
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,040
consciousness there until one is left with a proto-self either way one begins with full

357
00:48:52,040 --> 00:49:01,240
consciousness and ends with an amoeba like existence one begins with a full life and ends

358
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:09,720
with death or the equivalent of death and this process can happen gradually so that there may

359
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:18,600
may be some awareness of the increasing loss of awareness personal accounts of early dementia

360
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,480
provide the best knowledge we have of approaching death in this manner

361
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:32,040
in the early stages of dementia where enough of the mind remains to understand and articulate

362
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:40,760
what's happening you can you can understand how consciousness is gradually being lost

363
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:50,360
but in later stages the person has slipped into an abyss of confusion somewhere in the

364
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:59,720
intermediate zone the sense of self dissolves and is gone I know this is a very grim subject

365
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:06,280
many of you probably know people or have relatives who about dementia I've had some loved ones who

366
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,840
have had dementia I currently have a friend who lives in michigan who is dying of alzheimer's

367
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:20,040
and she writes me letters frequently and I can see the loss of her herself fading away

368
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,080
now I wanted to end with something truly personal

369
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:37,240
from a scientific point of view I believe everything that I've said about the materiality

370
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,000
of the brain I've laid it out

371
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,960
but I'm not satisfied with this picture

372
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:58,040
in my mind I can still see my mother dancing the bossa nova bossa nova in my mind I can still

373
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:06,200
hear my father telling his kushmaker joke and the last the punchline is it went kush

374
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,240
and I can have another one up in 15 minutes

375
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:19,080
I often wonder where are they now my deceased parents my father and mother

376
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,440
I know the materials explanation which I've just told you but that does nothing to relieve

377
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:33,320
my longing for them and the impossible truth that they do not exist anymore

378
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:48,360
I am alive and I'm enjoying it aching joints and all despite my belief that I am only a collection

379
00:51:48,360 --> 00:52:00,040
of atoms that my awareness is passing away neuron by neuron I am content with the illusion of life

380
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,760
I'll take it and even though I do not believe in a heaven or hell when I do not believe in

381
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:14,440
the immortal soul I find a pleasure in knowing that a hundred years from now and even a thousand

382
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:22,520
years from now that most of my atoms will remain those atoms will not know where they came from

383
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:32,600
but they will have been mine some of them will have been part of the memory of my mother

384
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:41,800
some of them will be the vinegary smell of my first apartment the memory of that

385
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,600
some of them will once have been my hand and if I could label each of my atoms at this moment

386
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:59,560
write my social security number on each of my atoms someone could follow those atoms for the next

387
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:08,840
thousand years as they floated in the air mixed with the soil became parts of plants and trees

388
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,800
dissolved in the ocean and then floated into the air again some of my atoms a thousand years

389
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:25,560
from now will be parts of other people some will be parts of other lives other memories

390
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,680
and some after that long journey will return to the island in Maine

391
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,200
so that's how a spiritual materialist thinks of his own death

392
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:49,800
science and religion have been the two greatest forces that have shaped human civilization

393
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:56,440
I think they both expressed something deeply human about us they're both here to stay

394
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:08,680
and so let the dialogue continue thank you

395
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:38,520
this works yes good um so thank you so much for this and I'm sure some people may have questions

396
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,440
comments wow oh there you go we can start there

397
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,640
hey thanks on behalf probably of everybody here I much appreciate the talk

398
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,400
it seems if there's something in common between the scientific approach

399
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:03,960
and the faith-based approach and that both are asking why why did that happen why did

400
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,040
something happen and with science we we test hypotheses and some of them when you come across

401
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,720
consciousness and you say well we can't understand it it's sort of mystical in a way and it's not

402
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,640
surprising to me therefore that some people would say well there must be something bigger something

403
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,880
greater involved so it's not surprising to me that there's this difference in part because

404
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:33,800
they seem to both be asking the same question good comment yeah I don't think I need to

405
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,800
respond to that I agree with what you said okay there was a hand yeah

406
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,200
um it perhaps you've provided an answer to this question and uh caused me to find some comfort

407
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,760
but I've always been uh troubled by the uncertain uncertainty of quantum mechanics the further

408
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:06,680
you investigate into material the less certain it becomes um you you've kind of addressed that but

409
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:12,840
perhaps it's worth some additional thought from your side how it fits in and how it's explained

410
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,520
well it's it's not true it's not quite true that the further we investigate quantum mechanics

411
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:27,560
the more uncertain it becomes um the the uncertainty in quantum mechanics uh

412
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:37,320
well what it says uh explicitly is that you uh for example that you can't know

413
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,560
precisely where a particle is and at the same time know precisely how fast it's moving

414
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,520
but there is a uh a quantitative relationship a quantitative equation that tells you exactly

415
00:56:52,520 --> 00:57:00,360
how much that trade-off is that uncertainty is between position and motion and uh

416
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:09,240
uh we uh when we have large numbers of particles uh we can we can convert that uncertainty to

417
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:16,760
probabilities and we can predict very accurately how a large number of particles will behave um

418
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,320
um so um

419
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:31,240
there is there is a fundamental uh fuzziness of of nature at at the smallest scales

420
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,960
but I I don't think that it's true that that that uncertainty is getting larger and larger

421
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,720
as we learn more and more I think we have been able to put a box around that uncertainty

422
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:53,480
and even quantify it and we actually have equations that express that uncertainty uh so

423
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:06,520
there there there are a lot of uh philosophers and ethicists and uh theologians have have

424
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:14,520
invoked quantum mechanics or the uncertainty in quantum mechanics to express uh uh theological

425
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:21,640
and ethical issues philosophical issues such as whether uh we can have free will uh versus

426
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,920
determined whether whether we have a free will in making choices or whether our actions are

427
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:33,400
completely determined um if there's a little bit of uncertainty maybe that explains uh some

428
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:41,000
arbitrariness in our actions uh but I think that most of those arguments are are misusing

429
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:51,560
quantum mechanics um so I I don't mean to uh to uh dismiss your your question at at all

430
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:59,960
but I do think that that quantum mechanics is not the place to look for this uh uh

431
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,000
union or sympathy between science and religion

432
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:22,600
we all seem to struggle with this concept of consciousness and life itself in fact

433
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:33,080
and I might offer the concept that the universe and everything in it is in fact alive is conscious

434
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:40,120
and sentient and is intelligent and therefore the phenomena that we see that we don't understand

435
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,720
do have an intelligence behind them even though it is not of our understanding I don't accept

436
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,880
the supernatural but I know that there are phenomena that we do not cannot explain today

437
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,720
but that that certainly can be part of our natural universe

438
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,600
thank you for your talk um I have no question just a couple of observations that are

439
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:26,520
personal about consciousness um and I'll just let them float out there to my youngest students I used

440
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:39,240
to say uh accept that if we accept that the universe is just a series and I'm a non-scientist

441
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,520
this will be pretty clear to you but if we accept that the universe is just a series of random

442
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:50,680
accidents of physics and chemistry isn't it pretty remarkable that it ends up with you

443
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:58,760
on one level and uh another thing I think about quite a lot although I have not read up on it

444
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:11,240
is that and this is about my personal consciousness who writes scripts casts and directs my dreams

445
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:22,600
because it is not me the comments are floating okay

446
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,880
thank you so much for your talk um I was wondering so um as a Muslim from a religious

447
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,840
point of view I can understand where ethics and morality derives from in terms of

448
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,480
okay assuming god created you god understands you best he knows how this whole machine works

449
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:52,520
and you follow the rules prescribed by god where do um I guess where the ethic or the word where's

450
01:01:52,520 --> 01:02:01,400
the source of ethics and morality from a more materialistic or scientific worldview um and um

451
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,520
yeah I guess that's primarily yeah yeah

452
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:20,120
um well uh first of all I I I do not think that you need a divine being or a creator

453
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,160
to develop for human beings develop a sense of ethics and morality um that doesn't mean that

454
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:34,440
that such a being doesn't exist but it just means I don't think it's necessary um

455
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:41,320
um I think that that some of our ethics and morality

456
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:54,040
evolved and maybe all of it from evolutionary forces that is uh for our own survival

457
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:03,720
and I think that you know Wilson might have written a book uh on the altruistic gene

458
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,920
um Marcel am I right about that

459
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:19,880
wrote a lot about altruism yeah and and uh according to that idea uh and of course we we can't

460
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:28,440
prove the idea because evolution happened over millions of years that that you're uh you're

461
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,520
feeling uh your your tender feelings for other people and the desire to help them

462
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:45,240
could have originated from the desire to preserve your community not just yourself but

463
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:54,120
your family if one of your family members uh survives then they can help take care of you

464
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:00,120
uh and so uh through the process of evolution when lots of different uh

465
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,600
random processes were occurring and some were beneficial for survival and some weren't

466
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:16,760
the the desire to help your fellow human being in certain ways could have been had survival

467
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:27,880
benefit for you and thus would have been uh preserved uh that trait um the the very strong

468
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:36,840
feeling that you have for a mate uh is clearly of evolutionary benefit uh to form a union that

469
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,840
allows the protection of the children while they're they're growing up um I know this is a very cold

470
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:50,840
hearted explanation of of of ethics and morality uh but this would be the materialist explanation

471
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,400
I believe

472
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:09,400
hello yeah so as you're sitting there with these men in the uh blue and green suits

473
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:16,280
and uh having your your brain dismantled uh neuron by neuron um they're they're taking the

474
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:23,320
neurons and and putting them into a jar and and remaking another brain that that has the

475
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,840
exact same shape as the one that they're dismantling just in a different place and slowly as your

476
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:35,880
consciousness goes down to to the point where it disappears and the consciousness of of the brain

477
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,720
that's forming in the jar slowly peaks up into a yikes what's happening to me um

478
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:51,400
what are your thoughts there on the continuity of self and is is the the consciousness that

479
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:57,880
wakes up in the jar a continuity of of you sitting at the table well that's that's that's the basis

480
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:05,000
of a wonderful science fiction story and uh I of course don't know the answer to that

481
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:17,000
but I think would be a great a great um here here's where uh I do think that that uh physics

482
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,560
would come in and that is I think that you could show that it's impossible to recreate

483
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:30,680
the brain exactly starting from scratch that is if you're if you're given all of the

484
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,480
positions the positions of all of the atoms in my brain um I think it would be impossible to

485
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:45,720
to recreate that exactly so there'd be little errors here and there you know this one nerve

486
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,600
filament was supposed to connect to this neuron and it didn't it connected to that one instead

487
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:57,400
and uh so I I don't think that it would be actually possible uh but if it were possible

488
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:05,800
uh that it's a great question of whether my consciousness would suddenly appear somewhere

489
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:15,960
else um and uh I think that that eventually when we understand the brain well enough

490
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:24,520
that we may be able to download a lot of the information in our neurons and put it on a piece

491
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:31,320
of silicon and then the answer is does does that have a consciousness and how is it related to the

492
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:41,480
original consciousness but it's a great question and uh I I hope that you will write a sci-fi story

493
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:50,280
based on it having a public dialogue in Boston in the spring of 2018 on transhumanism which is

494
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,640
pretty much one of the things that deals with this kind of stuff one last question there was a

495
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:05,800
lady here did you still have a question while you were speaking I was just kind of remembering

496
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:13,320
this counterculture Catholic church group I was in back in the 70s in California and the Catholic

497
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,440
priest during communion you know we'd have communion together he would say now you know

498
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:27,560
we can be imagining um that we're just sharing in now all of what creation is made of and the

499
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:34,520
body and blood of Jesus and the stuff of all of what creation is made of and it's all material

500
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:43,240
and it's all spiritual someday we'll know that it all goes together so thank you

501
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:48,040
note I'll thank you all for coming and stay tuned for more thank you
