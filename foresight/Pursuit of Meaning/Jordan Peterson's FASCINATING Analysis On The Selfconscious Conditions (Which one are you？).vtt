00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
You burn something and you send the smoke up, God gets a crack at determining the quality of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Well, let's be perfectly clear about this.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
If your sacrifices aren't first rate, the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
And that's exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Now, Abel, he's a trusting character.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
He believes in the nature of experience and the nature of existence.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
When he's called on to make a sacrifice, he sacrifices the best that he has to offer.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And that makes God happy and has a consequence.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Everything that Abel touches turns to gold.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Everyone likes him, they respect him.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
His crops multiply, he's successful with women.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Plus, he's a wonderful guy.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
So you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite.

00:53.000 --> 01:05.000
And there's a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own devious devices to sail his ship through the shoals of life.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
He believes as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of his withdrawal from the infinite,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
a contact that he can't tolerate because he can't tolerate his own vulnerability,

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
that he's able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer second rate sacrifices to God himself,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
who can see absolutely everything, because the infinite is absolutely everything,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
and to prevail nonetheless.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Well, needless to say, this does not work.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
And it doesn't work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their unnecessary suffering.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
It's very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
They'll tell you the poor decisions they made in their lives and the opportunities that they didn't take

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
and the chances that they didn't have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they failed to make.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
There's nothing mysterious about it.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Well, that's a terrible thing.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
He's unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens, and that's partly because he doesn't really want it,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
because if he really wanted it, he'd make the right sacrifices.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
but of course really isn't.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Cain goes to complain to God.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
And he says,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
What in the world is going on here?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm marking myself to the bone.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm sacrificing things left, right, and center.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Everything I touch turns to dirt.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Everything turns against me.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Like, what's up with the nature of reality?

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
Cain's essential vulnerability is revealed and exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
God says to him, essentially,

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Sin is a predatory cat that croaches at your doorway and leaps on you at will.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But if you only wanted to, you could master it.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
And that is absolutely the last thing that Cain wants to hear.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Because if things are going from bad to worse for you and you're playing a causal role in it,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
there's nothing more horrible than something that someone can do to you,

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
but reveal to you in a way that you can't deny that you're entirely complicit in your own demise.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
And that's exactly what God does to Cain.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And so what does Cain do?

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, the logical thing would be listen, because if the structure of reality itself tells you something,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
it's best to listen since there's no way out of it, but that's not what Cain does.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
He's so incensed by his essential vulnerability,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and to conduct himself appropriately that he decides then and there.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels when that ideal exists as a contrast point.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And number two, to destroy the favored son of God.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And so he goes out into the field and kills Abel.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And God comes along and says, where's my favorite son?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Cain says, I killed him.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
And it's so interesting to me that that story is placed really, it's the third story in the Old Testament.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It's with the archaic stories.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
And it's a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
to the self-conscious, vulnerable conditions of existence.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
And one is a humble approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And the other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
and the degeneration of the soul into something that's homicidally murderous.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, the story doesn't stop there and it gets really compressed in this part

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
and that's perhaps because some of it's been lost with the passages of time.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
But the next thing that happens is that, well, God doesn't punish Cain.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
And you think, that's kind of strange.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I mean, Old Testament God, he's punishing people left, right and center.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Not Cain.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
And you think, well, he marks Cain and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
because he's been marked by God as to be left alone.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
And the reason for that, I think, and this is something that's reflected on our legal system,

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
is that murder promotes revenge and revenge destroys societies.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And so God puts an end to the situation right there and then by telling people that

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
despite the fact that Cain has committed a terrible crime,

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
that there will be no retribution.

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain's offspring,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
he doesn't kill you, he kills seven of you.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain's offspring,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
he doesn't kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
And Tubal Cain is the artificer of weapons of war.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
And this stunningly brilliant story says in its incredibly compressed fashion

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
that the motivation that drives the commission of the worst human atrocities

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the self-conscious individual

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
and their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage,

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And the next story is the flood and it's not surprising

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
because if things go from bad to worse long enough, everything falls.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And it's a terrifying story and I didn't understand that story.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I didn't understand that story for years.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It wasn't really until I read Alexander Solzhenitsyn that I developed,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I think, the cognitive capacity to even understand what the story meant

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
because Solzhenitsyn said it is no bell prize accepting speech.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
A single person who stops lying can bring down a tyranny,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
which is a stunning thing to say,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
but I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
because we have historical examples of people who did precisely that.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Gandhi did it, Vaclav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the axe blows

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
that brought down the Soviet Union,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
a stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
by memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim this far away from starvation.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
It shows you as clearly as anything possibly can how powerful the human spirit can be

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
if it's willing to take on the obligation of its relationship with the divine

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
and also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
This is not shouldered.
