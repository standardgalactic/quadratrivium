1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You burn something and you send the smoke up, God gets a crack at determining the quality of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, let's be perfectly clear about this.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If your sacrifices aren't first rate, the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And that's exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, Abel, he's a trusting character.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He believes in the nature of experience and the nature of existence.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When he's called on to make a sacrifice, he sacrifices the best that he has to offer.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And that makes God happy and has a consequence.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everything that Abel touches turns to gold.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Everyone likes him, they respect him.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
His crops multiply, he's successful with women.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Plus, he's a wonderful guy.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And there's a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own devious devices to sail his ship through the shoals of life.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He believes as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of his withdrawal from the infinite,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a contact that he can't tolerate because he can't tolerate his own vulnerability,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that he's able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer second rate sacrifices to God himself,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
who can see absolutely everything, because the infinite is absolutely everything,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and to prevail nonetheless.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, needless to say, this does not work.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And it doesn't work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their unnecessary suffering.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They'll tell you the poor decisions they made in their lives and the opportunities that they didn't take

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and the chances that they didn't have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they failed to make.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There's nothing mysterious about it.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, that's a terrible thing.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens, and that's partly because he doesn't really want it,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because if he really wanted it, he'd make the right sacrifices.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but of course really isn't.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Cain goes to complain to God.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And he says,

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What in the world is going on here?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm marking myself to the bone.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sacrificing things left, right, and center.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everything I touch turns to dirt.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Everything turns against me.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Like, what's up with the nature of reality?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cain's essential vulnerability is revealed and exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
God says to him, essentially,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sin is a predatory cat that croaches at your doorway and leaps on you at will.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But if you only wanted to, you could master it.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And that is absolutely the last thing that Cain wants to hear.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because if things are going from bad to worse for you and you're playing a causal role in it,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
there's nothing more horrible than something that someone can do to you,

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but reveal to you in a way that you can't deny that you're entirely complicit in your own demise.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And that's exactly what God does to Cain.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so what does Cain do?

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, the logical thing would be listen, because if the structure of reality itself tells you something,

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's best to listen since there's no way out of it, but that's not what Cain does.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's so incensed by his essential vulnerability,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and to conduct himself appropriately that he decides then and there.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels when that ideal exists as a contrast point.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And number two, to destroy the favored son of God.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And so he goes out into the field and kills Abel.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And God comes along and says, where's my favorite son?

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Cain says, I killed him.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And it's so interesting to me that that story is placed really, it's the third story in the Old Testament.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's with the archaic stories.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
to the self-conscious, vulnerable conditions of existence.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And one is a humble approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And the other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and the degeneration of the soul into something that's homicidally murderous.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, the story doesn't stop there and it gets really compressed in this part

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and that's perhaps because some of it's been lost with the passages of time.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But the next thing that happens is that, well, God doesn't punish Cain.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And you think, that's kind of strange.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I mean, Old Testament God, he's punishing people left, right and center.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Not Cain.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And you think, well, he marks Cain and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
because he's been marked by God as to be left alone.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And the reason for that, I think, and this is something that's reflected on our legal system,

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is that murder promotes revenge and revenge destroys societies.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so God puts an end to the situation right there and then by telling people that

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
despite the fact that Cain has committed a terrible crime,

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that there will be no retribution.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain's offspring,

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
he doesn't kill you, he kills seven of you.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain's offspring,

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
he doesn't kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And Tubal Cain is the artificer of weapons of war.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And this stunningly brilliant story says in its incredibly compressed fashion

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that the motivation that drives the commission of the worst human atrocities

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the self-conscious individual

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage,

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And the next story is the flood and it's not surprising

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
because if things go from bad to worse long enough, everything falls.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And it's a terrifying story and I didn't understand that story.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I didn't understand that story for years.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It wasn't really until I read Alexander Solzhenitsyn that I developed,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think, the cognitive capacity to even understand what the story meant

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because Solzhenitsyn said it is no bell prize accepting speech.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A single person who stops lying can bring down a tyranny,

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which is a stunning thing to say,

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because we have historical examples of people who did precisely that.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Gandhi did it, Vaclav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the axe blows

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that brought down the Soviet Union,

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
a stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
by memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim this far away from starvation.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It shows you as clearly as anything possibly can how powerful the human spirit can be

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
if it's willing to take on the obligation of its relationship with the divine

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is not shouldered.
