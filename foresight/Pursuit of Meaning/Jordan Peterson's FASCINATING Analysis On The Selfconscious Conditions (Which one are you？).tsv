0	8000	You burn something and you send the smoke up, God gets a crack at determining the quality of your offering, the quality of your sacrifice.
8000	12000	Well, let's be perfectly clear about this.
12000	18000	If your sacrifices aren't first rate, the nature of your relationship with the infinite is going to suffer dreadfully.
18000	21000	And that's exactly what the story of Cain and Abel reveals.
21000	24000	Now, Abel, he's a trusting character.
24000	27000	He believes in the nature of experience and the nature of existence.
27000	31000	When he's called on to make a sacrifice, he sacrifices the best that he has to offer.
31000	33000	And that makes God happy and has a consequence.
33000	36000	Everything that Abel touches turns to gold.
36000	38000	Everyone likes him, they respect him.
38000	40000	His crops multiply, he's successful with women.
40000	42000	Plus, he's a wonderful guy.
42000	46000	So you could hardly imagine a more annoying creature if you possibly attempted to do it.
46000	53000	Whereas Cain has reacted to his self-consciousness by withdrawing from the infinite.
53000	65000	And there's a tremendous danger in that because it starts to mean that he relies purely on his own devious devices to sail his ship through the shoals of life.
65000	71000	He believes as his arrogance develops, as a consequence of his withdrawal from the infinite,
71000	75000	a contact that he can't tolerate because he can't tolerate his own vulnerability,
75000	81000	that he's able to deceive the structure of reality itself to offer second rate sacrifices to God himself,
81000	85000	who can see absolutely everything, because the infinite is absolutely everything,
85000	87000	and to prevail nonetheless.
87000	90000	Well, needless to say, this does not work.
90000	98000	And it doesn't work in an obvious way if you talk to people and they reveal to you their unnecessary suffering.
98000	102000	It's very straightforward to look behind what it is that they have to say.
102000	107000	They'll tell you the poor decisions they made in their lives and the opportunities that they didn't take
107000	113000	and the chances that they didn't have enough courage to grasp and the sacrifices they failed to make.
113000	115000	There's nothing mysterious about it.
115000	122000	And their own experiences teach them full well that they pathologized the relationship they have with the nature of reality.
122000	124000	Well, that's a terrible thing.
124000	126000	Well, and Cain is dreadfully unhappy.
126000	130000	He's unhappy because nothing he ever wants happens, and that's partly because he doesn't really want it,
130000	133000	because if he really wanted it, he'd make the right sacrifices.
133000	138000	The salt is rubbed into his wounds by the existence of his brother, for whom everything seems simple,
138000	140000	but of course really isn't.
140000	142000	Cain goes to complain to God.
142000	148000	And I had to read three or four different translations of these particular verses to figure out what this meant.
148000	150000	And he says,
150000	152000	What in the world is going on here?
152000	154000	I'm marking myself to the bone.
154000	156000	I'm sacrificing things left, right, and center.
156000	158000	Everything I touch turns to dirt.
158000	160000	Everything turns against me.
160000	163000	Like, what's up with the nature of reality?
163000	171000	Cain's essential vulnerability is revealed and exacerbated by his pathological attitude towards his own actions.
171000	173000	God says to him, essentially,
173000	179000	Sin is a predatory cat that croaches at your doorway and leaps on you at will.
179000	182000	But if you only wanted to, you could master it.
182000	187000	And that is absolutely the last thing that Cain wants to hear.
187000	192000	Because if things are going from bad to worse for you and you're playing a causal role in it,
192000	196000	there's nothing more horrible than something that someone can do to you,
196000	202000	but reveal to you in a way that you can't deny that you're entirely complicit in your own demise.
202000	205000	And that's exactly what God does to Cain.
205000	207000	And so what does Cain do?
207000	213000	Well, the logical thing would be listen, because if the structure of reality itself tells you something,
213000	216000	it's best to listen since there's no way out of it, but that's not what Cain does.
216000	220000	He's so incensed by his essential vulnerability,
220000	225000	compromised and exacerbated by his failure to make the appropriate sacrifices
225000	228000	and to conduct himself appropriately that he decides then and there.
228000	235000	Number one, to destroy his ideal, to reduce the tension that he feels when that ideal exists as a contrast point.
235000	238000	And number two, to destroy the favored son of God.
238000	241000	And so he goes out into the field and kills Abel.
241000	244000	And God comes along and says, where's my favorite son?
244000	247000	Cain says, I killed him.
247000	254000	And it's so interesting to me that that story is placed really, it's the third story in the Old Testament.
254000	256000	It's with the archaic stories.
256000	261000	And it's a story that reveals, as far as I can tell, that there are two essential patterns of reaction
261000	265000	to the self-conscious, vulnerable conditions of existence.
265000	273000	And one is a humble approach to infinity with determined attempts to make the appropriate sacrifices.
273000	277000	And the other is arrogance, resentment, the keeping of everything good for oneself
277000	282000	and the degeneration of the soul into something that's homicidally murderous.
282000	286000	Well, the story doesn't stop there and it gets really compressed in this part
286000	289000	and that's perhaps because some of it's been lost with the passages of time.
289000	294000	But the next thing that happens is that, well, God doesn't punish Cain.
294000	298000	And you think, that's kind of strange.
298000	301000	I mean, Old Testament God, he's punishing people left, right and center.
301000	302000	Not Cain.
302000	308000	And you think, well, he marks Cain and he says to the people who are around that they should leave him alone
308000	311000	because he's been marked by God as to be left alone.
311000	315000	And the reason for that, I think, and this is something that's reflected on our legal system,
315000	321000	is that murder promotes revenge and revenge destroys societies.
321000	325000	And so God puts an end to the situation right there and then by telling people that
325000	331000	despite the fact that Cain has committed a terrible crime,
331000	335000	that there will be no retribution.
335000	344000	Cain goes off and gets married and he has a number of generations of offspring.
344000	349000	If you insult a member of the first generation of Cain's offspring,
349000	352000	he doesn't kill you, he kills seven of you.
352000	356000	And if you insult a member of the second generation of Cain's offspring,
356000	360000	he doesn't kill seven of you, he kills seven times seven of you.
360000	367000	And then on down the road of the offspring of Cain is Tubal Cain.
367000	372000	And Tubal Cain is the artificer of weapons of war.
372000	379000	And this stunningly brilliant story says in its incredibly compressed fashion
379000	385000	that the motivation that drives the commission of the worst human atrocities
385000	391000	is an inevitable social consequence of the refusal of the self-conscious individual
391000	395000	to make the sacrifices appropriate to establishing a harmonious life
395000	401000	and their consequent degeneration into a kind of murderous and resentment filled rage,
401000	409000	propagating endlessly through its variations in society until everything comes to an end.
409000	415000	And the next story is the flood and it's not surprising
415000	421000	because if things go from bad to worse long enough, everything falls.
421000	424000	And it's a terrifying story and I didn't understand that story.
424000	426000	I didn't understand that story for years.
426000	430000	It wasn't really until I read Alexander Solzhenitsyn that I developed,
430000	434000	I think, the cognitive capacity to even understand what the story meant
434000	438000	because Solzhenitsyn said it is no bell prize accepting speech.
438000	441000	A single person who stops lying can bring down a tyranny,
441000	443000	which is a stunning thing to say,
443000	447000	but I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century
447000	450000	because we have historical examples of people who did precisely that.
450000	454000	Gandhi did it, Vaclav Havel did it, Nelson Mandela did it.
454000	458000	Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the axe blows
458000	460000	that brought down the Soviet Union,
460000	464000	a stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book
464000	468000	by memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim this far away from starvation.
468000	474000	It shows you as clearly as anything possibly can how powerful the human spirit can be
474000	478000	if it's willing to take on the obligation of its relationship with the divine
478000	483000	and also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered.
483000	485000	This is not shouldered.
