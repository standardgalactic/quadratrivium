0	10200	How on earth can I argue for a local science? I'm going to be laughed out of the room if
10200	12000	I argue for a local science.
12000	15800	But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?
15800	19520	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
19520	28240	It seems to me that what those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system
28240	34920	theorists would call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.
34920	42960	The next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different modes of constraint that
42960	47720	are all operating simultaneously.
47720	53640	This is Brain Inspired. Hey everyone, I'm Paul. Alicia Juarrero is a philosopher and
53640	59000	has been interested in complexity science for a long time. In her own words, since before
59000	62040	complexity was cool. I like that.
62040	67840	In this episode, we discuss many of the topics and ideas. In her new book, Context Changes
67840	71280	Everything, How Constraints Create Coherence.
71280	76640	The book makes the thorough case that constraints should be given way more attention when trying
76640	82280	to understand complex systems like brains and minds, how they're organized, how they
82280	89000	operate, how they're formed, how they're maintained, et cetera, et cetera.
89000	95760	So as you probably know, modern science, thanks in large part to the success of physics,
95760	102280	focuses on, or mostly on, a single kind of causation, the kind involved when one billiard
102280	105400	ball strikes another billiard ball.
105400	110240	But that kind of causation neglects what Alicia argues are the most important features of
110240	118680	complex systems, the constraints that shape the dynamics and possibility spaces of systems.
118680	122600	Much of Alicia's book describes the wide range of types of constraints that we should
122600	129040	be paying attention to, and how they interact and mutually influence each other.
129040	135000	I highly recommend the book, and you may want to read it before, during, and after our conversation.
135000	140800	It's partly because, if you're like me, the concepts that we discuss still aren't comfortable
140800	145600	to think about in terms of normal modes of explanation in science.
145600	150040	Thinking across levels of organization turns out to be hard.
150040	154840	You might also want the book handy because, hang on to your hats, we also jump around
154840	160560	a lot among many of the concepts that are in our book.
160560	167320	So context changes, everything comes almost 25 years, almost a quarter of a century, after
167320	173960	her previous classic, Dynamics in Action, which we also discuss, and which I also recommend,
173960	180280	especially if you want more of a primer to her new, more expansive work.
180280	185040	These ideas touch on all things complex, of course, from self-organizing systems, like
185120	192600	whirlpools, to ecologies, businesses, societies, and of course, minds and brains.
192600	195040	Find the show notes at braininspired.co.
195040	201200	I'm sure you could tell, I very much enjoyed this conversation.
201200	206000	We also have some guest questions from friends of the podcast, Kevin Mitchell, who's also
206000	212080	coming up on a near future episode about his new book, and Max Shine, from Down Under.
212080	213680	Thanks for listening, here's Alicia.
216040	221440	Context changes, everything is almost a quarter...
221440	223440	And human is Cuban hyperbole.
223440	225440	Oh, what does that mean?
225440	230720	Humans tend to exaggerate, I probably should have said, context changes, most things are
230720	233920	a lot of things, human hyperbole.
233920	238960	Well I was going to tie it to your previous work, Dynamics in Action, which is now almost
238960	241440	a quarter of a century old.
241440	247680	And so what you could say about that is that context changes action is a very coarse and
247680	251880	terrible summary of that classic now work.
251880	255560	And so I was thinking maybe context changes, everything is just kind of an expansion on
255560	256560	those ideas.
256560	257560	It really is.
257560	258560	It really is.
258560	263960	After I wrote that one, I thought, well, I've got nothing else to say, but you know, there's
263960	271280	been so many issues, and one of the things is people said to me, you know, there's nothing
271280	274400	that's context free, I'd use that term in that one.
274400	275400	Oh yeah.
275400	277040	Yeah, yeah, that's true.
277040	279040	So what do I call it?
279040	280840	Well, what about context, it depends.
280840	288240	So I'm thinking maybe I gave short shrift to that one, to that kind of constraint.
288240	297800	You know, things start, and of course AI and language models and so on, and for E, I think
297800	299360	came out of the process.
299360	302800	So there were a lot of things that I thought once the pandemic started, I thought, you
302800	307640	know what, just sit down and do it, you know, and just put it all together.
307640	312800	And Steve, you see if it comes together, and I was pleased it did.
312800	313800	Yeah, me too.
313800	318840	I mean, you mentioned the phrase context free, which you have changed now to context dependent
318840	319840	in the new book.
319840	320840	Independent.
320840	321840	Oh, that's the contact.
321840	322840	Right, context independent.
322840	326480	Yeah, see, that's what I was going to say is, you know, the book, I love the book.
326480	332520	It is challenging, and one that I will have to revisit over and over, because, well, no,
332520	333520	it's not bad.
333520	334680	So I'm already, that's not a bad thing.
334680	339320	I'm already a slow reader, and I'm a slow thinker, apparently, as well, at least to
339320	340320	give me depth.
340320	341320	I'm a writer is what I am.
341320	342320	I don't write very clearly.
342320	347320	I don't know why I'm good in the classroom, but I'm terrified.
347320	352200	I just, it looks still, I spent most of my time just editing.
352200	353200	Sure.
354200	359000	Well, that's what, so what I want to ask you is, what has changed in your views since
359000	360240	Dynamics in Action?
360240	364880	And, you know, besides just expanding, you know, you cover like so many different constraints
364880	366400	and topics in this book.
366400	370160	But what I wanted to comment on before that is, one of the reasons why I'm going to have
370160	376480	to go back to it over and over is because the terminology and is, you're like inventing
376480	377480	some of it.
377480	383640	But a lot of it is kind of still, for me, still fuzzy in terms of like what it actually,
383640	389400	like it's definition and how, like how I set the boundaries, you know, with these terms
389400	391640	and what they mean and how I can use them.
391640	396560	And so, you know, and we'll come back to this, but anyway, that's why I'm going to be revisiting
396560	397560	a lot.
397560	403520	So maybe let's start with, you know, what's changed in 25 years in your thinking?
403520	411600	I think what's changed is that when I wrote Dynamics in Action, I basically meant it as
411600	416840	a brief against analytic action theory.
416840	417840	Okay.
417840	420120	Can you summarize analytic action theory?
420120	427200	Well, the idea that either that intentional behavior, intentional action, you know, the
427200	432160	book starts with what's the difference between a wink and a blink, difference being that
432160	444920	you should be able to explain away anything that philosophy of mind considers intentionality
444920	446400	or intention.
446400	454720	So teleology was reduced away.
454720	461720	The idea of contentful intentions were reduced away.
461720	468600	And so my thought was, because I had published a number of standalone papers about what's
468600	475640	wrong with behaviorist reductions of intention, what's wrong with identity theory attempts
475640	484600	to reduce intentions is on, that complex dynamical systems theory was a very good way of entering
484600	489320	this whole field that would solve a lot of the problems or wouldn't get you into the
489320	493800	problems that all these other attempts did.
493800	503400	But in the last 20-some years, I keep thinking, you know, most stuff in reality is irreversible.
503400	505200	Most stuff is context.
505200	511120	So it applies not just to action, but it applies a lot more broadly.
511120	517760	And so I think I stick my neck out a bit more with respect to general ontology or general
517760	525040	cosmology by using the same notion of constraint more broadly than just for action.
525040	526040	Yeah.
526040	529360	Well, I had to revisit dynamics in action.
529360	533800	As you know, and as you write about in your newer book, Context Changes Everything, neuroscience
533800	536560	has embraced the dynamical systems perspective.
536560	540600	And you talk about some of the studies that, you know, some of the people who have been
540600	543040	in those studies have been on this podcast.
543040	546400	On this podcast, we talk a lot about the dynamical systems view.
546400	550280	And then going back to dynamics in action, it's like, oh, my God, it's all there already.
550280	551280	I mean...
551280	552280	Thank you.
552280	559520	It's fascinating to me that somebody like Mark Churchland, whom I use in one of the chapters,
559520	567920	is the son of Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were the foremost advocates of the liminative...
567920	568920	Right.
568920	569920	Oh, I didn't even think of that.
569920	570920	Everything is as a mind.
570920	578880	I'm thinking, oh, my goodness, this is the revenge par excellence of dynamical systems
578880	579880	theory.
579880	587000	Because I once met Paul Churchland here in DC, Dick Schlagel at GW, and invited him
587000	588000	to speak.
588000	593040	And I asked him back then, this must have been, this must have been just about when Context
593040	594040	Changes...
594040	595040	I went and dynamics came up.
595040	596040	It was years ago.
596040	597040	And I...
597040	601720	Haven't you ever considered cut dynamical systems theory?
601720	607560	That has nothing to say about neurology or the reality of the case.
607560	612080	Paul Churchland said that in person, and I've never forgotten, I'm thinking, no.
612080	617920	And the reason I was almost sure that was so is because, but way back when, I was talking
617920	623760	a lot to people in operations, research and network theory and that kind of thing.
623760	628080	And they're like, you know what, there's got to be a network property in the brain that
628080	635120	has emergent properties that somehow loops back down and is able to influence behaviors
635120	638840	such that these emergent properties get realized in behavior.
638840	642400	That's the difference between an action proper and behavior.
642400	643960	There's got to be some of that.
643960	651440	But no, I think that just traditional notions of causality, traditional notions of ontology,
651440	655760	that only the tiny little fundamental components are real.
655760	658120	So it was all, let's look for the neuron.
658120	659120	Right.
659120	660120	It does this.
660120	661120	Yeah.
661120	668440	So I find it really, really very rewarding that dynamical systems theory has been vindicated
668440	669440	in a sense.
669440	670440	Yeah.
670440	675160	I wonder what the elder Churchlands, their daughter is also in neuroscience, by the way.
675160	677320	I wonder what they think of the dynam...
677320	683480	I wonder if they've come around at all because the tagline sort of of eliminateitivism is
683480	689000	that folk psychology, the words that we use in folk psychology aren't real things, right?
689000	692960	And then there's a reductionist way to understand things and that's the best way.
692960	699800	But the dynamical systems viewpoint kind of, it's kind of in between that, right?
699800	703000	Because it allows for a top-down thing, but it doesn't necessarily say anything about the
703000	705000	terms and concepts we use.
705000	711880	Well, that's why I think I stick my neck out in this one where it seems to me that what
711880	720800	those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system theorists would
720800	725040	call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.
725040	732320	And so they are capturing an emergent property that is powerful and that's where the whole
732400	739600	problem of causality kept bugging me because, thinking, Carl Gillette's book on reduction
739600	745800	and emergence where he says, you know, nowadays the physicists, like Brian Rocklin, for example,
745800	752800	have espoused the truth or the reality of emergent properties.
752800	759600	But they still don't want to allow that those emergent properties are causally influential
759600	760600	on their components.
760680	764040	In other words, they cannot change behavior.
764040	770320	They cannot change in a sense neural architecture in virtue of their emergent
770320	775480	properties. Whereas that's what I think complex dynamical systems let's you do.
777200	780640	Maybe we could suggest that way into causality around a lot.
780760	781760	No, that's great.
783560	784480	You'll have to. I do it too.
784480	786400	So we're going to be in a real swamp here pretty soon.
787400	792880	But, you know, so one of the things in dynamics and action also is, you know, you've
792880	798760	railed against this modern notion of efficient causation as the only valid kind of causation.
798760	802480	And since you're just talking about causality, maybe we should talk about that.
802640	806680	And then I want to come back to also what you have changed your mind about perhaps since then.
806680	813040	But so, you know, famously, there are these four different types of causations from Aristotle's
813040	819320	days, from Aristotle, and an efficient causation, the billiard ball that thing X hits things
819320	823600	Y and then that moves things thing Y. That's the only valid kind of causation.
823800	829720	And a lot of your labor is trying to bring back notions of the other of formal
829720	832320	causality and causality via constraint.
833360	837920	And so do you think that and from my limited perspective, because I'm reading works like
837920	843880	yours and like a lot of similar kinds of works that are trying to bring make teleology not
843880	850360	such a bad word and bring like these constraints to bear, because of that, I feel like the old
850360	854280	story, the modern story of efficient causation is the only causation.
854440	855560	I feel like that's dissipating.
855560	857240	Do you believe that also?
857880	867520	I think it's still very present in physics, especially with regards to the kind of causality
867520	874240	that we would call top down causality, that in fact, emergent properties really are not
874240	882720	causally powerful, that all the heavy lifting, as Van Orten would say, it all happens bottom
882720	887880	up. And so it's really to be explained through efficient energetic transfer.
888280	897760	But I think that's because the idea of causality as efficient boxes you into the the
899120	904600	boxes you into the impossibility of top down causation, because if there were top down
904600	910960	causation with that kind of causality, you'd have over determination, you'd have a violation
910960	913480	of the closure of the physical and you'd have all these problems.
913480	915240	And so therefore no way that can't happen.
915560	920480	Well, but if you think of what I found fascinating, that's one of the reasons why I
920480	928040	adopted the notion of constraint was every time natural scientists, hard scientists got into
928040	934040	trouble thinking in terms of efficient causality, then immediately the term starts being used as,
934400	939680	well, it's factors or conditions or constraints that are causal.
939680	947960	Well, okay, so I'll grant you efficient causality as the term for cause.
949000	952000	So let's call it influence by constraint.
952440	957600	And that's what I was trying to do, because I certainly don't want to go to an
957600	960080	environmental notion of formal cause.
960080	965960	I don't want to go to, you know, Deus Ex Machina, or, or your, you know, Paley's
965960	971640	teleology, or even Aristotle's teleology, which was all built in, set up from the beginning.
971880	978800	That's the way that that's why that's why Darwin, Darwin bought into this.
978800	983160	And so Darwin thought he was very concerned about the notion of evolution.
983160	988960	He said you have new species appearing that that would mean that it wasn't all built in
988960	989640	from the start.
989640	994960	And therefore this developmental process was only an unfurling of preexisting
995520	996320	potential.
996680	1001880	And what I want to say is that constraints really create new potential, because I think
1001880	1003760	that's what you get from prigazine.
1003760	1008320	I think that's what prigazine gets the, he was the good pregoser now that we think
1008320	1009000	about it.
1009000	1013080	He was the one who he got the Nobel Prize for dissipated structures, I think for that
1013080	1013760	very reason.
1015000	1022280	But you mentioned physics, and maybe it's just in biology that the notion of circular
1022320	1027120	causality and causality via constraint is more comfortable among biologists.
1027200	1031640	I think the biologists, biology was the last holdout.
1031880	1038040	They refused to get shoehorned into the model of efficient mechanical causality.
1038360	1045640	And as I was reading your email and reading one of the latest issues of Science Magazine
1045640	1053280	on Australia, you know, they're talking about the dispersal of distribution of black
1053280	1054640	beans throughout Australia.
1054920	1062840	And the assumption was, well, this precedes the Westerners who arrived in Australia.
1063240	1073120	But now they're revisiting the idea that some of the salt lines of the native Australians
1073360	1078520	have accounts of these plants and the dispersion.
1078760	1090880	So the Science Magazine article talks about combining not only the genetic flow of the
1090880	1099960	genes of the black bean plant, but also biogeography and these ethnographic accounts.
1100200	1107880	So I think that you see it now more in ecology, in addition to just straight biology.
1107880	1108600	But you see it.
1108960	1117320	And of course, the social scientists have always used other causal factors as their
1117320	1122160	reasons. But of course, that's what led the heart scientists to say, well, that proves
1122160	1123240	they're not sciences.
1123640	1129800	The social scientists, because they need to, because they need to appeal to you
1129800	1134560	unique causes to things that don't scale as a universal law.
1135240	1142440	And because they use top down factors that are not efficient causes, that shows for
1142440	1143960	sure they're not science.
1145160	1148840	Before maybe this can just be a jumping off point to any of these can be jumping off
1148840	1150440	points because we can go any direction.
1150760	1156320	But have you changed your mind about anything in particular with regard to the story of
1156320	1158880	context and constraints over the last quarter century?
1159560	1165320	No, I've just sort of expect, I think I focus more on context independent constraints,
1165840	1168120	because what I think that does.
1168320	1173960	And hang on, I'll just say context independence means it's an external constraint that
1173960	1178760	drives a system far from equilibrium, like a gradient or gravity, etc.
1178760	1179760	It pulls on the system.
1180280	1181760	Gradient, particularly.
1182000	1186400	And when you start looking at the different kinds of gradients, either the spatial
1186440	1191040	temporal gradients of gravity, you know, the gravitational.
1192280	1194040	I like that you just illustrated gravity right there.
1194440	1204320	That means that that space, time is not homogenous and uniform.
1204320	1207560	There are inhomogeneities in space and time.
1208720	1214040	Polarities, we know the importance of polarities all over the place.
1214040	1220160	We have polarities in electric and magnetic, but also in developmental anterior
1220160	1225040	posterior, right and left in the development of an embryo.
1226000	1227480	There are we have.
1228840	1235760	I think in social systems, we certainly have levels of organization that would
1235760	1241240	give you different different points of equilibrium at different stages.
1241520	1249880	So I think the importance of that, the importance of boundary conditions, I think,
1249960	1253320	as a setting for a context.
1253720	1260920	So basically, I think of the of context independent constraints as those that
1260920	1265320	determine, in a sense, the bounds of possibility space.
1265320	1273840	They kind of determine the basic fundamental characteristics of possibility space.
1274800	1278240	But you need both context independent and context dependent.
1278240	1282520	And I'll just briefly define context, context dependent constraints are those
1282520	1286400	that which bring things back essentially away from context independence, which means
1286640	1287920	more toward equilibrium.
1287920	1290040	And when you get these mixing and match, maybe not.
1290600	1293480	I know, I know, I just caught myself saying more toward equilibrium.
1293800	1297520	But away from independence, we'll say maybe that's correct.
1297680	1298200	Yeah.
1298200	1302160	But when you get these interacting is when when you can have the ability to develop
1302160	1303320	complex systems.
1303360	1307560	I think the reason I had given context free context independent constraints short
1307560	1312080	shrift back when is because I don't think context independent constraints.
1313400	1317240	Complexify, they don't they don't enable complexity.
1317720	1321080	All you get in principle would be a clump.
1322280	1322640	Yeah.
1322640	1323120	Correct.
1323160	1324520	They wouldn't match the poles.
1324560	1324840	Yeah.
1325360	1329960	And clumps and masses and agglomerations have no emergent properties.
1330240	1335400	So context independent constraints don't don't create complexity.
1336240	1343280	Once you have a a a space of possibilities with a certain in
1343280	1349640	homogeneity in it, then I think complex dependent constraints can kick in.
1350000	1353800	My question is, well, why do they show up?
1353840	1357320	Why do context independent constraints appear?
1357680	1365760	And I'm wondering whether, again, the boundary conditions, if if if the clumps
1365760	1376360	are dense enough and they can't move much, then do accidental linkages?
1377360	1381280	The indeterminism, are you hinting at indeterminism in the universe?
1381920	1390000	Even the bumps and jostlings of regular Brownian motion, that if if there, I always
1390000	1394240	try to ground what I say in in heart sciences.
1394480	1399160	And I always end up going back to things like the Bernard cells and the BZ reaction.
1399400	1404000	Otherwise, I'm very worried that philosophers will be accused of flights of
1404160	1408800	fancy that are not grounded in anything scientific.
1408800	1413360	And so I keep thinking, all right, so you've got Bernard cells and a pan of
1413360	1420720	water heated uniformity from below and at a certain threshold of non-equilibrium,
1420720	1424840	in other words, at a certain gradient, correct?
1425120	1425480	Yep.
1425560	1429360	The status quo cannot be maintained.
1429360	1432520	In other words, conduction cannot be maintained.
1432520	1443600	And so the system flips to linking individual water molecules into local perturbation.
1444920	1450280	But if that gets amplified by the conditions, then it becomes a self
1450280	1452000	reinforcing feedback loop.
1452200	1457160	And that's, I think, where you see the context dependent constraint kicking in.
1457440	1465320	That then the linkages create standalone units.
1466840	1469800	Almost like when you're playing hangman.
1470920	1475600	You know, we know that instinctively, because if we have towards the end of a
1475600	1482080	word that we don't know what that is, a T and then an I, well, there are two more to go.
1482080	1486880	Well, it's either going to be NG or ON, because these form like standalone
1487400	1494120	units, because they, the context dependence concatenates and becomes a standalone unit.
1494120	1499280	And now you've got in language, you'd have a phony, right?
1499280	1503000	But in, that's what a laser is.
1503000	1509640	A laser is context dependent constraints of a whole bunch of photon streams getting
1510160	1516800	linked together in a way that they become a standalone entity with emergent properties.
1517920	1518200	Yeah.
1518200	1521520	So you're talking about, and you just mentioned why you use these examples,
1521520	1526320	because they're less dangerous, I suppose, because they're in some
1526320	1530880	sense simpler, more, I'm going to say low dimensional, because they're like from physics.
1530880	1531880	So it feels more comfortable.
1531920	1536400	Maybe that's a way to say it, but you do venture into these more, you know,
1536400	1538880	like biological systems in the book.
1539480	1544040	And one of the questions I had for you is, so I'm glad that you're sometimes
1544080	1546920	pausing just a little bit before you say causality or something.
1546920	1548000	Yeah, I always do.
1548000	1548520	Yeah.
1548520	1553400	Because that's where immediately a physicist will say, no, that's not causality.
1553760	1554800	Yeah, right, right.
1554800	1557000	Well, then like, and then I don't know what's going on in your head if you're
1557000	1561200	searching for a different term, because, or, you know, alternative types of terms,
1561440	1563880	because, you know, reading your book, and one of the reasons why I need to
1563880	1565280	revisit it multiple times.
1565280	1568880	And I look forward to it is just because things feel so new to me and the
1568880	1576760	terminology so new that I don't feel like they don't feel comfortable, right?
1576760	1579960	So I'm trying to think like, how do I apply this term?
1579960	1583360	And how does this concept interact with this kind of constraint?
1583360	1585200	And they're interlocking in dependencies.
1585200	1587080	And how do I think about applied to the brain?
1587200	1591960	And so what I'm wondering is, are these going to feel, you're the expert.
1592040	1594440	How do these feel super comfortable to you?
1594440	1598200	Just switching and thinking about these things, interacting and the different modalities?
1598200	1602400	I wish I had made, I had coined the term enabling constraints.
1602400	1607280	It goes back to Patty, Howard Patty, and a whole bunch of these biologists who
1607280	1612760	talked several of whose books have the same similar title hierarchy theory.
1613360	1621680	And it's because the enabling constraint is able to create a self-organization that
1621680	1626600	can then also embed in the next higher up level of constraints.
1627000	1632760	So I particularly want to use the notion of enabling constraints as constraints that
1632760	1638360	enable the formation of a more complex dynamic.
1639160	1642320	And that is, and how does that relate to a limiting constraint?
1642320	1643640	Contrast that with a limiting?
1643640	1650120	That would be the, I think we tend to use the term constraint, especially in physics
1650120	1656840	and in mechanical engineering, especially as limiting, as closing off options.
1656840	1664920	But the biologists tend to use them very often as factors, conditions, feedback
1664920	1666560	loops, catalysts.
1667440	1672560	See, the nice thing about the notion of a catalyst, two things, a lot of things.
1672920	1675800	One is it spans chemistry and biology.
1676760	1684080	And even in so-and-so as a catalyst of change, and we say that of people.
1684440	1692760	So it's used in that sense, but also because a catalyst is conserved.
1692760	1695840	It does not use up any energy of its own.
1696280	1701600	And so what I like about that notion is that it's a causal factor.
1701600	1704200	It's a causal, it's an influencer.
1704440	1709640	That is not in the efficient causality mode.
1710240	1713160	So are feedback loops.
1714080	1720880	And the thing about a feedback loop, which I love, is that for eons, since I was on
1720880	1727320	that never change, the idea of something creating itself or feeding back on itself
1727320	1730320	to change itself was forbidden, was verboten.
1731320	1736920	Because, again, from Aristotle's notion, then it would have to be before and after itself.
1737480	1739400	It would have to be before itself is caused.
1739400	1741360	It would have to be after itself is caused.
1741920	1743080	Oh, no, you can't have that.
1743560	1753840	The notion of simultaneous causality does not allow for parts interacting to produce
1753960	1762320	holes that have emergent properties, which then simultaneously loop back down and
1762320	1767480	constrain the parts of which the hole is made up.
1768840	1775000	And so that's why I love the notion of feedback loops and catalysts in particular.
1775880	1783520	But then I think once that hole coalesces, then you've got stabilizing
1783520	1789040	constraints, because it has to hold together for a persistent length of time.
1789040	1793800	Because unlike neuroequilibrium thermodynamics, the thing doesn't fall apart.
1793840	1798760	The thing about these Ben-Arts cells is that while the conditions hold, it holds
1798760	1802840	together despite changes at the component level.
1803040	1804080	Perturbations, yeah.
1804080	1810200	So fluctuations, internal fluctuations and perturbations, it has a metastability, which
1810240	1814400	I also like, which is different from thermal equilibrium of classical
1814680	1816360	neuroequilibrium thermodynamics.
1816880	1823920	While the thing holds, it has a stabilizing power to stabilize the
1823920	1826320	constraint regime as a whole.
1826440	1827280	And what is it?
1827360	1828960	You say it has a stabilizing power.
1828960	1829720	That's the whole.
1829720	1834400	What is the dynamic constraint regime that constitutes a Ben-Arts cell?
1834680	1839720	A Ben-Arts cell is not a thing other than the water molecules that make it up.
1839960	1846880	Or the constraints that go into establishing the conditions that make it up.
1846880	1849640	The boundary conditions as context-independent constraints.
1849880	1854320	And then the linkages of the molecules.
1855440	1855760	Yeah.
1856000	1856520	Right?
1856680	1857040	Yeah.
1857600	1862240	Yeah, it's just so hard to think of across scales, these myriological.
1862320	1866480	Yes, it's extremely difficult to think across scale, because we tend to think
1866480	1868920	in terms of efficient cause across scale.
1869120	1869440	Yeah.
1869480	1874400	And all of these biologists was, I always wondered for a long time, why did these
1874400	1879800	biologists like Stan Salti, Howard Patti, a lot of them started talking about
1879800	1884480	semiotics and semiosm, why did they ever get into this?
1885040	1891160	And it finally dawned on me because the relationship between levels of
1891160	1893880	organization and Herbert Simon knew this.
1895240	1897040	The near decomposability.
1897640	1902840	Relations of constraint, they're not relations of energetic exchange, right?
1902960	1910960	So the higher level is a form of constraint on the possibility space of
1910960	1911840	the lower level.
1912280	1916560	So it doesn't let it veer off and disintegrate.
1916800	1918560	It's interesting the word integrity.
1919480	1923000	It's beautifully here because it just holds it together.
1923320	1923640	Yeah.
1923800	1928760	So when I think of top-down constraints, those are limiting because they hold
1928760	1934200	that possibility space within a dynamic range.
1935320	1938520	And so the thing holds, an organism holds together.
1939040	1946120	Our metabolism might change, a spleen might be removed, a goldbladder might be
1946120	1949000	removed with a constraint regime holds.
1949960	1954760	Can you name something that is not an emergent property of something else?
1956440	1957240	Oh, culture.
1958120	1959480	Culture is not an emergent property?
1959480	1960520	Culture is an emergent property.
1960520	1960840	Do you want me to-
1960840	1962680	No, can you name something that's not an emergency?
1962680	1968200	Oh, quantity is emergent, but it's not an interesting emergence.
1968760	1969160	Okay.
1969160	1970040	So that's fine.
1970040	1971160	No, thank you.
1971160	1972280	That's a good point.
1972280	1978440	When I think of emergent properties, the emergent properties that I'm interested
1978600	1988120	in are qualitatively different properties that affect the behavior of the component
1988120	1993320	level so that that qualitative property continues in effect.
1994200	2001080	That's why homeostasis, I think of as an emergent property that has interesting
2001320	2008040	features, because it controls the goings-on at the lower level such that homeostasis
2008760	2011080	homostatic balance holds.
2011640	2019640	Whereas a whole bunch of pile of debris in my backyard.
2020680	2022520	It's still emergent with respect to-
2022520	2023240	Balance.
2023240	2024040	Balance.
2024040	2024440	Is what?
2025080	2025960	Science.
2025960	2026520	It's bigger.
2026520	2030520	Well, it's bigger, but if you throw a bowling ball into it, it would be harder to move
2030520	2033160	than if you just had one piece of debris out there, right?
2033160	2038280	Well, that's true, but it does not change the characteristics of any of the-
2038280	2039000	There's no top-down.
2039000	2039480	There's no-
2039480	2039800	All right.
2039800	2040680	There's no top-down.
2040680	2046840	See, that's what's been driving my thinking for 20-some years, right?
2046840	2053800	And that is, how can you explain top-down causality without falling victim or making the mistakes of
2053800	2056920	and all that other stuff?
2056920	2060760	And that's what I think complex dynamical systems gives me.
2060760	2068040	And I think the rise of ecology in the last 25 years has helped enormously,
2068040	2072440	because we used to think, oh, well, we can kill off the plank, then that's not a big deal.
2072440	2072840	Right.
2072840	2073640	Yeah, yeah.
2073640	2074360	Correct?
2074360	2081000	And the thing is the understanding that it may mess up the constraint regime that holds the whole
2081000	2096520	thing together is the idea that there are systemic properties that really affect the components.
2097640	2104920	I think that's gone a long way to making us aware of top-down,
2104920	2107480	in a respectable scientific way.
2108200	2113160	On the other hand, one of the features of complex self-organizing systems is their robustness.
2113160	2116280	So if you did kill off all the mosquitoes, we might be okay.
2117480	2124760	I suspect, though, I think robustness means that they degrade gracefully.
2125640	2126200	I like that.
2126920	2136440	That it doesn't fall apart the way if you break the axle on a bicycle that will try to go whatever.
2136440	2138040	That will just, the thing won't work at all.
2140040	2144120	It seems as though complex dynamical systems, far from equilibrium,
2145400	2151240	they get a bit out of kilter, but they continue to work for a fair amount of time until then it
2151240	2156520	reaches its level of instability that that constraint regime cannot hold.
2156520	2157720	New phase change coming up.
2157720	2160680	And you get an entirely new phase change that falls apart.
2161320	2165720	So I suspect that if we killed off all the mosquitoes,
2166360	2171080	we do not know what might enter that, that open niche now.
2172040	2175560	Right. Yeah. Well, there's been all sorts of disasters with introducing
2175560	2179080	a non-native species to kill off one thing.
2179080	2180440	It turns out they're invasive.
2181080	2186440	Exactly. I suspect we've got to be careful because of that kind of problem.
2186440	2191640	Before the thing falls apart, you might have some really nasty surprises that you didn't expect.
2192680	2196120	Hey, you mentioned homeostasis and again, we're going to jump around.
2196120	2202360	But I had Henry Yin on and I've had a few other people on who talk about the brain
2202920	2207880	more as a control system than necessarily a complex system that we need to think about
2207880	2211800	things more in sort of the old cybernetics way of a control system.
2211800	2216200	However, the set point of our thermometer is not set externally.
2216200	2217960	We're setting our own set point, right?
2217960	2221000	So homeostasis is in certain bounds.
2221000	2222600	Well, that's what I was going to ask you about.
2223960	2230680	How do you think, rather, about when we're setting our internal desired temperature,
2230680	2233000	let's say, that we need to be around 98.6?
2233800	2234680	How do you think about that?
2234680	2236040	Where does that set point come from?
2236040	2238920	Bottom up, top down, or is it just the-
2239000	2242200	I think everything, not only comes up, bottom up, top down, but
2243000	2243880	pass forward.
2243880	2244440	I think-
2244440	2245560	Pass forward, environment and-
2246760	2249240	We forget temporal constraints as well.
2250760	2258440	For example, folks up in the Himalayas and in the Andes have a whole different
2260920	2263080	oxygen hemoglobin.
2263640	2264360	Capacity.
2264520	2271880	Capacity and characteristic because of centuries of adaptability, millennia of adaptability.
2271880	2277080	So we forget temporal constraints as well, right?
2277960	2284440	It seems as though the same temperature in the fall feels colder than it does in the spring,
2284440	2288280	because by the time we get to the spring, we've had a whole winter.
2288280	2292120	So I think it's multi-dimensional, multi-scalar,
2294840	2298840	temporally, I think we forget time.
2300600	2304920	And all of these complex dynamical systems, I remember a phrase of Prigogenes,
2304920	2309720	I was fortunate enough to meet him a couple of times, and I've never seen this
2310600	2314040	written down, but he used to use that phrase more than once in person.
2314040	2316440	They carry their history on their back.
2316440	2317240	Oh, I like that.
2317400	2318920	I love that phrase.
2318920	2328040	In other words, their very dynamical architecture and characteristics embody,
2328040	2333640	and that's where the 4E is coming, embody the conditions under which they were created,
2333640	2335320	evolved and so on.
2335320	2337240	His examples were snowflakes.
2337240	2342840	They might have all started with the same, but over the time that they fell to earth,
2343560	2350440	they, their actual architecture changes to embody the temperature, the pressure,
2350440	2359480	the, all the atmospheric conditions through which they modified themselves and adapted
2359480	2361880	and until they reached the ground.
2361880	2369000	So I think that's true for us as well, for body temperature, for body states.
2369560	2376120	I'm, I'm fascinated by that whole notion of inflammation, all the, all these set points
2377160	2386360	that I think, in a sense, those mark the parameters of what you might call the constraint dome.
2387160	2388760	You know, we've got the proteome.
2388760	2390040	Oh, there it is.
2390040	2391720	There's the word, the constraint dome.
2392120	2398040	I just, I just, I was reading proteome and epigenome and stuff.
2398040	2400040	Well, you know, we need a constraint dome.
2400040	2400680	We do.
2400680	2401800	Well, that's all in your book.
2401800	2402760	The constraint dome is it.
2402760	2406840	Yeah, but I don't, I've never occurred to me to use that phrase, which I like,
2406840	2412360	because it's a whole bunch of them together at once.
2413320	2413800	Right.
2413800	2414280	Right.
2414280	2420360	That's the problem and sort of just mentally trying to imagine these things.
2420360	2423960	But real quick, you know, you mentioned temporal constraints, but in a sense,
2425240	2430920	this is a question, all or most constraints are temporal in nature because a constraint is,
2430920	2433560	by definition, slower than the process that it's constrained.
2433560	2440200	Like a catalyst, right, is more stable than the reaction that it's catalyzing and that's,
2440200	2441960	so it can act as a constraint.
2441960	2442760	Correct.
2442760	2450440	But then the cells which enable the tissues, the cell dynamics, which enable the tissues,
2450440	2458520	that's faster than the, than the, so, so you have a whole bunch of, so therefore,
2458520	2462920	what's important are the interfaces between the levels of organization.
2462920	2467480	And what are the, what are the constraints that govern those interfaces?
2467560	2478040	And we would call them what, codes, rules, laws, but local, but local, very, oftentimes very local,
2478840	2479400	right?
2479400	2479800	Right.
2479800	2485480	Well, that's so, okay, there's this, a lot of the physical laws, like, like, you know,
2485480	2487320	the notion of a force, right?
2487320	2491000	For some reason, well, when you think about it, it's, it doesn't make any sense.
2491000	2494280	But for some reason, when you grow up with it in physics classes and you think, oh,
2494280	2498440	force, I know what a force is, but when you really think about it, it becomes very unnatural,
2498440	2500520	like saying the same word over and over and you lose its meaning.
2501480	2508200	Are these ideas going to seem as natural to me, eventually, as the concept of a force,
2508200	2510360	which is, it turns out, a slippery idea also?
2511720	2519800	I would hope so, but that's what I'm always worried about, about neologisms and, and I
2519800	2524120	worried about using the word constraint, but it seemed as though it was...
2524120	2525160	What else would you call it?
2525160	2530840	Better than a cause, because as if I, if I use the word cause, then the assumption that
2530840	2535480	that has to be energetic transfer, that's almost a, that's a losing battle.
2535480	2536440	That's why.
2536440	2543960	So I don't know what else to cause, call it, but to think in terms of enabling constraints is bottom
2543960	2551800	up that, that within certain boundary, within certain context independent frameworks, they
2551800	2562680	can generate emergent properties, which in turn operate as second order top down context
2562680	2563880	dependent constraints, if you will.
2564440	2566360	It's easier to just call a constraint regime.
2567160	2567560	Yeah.
2567560	2568600	Okay, regime to the word.
2568840	2576760	Hold the, the components together so that they continue to satisfy the emergent properties
2576760	2577240	of the whole.
2578920	2586040	Do you feel like we'll, we will be able to write a constraint cookbook to generate dynamical
2586040	2588840	complex systems that we want to generate eventually?
2589560	2598200	If we think of it as formal systems, the way we used to where you would have a universal law,
2599000	2600680	yeah, Newton's laws of motion.
2601480	2605160	And I think my answer is no, because if I'm emphasizing context dependence,
2607080	2616760	those laws would be what car popper would call, well, yeah, those applies to, to a normal science.
2617880	2625400	But evolution to a whole new constraint structure, to a whole new constraint regime,
2625400	2630360	such as the transition, I would say, from physics to chemistry, chemistry to biology,
2630360	2635480	biology to psychology first, or sociology first, or whatever you want to call it,
2635480	2641160	and on and on and on, that requires a whole new constraint regime.
2641160	2648200	It's a, it's a, it's a topological nightmare, nightmare and transition.
2648200	2649160	You know what's interesting?
2649720	2652920	Prigazine detested catastrophe theory.
2652920	2654440	And I never understood why.
2655000	2661080	This idea that Peter Allen, who worked with him for, with Prigazine for a long time,
2661080	2662280	you know Peter Allen's work?
2662280	2664200	Peter Allen, really nice work.
2664200	2668040	He's retired now from Cranfield in England.
2668680	2673800	But he did a lot of work with Prigazine in Brussels at the Free University.
2674760	2685080	And the idea that the transition from independent photon streams to a laser,
2685080	2690280	the transition from a independent water molecules to a benign cell,
2690280	2696520	the transition from a whole bunch of chemical transformations to a living organism,
2697320	2705960	is a, is akin to a, to a bifurcation, to a topological bifurcation,
2705960	2711800	that you have entirely new coordinates that apply at this new level.
2712440	2714920	That to me gives
2718200	2720360	reality to emergent properties.
2720360	2721640	Oh, ontologically real?
2721640	2724600	Oh, I, I wanted to say ontologically real.
2724600	2725400	Okay, that's dangerous.
2725400	2727960	I don't have to worry about, about tenure.
2727960	2732520	So I don't have to worry about, about retreating to epistemology
2732520	2733560	where the going gets stuff.
2733560	2735720	So well, you know, that's our models.
2735720	2740440	And that's the way we make sense of information overload.
2740440	2742040	And so, no, damn it.
2742040	2746600	I want to say they are, they are ontologically real.
2746600	2750360	That, that the constraint regime that holds a benign cell together
2750360	2754600	or a culture together or a laser together.
2755400	2756280	Are real.
2756280	2758040	They are not stuff.
2758040	2759160	They are not things.
2759160	2761080	I certainly don't want to reify them.
2761800	2769240	But I don't see why we don't allow the dynamical interdependencies,
2769240	2772600	which is all these constraint regimes are, right?
2772600	2776280	They are, they are interlocking interdependencies.
2777160	2779480	I thought, I thought reify meant make real.
2780280	2783000	Oh, well, yeah, sure.
2783000	2787080	Part of it, but, but then only stuff, stuff is real.
2787080	2787960	Oh, okay.
2787960	2788440	Okay.
2788440	2791480	So therefore process is our real process.
2791480	2795800	That's why Whitehead rails against the reification
2795800	2799880	because he emphasized that processes are real.
2800680	2804600	And I want to say, and the constraints that keep processes
2804600	2810520	within a certain space, face space are also real.
2810520	2813400	They are as real as the face space they are kept into.
2813400	2817080	Which one do you give, do you give more credence to processes
2817080	2819560	or are you a process philosopher, so to speak?
2819560	2820360	Good question.
2820920	2825160	You know, dynamical systems theory seems to place
2825160	2831240	and if nothing else equal to the links as the nodes.
2831880	2832200	Yeah.
2832200	2834920	The question of whether the nodes or condensates,
2835720	2840280	Mark Bergauer uses that term, the condensates of links
2841240	2844120	of a lot of stable linkages.
2844120	2845240	Oh, that's cool.
2845240	2851480	And the nodes as stable condensates, no, as nodes are condensates
2851480	2856440	of stable links or those that happen very often and so on.
2857080	2862120	So it's hard to say, in this new book, I stick my neck out
2862120	2865480	because I did not realize that there's still a question
2865480	2869080	about exactly what covalent bonds are.
2869080	2870200	Oh, yeah.
2870520	2873720	I think when you dig into any established thing,
2873720	2875400	there's, we realize, yeah.
2875400	2875880	There you go.
2875880	2878760	And the interconversion of matter and energy certainly says,
2878760	2885720	well, you know, so is a material thing simply the condensate
2885720	2892120	of a bunch of constrained energy forces, links and constraints,
2893160	2898440	or are the forces and the links, the manifestation
2898520	2903800	or the behavior of the, then if relativity theory is correct,
2903800	2905560	which I'm assuming, then it doesn't matter.
2905560	2906920	They're interconvertebral, right?
2908840	2910360	But again, they're very local.
2911480	2919640	See, I want to, I was thinking, how on earth can I argue for a local science?
2920200	2923640	I'm going to be laughed out of the room if I argue for a local science.
2923640	2927480	But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?
2927480	2928600	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2929320	2934360	I have a sweet spot in my heart for Bill Wimsat, even though I've never met him,
2935000	2941400	because I learned that he, I don't know who told me or how I'd learned about it.
2941400	2945480	He was on the committee that approved my first paper.
2945480	2946440	Oh, oh.
2946440	2948760	His action theory rests on a mistake.
2948760	2955160	And so I think that I published that first paper so many years ago.
2955160	2955720	Wow, that's awesome.
2955720	2961240	I think Wimsat is fact, you know, and that brings in the notion of explanation, how
2961960	2968280	he's been arguing that sometimes explanations look upwards, not just downwards.
2968920	2969240	Why?
2969240	2975720	Because if you do believe that there are emergent properties and they are causally constrained.
2977240	2979240	With the eye roll, folks, who are only messing with me.
2979240	2980280	Exactly.
2980280	2988680	Then you have to be able to make reference in any complete explanation to its influence
2989400	2994680	as well as to the influence of the bottom up components, which is the way we tend to,
2994680	2996040	we always look downwards.
2996600	2996840	Yeah.
2998360	3003960	And let me tell you, I think the reason folks like David Chalmers and Company,
3003960	3010600	all this business about psycho, panpsychism.
3010600	3012040	Panpsychism, yeah.
3012040	3018280	I think what's driving that is that any time you find top down causality, you cannot much
3019720	3023400	deny, that's got to be mental.
3024440	3025800	Well, let's put it differently.
3025800	3030520	It's got to be top down and it's a constraint regime influencing its components.
3031160	3038120	But I don't want to say that they're just as chemical properties are emergent for physical,
3038680	3043320	biological properties are emergent from chemical, psychic properties are emergent
3043880	3045640	at a certain level of organization.
3046280	3053000	I don't want to say that that emergent property way up at the psychic level also exists.
3053720	3058120	I really don't want to say the Bernard cell is thinking.
3061160	3062920	Or is conscious or is aware.
3063720	3066920	But I do want to say there is a top down phenomenon.
3066920	3071720	I think I suspect that a lot of what's driving the panpsychic.
3073640	3074920	What would we call it?
3074920	3075240	Fad?
3075880	3077240	I hope so.
3077240	3080280	I cannot imagine that anybody's taking tears.
3080280	3085560	I think it's a, it's a, that's all I can do.
3085560	3087880	Let's call it paradigm to give it a little more credence than fad.
3087960	3094920	I don't want to get in trouble, Alicia.
3094920	3102360	Okay, I have to talk about that.
3103000	3109080	I just spoke at the theory of consciousness conference in Taramina this past spring.
3109640	3113480	And I suddenly realized I said the same thing I talked about.
3113480	3116440	I talked with that conference in Antwerp 20 some years ago.
3116440	3118760	And I was left out of the rule 20 some years ago.
3118760	3119560	Oh, wow.
3119560	3123320	I was talking about constraints and dynamical systems and so on.
3123320	3128120	Going, now interesting, you get a lot of this talk about constraints.
3128120	3130680	Say, I mean, people were talking a lot about constraints.
3132520	3133800	What is the lesson from that?
3133800	3137480	Because you've stuck to your guns and did you just brush that off your back?
3137480	3140440	And this is an aside, it's more of a personal question, you know,
3140440	3144120	because a lot of people face laughter or dismissal.
3144120	3147480	Well, I wasn't literally left out, but I was ignored.
3147480	3151080	And nobody asked me questions and they just said it's the equivalent.
3151080	3151960	People were polite.
3151960	3153240	Maybe they didn't understand it.
3154360	3155800	Well, I didn't explain it clearly.
3155800	3164360	But I think it was just, it didn't fit the standard bottom up identity theory
3164360	3168760	or supervenience theory, which was what was popular at the time,
3168840	3172920	or eliminatism, I never can say, at the time.
3173640	3178360	So it was ignored just as, I hate to say it, absolutely.
3180440	3184680	You know, Bill Bechtel, who's a nice guy and he's very good.
3184680	3186040	He's a new mechanist.
3186040	3188680	He's a mechanisms all the way proponent.
3189320	3193880	Well, if you look at his mechanics, they've sort of changed.
3194440	3198440	And he came to Cuba, he and Adele came to Cuba with me in a conference
3198440	3200600	I organized in Havana years ago.
3201240	3205800	And I think his mechanism is not your grandmother's mechanism.
3205800	3206200	That's true.
3206200	3207640	But he's adapted, like you just said.
3209160	3213640	But it's sort of like, come on, Bill, just acknowledge complex, dynamical.
3214600	3215080	Can't do it.
3215080	3216040	It's kind of, yeah.
3216040	3221080	Well, it's hard to change your mind when you've done it so wrong.
3221400	3221720	Yeah.
3222520	3224760	You mentioned explanation a few minutes ago.
3226760	3232120	So in dynamics and action, I think the last chapter or the next last chapter,
3232120	3237400	you make a call for the necessity of explaining these sorts of myriological
3238440	3241480	interactions in terms of hermeneutics or a narrative story.
3242040	3247720	And in this newer book, I think I searched and I think hermeneutics was in there maybe once or
3247720	3248200	twice.
3248200	3251640	But you also talk, you bring up the idea of order parameters, which are kind of like
3251640	3254600	these hyperparameters of dynamical systems.
3254600	3257560	So I'm wondering where you stand in terms of explanation.
3258280	3261240	My original thought was, well, if I could just list all the constraints and the
3261240	3264200	types of constraints and how they're interacting, is that an explanation?
3264200	3265640	Do I need a narrative story?
3265640	3267240	Are these order parameters?
3268200	3275640	What would satisfy me or a reviewer of a paper as an explanation of some cognitive
3276440	3277880	function, for example?
3277880	3281000	Well, I used the term hermeneutics.
3283480	3284200	Another eye roll.
3284200	3284680	Another eye roll.
3284680	3284920	Yeah.
3284920	3291400	I mean, I don't like neologism, although that hermeneutics goes back to biblical
3291400	3292360	existence.
3292360	3292600	Right.
3292600	3294680	Well, that's, yeah, when you look it up, it's all about the Bible.
3294680	3297160	But your point was to go across levels.
3297160	3298680	You really need to account for these things.
3298680	3300120	And narrative might be the only way to do that.
3300120	3306760	Gertz's notion that I borrowed that back then from Cliff Gertz, who almost defined
3306760	3309560	her hermeneutics and said, it's kind of like sailing.
3309560	3314040	You have to tack from the very global to the very local, back to the global, back to
3314040	3318360	the local, and see how all these constraints interact and change each other.
3318360	3323560	And I love also the notion of mutual constraint satisfaction, which is what I think is happening.
3324280	3330680	I think probably narrative does a way better job of accomplishing that
3331400	3335560	than a Hempel and Oppenheimer, Hempel and Oppenheimer,
3335560	3336920	deductive, nomological model.
3338600	3342920	So to that extent, I don't think I've changed my tune.
3342920	3345400	I just, I'm not using the notion of narrative.
3345640	3358680	When somebody nowadays says, Proust's Madeline's, you bring up the whole constraint regime of the
3358680	3364440	culture of his history, of his childhood, of his experience, that to me is almost like an
3364440	3373160	order of parameter. It's a parameter in that it is the intersection of a whole bunch of different
3373160	3381160	independent variables that together give you a whole tapestry of a whole different face,
3381160	3385960	possibility space. Could you think of a concept as a constraint?
3385960	3391560	I think I certainly think of a concept of a constraint and a framework, a cognitive framework
3391560	3399320	being a whole tapestry of concepts. But in such as cognitive, it's emotional.
3400120	3407560	I mean, think of, think of, think of all faction. And all faction does not
3409480	3419400	go directly to the cortex initially, right? But I think a concept has a lot of
3419400	3422680	characteristics that are important. One is they're multiply realizable.
3423560	3424680	That's a big theme in your book.
3424680	3430440	That's a big theme in my book because a triangle or triangularity as a concept
3432920	3435800	is multiply realizable. It's not a one-to-one
3436920	3445080	capture of the individual physical features of one instance. And I think that we know the child
3445080	3452600	is able to, has understood the concept when they're able to apply that concept to an instance they
3452600	3458120	haven't seen before or they were not taught about. So I think that's extremely important.
3459240	3467960	I think what a local constraint regime does is it captures a type, what philosophers used to call
3467960	3478280	types and universals, or a concept or what we would call an emotion. Not this emotion now here.
3478280	3479320	An emotion, yeah.
3480360	3489400	You know, this type of emotion. It's a bunch of constraint regimes that can be identified
3490360	3503880	with a term like fear or anger or pleasure or avoid an approach. All these are code terms.
3505000	3511400	To that extent, the reductions, they're code terms, but they do capture something very real.
3511400	3515000	And that is a whole complex constraint regime.
3515960	3522040	That kind of swirls around this, let's say, fear or something. It takes with it, you know,
3522040	3527880	fight or flight, et cetera. And it's almost like a process that is itself kind of condensated to
3527880	3532760	use your term earlier, but still a process and brings with it, carries with it on its back
3533800	3536200	its history and all of the things associated with it.
3536200	3537720	Correct, correct, correct.
3537720	3544120	Yeah. Okay, so I didn't tell you this. And I know we're jumping around. I actually
3544120	3549880	elicited a few guest questions from previous guests. The first one I'm going to play for you,
3550520	3557080	and this is kind of kind of maybe segue into a conversation about minds and brains and then
3557080	3560840	later AI. The first one I'm going to play to you is from Kevin Mitchell. I'm going to have him
3560840	3568440	back on the podcast in a couple of weeks about his new book, Agents, Free Agents,
3568440	3569640	How Free Well Gave Us Agency.
3570840	3573160	Okay, so I'm just going to play this to you, make sure that you can hear it.
3574840	3579640	Hi, Alicia. This is Kevin Mitchell. I really loved your new book, which very clearly lays out the
3579640	3584920	case that constraints are causes. That is that the way things are organized is every bit as much of
3584920	3590920	a cause of how they evolve through time as the basic laws and forces of physics. In particular,
3590920	3596680	you highlight the really key idea of enabling constraints, especially in hierarchical systems,
3596680	3601400	that organizing the elements at one level can enable new kinds of properties to emerge at higher
3601400	3607960	levels. You say in chapter 16 that emergent properties and powers were not merely waiting to
3607960	3613640	be revealed. They are genuine creations of path dependent, multiple constraint satisfaction.
3614840	3619560	And I wanted to push back on that a little and suggest that, in fact, many of the organizations
3619560	3624920	we see in living organisms and design systems are there because of some functionality.
3624920	3629480	They serve a useful purpose, and that many such functional motifs or architectures
3629480	3635480	are in fact waiting to be revealed. Under this view, a lot of the design work done by evolution
3635480	3641560	is actually an exploration of a kind of platonic design space, followed by retention of useful
3641560	3647960	motifs rather than a real creation de novo. So I wonder what you make of that notion. Thanks.
3649000	3652360	All right, so that was a long one, but did you get it all?
3652360	3661080	Yes, I think I got it all. That's a heck of a question, because I think logically, of course,
3661080	3671400	there is a platonic, maybe undercurrent. But in fact, I think I'm more like Aristotle did not
3671400	3679960	believe that Plato's forms existed in a transcendental realm. And I want to stay agnostic about
3679960	3685400	that. But I certainly want to say that they are embodied and revealed and acted upon
3687880	3693960	in virtue of the confluence of these constraints occurring at a particular moment, at a particular
3695720	3701880	time. Locally. You know, I think I used to think of myself more as a platonist when I remember
3701880	3709720	getting into philosophy. And I got into philosophy because back in the day, a lot of schools allowed
3709720	3716120	you to, if you were not a science or math major or engineering major, you could substitute a
3716120	3720680	symbolic logic course for math requirement as one of your requirements. Anything to get rid of,
3720680	3728680	not to do math, which I am sorry, I did. But when I took the first philosophy course, it was like
3728680	3735080	discovering a whole new platonic world. It was like, you know, if I'd taken another history course,
3735080	3739240	yeah, you know, it's another king, another queen, another war, another this. But this was like a
3739240	3744760	whole new floor in a building that I'd never seen before. That's that kind of transformation.
3747240	3753640	But more and more, I want to kind of remain grounded and rooted to
3755880	3765800	natural phenomena. So I really want to naturalize my arguments and speculating about a platonic
3765880	3773000	transcendental realm. Well, he said a kind of platonic. He hedged a little bit. Well, if that's
3773000	3782360	the case, then I'm perfectly happy with his book that way. So that what is the kind? Well,
3782360	3789000	in Aristotle's case, it's the Aristotle believed in forms. It's just that he believed in embodied
3789000	3797880	forms and forms as they were. And so what I want to say is that they are created by this confluence
3797880	3806120	of constraints. My main concern is to make sure that they are taken seriously such that
3808200	3813560	meaning is taken seriously. In other words, the unembedding
3813880	3822520	organizational level gives meaning to the components. The amount of
3824280	3832680	glucose in a fudge brownie that I can eat and not get sick is given meaning by what my homeostasis
3832680	3841160	metabolism is operating as. Well, yeah, you're okay now, but don't do it very often kind of thing.
3841160	3848200	So that meaning is the multiple realizability of the ambiguous
3849480	3857480	aspect being disambiguated by context. But but not not and I use the word context very deliberately.
3857480	3863880	I don't want to use context to mean any old environment. I want to mean the environment
3863880	3870920	in which a system is embedded and from which it has drawn some of its context is enabling constraints
3870920	3883400	and in terms of which it implements its stabilizing or top down constraints. So so
3885480	3892680	I want to say these are these are new and the properties are real so that
3893560	3904840	yes, superconductivity and a laser has brand new properties that are real. Did they exist in a
3904840	3910600	pre existing platonic realm? I don't think I want to speculate on that. I'm perfectly happy
3910600	3917960	so long and to me real means it has causal power. It has some kind of it makes it makes a difference.
3918840	3925480	If it's any phenomenal, you know, then I don't that kind of emergence. Yeah, weak emerges that
3925480	3929400	kind of mergers doesn't interest me that much. Okay, I don't want to speak for Kevin, but
3930840	3935880	kind of reformulating his question, you know, a lot of what you and the field and dynamical
3935880	3940120	systems theories talks about is these state spaces and when you're on a dynamical like when
3940120	3946440	you're on a trajectory within the state space, you can visit different areas within the state
3946440	3951000	space, not all of them and the constraints constrain where you can visit in the state
3951000	3958360	space, right? But if you I wonder if that that kind of platonic realm that Kevin is alluding to
3959000	3964840	is you can think of it as the state space that whether a state space is a real thing, right,
3964840	3969960	on a trajectory, later we can say that we can define the state space by the trajectory and the
3969960	3973960	boundary conditions of the possible values that it could have taken. But if it's not visiting
3974520	3980200	a particular area of the state space, would that and it did, would that then be a new thing?
3980200	3984520	Or would it be visiting a thing for which it already had a capacity for and thinking in terms
3984520	3989960	of like the functions that Kevin was talking about? I think that's what normal science is. Normal
3989960	3995880	science is the visiting of areas in a possibility space. It hadn't visited before, but it's pretty
3995880	4004680	much the same possibility space. I think that's development, biology. I think evolution. I think
4004680	4012840	there are times when it's the entire possibility space that is new. That's what I want to call
4013640	4020840	a creative emergent characteristic. Is this related to Stuart Kaufman's adjacent possible idea?
4020840	4029880	Maybe. Whether we go step by step going from each adjacent possible or in the case of a
4029880	4035880	Bernard cell, it doesn't seem that it's adjacent possible. It seems as though there's a threshold
4035880	4044040	of instability on which you need to reorganize all the parameters, all the variables. Everything
4044040	4049640	acquires a different meaning because it's in a qualitatively different space.
4050600	4057720	It seems to me that's what happens, for example, a cell in a petri dish as opposed to a cell
4057720	4071160	within a tissue. It's a different qualitative phenomenon. It's the new possibility space
4071160	4077000	that I want to say is being created is an emergent quality. It's not just a new
4077320	4083960	corner in the existing possibility space. I'm perfectly happy going adjacent possible.
4087720	4093000	This is from Max Shine, who's been on the podcast. He calls himself a systems neurobiologist,
4093000	4097480	and he really tries to think across scales. A lot of his research is dealing with things
4097480	4104200	like how neuromodulation interacts with network level things. These things are hard to think about
4104200	4111880	and to research, obviously. Let me pull up this question. Hi, Alicia. This is Max Shine from
4111880	4116360	the University of Sydney. When we think about top-down constraints over bottom-up activity,
4116360	4121960	we often invoke concepts like the self. I can imagine myself being hungry and that will help
4121960	4126920	constrain the types of actions that I might take in order to find food and satiate my hunger.
4127880	4132120	There are a number of really fascinating situations, like the so-called flow state
4133000	4139080	and also states with pharmacological manipulation, when the sense of self can dissolve. Yet you
4139080	4143960	still see quite coherent cross-scale behavior. People don't just crumble into a heap. They can
4143960	4149720	still perform music and sports at a high level or have a nice walk through the forest. My question
4149720	4155560	is, do you view the sense of self as an illusion, or do you think of it just as one of many ways in
4155560	4161720	which a system that's organized across scales can be organized? Thanks. Max wants to know
4161720	4166840	whether his question was better than Kevin's. No, I'm just kidding. No, they're very good, both of
4166840	4177080	them. You know, I keep thinking how, with Gazaniga's experiments with the cut corpus callosum,
4177640	4184360	that there were a whole bunch of weird things like we discovered about somebody was shown an
4184360	4188920	image to the right eye, another image to the left eye, and people confabulated.
4189880	4195400	And so you wonder if in these cases where the self seems to dissolve,
4198760	4205400	there's nevertheless enough connectivity to maintain a coherent structure.
4207800	4212920	Structure being the self? What's the structure? Yes, I would say a dynamic, a whole dynamic
4212920	4224360	constraint that keeps being you. To a lesser example, I think people who sleep walk or who are
4224360	4231560	hypnotized will nevertheless not bump into the coffee table. They go around the coffee table.
4232520	4236520	But these could be sort of on the automatic side of behavior, right? So there's automatic and
4236520	4243240	controlled processes. Right, right. So that, well, but there is control enough that you walk and you
4243240	4250920	don't, you maintain an awareness. Right, but maybe the flow state would be, because Max mentioned the
4250920	4256200	flow state, when that is like when your automatic processes take over, but you still barely have
4256200	4261080	some sort of control and you're in a heightened, you're trying really hard and it kind of switches
4261160	4265720	and then you're watching yourself do it kind of. Yeah, yeah. And you wonder whether we can,
4266600	4272680	could that be a bit like these optical illusions where you can see one side and not the other?
4272680	4281080	And so to what extent do those constraints, to what extent do those levels of awareness
4282520	4289480	conflict with each other, can mutually support each other and reinforce each other or not?
4290120	4296680	Again, I think that the next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different
4297800	4304600	modes of constraint that are all operating simultaneously. As I started writing this,
4304600	4311960	all of a sudden things like entrenchment, like buffering, I have a whole chapter of where I
4311960	4321080	catalog some of these buffering and entrenchment and scapholds and all of these that seem to
4321080	4326920	all be operating simultaneously and that certainly a lot of the social scientists have understood
4326920	4333960	very, very well. In public policy, oh look, have we entrenched this rule in regulation,
4333960	4341800	it will hang on for way longer and avoid any kind of attempts to remove it as a regulation that
4341880	4350920	I live in DC, that's why I think about it. And so you wonder, starting to map things in terms of
4350920	4358680	constraints, in terms of possibility spaces, might start to illustrate how all of these work and
4360600	4368280	the possibility of therapeutic intervention as a result because that's what all this recent talk
4368280	4376680	about psychedelics. No, you wonder to what extent a psychedelic literally disintegrates the
4376680	4384840	constraint regime of the self, of the pre-established coordinates and parameters and so on.
4386680	4397880	Exactly, the ego. You wonder to what extent that is a disruption of the constraint regime,
4397960	4405400	more than the disruption of vision or, yeah, vision too, you get maybe hallucinations,
4405400	4411480	but that's not as interesting as, you know, I go like that and I push my elbow, I can hallucinate
4411480	4416600	all these standard, optical illusions, we don't call them hallucinations, we call them optical
4416600	4422040	illusions, right? So at what point do we start looking at this and the answer is that's going
4422120	4429560	to take a lot of very interesting research, kind of like Ramachandran's famous example with the
4430120	4436280	phantom limb and the mirror and so on. How is that possible unless there is some
4439080	4449400	control regime that is modulating the sense of pain that incorporates, you know, I can imagine
4449400	4455000	being in an automobile accident and having my arm mangled or I hear these descriptions of these
4455000	4460680	IEDs and you know, picking up chalkboard scraping and things like that. Correct, correct, and so
4460680	4466200	you go, well, here's everything together because if you didn't have the visual input, if you didn't
4466200	4471400	have the conceptual understanding of what this means, on and on and on, you wonder if the pain
4471400	4481560	would be, would be different. And so how all of these constraint regimes interact and what are
4481560	4487640	the necessary inputs at each point to maintain that particular constraint regime so that then
4487640	4496280	you have a global sense of self that I'm not sure we're all that coherent when every in every day.
4497160	4501240	I don't feel coherent, but my wife would beg to differ.
4501240	4507800	Weird enough to be operating, but it's not like, you know, if I heard something horrible happening
4507800	4516840	outside, I wouldn't react and I even even in a sense of flow, I think there's enough cognitive
4516840	4524120	control that if some horrendous perturbation, the standard answer is you drive home and you
4524120	4527880	don't even know if you went through that red light or you don't because you drive home in that
4528600	4532920	and that path every day and you don't even think about it. But certainly if a child ran across
4532920	4542120	your front of the then you'd immediately get out of that flow and react. So there's how much
4542120	4549560	control in which case, how can we use it therapeutically for obsessive compulsive disorders,
4549560	4562600	for PTSD, for all of these, I think those are all disorders disorders of constraint regimes. So
4562600	4568520	regulation of regulate, it's a it's the regulatory system that's shot, it's like the on switches
4568520	4575000	on all the time, or the it is modulating it the way it's supposed to modulate it. So these are
4575000	4584680	regulatory meaning constraint regime issues, not structure, not function. It's the regulatory
4584680	4591240	constraint regime that modulates these other two that that we don't understand that much about, I
4591240	4601400	think, all CD, PTSD, chronic anxiety or depression, all of these that are sort of I think we've pretty
4601400	4605080	much taken care of, no, we haven't taken care of it, but we understand how it worked the low
4605080	4610680	hanging fruit of the, you know, yeah, well, you know, the glucose is out of whack, that causes,
4610680	4617880	but where stress or epigenetic stress can be inherited several generations down,
4617880	4622840	that's a regulatory issue. Then that's what methylation does. And that's what I think
4622840	4628200	a lot of these constraint regimes do. So there's this phenomenon sort of piggybacking on what
4628200	4633240	Mac was asking about, there's this phenomena in psychedelics, right, you can use them
4633240	4637560	therapeutically. And in some cases, like near death experiences serve as therapeutic events,
4637560	4642280	and people come back kind of different, right? Correct. And is this a way to is one way to
4642280	4646360	imagine that, and maybe even electroshock therapy is another example, I'm not sure if that's a good
4646360	4652280	example, but yeah, yeah, you have all these kind of entrenched constraints locally in your brain
4652280	4656840	in your mind and operating things. And then when you so I'm sure you're aware of the psychedelic
4656840	4661640	study that when you administer psychedelics, often what happens is there's higher connectivity
4661640	4666520	in your brain, less modularity, right? And could could you maybe there's a speculation,
4666520	4672360	but would you think of that as just resetting all of the attractor states and then when they
4672360	4676520	come back up, they can come back in slightly different ways, they might not probably and it
4676520	4683960	might open up, it might make the interfaces more porous to contemporary experience. So
4683960	4690760	you don't have to be worried that the explosion is the IED, or that that that you don't have to
4690760	4698120	wash your hands a million times in order to because you know, yes, I think that the that more and
4698120	4707880	more as we read these kinds of novel forms of therapy that they are, they usually are targeting
4707880	4718680	issues of regulation. Really, to me, fascinating. Yeah, this is then starting to study how exactly
4718680	4728440	that connectiome stays stays whole. Strain dome connect, they all because all the connectome,
4728440	4734760	the proteomics and all the rest of them, all the ohms, all the ohms then are modulated by the whole
4734760	4743000	constrained dome of the entire. But that also includes the constraints of your society. You
4743000	4750600	know, I love traveling to Europe. When I travel to Europe, the weight of history is very obvious
4751720	4757800	compared to the United States. You ask somebody at a restaurant in anywhere in Europe, and how do
4757800	4766120	you prepare this dish? Half of the time, it's the way it's always been prepared. Yeah. Whereas in
4766120	4770040	America, if you do it the same way as you did it six months ago, oh, you're stale, you're boring,
4770040	4775560	you're old, it's encouraged the constraint regime. Now, that's not to say that they're not all sorts
4775560	4780840	of problems for marginalized societies where the constraint regimes are very clearly kept and
4780840	4785880	trenched very deliberately. Yes, I understand that. But it's all a question of the constraint
4785960	4791240	coming from the culture as well. That's why in the four E's, the whole, for example, their emphasis
4791240	4796440	on affordances. This is the, so I don't know if we said earlier, this is like the inactive embodied,
4797720	4803240	what are the other two? The four E's. Anyways, embodied cognition. Correct. Yeah.
4803240	4810200	Embodied cognition, which Andy Clark and Paolo and even Merlin Dallen, where about when? Extended.
4810280	4814600	Extended embodied and acted. There we go. We got three out of four.
4816200	4822280	You know, I always say, I frankly do not think that a chair affords opportunities for seating for
4822280	4828840	a lot of people. You hear stories of folks from, I don't know which culture who were brought to
4828840	4836040	the United States, and they will stand on the toilet because it didn't occur. And I don't think
4836120	4843640	a tatami mat affords opportunities for sleeping for those of us who were not raised in a Japanese
4843640	4851960	school. I mean, affordances are clearly embodied, embedded in the constraint of the society in which
4851960	4857720	you grew up, or you know about. Embedded. You just said the fourth E. It's embedded. It is. Okay.
4858840	4865080	And I think how things get, see, I don't think you have embeddedness in Newtonian science. Right.
4865640	4871320	Things are just plunked into a featureless space and time in Newtonian science.
4871320	4875240	Yeah. Well, that's the beauty of it too, because it's simplicity, right? It's
4875240	4882600	spherical cows. It's in a vacuum. It's, yeah. Correct. But it's featureless. Whereas embeddedness
4882600	4889880	is you're really embedded, meaning that embedding layer affects you,
4890280	4897560	and you are a part of that embedding dynamic as well. It goes both ways.
4898920	4902600	All right. I want to ask you, because we're coming up on time, and I have a thousand other things
4902600	4906440	to ask you, but let's stay on brain and mind for just one more question here. And then I have some,
4906440	4911400	I want to ask you about artificial intelligence and your thoughts on that. So thinking about
4911400	4919320	dimensionality and going up in these a myriological level, right? So a lot of this modern neuroscience
4919320	4923160	is reducing the dimensionality of your brain activity into these low dimensional manifold
4923160	4927320	structures, and then the dynamics come in when you have a trajectory along that manifold.
4927320	4930280	And a lot of some people think that that's, well, maybe that's the closest thing that we
4930280	4937480	can get to right now in describing, in relating brains to minds. And then, but marrying that idea
4937480	4945080	with the idea of capacity. And this goes back to Kevin Mitchell's question. What I want to think
4945080	4950280	is that I'm not a low dimensional mind. I'm a, I have a high capacity, right? Is there a way,
4950280	4954360	like, is there a story I can tell myself that I'm going from the high dimensionality
4954920	4961640	brain activity that I have moving quote unquote up a level to mind? And that can, that's a messy
4961640	4965400	statement I know. Can I increase my dimensionality? Do I have to reduce it?
4965960	4974360	No, I think, for example, letters form words. I think of a word as
4979320	4985160	a higher dimension. You can do more with those words. You have options available in words
4985160	4989400	and keep going sentences. But that's certainly true for atoms, molecules.
4990360	4994040	Is the higher dimension, does that, do you mean, is it a higher
4995320	4999320	possibility space? Or is it, I guess that's kind of equated to higher dimensionality.
4999320	5007720	Yeah, that's what I think of. It's a higher possibility space whose coordinates are relational.
5009400	5016600	Okay. And if that's the case, then you have a way higher possibility space. So that's why,
5016600	5023000	for example, the example I used in the book, which is Manté's understanding of how these chimps
5024120	5039800	are able to understand. Because the possibility space they have forged is a task defined
5040600	5049400	possibility space. But it's of a different type. Exactly. The type is simpler in that you have one
5049400	5056200	concept of a type that captures all the way. You have to look at the colored dots, you have to
5056200	5063960	look at the movement of the dots and so on. But it's the task that is defined. And the behavior is
5064520	5071720	executed in terms of that task. Is that lower dimensional? I think it's way more sophisticated
5071720	5078440	than it would just in terms of the intensity of the flash of light. But here the task is a huge
5078440	5089320	constraint as well. Yes, but it's a much more complex dynamic than would be the physical
5089400	5103400	features alone, right? Yeah. So it's sometimes people say that complex systems are a simplified
5104920	5110600	description of what's going on. Sometimes I think of it more like streamlined. Okay. The
5110600	5118040	streamlining gives you characteristics that you wouldn't have otherwise. And so the organization
5118040	5124040	of that monkey's brain in response to training, which would be the neighboring constraints.
5125240	5135480	All right. It seems to me opens up a world for the monkey that may be captured by
5136520	5144440	the essential characters of the task, but not of the pure physical component alone. So in that sense,
5145080	5150520	I think of it as an expansion. Chemistry can do more than physics. Biology can do more than
5150520	5155960	chemistry, even though they are nonetheless not violating any of the underlying laws. It's the
5155960	5160920	organization and the complexity of that organization that opens up possibilities, I think.
5161480	5166760	All right. So my mind could be more cool than my brain activity. I could feel better about my
5166760	5175080	mind than my brain. Probably, yeah. Brain gets really... And I think that's true. I think as
5175080	5183160	people age, they get worse at tasks that are just repetitive. Oh, I thought that's all they could
5183160	5187880	do are tasks that are repetitive. But I think understanding connections and understanding
5188680	5195400	nuances and things like that. Oh, I'm thinking way aged. You're thinking like our age, maybe.
5195400	5199560	Well, I'm thinking of the difference between...
5203000	5210600	I don't know. It's more like difference between understanding and just pure speed of activity.
5210600	5213880	But my grandmother, who's 99, she cannot learn a new card game.
5214760	5218440	Right? She can play bridge, but she can't learn a new card game. But that's 99.
5218600	5221640	Yeah. So maybe that's even a different type.
5222760	5226680	Any one or maybe she's not interested in it. Maybe. Come on, grandma.
5229320	5233080	Yeah. But I see it's a different kind of understanding. I don't know. Would you call that
5233080	5237720	wisdom? Well, hopefully, I think that's what philosophers were looking for. Yeah. And the
5237720	5241720	question is, but I don't think it automatically happens as you get older. An awful lot of old
5241720	5246360	fools around there. Sure are. Yeah. Sure are a lot of old fools out there.
5247000	5250680	Okay, Alicia, I don't want to take all day for you. So I want to switch to artificial
5250680	5254360	intelligence here for a few moments. Are you good on time for a few more minutes?
5256040	5260920	Great. This is a lot of fun for me. No, me too. So I was actually kind of surprised
5260920	5265160	in revisiting dynamics in action. And you go into it in a little more detail, I think,
5265160	5274200	in context changes, everything that you refer to like neural network examples. And in both books,
5274200	5278760	you talk about the semantics that come along with syntax when you put recurrence in these
5278760	5285160	neural networks. And you cite Jeffrey Hinton and actually Michael Plout who or David Plout, who was
5285160	5289400	one of the authors on that paper, I did a course with him. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
5289400	5293240	But I always call them hidden plot and shallots because hidden and shallots probably plot and
5293240	5300600	shallots are hidden. But they're that that I will go ahead and finish up. Anyway, again,
5300600	5305160	I'm cute, but I shouldn't. Yeah. Well, so given what we've been talking about and, you know,
5305880	5311560	these interlocking systems and how important that is for complexity and the constraints,
5312840	5317880	given all that, I'm slightly surprised. And you talked about a constraint of closure from
5317880	5323080	Massimo and me. Moreno and Massimo. Moreno and Massimo, which I love that book also.
5324120	5328360	But that is very specific to like biological systems and not just biological systems,
5328360	5332840	but complex systems in the natural world. And it's not those types of things that we've been
5332840	5337480	talking about are not built into neural networks or only some of them are because maybe you talk
5337480	5343480	about the recurrence and how that can lead to semantics. So anyway, I was slightly surprised
5343480	5346840	that I started reading about like the neural networks because I thought, oh, well, a lot of
5346840	5351480	the things that it seemed to be important in these complex dynamics that give rise to our
5351480	5355480	rich mental worlds and rich ecologies and stuff are missing in the artificial intelligence systems,
5355480	5359160	or maybe they're not. And I wonder what you think is missing in current AI.
5359160	5367000	I think what's missing in current AI is context. In other words, somatic, somatic.
5367000	5372680	Oh, okay. Well, because context, I think, is it context changes? No, no, that's the title of your
5372680	5377640	book. All you need is, all you need is attention, which is a different form of context. And like
5377640	5381960	the modern transformer, which underlies all these large language models is all about context
5381960	5388840	in terms of word. But it does not have somatic information. It does not include
5388840	5398360	historical context. Well, this is how it's changed over time. So I think you need,
5399000	5407320	it does not include social, except indirectly as the social aspects get revealed in languages.
5408280	5416280	Otherwise, you don't have direct somatic interaction. Now, once you have these things,
5417640	5423480	once you have the chip, or the video chip, in a machine that you kind of
5425800	5432360	raise as a child with all the video, with all the video, with all the auditory, with all that.
5432360	5436200	You're actually, you're speaking exactly to my previous guest. I haven't released this yet,
5436200	5441080	but he raises artificial agent chicks exactly like newborn chicks to look at
5441080	5445640	this developmental trajectory of return. Which people did with chimps, remember? They
5445640	5452680	tried that without, did not turn out very well. Because at some point it didn't scale up. Now,
5452680	5465400	the question is whether the, but I think that if in fact, we have, we have eons of evolution
5465480	5475800	behind us, of the planet of the, of life and so on, you wonder if you can short-circuit any of that
5475800	5482760	and get. Right. Well, we seem to be partially. Well, I mean, I certainly want to say a sunflower
5482760	5489320	is aware of the sun. Okay. Tropism is a form of awareness. I don't care what you call it.
5489320	5497080	Is it self-awareness? No, I don't think so. I wouldn't want to say that. So it's the thought
5497080	5501640	example of the, you know, which the elephants and so on. Now they're saying crows can do it and so on.
5501640	5507560	So is that, what is it like to be a crow as well as a bat? So at what point do you start saying,
5507560	5512440	well, this is not just, it recognizes its body with something and you wonder,
5513240	5518760	or it really recognizes itself as a self or is there a self in the, in the
5518760	5523880	chimp that can point to the screen when it sees its image with a thought on its forehead.
5524920	5529960	At each point, I would say it's an emergent property, but certainly I've got to tell you those
5529960	5535560	hint and plot and chalices. I had been playing around with these problems for ages and I had
5535560	5542120	not sat down to write dynamics in action until I read hint and plot and chalice, which at the time
5542120	5549080	was, I went, the fact that, that, that's really simple. I mean, we're talking how many decades ago,
5549880	5555800	neural network was able to, according to chalice, I think it was when somebody asked him, how do
5555800	5561560	you explain that it produces the errors of deep dyslexia, not surface dyslexia? And his answer
5561560	5568360	was, I can only explain it by saying it self-organized a semantic attractor. So semantics
5568360	5574200	would be an emergent property that changes the output. That's what I, why we would call it
5574200	5580120	strong emergence. That's what I, why I would call it top down. It changes the probability
5580120	5587160	distribution of what its behavior is such that it produces an output that reflects the semantics
5587160	5594920	of the attractor. But so AI does not have closure of constraints. So this is another idea that,
5596040	5601000	you know, it's not self-generating. It's, it's byproducts don't feedback in that sense, or,
5601000	5608040	or maybe you have a different outcome. Now, now. Now it doesn't. Exactly. Okay. That's the question.
5608040	5615240	The question always is not, not what's practically doable today, but in principle. Sure, sure. But
5615240	5619000	I mean, are we going to have to emulate life then? Are we going to have to have artificial
5619000	5624280	life to have what, whatever the hell real artificial, real intelligence, real artificial
5624280	5630600	intelligence is, right? And that's again, an answer for the constraint on how many of these
5630600	5637720	constraints are really not necessary for, for intelligent systems that would assist a neurologist
5637720	5643640	or a, you know, maybe you don't need experience, you know, emotion or you know, I mean, I don't know.
5645160	5652760	So, but my, but what I find fascinating is that even without somatic input, without any of this
5652760	5660040	other stuff, the kinds of errors that people talk, oh, they hallucinate, that it's so similar to the
5660040	5668760	kinds of errors that you got with the split brain gazaniga issues, the thing is making up
5669560	5675720	some kind of story that would make all the inputs it has so far coherent.
5676920	5683720	Correct? Even if it is, well, that's a typo. I've seen one where the output, well, the people
5683720	5687400	were, the trainer was saying, no, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right. At one point
5687400	5693800	it said, well, you know, that wasn't just a typo. Excuse me. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.
5694920	5701400	What ideas or concepts do you find yourself like revisiting the most when you're working? What
5701400	5707000	ideas do you have? Do you revisit and are unsure about or think you need to grapple with more?
5707720	5716520	I think the notion of how do you account for the emergent properties,
5717720	5723480	characteristics in each particular case in each particular individual? How do we
5723480	5729720	how? Is there any hope to be able to map this other than say, well, if each one is unique,
5729720	5735480	then well, then that's the end of science. That's it. I mean, we need some kind of general
5737480	5744760	formal. We both winced there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how to phrase it. Is it a back,
5744760	5752360	forth, hermeneutic kind of multiple constraint satisfaction? How does that work? And I love
5752360	5759160	that example that I got from Kusler and Koenig, I think their book way back went on psychology of,
5759160	5764280	you know, imagine you're renting out an apartment and the apartment has one large
5764280	5768440	wall and it's got a window here and so on. And this is going to be your bedroom and so
5768440	5773000	you're constrained because the bed has to fit against maybe a wall, but then the chest doesn't
5773000	5780040	fit because the other wall. So it's a question of multiple constraint satisfaction. So do you
5780040	5785240	turn the chest of drawers into a night table because that's the only place it fits. And so
5785240	5790680	you're adjusting it and it's constant adjustment, but that's what you see in dynamical systems.
5791400	5798440	That's the kind of meta stability that someone riding a bike or someone on a tightrope, you
5798440	5805400	know, one of these people going on a highway or a tightrope. It's not the kind of equilibrium of
5805400	5812520	your old time, near equilibrium thermodynamics. It's a meta stability where it's a constant
5812520	5823560	adjustment of constraints. Correct? And so how do we, is there any hope to be able to map this
5823560	5830280	in a way that provides some kind of general guidance as to how this is going to play out
5830280	5834360	in a particular situation? How much do you have to know of the background? How much, you know,
5834360	5840920	do you have to know of the context to be, you know, and I think, I think that's one good thing
5840920	5849480	about that Aristotle had said was, you don't, you can't teach law, medicine, and ethics,
5850280	5856120	because those are eminently context dependent compared to science. So, so how do you do it?
5856120	5861560	You can only do it through apprenticeships, because the apprentice gives you this. And
5861560	5869880	when I talk class, this is what I do. You know, you get a feel for it. So, so is that what a good
5869960	5876120	coach in a business does? Because they've got enough of a feel for it. They might not be able
5876120	5884040	to formalize it into a standard algorithm, but they've got a feel for the situation that therefore
5884040	5888600	can provide guidance. This is why a coach doesn't need to be more of an expert than the expert as
5888600	5895880	well, I imagine. You know, you have to have a feel for it. And how do you, how do you formalize the
5895880	5902200	feel of something? And that's what, that's what a, that's what a master musician does. I just
5902200	5908280	finished reading a book by Adam Gopnik called The Real Work, and it's about the mystery of mastery.
5908840	5913640	Okay. Oh, it's fun to read. And so he talks about, you know, how do you,
5915480	5922200	is the master seeing something that's at a different level? And Hofstadter used to talk
5922200	5929080	about that when he talked about the chess master, who's shown a chess game in progress for a few
5929080	5934680	seconds, and then they're asked to reproduce the feel for the board. They would always put
5934680	5940440	the pieces in different locations than what was actually presented to them. But the strategy,
5940440	5947080	the strategic position, white and black were in, remained the same. Interesting. So what are they
5947160	5953480	seeing? That the newbie doesn't see. The newbie is worried about
5955080	5960840	playing the piano one finger here, one finger there. Simulating each move. That's like the physical
5962120	5968680	signal that's coming in. Obviously mastery means that you see a level of organization
5969320	5975640	that in the case of chess's strategy, in the case of magician is the
5976200	5982280	prestidigitation, it's the magic. And what is it that you're seeing that then matters?
5983000	5990120	And I think that's the constraint regime that we're all trying to figure out. Why is it that the
5990120	5998360	same person that the soldier next to that one didn't get PTSD? They were in the same explosion.
5998680	6004040	Because they were more of a man. See, that was the old tradition. It had to be an internal
6004040	6010760	and internal characteristic. Whereas what I'm saying is what are the interdependent constraints
6010760	6018200	that make a difference? You began that with like wondering if there is no hope,
6018200	6022840	or if there is hope. Is there hope? Do you feel optimistic? Look, you've got to assume
6023560	6031000	that we're all humans. So there's got to be some commonalities somewhere. At what scale,
6031000	6037560	at what granularity? It's hard to say because you look at families and you see kids from the same
6037560	6042680	family raised by the same friends, going to the same school, and they're so different. So you wonder,
6043320	6049480	how does that happen? Is that all in birth order? I mean, there was a time where people
6049480	6054920	talked a lot about that. If temporal constraints matter, then temporal order has to matter at
6054920	6060440	some point. But to what extent, to what degree? I think that's what the... What's fun about this
6060440	6068200	is that there's a whole new possibility space of research that opens up when you look in terms of
6068200	6074120	constraints rather than looking in terms of... When the people were into the genome, I thought,
6075000	6080120	people are assuming again, one disease per genome. Looking back, that's crazy.
6080120	6083480	That's never going to happen. I knew that that was the case.
6083480	6087480	You knew that. I didn't know that. I mean, yeah, because I had this linear thought,
6087480	6093000	that's the way I was raised. And so... We all were raised that way. That's what we all assume.
6093000	6099400	But now the question is, well, is it going to be one protein fold per disease or per disease?
6100360	6106200	So at what point is it... No, it's the context that makes it fall this way rather than that,
6106200	6110680	and therefore gets this functionality rather than that, even though it's the same string of amino
6110680	6117000	acids. All right, so it's the confirmation. So what is it in the context that makes it conform a
6117000	6123560	certain way? Well, in the case of development, we know that one cell in one part of the fertilized
6123560	6126840	egg is the one that... Because if it's in that location, that's what's going to
6126920	6133400	turn into the first neural crest. Is that pure random? Then that raises, that brings randomness
6133400	6139400	there rather than at the quantum level. So how does that work? Who knows? But it's fun to think
6139400	6146760	about. It opens up a whole new way of looking at a whole level of organization that we thought was
6146760	6152840	just illusory or just epistemically convenient. But if we really say, all right, now let's pretend
6152840	6157320	just for the sake of argument, it's real. How does this play out? What does this mean? What are the
6157320	6162280	implications? I mean, it's not just one level, though. God, I now want to ask you, what's beyond
6162280	6170760	consciousness? What's... It's turtles all the way up. I just used that. It's everywhere. It's the
6170760	6181080	whole tangled... It's an entangled bank that's... But it's not random. People use the word still,
6181160	6187640	use the word chaos when they refer to things like the Lorenz attractor to mean it's this sort...
6187640	6192920	No, it's just a high level of organization that we didn't appreciate before. That Lorenz
6192920	6198680	butterfly is very organized. Are you kidding? But it never repeats the same trajectory twice
6198680	6204040	because of its path dependence and so on. So we have to understand what are the constraints that
6204040	6209880	lead to that higher level of organization and how does that work? Well, Alicia, in terms of
6209880	6215960	possibility spaces, it just occurred to me that if the science, the philosophy of constraints,
6215960	6220680	is a possibility space, your book Context Changes Everything filled the hell out of that space.
6221240	6226920	I'm glad that we got to visit some of those places today. I really appreciate it. Thank you for
6226920	6242840	asking me. It was fun. A lot of fun. Thank you so much. Thank you.
