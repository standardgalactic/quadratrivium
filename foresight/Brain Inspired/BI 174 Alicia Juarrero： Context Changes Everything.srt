1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
How on earth can I argue for a local science? I'm going to be laughed out of the room if

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
I argue for a local science.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,800
But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:28,240
It seems to me that what those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,920
theorists would call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,960
The next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different modes of constraint that

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,720
are all operating simultaneously.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,640
This is Brain Inspired. Hey everyone, I'm Paul. Alicia Juarrero is a philosopher and

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,000
has been interested in complexity science for a long time. In her own words, since before

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,040
complexity was cool. I like that.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,840
In this episode, we discuss many of the topics and ideas. In her new book, Context Changes

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
Everything, How Constraints Create Coherence.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,640
The book makes the thorough case that constraints should be given way more attention when trying

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,280
to understand complex systems like brains and minds, how they're organized, how they

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,000
operate, how they're formed, how they're maintained, et cetera, et cetera.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,760
So as you probably know, modern science, thanks in large part to the success of physics,

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,280
focuses on, or mostly on, a single kind of causation, the kind involved when one billiard

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,400
ball strikes another billiard ball.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,240
But that kind of causation neglects what Alicia argues are the most important features of

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,680
complex systems, the constraints that shape the dynamics and possibility spaces of systems.

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,600
Much of Alicia's book describes the wide range of types of constraints that we should

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,040
be paying attention to, and how they interact and mutually influence each other.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,000
I highly recommend the book, and you may want to read it before, during, and after our conversation.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,800
It's partly because, if you're like me, the concepts that we discuss still aren't comfortable

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,600
to think about in terms of normal modes of explanation in science.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,040
Thinking across levels of organization turns out to be hard.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,840
You might also want the book handy because, hang on to your hats, we also jump around

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,560
a lot among many of the concepts that are in our book.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,320
So context changes, everything comes almost 25 years, almost a quarter of a century, after

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,960
her previous classic, Dynamics in Action, which we also discuss, and which I also recommend,

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,280
especially if you want more of a primer to her new, more expansive work.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,040
These ideas touch on all things complex, of course, from self-organizing systems, like

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,600
whirlpools, to ecologies, businesses, societies, and of course, minds and brains.

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,040
Find the show notes at braininspired.co.

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm sure you could tell, I very much enjoyed this conversation.

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,000
We also have some guest questions from friends of the podcast, Kevin Mitchell, who's also

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,080
coming up on a near future episode about his new book, and Max Shine, from Down Under.

39
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Thanks for listening, here's Alicia.

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Context changes, everything is almost a quarter...

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
And human is Cuban hyperbole.

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Oh, what does that mean?

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,720
Humans tend to exaggerate, I probably should have said, context changes, most things are

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
a lot of things, human hyperbole.

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,960
Well I was going to tie it to your previous work, Dynamics in Action, which is now almost

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,440
a quarter of a century old.

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,680
And so what you could say about that is that context changes action is a very coarse and

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,880
terrible summary of that classic now work.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,560
And so I was thinking maybe context changes, everything is just kind of an expansion on

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
those ideas.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
It really is.

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
It really is.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,960
After I wrote that one, I thought, well, I've got nothing else to say, but you know, there's

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,280
been so many issues, and one of the things is people said to me, you know, there's nothing

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
that's context free, I'd use that term in that one.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Oh yeah.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,040
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
So what do I call it?

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, what about context, it depends.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,240
So I'm thinking maybe I gave short shrift to that one, to that kind of constraint.

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:57,800
You know, things start, and of course AI and language models and so on, and for E, I think

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
came out of the process.

63
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
So there were a lot of things that I thought once the pandemic started, I thought, you

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,640
know what, just sit down and do it, you know, and just put it all together.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,800
And Steve, you see if it comes together, and I was pleased it did.

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Yeah, me too.

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,840
I mean, you mentioned the phrase context free, which you have changed now to context dependent

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
in the new book.

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Independent.

70
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Oh, that's the contact.

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Right, context independent.

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,480
Yeah, see, that's what I was going to say is, you know, the book, I love the book.

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,520
It is challenging, and one that I will have to revisit over and over, because, well, no,

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
it's not bad.

75
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
So I'm already, that's not a bad thing.

76
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm already a slow reader, and I'm a slow thinker, apparently, as well, at least to

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
give me depth.

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm a writer is what I am.

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I don't write very clearly.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I don't know why I'm good in the classroom, but I'm terrified.

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,200
I just, it looks still, I spent most of my time just editing.

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Sure.

83
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, that's what, so what I want to ask you is, what has changed in your views since

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,240
Dynamics in Action?

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,880
And, you know, besides just expanding, you know, you cover like so many different constraints

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
and topics in this book.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,160
But what I wanted to comment on before that is, one of the reasons why I'm going to have

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,480
to go back to it over and over is because the terminology and is, you're like inventing

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
some of it.

90
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,640
But a lot of it is kind of still, for me, still fuzzy in terms of like what it actually,

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,400
like it's definition and how, like how I set the boundaries, you know, with these terms

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,640
and what they mean and how I can use them.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,560
And so, you know, and we'll come back to this, but anyway, that's why I'm going to be revisiting

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
a lot.

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,520
So maybe let's start with, you know, what's changed in 25 years in your thinking?

96
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,600
I think what's changed is that when I wrote Dynamics in Action, I basically meant it as

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,840
a brief against analytic action theory.

98
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Okay.

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,120
Can you summarize analytic action theory?

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,200
Well, the idea that either that intentional behavior, intentional action, you know, the

101
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,160
book starts with what's the difference between a wink and a blink, difference being that

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:24,920
you should be able to explain away anything that philosophy of mind considers intentionality

103
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
or intention.

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,720
So teleology was reduced away.

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,720
The idea of contentful intentions were reduced away.

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,600
And so my thought was, because I had published a number of standalone papers about what's

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,640
wrong with behaviorist reductions of intention, what's wrong with identity theory attempts

108
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:04,600
to reduce intentions is on, that complex dynamical systems theory was a very good way of entering

109
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,320
this whole field that would solve a lot of the problems or wouldn't get you into the

110
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,800
problems that all these other attempts did.

111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:23,400
But in the last 20-some years, I keep thinking, you know, most stuff in reality is irreversible.

112
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Most stuff is context.

113
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,120
So it applies not just to action, but it applies a lot more broadly.

114
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,760
And so I think I stick my neck out a bit more with respect to general ontology or general

115
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,040
cosmology by using the same notion of constraint more broadly than just for action.

116
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Yeah.

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,360
Well, I had to revisit dynamics in action.

118
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,800
As you know, and as you write about in your newer book, Context Changes Everything, neuroscience

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,560
has embraced the dynamical systems perspective.

120
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,600
And you talk about some of the studies that, you know, some of the people who have been

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,040
in those studies have been on this podcast.

122
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,400
On this podcast, we talk a lot about the dynamical systems view.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,280
And then going back to dynamics in action, it's like, oh, my God, it's all there already.

124
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
I mean...

125
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Thank you.

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,520
It's fascinating to me that somebody like Mark Churchland, whom I use in one of the chapters,

127
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,920
is the son of Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were the foremost advocates of the liminative...

128
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Right.

129
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

130
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Everything is as a mind.

131
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm thinking, oh, my goodness, this is the revenge par excellence of dynamical systems

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
theory.

133
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Because I once met Paul Churchland here in DC, Dick Schlagel at GW, and invited him

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to speak.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
And I asked him back then, this must have been, this must have been just about when Context

136
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Changes...

137
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I went and dynamics came up.

138
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
It was years ago.

139
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
And I...

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Haven't you ever considered cut dynamical systems theory?

141
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,560
That has nothing to say about neurology or the reality of the case.

142
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Paul Churchland said that in person, and I've never forgotten, I'm thinking, no.

143
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,920
And the reason I was almost sure that was so is because, but way back when, I was talking

144
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,760
a lot to people in operations, research and network theory and that kind of thing.

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,080
And they're like, you know what, there's got to be a network property in the brain that

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:35,120
has emergent properties that somehow loops back down and is able to influence behaviors

147
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,840
such that these emergent properties get realized in behavior.

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,400
That's the difference between an action proper and behavior.

149
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
There's got to be some of that.

150
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:51,440
But no, I think that just traditional notions of causality, traditional notions of ontology,

151
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
that only the tiny little fundamental components are real.

152
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,120
So it was all, let's look for the neuron.

153
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Right.

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
It does this.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Yeah.

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,440
So I find it really, really very rewarding that dynamical systems theory has been vindicated

157
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
in a sense.

158
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Yeah.

159
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,160
I wonder what the elder Churchlands, their daughter is also in neuroscience, by the way.

160
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,320
I wonder what they think of the dynam...

161
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,480
I wonder if they've come around at all because the tagline sort of of eliminateitivism is

162
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,000
that folk psychology, the words that we use in folk psychology aren't real things, right?

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,960
And then there's a reductionist way to understand things and that's the best way.

164
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,800
But the dynamical systems viewpoint kind of, it's kind of in between that, right?

165
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Because it allows for a top-down thing, but it doesn't necessarily say anything about the

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
terms and concepts we use.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Well, that's why I think I stick my neck out in this one where it seems to me that what

168
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:00,800
those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system theorists would

169
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,040
call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.

170
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,320
And so they are capturing an emergent property that is powerful and that's where the whole

171
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,600
problem of causality kept bugging me because, thinking, Carl Gillette's book on reduction

172
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,800
and emergence where he says, you know, nowadays the physicists, like Brian Rocklin, for example,

173
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,800
have espoused the truth or the reality of emergent properties.

174
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,600
But they still don't want to allow that those emergent properties are causally influential

175
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
on their components.

176
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,040
In other words, they cannot change behavior.

177
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,320
They cannot change in a sense neural architecture in virtue of their emergent

178
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,480
properties. Whereas that's what I think complex dynamical systems let's you do.

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,640
Maybe we could suggest that way into causality around a lot.

180
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
No, that's great.

181
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,480
You'll have to. I do it too.

182
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,400
So we're going to be in a real swamp here pretty soon.

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,880
But, you know, so one of the things in dynamics and action also is, you know, you've

184
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,760
railed against this modern notion of efficient causation as the only valid kind of causation.

185
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,480
And since you're just talking about causality, maybe we should talk about that.

186
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,680
And then I want to come back to also what you have changed your mind about perhaps since then.

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,040
But so, you know, famously, there are these four different types of causations from Aristotle's

188
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,320
days, from Aristotle, and an efficient causation, the billiard ball that thing X hits things

189
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,600
Y and then that moves things thing Y. That's the only valid kind of causation.

190
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,720
And a lot of your labor is trying to bring back notions of the other of formal

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,320
causality and causality via constraint.

192
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,920
And so do you think that and from my limited perspective, because I'm reading works like

193
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,880
yours and like a lot of similar kinds of works that are trying to bring make teleology not

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,360
such a bad word and bring like these constraints to bear, because of that, I feel like the old

195
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,280
story, the modern story of efficient causation is the only causation.

196
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,560
I feel like that's dissipating.

197
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,240
Do you believe that also?

198
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:27,520
I think it's still very present in physics, especially with regards to the kind of causality

199
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,240
that we would call top down causality, that in fact, emergent properties really are not

200
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,720
causally powerful, that all the heavy lifting, as Van Orten would say, it all happens bottom

201
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,880
up. And so it's really to be explained through efficient energetic transfer.

202
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:57,760
But I think that's because the idea of causality as efficient boxes you into the the

203
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,600
boxes you into the impossibility of top down causation, because if there were top down

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,960
causation with that kind of causality, you'd have over determination, you'd have a violation

205
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,480
of the closure of the physical and you'd have all these problems.

206
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,240
And so therefore no way that can't happen.

207
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,480
Well, but if you think of what I found fascinating, that's one of the reasons why I

208
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,040
adopted the notion of constraint was every time natural scientists, hard scientists got into

209
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,040
trouble thinking in terms of efficient causality, then immediately the term starts being used as,

210
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,680
well, it's factors or conditions or constraints that are causal.

211
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,960
Well, okay, so I'll grant you efficient causality as the term for cause.

212
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So let's call it influence by constraint.

213
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,600
And that's what I was trying to do, because I certainly don't want to go to an

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,080
environmental notion of formal cause.

215
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,960
I don't want to go to, you know, Deus Ex Machina, or, or your, you know, Paley's

216
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,640
teleology, or even Aristotle's teleology, which was all built in, set up from the beginning.

217
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,800
That's the way that that's why that's why Darwin, Darwin bought into this.

218
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,160
And so Darwin thought he was very concerned about the notion of evolution.

219
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,960
He said you have new species appearing that that would mean that it wasn't all built in

220
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,640
from the start.

221
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,960
And therefore this developmental process was only an unfurling of preexisting

222
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,320
potential.

223
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,880
And what I want to say is that constraints really create new potential, because I think

224
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,760
that's what you get from prigazine.

225
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,320
I think that's what prigazine gets the, he was the good pregoser now that we think

226
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,000
about it.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,080
He was the one who he got the Nobel Prize for dissipated structures, I think for that

228
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,760
very reason.

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,280
But you mentioned physics, and maybe it's just in biology that the notion of circular

230
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,120
causality and causality via constraint is more comfortable among biologists.

231
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,640
I think the biologists, biology was the last holdout.

232
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,040
They refused to get shoehorned into the model of efficient mechanical causality.

233
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,640
And as I was reading your email and reading one of the latest issues of Science Magazine

234
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:33,280
on Australia, you know, they're talking about the dispersal of distribution of black

235
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
beans throughout Australia.

236
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:42,840
And the assumption was, well, this precedes the Westerners who arrived in Australia.

237
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:53,120
But now they're revisiting the idea that some of the salt lines of the native Australians

238
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,520
have accounts of these plants and the dispersion.

239
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:10,880
So the Science Magazine article talks about combining not only the genetic flow of the

240
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:19,960
genes of the black bean plant, but also biogeography and these ethnographic accounts.

241
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,880
So I think that you see it now more in ecology, in addition to just straight biology.

242
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,600
But you see it.

243
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:37,320
And of course, the social scientists have always used other causal factors as their

244
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,160
reasons. But of course, that's what led the heart scientists to say, well, that proves

245
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,240
they're not sciences.

246
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,800
The social scientists, because they need to, because they need to appeal to you

247
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,560
unique causes to things that don't scale as a universal law.

248
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,440
And because they use top down factors that are not efficient causes, that shows for

249
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
sure they're not science.

250
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,840
Before maybe this can just be a jumping off point to any of these can be jumping off

251
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,440
points because we can go any direction.

252
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,320
But have you changed your mind about anything in particular with regard to the story of

253
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
context and constraints over the last quarter century?

254
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,320
No, I've just sort of expect, I think I focus more on context independent constraints,

255
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,120
because what I think that does.

256
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,960
And hang on, I'll just say context independence means it's an external constraint that

257
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,760
drives a system far from equilibrium, like a gradient or gravity, etc.

258
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
It pulls on the system.

259
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,760
Gradient, particularly.

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
And when you start looking at the different kinds of gradients, either the spatial

261
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,040
temporal gradients of gravity, you know, the gravitational.

262
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,040
I like that you just illustrated gravity right there.

263
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:04,320
That means that that space, time is not homogenous and uniform.

264
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,560
There are inhomogeneities in space and time.

265
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,040
Polarities, we know the importance of polarities all over the place.

266
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,160
We have polarities in electric and magnetic, but also in developmental anterior

267
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,040
posterior, right and left in the development of an embryo.

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
There are we have.

269
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,760
I think in social systems, we certainly have levels of organization that would

270
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,240
give you different different points of equilibrium at different stages.

271
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,880
So I think the importance of that, the importance of boundary conditions, I think,

272
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,320
as a setting for a context.

273
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,920
So basically, I think of the of context independent constraints as those that

274
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,320
determine, in a sense, the bounds of possibility space.

275
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:13,840
They kind of determine the basic fundamental characteristics of possibility space.

276
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,240
But you need both context independent and context dependent.

277
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,520
And I'll just briefly define context, context dependent constraints are those

278
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,400
that which bring things back essentially away from context independence, which means

279
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,920
more toward equilibrium.

280
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,040
And when you get these mixing and match, maybe not.

281
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,480
I know, I know, I just caught myself saying more toward equilibrium.

282
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,520
But away from independence, we'll say maybe that's correct.

283
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,200
Yeah.

284
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,160
But when you get these interacting is when when you can have the ability to develop

285
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,320
complex systems.

286
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,560
I think the reason I had given context free context independent constraints short

287
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,080
shrift back when is because I don't think context independent constraints.

288
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,240
Complexify, they don't they don't enable complexity.

289
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,080
All you get in principle would be a clump.

290
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,640
Yeah.

291
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,120
Correct.

292
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,520
They wouldn't match the poles.

293
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,840
Yeah.

294
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,960
And clumps and masses and agglomerations have no emergent properties.

295
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,400
So context independent constraints don't don't create complexity.

296
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,280
Once you have a a a space of possibilities with a certain in

297
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,640
homogeneity in it, then I think complex dependent constraints can kick in.

298
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,800
My question is, well, why do they show up?

299
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,320
Why do context independent constraints appear?

300
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:45,760
And I'm wondering whether, again, the boundary conditions, if if if the clumps

301
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:56,360
are dense enough and they can't move much, then do accidental linkages?

302
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,280
The indeterminism, are you hinting at indeterminism in the universe?

303
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:10,000
Even the bumps and jostlings of regular Brownian motion, that if if there, I always

304
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
try to ground what I say in in heart sciences.

305
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,160
And I always end up going back to things like the Bernard cells and the BZ reaction.

306
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Otherwise, I'm very worried that philosophers will be accused of flights of

307
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,800
fancy that are not grounded in anything scientific.

308
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,360
And so I keep thinking, all right, so you've got Bernard cells and a pan of

309
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,720
water heated uniformity from below and at a certain threshold of non-equilibrium,

310
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,840
in other words, at a certain gradient, correct?

311
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,480
Yep.

312
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,360
The status quo cannot be maintained.

313
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,520
In other words, conduction cannot be maintained.

314
00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:03,600
And so the system flips to linking individual water molecules into local perturbation.

315
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,280
But if that gets amplified by the conditions, then it becomes a self

316
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,000
reinforcing feedback loop.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,160
And that's, I think, where you see the context dependent constraint kicking in.

318
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:25,320
That then the linkages create standalone units.

319
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,800
Almost like when you're playing hangman.

320
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,600
You know, we know that instinctively, because if we have towards the end of a

321
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,080
word that we don't know what that is, a T and then an I, well, there are two more to go.

322
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,880
Well, it's either going to be NG or ON, because these form like standalone

323
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:54,120
units, because they, the context dependence concatenates and becomes a standalone unit.

324
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,280
And now you've got in language, you'd have a phony, right?

325
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,000
But in, that's what a laser is.

326
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,640
A laser is context dependent constraints of a whole bunch of photon streams getting

327
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,800
linked together in a way that they become a standalone entity with emergent properties.

328
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,200
Yeah.

329
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,520
So you're talking about, and you just mentioned why you use these examples,

330
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,320
because they're less dangerous, I suppose, because they're in some

331
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,880
sense simpler, more, I'm going to say low dimensional, because they're like from physics.

332
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
So it feels more comfortable.

333
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,400
Maybe that's a way to say it, but you do venture into these more, you know,

334
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,880
like biological systems in the book.

335
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,040
And one of the questions I had for you is, so I'm glad that you're sometimes

336
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,920
pausing just a little bit before you say causality or something.

337
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, I always do.

338
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah.

339
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,400
Because that's where immediately a physicist will say, no, that's not causality.

340
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,800
Yeah, right, right.

341
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, then like, and then I don't know what's going on in your head if you're

342
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,200
searching for a different term, because, or, you know, alternative types of terms,

343
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,880
because, you know, reading your book, and one of the reasons why I need to

344
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,280
revisit it multiple times.

345
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,880
And I look forward to it is just because things feel so new to me and the

346
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,760
terminology so new that I don't feel like they don't feel comfortable, right?

347
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,960
So I'm trying to think like, how do I apply this term?

348
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,360
And how does this concept interact with this kind of constraint?

349
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
And they're interlocking in dependencies.

350
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,080
And how do I think about applied to the brain?

351
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,960
And so what I'm wondering is, are these going to feel, you're the expert.

352
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,440
How do these feel super comfortable to you?

353
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,200
Just switching and thinking about these things, interacting and the different modalities?

354
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,400
I wish I had made, I had coined the term enabling constraints.

355
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,280
It goes back to Patty, Howard Patty, and a whole bunch of these biologists who

356
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,760
talked several of whose books have the same similar title hierarchy theory.

357
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:01,680
And it's because the enabling constraint is able to create a self-organization that

358
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,600
can then also embed in the next higher up level of constraints.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,760
So I particularly want to use the notion of enabling constraints as constraints that

360
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,360
enable the formation of a more complex dynamic.

361
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,320
And that is, and how does that relate to a limiting constraint?

362
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,640
Contrast that with a limiting?

363
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,120
That would be the, I think we tend to use the term constraint, especially in physics

364
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,840
and in mechanical engineering, especially as limiting, as closing off options.

365
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,920
But the biologists tend to use them very often as factors, conditions, feedback

366
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,560
loops, catalysts.

367
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,560
See, the nice thing about the notion of a catalyst, two things, a lot of things.

368
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,800
One is it spans chemistry and biology.

369
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:04,080
And even in so-and-so as a catalyst of change, and we say that of people.

370
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,760
So it's used in that sense, but also because a catalyst is conserved.

371
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,840
It does not use up any energy of its own.

372
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,600
And so what I like about that notion is that it's a causal factor.

373
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,200
It's a causal, it's an influencer.

374
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,640
That is not in the efficient causality mode.

375
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,160
So are feedback loops.

376
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,880
And the thing about a feedback loop, which I love, is that for eons, since I was on

377
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,320
that never change, the idea of something creating itself or feeding back on itself

378
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
to change itself was forbidden, was verboten.

379
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,920
Because, again, from Aristotle's notion, then it would have to be before and after itself.

380
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,400
It would have to be before itself is caused.

381
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,360
It would have to be after itself is caused.

382
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,080
Oh, no, you can't have that.

383
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:13,840
The notion of simultaneous causality does not allow for parts interacting to produce

384
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:22,320
holes that have emergent properties, which then simultaneously loop back down and

385
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,480
constrain the parts of which the hole is made up.

386
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,000
And so that's why I love the notion of feedback loops and catalysts in particular.

387
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,520
But then I think once that hole coalesces, then you've got stabilizing

388
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,040
constraints, because it has to hold together for a persistent length of time.

389
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,800
Because unlike neuroequilibrium thermodynamics, the thing doesn't fall apart.

390
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,760
The thing about these Ben-Arts cells is that while the conditions hold, it holds

391
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,840
together despite changes at the component level.

392
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,080
Perturbations, yeah.

393
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,200
So fluctuations, internal fluctuations and perturbations, it has a metastability, which

394
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,400
I also like, which is different from thermal equilibrium of classical

395
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,360
neuroequilibrium thermodynamics.

396
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,920
While the thing holds, it has a stabilizing power to stabilize the

397
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,320
constraint regime as a whole.

398
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
And what is it?

399
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
You say it has a stabilizing power.

400
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,720
That's the whole.

401
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,400
What is the dynamic constraint regime that constitutes a Ben-Arts cell?

402
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,720
A Ben-Arts cell is not a thing other than the water molecules that make it up.

403
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Or the constraints that go into establishing the conditions that make it up.

404
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,640
The boundary conditions as context-independent constraints.

405
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,320
And then the linkages of the molecules.

406
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,760
Yeah.

407
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,520
Right?

408
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,040
Yeah.

409
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,240
Yeah, it's just so hard to think of across scales, these myriological.

410
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,480
Yes, it's extremely difficult to think across scale, because we tend to think

411
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,920
in terms of efficient cause across scale.

412
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,440
Yeah.

413
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,400
And all of these biologists was, I always wondered for a long time, why did these

414
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,800
biologists like Stan Salti, Howard Patti, a lot of them started talking about

415
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,480
semiotics and semiosm, why did they ever get into this?

416
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,160
And it finally dawned on me because the relationship between levels of

417
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,880
organization and Herbert Simon knew this.

418
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,040
The near decomposability.

419
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,840
Relations of constraint, they're not relations of energetic exchange, right?

420
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,960
So the higher level is a form of constraint on the possibility space of

421
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,840
the lower level.

422
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,560
So it doesn't let it veer off and disintegrate.

423
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,560
It's interesting the word integrity.

424
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,000
It's beautifully here because it just holds it together.

425
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,640
Yeah.

426
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,760
So when I think of top-down constraints, those are limiting because they hold

427
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,200
that possibility space within a dynamic range.

428
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,520
And so the thing holds, an organism holds together.

429
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:26,120
Our metabolism might change, a spleen might be removed, a goldbladder might be

430
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,000
removed with a constraint regime holds.

431
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,760
Can you name something that is not an emergent property of something else?

432
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,240
Oh, culture.

433
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,480
Culture is not an emergent property?

434
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
Culture is an emergent property.

435
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:40,840
Do you want me to-

436
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,680
No, can you name something that's not an emergency?

437
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,200
Oh, quantity is emergent, but it's not an interesting emergence.

438
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,160
Okay.

439
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,040
So that's fine.

440
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,160
No, thank you.

441
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,280
That's a good point.

442
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,440
When I think of emergent properties, the emergent properties that I'm interested

443
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:08,120
in are qualitatively different properties that affect the behavior of the component

444
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,320
level so that that qualitative property continues in effect.

445
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,080
That's why homeostasis, I think of as an emergent property that has interesting

446
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,040
features, because it controls the goings-on at the lower level such that homeostasis

447
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,080
homostatic balance holds.

448
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Whereas a whole bunch of pile of debris in my backyard.

449
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,520
It's still emergent with respect to-

450
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,240
Balance.

451
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,040
Balance.

452
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,440
Is what?

453
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,960
Science.

454
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,520
It's bigger.

455
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Well, it's bigger, but if you throw a bowling ball into it, it would be harder to move

456
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,160
than if you just had one piece of debris out there, right?

457
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,280
Well, that's true, but it does not change the characteristics of any of the-

458
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,000
There's no top-down.

459
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,480
There's no-

460
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,800
All right.

461
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,680
There's no top-down.

462
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,840
See, that's what's been driving my thinking for 20-some years, right?

463
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,800
And that is, how can you explain top-down causality without falling victim or making the mistakes of

464
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,920
and all that other stuff?

465
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,760
And that's what I think complex dynamical systems gives me.

466
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:28,040
And I think the rise of ecology in the last 25 years has helped enormously,

467
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,440
because we used to think, oh, well, we can kill off the plank, then that's not a big deal.

468
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,840
Right.

469
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,640
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,360
Correct?

471
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,000
And the thing is the understanding that it may mess up the constraint regime that holds the whole

472
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:56,520
thing together is the idea that there are systemic properties that really affect the components.

473
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,920
I think that's gone a long way to making us aware of top-down,

474
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,480
in a respectable scientific way.

475
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,160
On the other hand, one of the features of complex self-organizing systems is their robustness.

476
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,280
So if you did kill off all the mosquitoes, we might be okay.

477
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,760
I suspect, though, I think robustness means that they degrade gracefully.

478
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,200
I like that.

479
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:36,440
That it doesn't fall apart the way if you break the axle on a bicycle that will try to go whatever.

480
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,040
That will just, the thing won't work at all.

481
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,120
It seems as though complex dynamical systems, far from equilibrium,

482
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,240
they get a bit out of kilter, but they continue to work for a fair amount of time until then it

483
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,520
reaches its level of instability that that constraint regime cannot hold.

484
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,720
New phase change coming up.

485
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,680
And you get an entirely new phase change that falls apart.

486
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,720
So I suspect that if we killed off all the mosquitoes,

487
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,080
we do not know what might enter that, that open niche now.

488
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,560
Right. Yeah. Well, there's been all sorts of disasters with introducing

489
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,080
a non-native species to kill off one thing.

490
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,440
It turns out they're invasive.

491
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,440
Exactly. I suspect we've got to be careful because of that kind of problem.

492
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,640
Before the thing falls apart, you might have some really nasty surprises that you didn't expect.

493
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,120
Hey, you mentioned homeostasis and again, we're going to jump around.

494
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,360
But I had Henry Yin on and I've had a few other people on who talk about the brain

495
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,880
more as a control system than necessarily a complex system that we need to think about

496
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,800
things more in sort of the old cybernetics way of a control system.

497
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,200
However, the set point of our thermometer is not set externally.

498
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,960
We're setting our own set point, right?

499
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,000
So homeostasis is in certain bounds.

500
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Well, that's what I was going to ask you about.

501
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,680
How do you think, rather, about when we're setting our internal desired temperature,

502
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,000
let's say, that we need to be around 98.6?

503
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,680
How do you think about that?

504
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,040
Where does that set point come from?

505
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,920
Bottom up, top down, or is it just the-

506
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,200
I think everything, not only comes up, bottom up, top down, but

507
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,880
pass forward.

508
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,440
I think-

509
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,560
Pass forward, environment and-

510
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,240
We forget temporal constraints as well.

511
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:38,440
For example, folks up in the Himalayas and in the Andes have a whole different

512
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,080
oxygen hemoglobin.

513
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,360
Capacity.

514
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,880
Capacity and characteristic because of centuries of adaptability, millennia of adaptability.

515
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,080
So we forget temporal constraints as well, right?

516
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,440
It seems as though the same temperature in the fall feels colder than it does in the spring,

517
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,280
because by the time we get to the spring, we've had a whole winter.

518
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,120
So I think it's multi-dimensional, multi-scalar,

519
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,840
temporally, I think we forget time.

520
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,920
And all of these complex dynamical systems, I remember a phrase of Prigogenes,

521
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,720
I was fortunate enough to meet him a couple of times, and I've never seen this

522
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,040
written down, but he used to use that phrase more than once in person.

523
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,440
They carry their history on their back.

524
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,240
Oh, I like that.

525
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
I love that phrase.

526
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:48,040
In other words, their very dynamical architecture and characteristics embody,

527
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,640
and that's where the 4E is coming, embody the conditions under which they were created,

528
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,320
evolved and so on.

529
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,240
His examples were snowflakes.

530
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,840
They might have all started with the same, but over the time that they fell to earth,

531
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:10,440
they, their actual architecture changes to embody the temperature, the pressure,

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:19,480
the, all the atmospheric conditions through which they modified themselves and adapted

533
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,880
and until they reached the ground.

534
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:29,000
So I think that's true for us as well, for body temperature, for body states.

535
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:36,120
I'm, I'm fascinated by that whole notion of inflammation, all the, all these set points

536
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:46,360
that I think, in a sense, those mark the parameters of what you might call the constraint dome.

537
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
You know, we've got the proteome.

538
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
Oh, there it is.

539
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,720
There's the word, the constraint dome.

540
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,040
I just, I just, I was reading proteome and epigenome and stuff.

541
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Well, you know, we need a constraint dome.

542
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,680
We do.

543
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,800
Well, that's all in your book.

544
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,760
The constraint dome is it.

545
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,840
Yeah, but I don't, I've never occurred to me to use that phrase, which I like,

546
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,360
because it's a whole bunch of them together at once.

547
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,800
Right.

548
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,280
Right.

549
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,360
That's the problem and sort of just mentally trying to imagine these things.

550
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,960
But real quick, you know, you mentioned temporal constraints, but in a sense,

551
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,920
this is a question, all or most constraints are temporal in nature because a constraint is,

552
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,560
by definition, slower than the process that it's constrained.

553
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,200
Like a catalyst, right, is more stable than the reaction that it's catalyzing and that's,

554
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,960
so it can act as a constraint.

555
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,760
Correct.

556
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,440
But then the cells which enable the tissues, the cell dynamics, which enable the tissues,

557
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:58,520
that's faster than the, than the, so, so you have a whole bunch of, so therefore,

558
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,920
what's important are the interfaces between the levels of organization.

559
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,480
And what are the, what are the constraints that govern those interfaces?

560
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:18,040
And we would call them what, codes, rules, laws, but local, but local, very, oftentimes very local,

561
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,400
right?

562
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Right.

563
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,480
Well, that's so, okay, there's this, a lot of the physical laws, like, like, you know,

564
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,320
the notion of a force, right?

565
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,000
For some reason, well, when you think about it, it's, it doesn't make any sense.

566
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,280
But for some reason, when you grow up with it in physics classes and you think, oh,

567
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,440
force, I know what a force is, but when you really think about it, it becomes very unnatural,

568
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,520
like saying the same word over and over and you lose its meaning.

569
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:48,200
Are these ideas going to seem as natural to me, eventually, as the concept of a force,

570
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,360
which is, it turns out, a slippery idea also?

571
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,800
I would hope so, but that's what I'm always worried about, about neologisms and, and I

572
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,120
worried about using the word constraint, but it seemed as though it was...

573
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,160
What else would you call it?

574
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,840
Better than a cause, because as if I, if I use the word cause, then the assumption that

575
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,480
that has to be energetic transfer, that's almost a, that's a losing battle.

576
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,440
That's why.

577
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:23,960
So I don't know what else to cause, call it, but to think in terms of enabling constraints is bottom

578
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,800
up that, that within certain boundary, within certain context independent frameworks, they

579
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:42,680
can generate emergent properties, which in turn operate as second order top down context

580
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,880
dependent constraints, if you will.

581
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,360
It's easier to just call a constraint regime.

582
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,560
Yeah.

583
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,600
Okay, regime to the word.

584
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:56,760
Hold the, the components together so that they continue to satisfy the emergent properties

585
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,240
of the whole.

586
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,040
Do you feel like we'll, we will be able to write a constraint cookbook to generate dynamical

587
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,840
complex systems that we want to generate eventually?

588
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:18,200
If we think of it as formal systems, the way we used to where you would have a universal law,

589
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,680
yeah, Newton's laws of motion.

590
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,160
And I think my answer is no, because if I'm emphasizing context dependence,

591
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:36,760
those laws would be what car popper would call, well, yeah, those applies to, to a normal science.

592
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:45,400
But evolution to a whole new constraint structure, to a whole new constraint regime,

593
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,360
such as the transition, I would say, from physics to chemistry, chemistry to biology,

594
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,480
biology to psychology first, or sociology first, or whatever you want to call it,

595
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,160
and on and on and on, that requires a whole new constraint regime.

596
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:08,200
It's a, it's a, it's a topological nightmare, nightmare and transition.

597
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,160
You know what's interesting?

598
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,920
Prigazine detested catastrophe theory.

599
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,440
And I never understood why.

600
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,080
This idea that Peter Allen, who worked with him for, with Prigazine for a long time,

601
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,280
you know Peter Allen's work?

602
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,200
Peter Allen, really nice work.

603
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,040
He's retired now from Cranfield in England.

604
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,800
But he did a lot of work with Prigazine in Brussels at the Free University.

605
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:45,080
And the idea that the transition from independent photon streams to a laser,

606
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,280
the transition from a independent water molecules to a benign cell,

607
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,520
the transition from a whole bunch of chemical transformations to a living organism,

608
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:05,960
is a, is akin to a, to a bifurcation, to a topological bifurcation,

609
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,800
that you have entirely new coordinates that apply at this new level.

610
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,920
That to me gives

611
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,360
reality to emergent properties.

612
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,640
Oh, ontologically real?

613
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,600
Oh, I, I wanted to say ontologically real.

614
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay, that's dangerous.

615
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,960
I don't have to worry about, about tenure.

616
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,520
So I don't have to worry about, about retreating to epistemology

617
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,560
where the going gets stuff.

618
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,720
So well, you know, that's our models.

619
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,440
And that's the way we make sense of information overload.

620
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,040
And so, no, damn it.

621
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,600
I want to say they are, they are ontologically real.

622
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,360
That, that the constraint regime that holds a benign cell together

623
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,600
or a culture together or a laser together.

624
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,280
Are real.

625
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,040
They are not stuff.

626
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,160
They are not things.

627
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,080
I certainly don't want to reify them.

628
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:09,240
But I don't see why we don't allow the dynamical interdependencies,

629
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,600
which is all these constraint regimes are, right?

630
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,280
They are, they are interlocking interdependencies.

631
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,480
I thought, I thought reify meant make real.

632
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh, well, yeah, sure.

633
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,080
Part of it, but, but then only stuff, stuff is real.

634
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,960
Oh, okay.

635
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,440
Okay.

636
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,480
So therefore process is our real process.

637
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,800
That's why Whitehead rails against the reification

638
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,880
because he emphasized that processes are real.

639
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,600
And I want to say, and the constraints that keep processes

640
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,520
within a certain space, face space are also real.

641
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,400
They are as real as the face space they are kept into.

642
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,080
Which one do you give, do you give more credence to processes

643
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,560
or are you a process philosopher, so to speak?

644
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,360
Good question.

645
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,160
You know, dynamical systems theory seems to place

646
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,240
and if nothing else equal to the links as the nodes.

647
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,200
Yeah.

648
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,920
The question of whether the nodes or condensates,

649
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,280
Mark Bergauer uses that term, the condensates of links

650
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,120
of a lot of stable linkages.

651
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,240
Oh, that's cool.

652
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:31,480
And the nodes as stable condensates, no, as nodes are condensates

653
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,440
of stable links or those that happen very often and so on.

654
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,120
So it's hard to say, in this new book, I stick my neck out

655
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,480
because I did not realize that there's still a question

656
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,080
about exactly what covalent bonds are.

657
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,200
Oh, yeah.

658
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,720
I think when you dig into any established thing,

659
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,400
there's, we realize, yeah.

660
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,880
There you go.

661
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,760
And the interconversion of matter and energy certainly says,

662
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,720
well, you know, so is a material thing simply the condensate

663
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:12,120
of a bunch of constrained energy forces, links and constraints,

664
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,440
or are the forces and the links, the manifestation

665
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,800
or the behavior of the, then if relativity theory is correct,

666
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,560
which I'm assuming, then it doesn't matter.

667
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,920
They're interconvertebral, right?

668
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,360
But again, they're very local.

669
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,640
See, I want to, I was thinking, how on earth can I argue for a local science?

670
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,640
I'm going to be laughed out of the room if I argue for a local science.

671
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,480
But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?

672
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

673
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,360
I have a sweet spot in my heart for Bill Wimsat, even though I've never met him,

674
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,400
because I learned that he, I don't know who told me or how I'd learned about it.

675
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,480
He was on the committee that approved my first paper.

676
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Oh, oh.

677
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,760
His action theory rests on a mistake.

678
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:15,160
And so I think that I published that first paper so many years ago.

679
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:15,720
Wow, that's awesome.

680
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,240
I think Wimsat is fact, you know, and that brings in the notion of explanation, how

681
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,280
he's been arguing that sometimes explanations look upwards, not just downwards.

682
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,240
Why?

683
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:35,720
Because if you do believe that there are emergent properties and they are causally constrained.

684
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
With the eye roll, folks, who are only messing with me.

685
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,280
Exactly.

686
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:48,680
Then you have to be able to make reference in any complete explanation to its influence

687
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,680
as well as to the influence of the bottom up components, which is the way we tend to,

688
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,040
we always look downwards.

689
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:56,840
Yeah.

690
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,960
And let me tell you, I think the reason folks like David Chalmers and Company,

691
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,600
all this business about psycho, panpsychism.

692
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,040
Panpsychism, yeah.

693
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,280
I think what's driving that is that any time you find top down causality, you cannot much

694
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,400
deny, that's got to be mental.

695
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,800
Well, let's put it differently.

696
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,520
It's got to be top down and it's a constraint regime influencing its components.

697
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:38,120
But I don't want to say that they're just as chemical properties are emergent for physical,

698
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,320
biological properties are emergent from chemical, psychic properties are emergent

699
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,640
at a certain level of organization.

700
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:53,000
I don't want to say that that emergent property way up at the psychic level also exists.

701
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,120
I really don't want to say the Bernard cell is thinking.

702
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,920
Or is conscious or is aware.

703
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,920
But I do want to say there is a top down phenomenon.

704
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,720
I think I suspect that a lot of what's driving the panpsychic.

705
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,920
What would we call it?

706
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,240
Fad?

707
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,240
I hope so.

708
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,280
I cannot imagine that anybody's taking tears.

709
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,560
I think it's a, it's a, that's all I can do.

710
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,880
Let's call it paradigm to give it a little more credence than fad.

711
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,920
I don't want to get in trouble, Alicia.

712
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:42,360
Okay, I have to talk about that.

713
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,080
I just spoke at the theory of consciousness conference in Taramina this past spring.

714
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,480
And I suddenly realized I said the same thing I talked about.

715
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,440
I talked with that conference in Antwerp 20 some years ago.

716
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,760
And I was left out of the rule 20 some years ago.

717
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,560
Oh, wow.

718
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,320
I was talking about constraints and dynamical systems and so on.

719
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,120
Going, now interesting, you get a lot of this talk about constraints.

720
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,680
Say, I mean, people were talking a lot about constraints.

721
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,800
What is the lesson from that?

722
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,480
Because you've stuck to your guns and did you just brush that off your back?

723
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,440
And this is an aside, it's more of a personal question, you know,

724
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,120
because a lot of people face laughter or dismissal.

725
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,480
Well, I wasn't literally left out, but I was ignored.

726
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,080
And nobody asked me questions and they just said it's the equivalent.

727
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,960
People were polite.

728
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,240
Maybe they didn't understand it.

729
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,800
Well, I didn't explain it clearly.

730
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:44,360
But I think it was just, it didn't fit the standard bottom up identity theory

731
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,760
or supervenience theory, which was what was popular at the time,

732
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,920
or eliminatism, I never can say, at the time.

733
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,360
So it was ignored just as, I hate to say it, absolutely.

734
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,680
You know, Bill Bechtel, who's a nice guy and he's very good.

735
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,040
He's a new mechanist.

736
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,680
He's a mechanisms all the way proponent.

737
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,880
Well, if you look at his mechanics, they've sort of changed.

738
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,440
And he came to Cuba, he and Adele came to Cuba with me in a conference

739
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,600
I organized in Havana years ago.

740
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,800
And I think his mechanism is not your grandmother's mechanism.

741
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,200
That's true.

742
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,640
But he's adapted, like you just said.

743
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,640
But it's sort of like, come on, Bill, just acknowledge complex, dynamical.

744
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,080
Can't do it.

745
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,040
It's kind of, yeah.

746
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,080
Well, it's hard to change your mind when you've done it so wrong.

747
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,720
Yeah.

748
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,760
You mentioned explanation a few minutes ago.

749
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,120
So in dynamics and action, I think the last chapter or the next last chapter,

750
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,400
you make a call for the necessity of explaining these sorts of myriological

751
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,480
interactions in terms of hermeneutics or a narrative story.

752
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,720
And in this newer book, I think I searched and I think hermeneutics was in there maybe once or

753
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,200
twice.

754
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,640
But you also talk, you bring up the idea of order parameters, which are kind of like

755
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,600
these hyperparameters of dynamical systems.

756
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,560
So I'm wondering where you stand in terms of explanation.

757
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,240
My original thought was, well, if I could just list all the constraints and the

758
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,200
types of constraints and how they're interacting, is that an explanation?

759
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,640
Do I need a narrative story?

760
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,240
Are these order parameters?

761
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:35,640
What would satisfy me or a reviewer of a paper as an explanation of some cognitive

762
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,880
function, for example?

763
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,000
Well, I used the term hermeneutics.

764
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,200
Another eye roll.

765
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,680
Another eye roll.

766
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:44,920
Yeah.

767
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:51,400
I mean, I don't like neologism, although that hermeneutics goes back to biblical

768
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,360
existence.

769
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,600
Right.

770
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,680
Well, that's, yeah, when you look it up, it's all about the Bible.

771
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,160
But your point was to go across levels.

772
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,680
You really need to account for these things.

773
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,120
And narrative might be the only way to do that.

774
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,760
Gertz's notion that I borrowed that back then from Cliff Gertz, who almost defined

775
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,560
her hermeneutics and said, it's kind of like sailing.

776
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,040
You have to tack from the very global to the very local, back to the global, back to

777
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,360
the local, and see how all these constraints interact and change each other.

778
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,560
And I love also the notion of mutual constraint satisfaction, which is what I think is happening.

779
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:30,680
I think probably narrative does a way better job of accomplishing that

780
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,560
than a Hempel and Oppenheimer, Hempel and Oppenheimer,

781
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,920
deductive, nomological model.

782
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,920
So to that extent, I don't think I've changed my tune.

783
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,400
I just, I'm not using the notion of narrative.

784
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:58,680
When somebody nowadays says, Proust's Madeline's, you bring up the whole constraint regime of the

785
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,440
culture of his history, of his childhood, of his experience, that to me is almost like an

786
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:13,160
order of parameter. It's a parameter in that it is the intersection of a whole bunch of different

787
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:21,160
independent variables that together give you a whole tapestry of a whole different face,

788
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,960
possibility space. Could you think of a concept as a constraint?

789
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,560
I think I certainly think of a concept of a constraint and a framework, a cognitive framework

790
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:39,320
being a whole tapestry of concepts. But in such as cognitive, it's emotional.

791
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:47,560
I mean, think of, think of, think of all faction. And all faction does not

792
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:59,400
go directly to the cortex initially, right? But I think a concept has a lot of

793
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,680
characteristics that are important. One is they're multiply realizable.

794
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,680
That's a big theme in your book.

795
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,440
That's a big theme in my book because a triangle or triangularity as a concept

796
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,800
is multiply realizable. It's not a one-to-one

797
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:25,080
capture of the individual physical features of one instance. And I think that we know the child

798
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:32,600
is able to, has understood the concept when they're able to apply that concept to an instance they

799
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,120
haven't seen before or they were not taught about. So I think that's extremely important.

800
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:47,960
I think what a local constraint regime does is it captures a type, what philosophers used to call

801
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:58,280
types and universals, or a concept or what we would call an emotion. Not this emotion now here.

802
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,320
An emotion, yeah.

803
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:09,400
You know, this type of emotion. It's a bunch of constraint regimes that can be identified

804
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:23,880
with a term like fear or anger or pleasure or avoid an approach. All these are code terms.

805
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,400
To that extent, the reductions, they're code terms, but they do capture something very real.

806
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,000
And that is a whole complex constraint regime.

807
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,040
That kind of swirls around this, let's say, fear or something. It takes with it, you know,

808
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,880
fight or flight, et cetera. And it's almost like a process that is itself kind of condensated to

809
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,760
use your term earlier, but still a process and brings with it, carries with it on its back

810
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,200
its history and all of the things associated with it.

811
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,720
Correct, correct, correct.

812
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:04,120
Yeah. Okay, so I didn't tell you this. And I know we're jumping around. I actually

813
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,880
elicited a few guest questions from previous guests. The first one I'm going to play for you,

814
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:17,080
and this is kind of kind of maybe segue into a conversation about minds and brains and then

815
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,840
later AI. The first one I'm going to play to you is from Kevin Mitchell. I'm going to have him

816
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:28,440
back on the podcast in a couple of weeks about his new book, Agents, Free Agents,

817
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,640
How Free Well Gave Us Agency.

818
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,160
Okay, so I'm just going to play this to you, make sure that you can hear it.

819
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,640
Hi, Alicia. This is Kevin Mitchell. I really loved your new book, which very clearly lays out the

820
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,920
case that constraints are causes. That is that the way things are organized is every bit as much of

821
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:50,920
a cause of how they evolve through time as the basic laws and forces of physics. In particular,

822
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,680
you highlight the really key idea of enabling constraints, especially in hierarchical systems,

823
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,400
that organizing the elements at one level can enable new kinds of properties to emerge at higher

824
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,960
levels. You say in chapter 16 that emergent properties and powers were not merely waiting to

825
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,640
be revealed. They are genuine creations of path dependent, multiple constraint satisfaction.

826
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,560
And I wanted to push back on that a little and suggest that, in fact, many of the organizations

827
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:24,920
we see in living organisms and design systems are there because of some functionality.

828
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,480
They serve a useful purpose, and that many such functional motifs or architectures

829
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:35,480
are in fact waiting to be revealed. Under this view, a lot of the design work done by evolution

830
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:41,560
is actually an exploration of a kind of platonic design space, followed by retention of useful

831
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:47,960
motifs rather than a real creation de novo. So I wonder what you make of that notion. Thanks.

832
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,360
All right, so that was a long one, but did you get it all?

833
01:00:52,360 --> 01:01:01,080
Yes, I think I got it all. That's a heck of a question, because I think logically, of course,

834
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:11,400
there is a platonic, maybe undercurrent. But in fact, I think I'm more like Aristotle did not

835
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:19,960
believe that Plato's forms existed in a transcendental realm. And I want to stay agnostic about

836
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,400
that. But I certainly want to say that they are embodied and revealed and acted upon

837
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,960
in virtue of the confluence of these constraints occurring at a particular moment, at a particular

838
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,880
time. Locally. You know, I think I used to think of myself more as a platonist when I remember

839
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:49,720
getting into philosophy. And I got into philosophy because back in the day, a lot of schools allowed

840
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,120
you to, if you were not a science or math major or engineering major, you could substitute a

841
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,680
symbolic logic course for math requirement as one of your requirements. Anything to get rid of,

842
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:08,680
not to do math, which I am sorry, I did. But when I took the first philosophy course, it was like

843
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:15,080
discovering a whole new platonic world. It was like, you know, if I'd taken another history course,

844
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,240
yeah, you know, it's another king, another queen, another war, another this. But this was like a

845
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:24,760
whole new floor in a building that I'd never seen before. That's that kind of transformation.

846
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:33,640
But more and more, I want to kind of remain grounded and rooted to

847
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:45,800
natural phenomena. So I really want to naturalize my arguments and speculating about a platonic

848
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:53,000
transcendental realm. Well, he said a kind of platonic. He hedged a little bit. Well, if that's

849
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:02,360
the case, then I'm perfectly happy with his book that way. So that what is the kind? Well,

850
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:09,000
in Aristotle's case, it's the Aristotle believed in forms. It's just that he believed in embodied

851
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:17,880
forms and forms as they were. And so what I want to say is that they are created by this confluence

852
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:26,120
of constraints. My main concern is to make sure that they are taken seriously such that

853
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,560
meaning is taken seriously. In other words, the unembedding

854
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:42,520
organizational level gives meaning to the components. The amount of

855
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:52,680
glucose in a fudge brownie that I can eat and not get sick is given meaning by what my homeostasis

856
01:03:52,680 --> 01:04:01,160
metabolism is operating as. Well, yeah, you're okay now, but don't do it very often kind of thing.

857
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:08,200
So that meaning is the multiple realizability of the ambiguous

858
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:17,480
aspect being disambiguated by context. But but not not and I use the word context very deliberately.

859
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:23,880
I don't want to use context to mean any old environment. I want to mean the environment

860
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:30,920
in which a system is embedded and from which it has drawn some of its context is enabling constraints

861
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:43,400
and in terms of which it implements its stabilizing or top down constraints. So so

862
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:52,680
I want to say these are these are new and the properties are real so that

863
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:04,840
yes, superconductivity and a laser has brand new properties that are real. Did they exist in a

864
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:10,600
pre existing platonic realm? I don't think I want to speculate on that. I'm perfectly happy

865
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:17,960
so long and to me real means it has causal power. It has some kind of it makes it makes a difference.

866
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:25,480
If it's any phenomenal, you know, then I don't that kind of emergence. Yeah, weak emerges that

867
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,400
kind of mergers doesn't interest me that much. Okay, I don't want to speak for Kevin, but

868
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,880
kind of reformulating his question, you know, a lot of what you and the field and dynamical

869
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,120
systems theories talks about is these state spaces and when you're on a dynamical like when

870
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:46,440
you're on a trajectory within the state space, you can visit different areas within the state

871
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,000
space, not all of them and the constraints constrain where you can visit in the state

872
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,360
space, right? But if you I wonder if that that kind of platonic realm that Kevin is alluding to

873
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,840
is you can think of it as the state space that whether a state space is a real thing, right,

874
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,960
on a trajectory, later we can say that we can define the state space by the trajectory and the

875
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,960
boundary conditions of the possible values that it could have taken. But if it's not visiting

876
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,200
a particular area of the state space, would that and it did, would that then be a new thing?

877
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,520
Or would it be visiting a thing for which it already had a capacity for and thinking in terms

878
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:29,960
of like the functions that Kevin was talking about? I think that's what normal science is. Normal

879
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,880
science is the visiting of areas in a possibility space. It hadn't visited before, but it's pretty

880
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:44,680
much the same possibility space. I think that's development, biology. I think evolution. I think

881
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:52,840
there are times when it's the entire possibility space that is new. That's what I want to call

882
01:06:53,640 --> 01:07:00,840
a creative emergent characteristic. Is this related to Stuart Kaufman's adjacent possible idea?

883
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:09,880
Maybe. Whether we go step by step going from each adjacent possible or in the case of a

884
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,880
Bernard cell, it doesn't seem that it's adjacent possible. It seems as though there's a threshold

885
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:24,040
of instability on which you need to reorganize all the parameters, all the variables. Everything

886
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,640
acquires a different meaning because it's in a qualitatively different space.

887
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:37,720
It seems to me that's what happens, for example, a cell in a petri dish as opposed to a cell

888
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:51,160
within a tissue. It's a different qualitative phenomenon. It's the new possibility space

889
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:57,000
that I want to say is being created is an emergent quality. It's not just a new

890
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,960
corner in the existing possibility space. I'm perfectly happy going adjacent possible.

891
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,000
This is from Max Shine, who's been on the podcast. He calls himself a systems neurobiologist,

892
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,480
and he really tries to think across scales. A lot of his research is dealing with things

893
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:24,200
like how neuromodulation interacts with network level things. These things are hard to think about

894
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:31,880
and to research, obviously. Let me pull up this question. Hi, Alicia. This is Max Shine from

895
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,360
the University of Sydney. When we think about top-down constraints over bottom-up activity,

896
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,960
we often invoke concepts like the self. I can imagine myself being hungry and that will help

897
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,920
constrain the types of actions that I might take in order to find food and satiate my hunger.

898
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,120
There are a number of really fascinating situations, like the so-called flow state

899
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,080
and also states with pharmacological manipulation, when the sense of self can dissolve. Yet you

900
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,960
still see quite coherent cross-scale behavior. People don't just crumble into a heap. They can

901
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,720
still perform music and sports at a high level or have a nice walk through the forest. My question

902
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:15,560
is, do you view the sense of self as an illusion, or do you think of it just as one of many ways in

903
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:21,720
which a system that's organized across scales can be organized? Thanks. Max wants to know

904
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,840
whether his question was better than Kevin's. No, I'm just kidding. No, they're very good, both of

905
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:37,080
them. You know, I keep thinking how, with Gazaniga's experiments with the cut corpus callosum,

906
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:44,360
that there were a whole bunch of weird things like we discovered about somebody was shown an

907
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,920
image to the right eye, another image to the left eye, and people confabulated.

908
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,400
And so you wonder if in these cases where the self seems to dissolve,

909
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:05,400
there's nevertheless enough connectivity to maintain a coherent structure.

910
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,920
Structure being the self? What's the structure? Yes, I would say a dynamic, a whole dynamic

911
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:24,360
constraint that keeps being you. To a lesser example, I think people who sleep walk or who are

912
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:31,560
hypnotized will nevertheless not bump into the coffee table. They go around the coffee table.

913
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,520
But these could be sort of on the automatic side of behavior, right? So there's automatic and

914
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:43,240
controlled processes. Right, right. So that, well, but there is control enough that you walk and you

915
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:50,920
don't, you maintain an awareness. Right, but maybe the flow state would be, because Max mentioned the

916
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:56,200
flow state, when that is like when your automatic processes take over, but you still barely have

917
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,080
some sort of control and you're in a heightened, you're trying really hard and it kind of switches

918
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,720
and then you're watching yourself do it kind of. Yeah, yeah. And you wonder whether we can,

919
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:12,680
could that be a bit like these optical illusions where you can see one side and not the other?

920
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:21,080
And so to what extent do those constraints, to what extent do those levels of awareness

921
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:29,480
conflict with each other, can mutually support each other and reinforce each other or not?

922
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,680
Again, I think that the next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different

923
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,600
modes of constraint that are all operating simultaneously. As I started writing this,

924
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:51,960
all of a sudden things like entrenchment, like buffering, I have a whole chapter of where I

925
01:11:51,960 --> 01:12:01,080
catalog some of these buffering and entrenchment and scapholds and all of these that seem to

926
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:06,920
all be operating simultaneously and that certainly a lot of the social scientists have understood

927
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:13,960
very, very well. In public policy, oh look, have we entrenched this rule in regulation,

928
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:21,800
it will hang on for way longer and avoid any kind of attempts to remove it as a regulation that

929
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:30,920
I live in DC, that's why I think about it. And so you wonder, starting to map things in terms of

930
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:38,680
constraints, in terms of possibility spaces, might start to illustrate how all of these work and

931
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:48,280
the possibility of therapeutic intervention as a result because that's what all this recent talk

932
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:56,680
about psychedelics. No, you wonder to what extent a psychedelic literally disintegrates the

933
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:04,840
constraint regime of the self, of the pre-established coordinates and parameters and so on.

934
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:17,880
Exactly, the ego. You wonder to what extent that is a disruption of the constraint regime,

935
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:25,400
more than the disruption of vision or, yeah, vision too, you get maybe hallucinations,

936
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:31,480
but that's not as interesting as, you know, I go like that and I push my elbow, I can hallucinate

937
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,600
all these standard, optical illusions, we don't call them hallucinations, we call them optical

938
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,040
illusions, right? So at what point do we start looking at this and the answer is that's going

939
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:49,560
to take a lot of very interesting research, kind of like Ramachandran's famous example with the

940
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:56,280
phantom limb and the mirror and so on. How is that possible unless there is some

941
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:09,400
control regime that is modulating the sense of pain that incorporates, you know, I can imagine

942
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:15,000
being in an automobile accident and having my arm mangled or I hear these descriptions of these

943
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,680
IEDs and you know, picking up chalkboard scraping and things like that. Correct, correct, and so

944
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:26,200
you go, well, here's everything together because if you didn't have the visual input, if you didn't

945
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:31,400
have the conceptual understanding of what this means, on and on and on, you wonder if the pain

946
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:41,560
would be, would be different. And so how all of these constraint regimes interact and what are

947
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,640
the necessary inputs at each point to maintain that particular constraint regime so that then

948
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:56,280
you have a global sense of self that I'm not sure we're all that coherent when every in every day.

949
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,240
I don't feel coherent, but my wife would beg to differ.

950
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:07,800
Weird enough to be operating, but it's not like, you know, if I heard something horrible happening

951
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:16,840
outside, I wouldn't react and I even even in a sense of flow, I think there's enough cognitive

952
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:24,120
control that if some horrendous perturbation, the standard answer is you drive home and you

953
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,880
don't even know if you went through that red light or you don't because you drive home in that

954
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,920
and that path every day and you don't even think about it. But certainly if a child ran across

955
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:42,120
your front of the then you'd immediately get out of that flow and react. So there's how much

956
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:49,560
control in which case, how can we use it therapeutically for obsessive compulsive disorders,

957
01:15:49,560 --> 01:16:02,600
for PTSD, for all of these, I think those are all disorders disorders of constraint regimes. So

958
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:08,520
regulation of regulate, it's a it's the regulatory system that's shot, it's like the on switches

959
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:15,000
on all the time, or the it is modulating it the way it's supposed to modulate it. So these are

960
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:24,680
regulatory meaning constraint regime issues, not structure, not function. It's the regulatory

961
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:31,240
constraint regime that modulates these other two that that we don't understand that much about, I

962
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:41,400
think, all CD, PTSD, chronic anxiety or depression, all of these that are sort of I think we've pretty

963
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,080
much taken care of, no, we haven't taken care of it, but we understand how it worked the low

964
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:50,680
hanging fruit of the, you know, yeah, well, you know, the glucose is out of whack, that causes,

965
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:57,880
but where stress or epigenetic stress can be inherited several generations down,

966
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,840
that's a regulatory issue. Then that's what methylation does. And that's what I think

967
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,200
a lot of these constraint regimes do. So there's this phenomenon sort of piggybacking on what

968
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:13,240
Mac was asking about, there's this phenomena in psychedelics, right, you can use them

969
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:17,560
therapeutically. And in some cases, like near death experiences serve as therapeutic events,

970
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,280
and people come back kind of different, right? Correct. And is this a way to is one way to

971
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,360
imagine that, and maybe even electroshock therapy is another example, I'm not sure if that's a good

972
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:32,280
example, but yeah, yeah, you have all these kind of entrenched constraints locally in your brain

973
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,840
in your mind and operating things. And then when you so I'm sure you're aware of the psychedelic

974
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,640
study that when you administer psychedelics, often what happens is there's higher connectivity

975
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,520
in your brain, less modularity, right? And could could you maybe there's a speculation,

976
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:52,360
but would you think of that as just resetting all of the attractor states and then when they

977
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:56,520
come back up, they can come back in slightly different ways, they might not probably and it

978
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:03,960
might open up, it might make the interfaces more porous to contemporary experience. So

979
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:10,760
you don't have to be worried that the explosion is the IED, or that that that you don't have to

980
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:18,120
wash your hands a million times in order to because you know, yes, I think that the that more and

981
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:27,880
more as we read these kinds of novel forms of therapy that they are, they usually are targeting

982
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:38,680
issues of regulation. Really, to me, fascinating. Yeah, this is then starting to study how exactly

983
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:48,440
that connectiome stays stays whole. Strain dome connect, they all because all the connectome,

984
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:54,760
the proteomics and all the rest of them, all the ohms, all the ohms then are modulated by the whole

985
01:18:54,760 --> 01:19:03,000
constrained dome of the entire. But that also includes the constraints of your society. You

986
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,600
know, I love traveling to Europe. When I travel to Europe, the weight of history is very obvious

987
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:17,800
compared to the United States. You ask somebody at a restaurant in anywhere in Europe, and how do

988
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:26,120
you prepare this dish? Half of the time, it's the way it's always been prepared. Yeah. Whereas in

989
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,040
America, if you do it the same way as you did it six months ago, oh, you're stale, you're boring,

990
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,560
you're old, it's encouraged the constraint regime. Now, that's not to say that they're not all sorts

991
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:40,840
of problems for marginalized societies where the constraint regimes are very clearly kept and

992
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,880
trenched very deliberately. Yes, I understand that. But it's all a question of the constraint

993
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:51,240
coming from the culture as well. That's why in the four E's, the whole, for example, their emphasis

994
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:56,440
on affordances. This is the, so I don't know if we said earlier, this is like the inactive embodied,

995
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,240
what are the other two? The four E's. Anyways, embodied cognition. Correct. Yeah.

996
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:10,200
Embodied cognition, which Andy Clark and Paolo and even Merlin Dallen, where about when? Extended.

997
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:14,600
Extended embodied and acted. There we go. We got three out of four.

998
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:22,280
You know, I always say, I frankly do not think that a chair affords opportunities for seating for

999
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:28,840
a lot of people. You hear stories of folks from, I don't know which culture who were brought to

1000
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:36,040
the United States, and they will stand on the toilet because it didn't occur. And I don't think

1001
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:43,640
a tatami mat affords opportunities for sleeping for those of us who were not raised in a Japanese

1002
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:51,960
school. I mean, affordances are clearly embodied, embedded in the constraint of the society in which

1003
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,720
you grew up, or you know about. Embedded. You just said the fourth E. It's embedded. It is. Okay.

1004
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:05,080
And I think how things get, see, I don't think you have embeddedness in Newtonian science. Right.

1005
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:11,320
Things are just plunked into a featureless space and time in Newtonian science.

1006
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,240
Yeah. Well, that's the beauty of it too, because it's simplicity, right? It's

1007
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:22,600
spherical cows. It's in a vacuum. It's, yeah. Correct. But it's featureless. Whereas embeddedness

1008
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:29,880
is you're really embedded, meaning that embedding layer affects you,

1009
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:37,560
and you are a part of that embedding dynamic as well. It goes both ways.

1010
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,600
All right. I want to ask you, because we're coming up on time, and I have a thousand other things

1011
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,440
to ask you, but let's stay on brain and mind for just one more question here. And then I have some,

1012
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:51,400
I want to ask you about artificial intelligence and your thoughts on that. So thinking about

1013
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:59,320
dimensionality and going up in these a myriological level, right? So a lot of this modern neuroscience

1014
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,160
is reducing the dimensionality of your brain activity into these low dimensional manifold

1015
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,320
structures, and then the dynamics come in when you have a trajectory along that manifold.

1016
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,280
And a lot of some people think that that's, well, maybe that's the closest thing that we

1017
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:17,480
can get to right now in describing, in relating brains to minds. And then, but marrying that idea

1018
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:25,080
with the idea of capacity. And this goes back to Kevin Mitchell's question. What I want to think

1019
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,280
is that I'm not a low dimensional mind. I'm a, I have a high capacity, right? Is there a way,

1020
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,360
like, is there a story I can tell myself that I'm going from the high dimensionality

1021
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:41,640
brain activity that I have moving quote unquote up a level to mind? And that can, that's a messy

1022
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,400
statement I know. Can I increase my dimensionality? Do I have to reduce it?

1023
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:54,360
No, I think, for example, letters form words. I think of a word as

1024
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:05,160
a higher dimension. You can do more with those words. You have options available in words

1025
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,400
and keep going sentences. But that's certainly true for atoms, molecules.

1026
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,040
Is the higher dimension, does that, do you mean, is it a higher

1027
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,320
possibility space? Or is it, I guess that's kind of equated to higher dimensionality.

1028
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:27,720
Yeah, that's what I think of. It's a higher possibility space whose coordinates are relational.

1029
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:36,600
Okay. And if that's the case, then you have a way higher possibility space. So that's why,

1030
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:43,000
for example, the example I used in the book, which is Manté's understanding of how these chimps

1031
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:59,800
are able to understand. Because the possibility space they have forged is a task defined

1032
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:09,400
possibility space. But it's of a different type. Exactly. The type is simpler in that you have one

1033
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:16,200
concept of a type that captures all the way. You have to look at the colored dots, you have to

1034
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:23,960
look at the movement of the dots and so on. But it's the task that is defined. And the behavior is

1035
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:31,720
executed in terms of that task. Is that lower dimensional? I think it's way more sophisticated

1036
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:38,440
than it would just in terms of the intensity of the flash of light. But here the task is a huge

1037
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:49,320
constraint as well. Yes, but it's a much more complex dynamic than would be the physical

1038
01:24:49,400 --> 01:25:03,400
features alone, right? Yeah. So it's sometimes people say that complex systems are a simplified

1039
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,600
description of what's going on. Sometimes I think of it more like streamlined. Okay. The

1040
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:18,040
streamlining gives you characteristics that you wouldn't have otherwise. And so the organization

1041
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:24,040
of that monkey's brain in response to training, which would be the neighboring constraints.

1042
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:35,480
All right. It seems to me opens up a world for the monkey that may be captured by

1043
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:44,440
the essential characters of the task, but not of the pure physical component alone. So in that sense,

1044
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:50,520
I think of it as an expansion. Chemistry can do more than physics. Biology can do more than

1045
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:55,960
chemistry, even though they are nonetheless not violating any of the underlying laws. It's the

1046
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,920
organization and the complexity of that organization that opens up possibilities, I think.

1047
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:06,760
All right. So my mind could be more cool than my brain activity. I could feel better about my

1048
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:15,080
mind than my brain. Probably, yeah. Brain gets really... And I think that's true. I think as

1049
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:23,160
people age, they get worse at tasks that are just repetitive. Oh, I thought that's all they could

1050
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,880
do are tasks that are repetitive. But I think understanding connections and understanding

1051
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:35,400
nuances and things like that. Oh, I'm thinking way aged. You're thinking like our age, maybe.

1052
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,560
Well, I'm thinking of the difference between...

1053
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:50,600
I don't know. It's more like difference between understanding and just pure speed of activity.

1054
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,880
But my grandmother, who's 99, she cannot learn a new card game.

1055
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,440
Right? She can play bridge, but she can't learn a new card game. But that's 99.

1056
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,640
Yeah. So maybe that's even a different type.

1057
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,680
Any one or maybe she's not interested in it. Maybe. Come on, grandma.

1058
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,080
Yeah. But I see it's a different kind of understanding. I don't know. Would you call that

1059
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,720
wisdom? Well, hopefully, I think that's what philosophers were looking for. Yeah. And the

1060
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,720
question is, but I don't think it automatically happens as you get older. An awful lot of old

1061
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,360
fools around there. Sure are. Yeah. Sure are a lot of old fools out there.

1062
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,680
Okay, Alicia, I don't want to take all day for you. So I want to switch to artificial

1063
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,360
intelligence here for a few moments. Are you good on time for a few more minutes?

1064
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:40,920
Great. This is a lot of fun for me. No, me too. So I was actually kind of surprised

1065
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:45,160
in revisiting dynamics in action. And you go into it in a little more detail, I think,

1066
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:54,200
in context changes, everything that you refer to like neural network examples. And in both books,

1067
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,760
you talk about the semantics that come along with syntax when you put recurrence in these

1068
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:05,160
neural networks. And you cite Jeffrey Hinton and actually Michael Plout who or David Plout, who was

1069
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,400
one of the authors on that paper, I did a course with him. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

1070
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,240
But I always call them hidden plot and shallots because hidden and shallots probably plot and

1071
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:20,600
shallots are hidden. But they're that that I will go ahead and finish up. Anyway, again,

1072
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:25,160
I'm cute, but I shouldn't. Yeah. Well, so given what we've been talking about and, you know,

1073
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:31,560
these interlocking systems and how important that is for complexity and the constraints,

1074
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:37,880
given all that, I'm slightly surprised. And you talked about a constraint of closure from

1075
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,080
Massimo and me. Moreno and Massimo. Moreno and Massimo, which I love that book also.

1076
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,360
But that is very specific to like biological systems and not just biological systems,

1077
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:52,840
but complex systems in the natural world. And it's not those types of things that we've been

1078
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:57,480
talking about are not built into neural networks or only some of them are because maybe you talk

1079
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,480
about the recurrence and how that can lead to semantics. So anyway, I was slightly surprised

1080
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,840
that I started reading about like the neural networks because I thought, oh, well, a lot of

1081
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,480
the things that it seemed to be important in these complex dynamics that give rise to our

1082
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,480
rich mental worlds and rich ecologies and stuff are missing in the artificial intelligence systems,

1083
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:19,160
or maybe they're not. And I wonder what you think is missing in current AI.

1084
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:27,000
I think what's missing in current AI is context. In other words, somatic, somatic.

1085
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,680
Oh, okay. Well, because context, I think, is it context changes? No, no, that's the title of your

1086
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,640
book. All you need is, all you need is attention, which is a different form of context. And like

1087
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,960
the modern transformer, which underlies all these large language models is all about context

1088
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:48,840
in terms of word. But it does not have somatic information. It does not include

1089
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:58,360
historical context. Well, this is how it's changed over time. So I think you need,

1090
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:07,320
it does not include social, except indirectly as the social aspects get revealed in languages.

1091
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:16,280
Otherwise, you don't have direct somatic interaction. Now, once you have these things,

1092
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:23,480
once you have the chip, or the video chip, in a machine that you kind of

1093
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:32,360
raise as a child with all the video, with all the video, with all the auditory, with all that.

1094
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,200
You're actually, you're speaking exactly to my previous guest. I haven't released this yet,

1095
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:41,080
but he raises artificial agent chicks exactly like newborn chicks to look at

1096
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,640
this developmental trajectory of return. Which people did with chimps, remember? They

1097
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:52,680
tried that without, did not turn out very well. Because at some point it didn't scale up. Now,

1098
01:30:52,680 --> 01:31:05,400
the question is whether the, but I think that if in fact, we have, we have eons of evolution

1099
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:15,800
behind us, of the planet of the, of life and so on, you wonder if you can short-circuit any of that

1100
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:22,760
and get. Right. Well, we seem to be partially. Well, I mean, I certainly want to say a sunflower

1101
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:29,320
is aware of the sun. Okay. Tropism is a form of awareness. I don't care what you call it.

1102
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:37,080
Is it self-awareness? No, I don't think so. I wouldn't want to say that. So it's the thought

1103
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:41,640
example of the, you know, which the elephants and so on. Now they're saying crows can do it and so on.

1104
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:47,560
So is that, what is it like to be a crow as well as a bat? So at what point do you start saying,

1105
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,440
well, this is not just, it recognizes its body with something and you wonder,

1106
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:58,760
or it really recognizes itself as a self or is there a self in the, in the

1107
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,880
chimp that can point to the screen when it sees its image with a thought on its forehead.

1108
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,960
At each point, I would say it's an emergent property, but certainly I've got to tell you those

1109
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,560
hint and plot and chalices. I had been playing around with these problems for ages and I had

1110
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:22,120
not sat down to write dynamics in action until I read hint and plot and chalice, which at the time

1111
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:29,080
was, I went, the fact that, that, that's really simple. I mean, we're talking how many decades ago,

1112
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:35,800
neural network was able to, according to chalice, I think it was when somebody asked him, how do

1113
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,560
you explain that it produces the errors of deep dyslexia, not surface dyslexia? And his answer

1114
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:48,360
was, I can only explain it by saying it self-organized a semantic attractor. So semantics

1115
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:54,200
would be an emergent property that changes the output. That's what I, why we would call it

1116
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:00,120
strong emergence. That's what I, why I would call it top down. It changes the probability

1117
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:07,160
distribution of what its behavior is such that it produces an output that reflects the semantics

1118
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:14,920
of the attractor. But so AI does not have closure of constraints. So this is another idea that,

1119
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:21,000
you know, it's not self-generating. It's, it's byproducts don't feedback in that sense, or,

1120
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:28,040
or maybe you have a different outcome. Now, now. Now it doesn't. Exactly. Okay. That's the question.

1121
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:35,240
The question always is not, not what's practically doable today, but in principle. Sure, sure. But

1122
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,000
I mean, are we going to have to emulate life then? Are we going to have to have artificial

1123
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,280
life to have what, whatever the hell real artificial, real intelligence, real artificial

1124
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:50,600
intelligence is, right? And that's again, an answer for the constraint on how many of these

1125
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:57,720
constraints are really not necessary for, for intelligent systems that would assist a neurologist

1126
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:03,640
or a, you know, maybe you don't need experience, you know, emotion or you know, I mean, I don't know.

1127
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:12,760
So, but my, but what I find fascinating is that even without somatic input, without any of this

1128
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:20,040
other stuff, the kinds of errors that people talk, oh, they hallucinate, that it's so similar to the

1129
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:28,760
kinds of errors that you got with the split brain gazaniga issues, the thing is making up

1130
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:35,720
some kind of story that would make all the inputs it has so far coherent.

1131
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:43,720
Correct? Even if it is, well, that's a typo. I've seen one where the output, well, the people

1132
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:47,400
were, the trainer was saying, no, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right. At one point

1133
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:53,800
it said, well, you know, that wasn't just a typo. Excuse me. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

1134
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:01,400
What ideas or concepts do you find yourself like revisiting the most when you're working? What

1135
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:07,000
ideas do you have? Do you revisit and are unsure about or think you need to grapple with more?

1136
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:16,520
I think the notion of how do you account for the emergent properties,

1137
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:23,480
characteristics in each particular case in each particular individual? How do we

1138
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:29,720
how? Is there any hope to be able to map this other than say, well, if each one is unique,

1139
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:35,480
then well, then that's the end of science. That's it. I mean, we need some kind of general

1140
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:44,760
formal. We both winced there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how to phrase it. Is it a back,

1141
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:52,360
forth, hermeneutic kind of multiple constraint satisfaction? How does that work? And I love

1142
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:59,160
that example that I got from Kusler and Koenig, I think their book way back went on psychology of,

1143
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:04,280
you know, imagine you're renting out an apartment and the apartment has one large

1144
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,440
wall and it's got a window here and so on. And this is going to be your bedroom and so

1145
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:13,000
you're constrained because the bed has to fit against maybe a wall, but then the chest doesn't

1146
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,040
fit because the other wall. So it's a question of multiple constraint satisfaction. So do you

1147
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:25,240
turn the chest of drawers into a night table because that's the only place it fits. And so

1148
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:30,680
you're adjusting it and it's constant adjustment, but that's what you see in dynamical systems.

1149
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:38,440
That's the kind of meta stability that someone riding a bike or someone on a tightrope, you

1150
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:45,400
know, one of these people going on a highway or a tightrope. It's not the kind of equilibrium of

1151
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:52,520
your old time, near equilibrium thermodynamics. It's a meta stability where it's a constant

1152
01:36:52,520 --> 01:37:03,560
adjustment of constraints. Correct? And so how do we, is there any hope to be able to map this

1153
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:10,280
in a way that provides some kind of general guidance as to how this is going to play out

1154
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,360
in a particular situation? How much do you have to know of the background? How much, you know,

1155
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:20,920
do you have to know of the context to be, you know, and I think, I think that's one good thing

1156
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:29,480
about that Aristotle had said was, you don't, you can't teach law, medicine, and ethics,

1157
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:36,120
because those are eminently context dependent compared to science. So, so how do you do it?

1158
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:41,560
You can only do it through apprenticeships, because the apprentice gives you this. And

1159
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:49,880
when I talk class, this is what I do. You know, you get a feel for it. So, so is that what a good

1160
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,120
coach in a business does? Because they've got enough of a feel for it. They might not be able

1161
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:04,040
to formalize it into a standard algorithm, but they've got a feel for the situation that therefore

1162
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:08,600
can provide guidance. This is why a coach doesn't need to be more of an expert than the expert as

1163
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:15,880
well, I imagine. You know, you have to have a feel for it. And how do you, how do you formalize the

1164
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:22,200
feel of something? And that's what, that's what a, that's what a master musician does. I just

1165
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:28,280
finished reading a book by Adam Gopnik called The Real Work, and it's about the mystery of mastery.

1166
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,640
Okay. Oh, it's fun to read. And so he talks about, you know, how do you,

1167
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:42,200
is the master seeing something that's at a different level? And Hofstadter used to talk

1168
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:49,080
about that when he talked about the chess master, who's shown a chess game in progress for a few

1169
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:54,680
seconds, and then they're asked to reproduce the feel for the board. They would always put

1170
01:38:54,680 --> 01:39:00,440
the pieces in different locations than what was actually presented to them. But the strategy,

1171
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:07,080
the strategic position, white and black were in, remained the same. Interesting. So what are they

1172
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:13,480
seeing? That the newbie doesn't see. The newbie is worried about

1173
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:20,840
playing the piano one finger here, one finger there. Simulating each move. That's like the physical

1174
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:28,680
signal that's coming in. Obviously mastery means that you see a level of organization

1175
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:35,640
that in the case of chess's strategy, in the case of magician is the

1176
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:42,280
prestidigitation, it's the magic. And what is it that you're seeing that then matters?

1177
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:50,120
And I think that's the constraint regime that we're all trying to figure out. Why is it that the

1178
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:58,360
same person that the soldier next to that one didn't get PTSD? They were in the same explosion.

1179
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:04,040
Because they were more of a man. See, that was the old tradition. It had to be an internal

1180
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:10,760
and internal characteristic. Whereas what I'm saying is what are the interdependent constraints

1181
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:18,200
that make a difference? You began that with like wondering if there is no hope,

1182
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,840
or if there is hope. Is there hope? Do you feel optimistic? Look, you've got to assume

1183
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:31,000
that we're all humans. So there's got to be some commonalities somewhere. At what scale,

1184
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,560
at what granularity? It's hard to say because you look at families and you see kids from the same

1185
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,680
family raised by the same friends, going to the same school, and they're so different. So you wonder,

1186
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:49,480
how does that happen? Is that all in birth order? I mean, there was a time where people

1187
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:54,920
talked a lot about that. If temporal constraints matter, then temporal order has to matter at

1188
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:00,440
some point. But to what extent, to what degree? I think that's what the... What's fun about this

1189
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:08,200
is that there's a whole new possibility space of research that opens up when you look in terms of

1190
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:14,120
constraints rather than looking in terms of... When the people were into the genome, I thought,

1191
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,120
people are assuming again, one disease per genome. Looking back, that's crazy.

1192
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:23,480
That's never going to happen. I knew that that was the case.

1193
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,480
You knew that. I didn't know that. I mean, yeah, because I had this linear thought,

1194
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:33,000
that's the way I was raised. And so... We all were raised that way. That's what we all assume.

1195
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,400
But now the question is, well, is it going to be one protein fold per disease or per disease?

1196
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:46,200
So at what point is it... No, it's the context that makes it fall this way rather than that,

1197
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,680
and therefore gets this functionality rather than that, even though it's the same string of amino

1198
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:57,000
acids. All right, so it's the confirmation. So what is it in the context that makes it conform a

1199
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:03,560
certain way? Well, in the case of development, we know that one cell in one part of the fertilized

1200
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,840
egg is the one that... Because if it's in that location, that's what's going to

1201
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:13,400
turn into the first neural crest. Is that pure random? Then that raises, that brings randomness

1202
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:19,400
there rather than at the quantum level. So how does that work? Who knows? But it's fun to think

1203
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:26,760
about. It opens up a whole new way of looking at a whole level of organization that we thought was

1204
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:32,840
just illusory or just epistemically convenient. But if we really say, all right, now let's pretend

1205
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:37,320
just for the sake of argument, it's real. How does this play out? What does this mean? What are the

1206
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:42,280
implications? I mean, it's not just one level, though. God, I now want to ask you, what's beyond

1207
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:50,760
consciousness? What's... It's turtles all the way up. I just used that. It's everywhere. It's the

1208
01:42:50,760 --> 01:43:01,080
whole tangled... It's an entangled bank that's... But it's not random. People use the word still,

1209
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:07,640
use the word chaos when they refer to things like the Lorenz attractor to mean it's this sort...

1210
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,920
No, it's just a high level of organization that we didn't appreciate before. That Lorenz

1211
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:18,680
butterfly is very organized. Are you kidding? But it never repeats the same trajectory twice

1212
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:24,040
because of its path dependence and so on. So we have to understand what are the constraints that

1213
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:29,880
lead to that higher level of organization and how does that work? Well, Alicia, in terms of

1214
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:35,960
possibility spaces, it just occurred to me that if the science, the philosophy of constraints,

1215
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,680
is a possibility space, your book Context Changes Everything filled the hell out of that space.

1216
