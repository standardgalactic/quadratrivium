00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
How on earth can I argue for a local science? I'm going to be laughed out of the room if

00:10.200 --> 00:12.000
I argue for a local science.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.800
But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?

00:15.800 --> 00:19.520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:19.520 --> 00:28.240
It seems to me that what those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system

00:28.240 --> 00:34.920
theorists would call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.

00:34.920 --> 00:42.960
The next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different modes of constraint that

00:42.960 --> 00:47.720
are all operating simultaneously.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.640
This is Brain Inspired. Hey everyone, I'm Paul. Alicia Juarrero is a philosopher and

00:53.640 --> 00:59.000
has been interested in complexity science for a long time. In her own words, since before

00:59.000 --> 01:02.040
complexity was cool. I like that.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.840
In this episode, we discuss many of the topics and ideas. In her new book, Context Changes

01:07.840 --> 01:11.280
Everything, How Constraints Create Coherence.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.640
The book makes the thorough case that constraints should be given way more attention when trying

01:16.640 --> 01:22.280
to understand complex systems like brains and minds, how they're organized, how they

01:22.280 --> 01:29.000
operate, how they're formed, how they're maintained, et cetera, et cetera.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.760
So as you probably know, modern science, thanks in large part to the success of physics,

01:35.760 --> 01:42.280
focuses on, or mostly on, a single kind of causation, the kind involved when one billiard

01:42.280 --> 01:45.400
ball strikes another billiard ball.

01:45.400 --> 01:50.240
But that kind of causation neglects what Alicia argues are the most important features of

01:50.240 --> 01:58.680
complex systems, the constraints that shape the dynamics and possibility spaces of systems.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.600
Much of Alicia's book describes the wide range of types of constraints that we should

02:02.600 --> 02:09.040
be paying attention to, and how they interact and mutually influence each other.

02:09.040 --> 02:15.000
I highly recommend the book, and you may want to read it before, during, and after our conversation.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.800
It's partly because, if you're like me, the concepts that we discuss still aren't comfortable

02:20.800 --> 02:25.600
to think about in terms of normal modes of explanation in science.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.040
Thinking across levels of organization turns out to be hard.

02:30.040 --> 02:34.840
You might also want the book handy because, hang on to your hats, we also jump around

02:34.840 --> 02:40.560
a lot among many of the concepts that are in our book.

02:40.560 --> 02:47.320
So context changes, everything comes almost 25 years, almost a quarter of a century, after

02:47.320 --> 02:53.960
her previous classic, Dynamics in Action, which we also discuss, and which I also recommend,

02:53.960 --> 03:00.280
especially if you want more of a primer to her new, more expansive work.

03:00.280 --> 03:05.040
These ideas touch on all things complex, of course, from self-organizing systems, like

03:05.120 --> 03:12.600
whirlpools, to ecologies, businesses, societies, and of course, minds and brains.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.040
Find the show notes at braininspired.co.

03:15.040 --> 03:21.200
I'm sure you could tell, I very much enjoyed this conversation.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.000
We also have some guest questions from friends of the podcast, Kevin Mitchell, who's also

03:26.000 --> 03:32.080
coming up on a near future episode about his new book, and Max Shine, from Down Under.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.680
Thanks for listening, here's Alicia.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.440
Context changes, everything is almost a quarter...

03:41.440 --> 03:43.440
And human is Cuban hyperbole.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.440
Oh, what does that mean?

03:45.440 --> 03:50.720
Humans tend to exaggerate, I probably should have said, context changes, most things are

03:50.720 --> 03:53.920
a lot of things, human hyperbole.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.960
Well I was going to tie it to your previous work, Dynamics in Action, which is now almost

03:58.960 --> 04:01.440
a quarter of a century old.

04:01.440 --> 04:07.680
And so what you could say about that is that context changes action is a very coarse and

04:07.680 --> 04:11.880
terrible summary of that classic now work.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.560
And so I was thinking maybe context changes, everything is just kind of an expansion on

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
those ideas.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
It really is.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
It really is.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.960
After I wrote that one, I thought, well, I've got nothing else to say, but you know, there's

04:23.960 --> 04:31.280
been so many issues, and one of the things is people said to me, you know, there's nothing

04:31.280 --> 04:34.400
that's context free, I'd use that term in that one.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
Oh yeah.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.040
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.040
So what do I call it?

04:39.040 --> 04:40.840
Well, what about context, it depends.

04:40.840 --> 04:48.240
So I'm thinking maybe I gave short shrift to that one, to that kind of constraint.

04:48.240 --> 04:57.800
You know, things start, and of course AI and language models and so on, and for E, I think

04:57.800 --> 04:59.360
came out of the process.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.800
So there were a lot of things that I thought once the pandemic started, I thought, you

05:02.800 --> 05:07.640
know what, just sit down and do it, you know, and just put it all together.

05:07.640 --> 05:12.800
And Steve, you see if it comes together, and I was pleased it did.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
Yeah, me too.

05:13.800 --> 05:18.840
I mean, you mentioned the phrase context free, which you have changed now to context dependent

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
in the new book.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
Independent.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
Oh, that's the contact.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.840
Right, context independent.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.480
Yeah, see, that's what I was going to say is, you know, the book, I love the book.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.520
It is challenging, and one that I will have to revisit over and over, because, well, no,

05:32.520 --> 05:33.520
it's not bad.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.680
So I'm already, that's not a bad thing.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.320
I'm already a slow reader, and I'm a slow thinker, apparently, as well, at least to

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
give me depth.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
I'm a writer is what I am.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
I don't write very clearly.

05:42.320 --> 05:47.320
I don't know why I'm good in the classroom, but I'm terrified.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.200
I just, it looks still, I spent most of my time just editing.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
Sure.

05:54.200 --> 05:59.000
Well, that's what, so what I want to ask you is, what has changed in your views since

05:59.000 --> 06:00.240
Dynamics in Action?

06:00.240 --> 06:04.880
And, you know, besides just expanding, you know, you cover like so many different constraints

06:04.880 --> 06:06.400
and topics in this book.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.160
But what I wanted to comment on before that is, one of the reasons why I'm going to have

06:10.160 --> 06:16.480
to go back to it over and over is because the terminology and is, you're like inventing

06:16.480 --> 06:17.480
some of it.

06:17.480 --> 06:23.640
But a lot of it is kind of still, for me, still fuzzy in terms of like what it actually,

06:23.640 --> 06:29.400
like it's definition and how, like how I set the boundaries, you know, with these terms

06:29.400 --> 06:31.640
and what they mean and how I can use them.

06:31.640 --> 06:36.560
And so, you know, and we'll come back to this, but anyway, that's why I'm going to be revisiting

06:36.560 --> 06:37.560
a lot.

06:37.560 --> 06:43.520
So maybe let's start with, you know, what's changed in 25 years in your thinking?

06:43.520 --> 06:51.600
I think what's changed is that when I wrote Dynamics in Action, I basically meant it as

06:51.600 --> 06:56.840
a brief against analytic action theory.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.840
Okay.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.120
Can you summarize analytic action theory?

07:00.120 --> 07:07.200
Well, the idea that either that intentional behavior, intentional action, you know, the

07:07.200 --> 07:12.160
book starts with what's the difference between a wink and a blink, difference being that

07:12.160 --> 07:24.920
you should be able to explain away anything that philosophy of mind considers intentionality

07:24.920 --> 07:26.400
or intention.

07:26.400 --> 07:34.720
So teleology was reduced away.

07:34.720 --> 07:41.720
The idea of contentful intentions were reduced away.

07:41.720 --> 07:48.600
And so my thought was, because I had published a number of standalone papers about what's

07:48.600 --> 07:55.640
wrong with behaviorist reductions of intention, what's wrong with identity theory attempts

07:55.640 --> 08:04.600
to reduce intentions is on, that complex dynamical systems theory was a very good way of entering

08:04.600 --> 08:09.320
this whole field that would solve a lot of the problems or wouldn't get you into the

08:09.320 --> 08:13.800
problems that all these other attempts did.

08:13.800 --> 08:23.400
But in the last 20-some years, I keep thinking, you know, most stuff in reality is irreversible.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
Most stuff is context.

08:25.200 --> 08:31.120
So it applies not just to action, but it applies a lot more broadly.

08:31.120 --> 08:37.760
And so I think I stick my neck out a bit more with respect to general ontology or general

08:37.760 --> 08:45.040
cosmology by using the same notion of constraint more broadly than just for action.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.040
Yeah.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.360
Well, I had to revisit dynamics in action.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.800
As you know, and as you write about in your newer book, Context Changes Everything, neuroscience

08:53.800 --> 08:56.560
has embraced the dynamical systems perspective.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.600
And you talk about some of the studies that, you know, some of the people who have been

09:00.600 --> 09:03.040
in those studies have been on this podcast.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.400
On this podcast, we talk a lot about the dynamical systems view.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.280
And then going back to dynamics in action, it's like, oh, my God, it's all there already.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
I mean...

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
Thank you.

09:12.280 --> 09:19.520
It's fascinating to me that somebody like Mark Churchland, whom I use in one of the chapters,

09:19.520 --> 09:27.920
is the son of Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were the foremost advocates of the liminative...

09:27.920 --> 09:28.920
Right.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.920
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
Everything is as a mind.

09:30.920 --> 09:38.880
I'm thinking, oh, my goodness, this is the revenge par excellence of dynamical systems

09:38.880 --> 09:39.880
theory.

09:39.880 --> 09:47.000
Because I once met Paul Churchland here in DC, Dick Schlagel at GW, and invited him

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
to speak.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.040
And I asked him back then, this must have been, this must have been just about when Context

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Changes...

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
I went and dynamics came up.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
It was years ago.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
And I...

09:57.040 --> 10:01.720
Haven't you ever considered cut dynamical systems theory?

10:01.720 --> 10:07.560
That has nothing to say about neurology or the reality of the case.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.080
Paul Churchland said that in person, and I've never forgotten, I'm thinking, no.

10:12.080 --> 10:17.920
And the reason I was almost sure that was so is because, but way back when, I was talking

10:17.920 --> 10:23.760
a lot to people in operations, research and network theory and that kind of thing.

10:23.760 --> 10:28.080
And they're like, you know what, there's got to be a network property in the brain that

10:28.080 --> 10:35.120
has emergent properties that somehow loops back down and is able to influence behaviors

10:35.120 --> 10:38.840
such that these emergent properties get realized in behavior.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.400
That's the difference between an action proper and behavior.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.960
There's got to be some of that.

10:43.960 --> 10:51.440
But no, I think that just traditional notions of causality, traditional notions of ontology,

10:51.440 --> 10:55.760
that only the tiny little fundamental components are real.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.120
So it was all, let's look for the neuron.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.120
Right.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
It does this.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.120
Yeah.

11:01.120 --> 11:08.440
So I find it really, really very rewarding that dynamical systems theory has been vindicated

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
in a sense.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
Yeah.

11:10.440 --> 11:15.160
I wonder what the elder Churchlands, their daughter is also in neuroscience, by the way.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.320
I wonder what they think of the dynam...

11:17.320 --> 11:23.480
I wonder if they've come around at all because the tagline sort of of eliminateitivism is

11:23.480 --> 11:29.000
that folk psychology, the words that we use in folk psychology aren't real things, right?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.960
And then there's a reductionist way to understand things and that's the best way.

11:32.960 --> 11:39.800
But the dynamical systems viewpoint kind of, it's kind of in between that, right?

11:39.800 --> 11:43.000
Because it allows for a top-down thing, but it doesn't necessarily say anything about the

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
terms and concepts we use.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.880
Well, that's why I think I stick my neck out in this one where it seems to me that what

11:51.880 --> 12:00.800
those folk psychology terms mean, represent, are what dynamical system theorists would

12:00.800 --> 12:05.040
call the constraint regime that holds the dynamics together.

12:05.040 --> 12:12.320
And so they are capturing an emergent property that is powerful and that's where the whole

12:12.400 --> 12:19.600
problem of causality kept bugging me because, thinking, Carl Gillette's book on reduction

12:19.600 --> 12:25.800
and emergence where he says, you know, nowadays the physicists, like Brian Rocklin, for example,

12:25.800 --> 12:32.800
have espoused the truth or the reality of emergent properties.

12:32.800 --> 12:39.600
But they still don't want to allow that those emergent properties are causally influential

12:39.600 --> 12:40.600
on their components.

12:40.680 --> 12:44.040
In other words, they cannot change behavior.

12:44.040 --> 12:50.320
They cannot change in a sense neural architecture in virtue of their emergent

12:50.320 --> 12:55.480
properties. Whereas that's what I think complex dynamical systems let's you do.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.640
Maybe we could suggest that way into causality around a lot.

13:00.760 --> 13:01.760
No, that's great.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.480
You'll have to. I do it too.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.400
So we're going to be in a real swamp here pretty soon.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.880
But, you know, so one of the things in dynamics and action also is, you know, you've

13:12.880 --> 13:18.760
railed against this modern notion of efficient causation as the only valid kind of causation.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.480
And since you're just talking about causality, maybe we should talk about that.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.680
And then I want to come back to also what you have changed your mind about perhaps since then.

13:26.680 --> 13:33.040
But so, you know, famously, there are these four different types of causations from Aristotle's

13:33.040 --> 13:39.320
days, from Aristotle, and an efficient causation, the billiard ball that thing X hits things

13:39.320 --> 13:43.600
Y and then that moves things thing Y. That's the only valid kind of causation.

13:43.800 --> 13:49.720
And a lot of your labor is trying to bring back notions of the other of formal

13:49.720 --> 13:52.320
causality and causality via constraint.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.920
And so do you think that and from my limited perspective, because I'm reading works like

13:57.920 --> 14:03.880
yours and like a lot of similar kinds of works that are trying to bring make teleology not

14:03.880 --> 14:10.360
such a bad word and bring like these constraints to bear, because of that, I feel like the old

14:10.360 --> 14:14.280
story, the modern story of efficient causation is the only causation.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.560
I feel like that's dissipating.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.240
Do you believe that also?

14:17.880 --> 14:27.520
I think it's still very present in physics, especially with regards to the kind of causality

14:27.520 --> 14:34.240
that we would call top down causality, that in fact, emergent properties really are not

14:34.240 --> 14:42.720
causally powerful, that all the heavy lifting, as Van Orten would say, it all happens bottom

14:42.720 --> 14:47.880
up. And so it's really to be explained through efficient energetic transfer.

14:48.280 --> 14:57.760
But I think that's because the idea of causality as efficient boxes you into the the

14:59.120 --> 15:04.600
boxes you into the impossibility of top down causation, because if there were top down

15:04.600 --> 15:10.960
causation with that kind of causality, you'd have over determination, you'd have a violation

15:10.960 --> 15:13.480
of the closure of the physical and you'd have all these problems.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.240
And so therefore no way that can't happen.

15:15.560 --> 15:20.480
Well, but if you think of what I found fascinating, that's one of the reasons why I

15:20.480 --> 15:28.040
adopted the notion of constraint was every time natural scientists, hard scientists got into

15:28.040 --> 15:34.040
trouble thinking in terms of efficient causality, then immediately the term starts being used as,

15:34.400 --> 15:39.680
well, it's factors or conditions or constraints that are causal.

15:39.680 --> 15:47.960
Well, okay, so I'll grant you efficient causality as the term for cause.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
So let's call it influence by constraint.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.600
And that's what I was trying to do, because I certainly don't want to go to an

15:57.600 --> 16:00.080
environmental notion of formal cause.

16:00.080 --> 16:05.960
I don't want to go to, you know, Deus Ex Machina, or, or your, you know, Paley's

16:05.960 --> 16:11.640
teleology, or even Aristotle's teleology, which was all built in, set up from the beginning.

16:11.880 --> 16:18.800
That's the way that that's why that's why Darwin, Darwin bought into this.

16:18.800 --> 16:23.160
And so Darwin thought he was very concerned about the notion of evolution.

16:23.160 --> 16:28.960
He said you have new species appearing that that would mean that it wasn't all built in

16:28.960 --> 16:29.640
from the start.

16:29.640 --> 16:34.960
And therefore this developmental process was only an unfurling of preexisting

16:35.520 --> 16:36.320
potential.

16:36.680 --> 16:41.880
And what I want to say is that constraints really create new potential, because I think

16:41.880 --> 16:43.760
that's what you get from prigazine.

16:43.760 --> 16:48.320
I think that's what prigazine gets the, he was the good pregoser now that we think

16:48.320 --> 16:49.000
about it.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.080
He was the one who he got the Nobel Prize for dissipated structures, I think for that

16:53.080 --> 16:53.760
very reason.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.280
But you mentioned physics, and maybe it's just in biology that the notion of circular

17:02.320 --> 17:07.120
causality and causality via constraint is more comfortable among biologists.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.640
I think the biologists, biology was the last holdout.

17:11.880 --> 17:18.040
They refused to get shoehorned into the model of efficient mechanical causality.

17:18.360 --> 17:25.640
And as I was reading your email and reading one of the latest issues of Science Magazine

17:25.640 --> 17:33.280
on Australia, you know, they're talking about the dispersal of distribution of black

17:33.280 --> 17:34.640
beans throughout Australia.

17:34.920 --> 17:42.840
And the assumption was, well, this precedes the Westerners who arrived in Australia.

17:43.240 --> 17:53.120
But now they're revisiting the idea that some of the salt lines of the native Australians

17:53.360 --> 17:58.520
have accounts of these plants and the dispersion.

17:58.760 --> 18:10.880
So the Science Magazine article talks about combining not only the genetic flow of the

18:10.880 --> 18:19.960
genes of the black bean plant, but also biogeography and these ethnographic accounts.

18:20.200 --> 18:27.880
So I think that you see it now more in ecology, in addition to just straight biology.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.600
But you see it.

18:28.960 --> 18:37.320
And of course, the social scientists have always used other causal factors as their

18:37.320 --> 18:42.160
reasons. But of course, that's what led the heart scientists to say, well, that proves

18:42.160 --> 18:43.240
they're not sciences.

18:43.640 --> 18:49.800
The social scientists, because they need to, because they need to appeal to you

18:49.800 --> 18:54.560
unique causes to things that don't scale as a universal law.

18:55.240 --> 19:02.440
And because they use top down factors that are not efficient causes, that shows for

19:02.440 --> 19:03.960
sure they're not science.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.840
Before maybe this can just be a jumping off point to any of these can be jumping off

19:08.840 --> 19:10.440
points because we can go any direction.

19:10.760 --> 19:16.320
But have you changed your mind about anything in particular with regard to the story of

19:16.320 --> 19:18.880
context and constraints over the last quarter century?

19:19.560 --> 19:25.320
No, I've just sort of expect, I think I focus more on context independent constraints,

19:25.840 --> 19:28.120
because what I think that does.

19:28.320 --> 19:33.960
And hang on, I'll just say context independence means it's an external constraint that

19:33.960 --> 19:38.760
drives a system far from equilibrium, like a gradient or gravity, etc.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.760
It pulls on the system.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.760
Gradient, particularly.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.400
And when you start looking at the different kinds of gradients, either the spatial

19:46.440 --> 19:51.040
temporal gradients of gravity, you know, the gravitational.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.040
I like that you just illustrated gravity right there.

19:54.440 --> 20:04.320
That means that that space, time is not homogenous and uniform.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.560
There are inhomogeneities in space and time.

20:08.720 --> 20:14.040
Polarities, we know the importance of polarities all over the place.

20:14.040 --> 20:20.160
We have polarities in electric and magnetic, but also in developmental anterior

20:20.160 --> 20:25.040
posterior, right and left in the development of an embryo.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.480
There are we have.

20:28.840 --> 20:35.760
I think in social systems, we certainly have levels of organization that would

20:35.760 --> 20:41.240
give you different different points of equilibrium at different stages.

20:41.520 --> 20:49.880
So I think the importance of that, the importance of boundary conditions, I think,

20:49.960 --> 20:53.320
as a setting for a context.

20:53.720 --> 21:00.920
So basically, I think of the of context independent constraints as those that

21:00.920 --> 21:05.320
determine, in a sense, the bounds of possibility space.

21:05.320 --> 21:13.840
They kind of determine the basic fundamental characteristics of possibility space.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.240
But you need both context independent and context dependent.

21:18.240 --> 21:22.520
And I'll just briefly define context, context dependent constraints are those

21:22.520 --> 21:26.400
that which bring things back essentially away from context independence, which means

21:26.640 --> 21:27.920
more toward equilibrium.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.040
And when you get these mixing and match, maybe not.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.480
I know, I know, I just caught myself saying more toward equilibrium.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.520
But away from independence, we'll say maybe that's correct.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.200
Yeah.

21:38.200 --> 21:42.160
But when you get these interacting is when when you can have the ability to develop

21:42.160 --> 21:43.320
complex systems.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.560
I think the reason I had given context free context independent constraints short

21:47.560 --> 21:52.080
shrift back when is because I don't think context independent constraints.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.240
Complexify, they don't they don't enable complexity.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.080
All you get in principle would be a clump.

22:02.280 --> 22:02.640
Yeah.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.120
Correct.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.520
They wouldn't match the poles.

22:04.560 --> 22:04.840
Yeah.

22:05.360 --> 22:09.960
And clumps and masses and agglomerations have no emergent properties.

22:10.240 --> 22:15.400
So context independent constraints don't don't create complexity.

22:16.240 --> 22:23.280
Once you have a a a space of possibilities with a certain in

22:23.280 --> 22:29.640
homogeneity in it, then I think complex dependent constraints can kick in.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.800
My question is, well, why do they show up?

22:33.840 --> 22:37.320
Why do context independent constraints appear?

22:37.680 --> 22:45.760
And I'm wondering whether, again, the boundary conditions, if if if the clumps

22:45.760 --> 22:56.360
are dense enough and they can't move much, then do accidental linkages?

22:57.360 --> 23:01.280
The indeterminism, are you hinting at indeterminism in the universe?

23:01.920 --> 23:10.000
Even the bumps and jostlings of regular Brownian motion, that if if there, I always

23:10.000 --> 23:14.240
try to ground what I say in in heart sciences.

23:14.480 --> 23:19.160
And I always end up going back to things like the Bernard cells and the BZ reaction.

23:19.400 --> 23:24.000
Otherwise, I'm very worried that philosophers will be accused of flights of

23:24.160 --> 23:28.800
fancy that are not grounded in anything scientific.

23:28.800 --> 23:33.360
And so I keep thinking, all right, so you've got Bernard cells and a pan of

23:33.360 --> 23:40.720
water heated uniformity from below and at a certain threshold of non-equilibrium,

23:40.720 --> 23:44.840
in other words, at a certain gradient, correct?

23:45.120 --> 23:45.480
Yep.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.360
The status quo cannot be maintained.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.520
In other words, conduction cannot be maintained.

23:52.520 --> 24:03.600
And so the system flips to linking individual water molecules into local perturbation.

24:04.920 --> 24:10.280
But if that gets amplified by the conditions, then it becomes a self

24:10.280 --> 24:12.000
reinforcing feedback loop.

24:12.200 --> 24:17.160
And that's, I think, where you see the context dependent constraint kicking in.

24:17.440 --> 24:25.320
That then the linkages create standalone units.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.800
Almost like when you're playing hangman.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.600
You know, we know that instinctively, because if we have towards the end of a

24:35.600 --> 24:42.080
word that we don't know what that is, a T and then an I, well, there are two more to go.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.880
Well, it's either going to be NG or ON, because these form like standalone

24:47.400 --> 24:54.120
units, because they, the context dependence concatenates and becomes a standalone unit.

24:54.120 --> 24:59.280
And now you've got in language, you'd have a phony, right?

24:59.280 --> 25:03.000
But in, that's what a laser is.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.640
A laser is context dependent constraints of a whole bunch of photon streams getting

25:10.160 --> 25:16.800
linked together in a way that they become a standalone entity with emergent properties.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.200
Yeah.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.520
So you're talking about, and you just mentioned why you use these examples,

25:21.520 --> 25:26.320
because they're less dangerous, I suppose, because they're in some

25:26.320 --> 25:30.880
sense simpler, more, I'm going to say low dimensional, because they're like from physics.

25:30.880 --> 25:31.880
So it feels more comfortable.

25:31.920 --> 25:36.400
Maybe that's a way to say it, but you do venture into these more, you know,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.880
like biological systems in the book.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.040
And one of the questions I had for you is, so I'm glad that you're sometimes

25:44.080 --> 25:46.920
pausing just a little bit before you say causality or something.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.000
Yeah, I always do.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.520
Yeah.

25:48.520 --> 25:53.400
Because that's where immediately a physicist will say, no, that's not causality.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.800
Yeah, right, right.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.000
Well, then like, and then I don't know what's going on in your head if you're

25:57.000 --> 26:01.200
searching for a different term, because, or, you know, alternative types of terms,

26:01.440 --> 26:03.880
because, you know, reading your book, and one of the reasons why I need to

26:03.880 --> 26:05.280
revisit it multiple times.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.880
And I look forward to it is just because things feel so new to me and the

26:08.880 --> 26:16.760
terminology so new that I don't feel like they don't feel comfortable, right?

26:16.760 --> 26:19.960
So I'm trying to think like, how do I apply this term?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.360
And how does this concept interact with this kind of constraint?

26:23.360 --> 26:25.200
And they're interlocking in dependencies.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.080
And how do I think about applied to the brain?

26:27.200 --> 26:31.960
And so what I'm wondering is, are these going to feel, you're the expert.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.440
How do these feel super comfortable to you?

26:34.440 --> 26:38.200
Just switching and thinking about these things, interacting and the different modalities?

26:38.200 --> 26:42.400
I wish I had made, I had coined the term enabling constraints.

26:42.400 --> 26:47.280
It goes back to Patty, Howard Patty, and a whole bunch of these biologists who

26:47.280 --> 26:52.760
talked several of whose books have the same similar title hierarchy theory.

26:53.360 --> 27:01.680
And it's because the enabling constraint is able to create a self-organization that

27:01.680 --> 27:06.600
can then also embed in the next higher up level of constraints.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.760
So I particularly want to use the notion of enabling constraints as constraints that

27:12.760 --> 27:18.360
enable the formation of a more complex dynamic.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.320
And that is, and how does that relate to a limiting constraint?

27:22.320 --> 27:23.640
Contrast that with a limiting?

27:23.640 --> 27:30.120
That would be the, I think we tend to use the term constraint, especially in physics

27:30.120 --> 27:36.840
and in mechanical engineering, especially as limiting, as closing off options.

27:36.840 --> 27:44.920
But the biologists tend to use them very often as factors, conditions, feedback

27:44.920 --> 27:46.560
loops, catalysts.

27:47.440 --> 27:52.560
See, the nice thing about the notion of a catalyst, two things, a lot of things.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.800
One is it spans chemistry and biology.

27:56.760 --> 28:04.080
And even in so-and-so as a catalyst of change, and we say that of people.

28:04.440 --> 28:12.760
So it's used in that sense, but also because a catalyst is conserved.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.840
It does not use up any energy of its own.

28:16.280 --> 28:21.600
And so what I like about that notion is that it's a causal factor.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.200
It's a causal, it's an influencer.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.640
That is not in the efficient causality mode.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.160
So are feedback loops.

28:34.080 --> 28:40.880
And the thing about a feedback loop, which I love, is that for eons, since I was on

28:40.880 --> 28:47.320
that never change, the idea of something creating itself or feeding back on itself

28:47.320 --> 28:50.320
to change itself was forbidden, was verboten.

28:51.320 --> 28:56.920
Because, again, from Aristotle's notion, then it would have to be before and after itself.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.400
It would have to be before itself is caused.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.360
It would have to be after itself is caused.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.080
Oh, no, you can't have that.

29:03.560 --> 29:13.840
The notion of simultaneous causality does not allow for parts interacting to produce

29:13.960 --> 29:22.320
holes that have emergent properties, which then simultaneously loop back down and

29:22.320 --> 29:27.480
constrain the parts of which the hole is made up.

29:28.840 --> 29:35.000
And so that's why I love the notion of feedback loops and catalysts in particular.

29:35.880 --> 29:43.520
But then I think once that hole coalesces, then you've got stabilizing

29:43.520 --> 29:49.040
constraints, because it has to hold together for a persistent length of time.

29:49.040 --> 29:53.800
Because unlike neuroequilibrium thermodynamics, the thing doesn't fall apart.

29:53.840 --> 29:58.760
The thing about these Ben-Arts cells is that while the conditions hold, it holds

29:58.760 --> 30:02.840
together despite changes at the component level.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.080
Perturbations, yeah.

30:04.080 --> 30:10.200
So fluctuations, internal fluctuations and perturbations, it has a metastability, which

30:10.240 --> 30:14.400
I also like, which is different from thermal equilibrium of classical

30:14.680 --> 30:16.360
neuroequilibrium thermodynamics.

30:16.880 --> 30:23.920
While the thing holds, it has a stabilizing power to stabilize the

30:23.920 --> 30:26.320
constraint regime as a whole.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.280
And what is it?

30:27.360 --> 30:28.960
You say it has a stabilizing power.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.720
That's the whole.

30:29.720 --> 30:34.400
What is the dynamic constraint regime that constitutes a Ben-Arts cell?

30:34.680 --> 30:39.720
A Ben-Arts cell is not a thing other than the water molecules that make it up.

30:39.960 --> 30:46.880
Or the constraints that go into establishing the conditions that make it up.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.640
The boundary conditions as context-independent constraints.

30:49.880 --> 30:54.320
And then the linkages of the molecules.

30:55.440 --> 30:55.760
Yeah.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.520
Right?

30:56.680 --> 30:57.040
Yeah.

30:57.600 --> 31:02.240
Yeah, it's just so hard to think of across scales, these myriological.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.480
Yes, it's extremely difficult to think across scale, because we tend to think

31:06.480 --> 31:08.920
in terms of efficient cause across scale.

31:09.120 --> 31:09.440
Yeah.

31:09.480 --> 31:14.400
And all of these biologists was, I always wondered for a long time, why did these

31:14.400 --> 31:19.800
biologists like Stan Salti, Howard Patti, a lot of them started talking about

31:19.800 --> 31:24.480
semiotics and semiosm, why did they ever get into this?

31:25.040 --> 31:31.160
And it finally dawned on me because the relationship between levels of

31:31.160 --> 31:33.880
organization and Herbert Simon knew this.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.040
The near decomposability.

31:37.640 --> 31:42.840
Relations of constraint, they're not relations of energetic exchange, right?

31:42.960 --> 31:50.960
So the higher level is a form of constraint on the possibility space of

31:50.960 --> 31:51.840
the lower level.

31:52.280 --> 31:56.560
So it doesn't let it veer off and disintegrate.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.560
It's interesting the word integrity.

31:59.480 --> 32:03.000
It's beautifully here because it just holds it together.

32:03.320 --> 32:03.640
Yeah.

32:03.800 --> 32:08.760
So when I think of top-down constraints, those are limiting because they hold

32:08.760 --> 32:14.200
that possibility space within a dynamic range.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.520
And so the thing holds, an organism holds together.

32:19.040 --> 32:26.120
Our metabolism might change, a spleen might be removed, a goldbladder might be

32:26.120 --> 32:29.000
removed with a constraint regime holds.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.760
Can you name something that is not an emergent property of something else?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.240
Oh, culture.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.480
Culture is not an emergent property?

32:39.480 --> 32:40.520
Culture is an emergent property.

32:40.520 --> 32:40.840
Do you want me to-

32:40.840 --> 32:42.680
No, can you name something that's not an emergency?

32:42.680 --> 32:48.200
Oh, quantity is emergent, but it's not an interesting emergence.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.160
Okay.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.040
So that's fine.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.160
No, thank you.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.280
That's a good point.

32:52.280 --> 32:58.440
When I think of emergent properties, the emergent properties that I'm interested

32:58.600 --> 33:08.120
in are qualitatively different properties that affect the behavior of the component

33:08.120 --> 33:13.320
level so that that qualitative property continues in effect.

33:14.200 --> 33:21.080
That's why homeostasis, I think of as an emergent property that has interesting

33:21.320 --> 33:28.040
features, because it controls the goings-on at the lower level such that homeostasis

33:28.760 --> 33:31.080
homostatic balance holds.

33:31.640 --> 33:39.640
Whereas a whole bunch of pile of debris in my backyard.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.520
It's still emergent with respect to-

33:42.520 --> 33:43.240
Balance.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.040
Balance.

33:44.040 --> 33:44.440
Is what?

33:45.080 --> 33:45.960
Science.

33:45.960 --> 33:46.520
It's bigger.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.520
Well, it's bigger, but if you throw a bowling ball into it, it would be harder to move

33:50.520 --> 33:53.160
than if you just had one piece of debris out there, right?

33:53.160 --> 33:58.280
Well, that's true, but it does not change the characteristics of any of the-

33:58.280 --> 33:59.000
There's no top-down.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.480
There's no-

33:59.480 --> 33:59.800
All right.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.680
There's no top-down.

34:00.680 --> 34:06.840
See, that's what's been driving my thinking for 20-some years, right?

34:06.840 --> 34:13.800
And that is, how can you explain top-down causality without falling victim or making the mistakes of

34:13.800 --> 34:16.920
and all that other stuff?

34:16.920 --> 34:20.760
And that's what I think complex dynamical systems gives me.

34:20.760 --> 34:28.040
And I think the rise of ecology in the last 25 years has helped enormously,

34:28.040 --> 34:32.440
because we used to think, oh, well, we can kill off the plank, then that's not a big deal.

34:32.440 --> 34:32.840
Right.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.640
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.640 --> 34:34.360
Correct?

34:34.360 --> 34:41.000
And the thing is the understanding that it may mess up the constraint regime that holds the whole

34:41.000 --> 34:56.520
thing together is the idea that there are systemic properties that really affect the components.

34:57.640 --> 35:04.920
I think that's gone a long way to making us aware of top-down,

35:04.920 --> 35:07.480
in a respectable scientific way.

35:08.200 --> 35:13.160
On the other hand, one of the features of complex self-organizing systems is their robustness.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.280
So if you did kill off all the mosquitoes, we might be okay.

35:17.480 --> 35:24.760
I suspect, though, I think robustness means that they degrade gracefully.

35:25.640 --> 35:26.200
I like that.

35:26.920 --> 35:36.440
That it doesn't fall apart the way if you break the axle on a bicycle that will try to go whatever.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.040
That will just, the thing won't work at all.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.120
It seems as though complex dynamical systems, far from equilibrium,

35:45.400 --> 35:51.240
they get a bit out of kilter, but they continue to work for a fair amount of time until then it

35:51.240 --> 35:56.520
reaches its level of instability that that constraint regime cannot hold.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.720
New phase change coming up.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.680
And you get an entirely new phase change that falls apart.

36:01.320 --> 36:05.720
So I suspect that if we killed off all the mosquitoes,

36:06.360 --> 36:11.080
we do not know what might enter that, that open niche now.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.560
Right. Yeah. Well, there's been all sorts of disasters with introducing

36:15.560 --> 36:19.080
a non-native species to kill off one thing.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.440
It turns out they're invasive.

36:21.080 --> 36:26.440
Exactly. I suspect we've got to be careful because of that kind of problem.

36:26.440 --> 36:31.640
Before the thing falls apart, you might have some really nasty surprises that you didn't expect.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.120
Hey, you mentioned homeostasis and again, we're going to jump around.

36:36.120 --> 36:42.360
But I had Henry Yin on and I've had a few other people on who talk about the brain

36:42.920 --> 36:47.880
more as a control system than necessarily a complex system that we need to think about

36:47.880 --> 36:51.800
things more in sort of the old cybernetics way of a control system.

36:51.800 --> 36:56.200
However, the set point of our thermometer is not set externally.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.960
We're setting our own set point, right?

36:57.960 --> 37:01.000
So homeostasis is in certain bounds.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.600
Well, that's what I was going to ask you about.

37:03.960 --> 37:10.680
How do you think, rather, about when we're setting our internal desired temperature,

37:10.680 --> 37:13.000
let's say, that we need to be around 98.6?

37:13.800 --> 37:14.680
How do you think about that?

37:14.680 --> 37:16.040
Where does that set point come from?

37:16.040 --> 37:18.920
Bottom up, top down, or is it just the-

37:19.000 --> 37:22.200
I think everything, not only comes up, bottom up, top down, but

37:23.000 --> 37:23.880
pass forward.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.440
I think-

37:24.440 --> 37:25.560
Pass forward, environment and-

37:26.760 --> 37:29.240
We forget temporal constraints as well.

37:30.760 --> 37:38.440
For example, folks up in the Himalayas and in the Andes have a whole different

37:40.920 --> 37:43.080
oxygen hemoglobin.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.360
Capacity.

37:44.520 --> 37:51.880
Capacity and characteristic because of centuries of adaptability, millennia of adaptability.

37:51.880 --> 37:57.080
So we forget temporal constraints as well, right?

37:57.960 --> 38:04.440
It seems as though the same temperature in the fall feels colder than it does in the spring,

38:04.440 --> 38:08.280
because by the time we get to the spring, we've had a whole winter.

38:08.280 --> 38:12.120
So I think it's multi-dimensional, multi-scalar,

38:14.840 --> 38:18.840
temporally, I think we forget time.

38:20.600 --> 38:24.920
And all of these complex dynamical systems, I remember a phrase of Prigogenes,

38:24.920 --> 38:29.720
I was fortunate enough to meet him a couple of times, and I've never seen this

38:30.600 --> 38:34.040
written down, but he used to use that phrase more than once in person.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.440
They carry their history on their back.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.240
Oh, I like that.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.920
I love that phrase.

38:38.920 --> 38:48.040
In other words, their very dynamical architecture and characteristics embody,

38:48.040 --> 38:53.640
and that's where the 4E is coming, embody the conditions under which they were created,

38:53.640 --> 38:55.320
evolved and so on.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.240
His examples were snowflakes.

38:57.240 --> 39:02.840
They might have all started with the same, but over the time that they fell to earth,

39:03.560 --> 39:10.440
they, their actual architecture changes to embody the temperature, the pressure,

39:10.440 --> 39:19.480
the, all the atmospheric conditions through which they modified themselves and adapted

39:19.480 --> 39:21.880
and until they reached the ground.

39:21.880 --> 39:29.000
So I think that's true for us as well, for body temperature, for body states.

39:29.560 --> 39:36.120
I'm, I'm fascinated by that whole notion of inflammation, all the, all these set points

39:37.160 --> 39:46.360
that I think, in a sense, those mark the parameters of what you might call the constraint dome.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.760
You know, we've got the proteome.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.040
Oh, there it is.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.720
There's the word, the constraint dome.

39:52.120 --> 39:58.040
I just, I just, I was reading proteome and epigenome and stuff.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.040
Well, you know, we need a constraint dome.

40:00.040 --> 40:00.680
We do.

40:00.680 --> 40:01.800
Well, that's all in your book.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.760
The constraint dome is it.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.840
Yeah, but I don't, I've never occurred to me to use that phrase, which I like,

40:06.840 --> 40:12.360
because it's a whole bunch of them together at once.

40:13.320 --> 40:13.800
Right.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.280
Right.

40:14.280 --> 40:20.360
That's the problem and sort of just mentally trying to imagine these things.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.960
But real quick, you know, you mentioned temporal constraints, but in a sense,

40:25.240 --> 40:30.920
this is a question, all or most constraints are temporal in nature because a constraint is,

40:30.920 --> 40:33.560
by definition, slower than the process that it's constrained.

40:33.560 --> 40:40.200
Like a catalyst, right, is more stable than the reaction that it's catalyzing and that's,

40:40.200 --> 40:41.960
so it can act as a constraint.

40:41.960 --> 40:42.760
Correct.

40:42.760 --> 40:50.440
But then the cells which enable the tissues, the cell dynamics, which enable the tissues,

40:50.440 --> 40:58.520
that's faster than the, than the, so, so you have a whole bunch of, so therefore,

40:58.520 --> 41:02.920
what's important are the interfaces between the levels of organization.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.480
And what are the, what are the constraints that govern those interfaces?

41:07.560 --> 41:18.040
And we would call them what, codes, rules, laws, but local, but local, very, oftentimes very local,

41:18.840 --> 41:19.400
right?

41:19.400 --> 41:19.800
Right.

41:19.800 --> 41:25.480
Well, that's so, okay, there's this, a lot of the physical laws, like, like, you know,

41:25.480 --> 41:27.320
the notion of a force, right?

41:27.320 --> 41:31.000
For some reason, well, when you think about it, it's, it doesn't make any sense.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.280
But for some reason, when you grow up with it in physics classes and you think, oh,

41:34.280 --> 41:38.440
force, I know what a force is, but when you really think about it, it becomes very unnatural,

41:38.440 --> 41:40.520
like saying the same word over and over and you lose its meaning.

41:41.480 --> 41:48.200
Are these ideas going to seem as natural to me, eventually, as the concept of a force,

41:48.200 --> 41:50.360
which is, it turns out, a slippery idea also?

41:51.720 --> 41:59.800
I would hope so, but that's what I'm always worried about, about neologisms and, and I

41:59.800 --> 42:04.120
worried about using the word constraint, but it seemed as though it was...

42:04.120 --> 42:05.160
What else would you call it?

42:05.160 --> 42:10.840
Better than a cause, because as if I, if I use the word cause, then the assumption that

42:10.840 --> 42:15.480
that has to be energetic transfer, that's almost a, that's a losing battle.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.440
That's why.

42:16.440 --> 42:23.960
So I don't know what else to cause, call it, but to think in terms of enabling constraints is bottom

42:23.960 --> 42:31.800
up that, that within certain boundary, within certain context independent frameworks, they

42:31.800 --> 42:42.680
can generate emergent properties, which in turn operate as second order top down context

42:42.680 --> 42:43.880
dependent constraints, if you will.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.360
It's easier to just call a constraint regime.

42:47.160 --> 42:47.560
Yeah.

42:47.560 --> 42:48.600
Okay, regime to the word.

42:48.840 --> 42:56.760
Hold the, the components together so that they continue to satisfy the emergent properties

42:56.760 --> 42:57.240
of the whole.

42:58.920 --> 43:06.040
Do you feel like we'll, we will be able to write a constraint cookbook to generate dynamical

43:06.040 --> 43:08.840
complex systems that we want to generate eventually?

43:09.560 --> 43:18.200
If we think of it as formal systems, the way we used to where you would have a universal law,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.680
yeah, Newton's laws of motion.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.160
And I think my answer is no, because if I'm emphasizing context dependence,

43:27.080 --> 43:36.760
those laws would be what car popper would call, well, yeah, those applies to, to a normal science.

43:37.880 --> 43:45.400
But evolution to a whole new constraint structure, to a whole new constraint regime,

43:45.400 --> 43:50.360
such as the transition, I would say, from physics to chemistry, chemistry to biology,

43:50.360 --> 43:55.480
biology to psychology first, or sociology first, or whatever you want to call it,

43:55.480 --> 44:01.160
and on and on and on, that requires a whole new constraint regime.

44:01.160 --> 44:08.200
It's a, it's a, it's a topological nightmare, nightmare and transition.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.160
You know what's interesting?

44:09.720 --> 44:12.920
Prigazine detested catastrophe theory.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.440
And I never understood why.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.080
This idea that Peter Allen, who worked with him for, with Prigazine for a long time,

44:21.080 --> 44:22.280
you know Peter Allen's work?

44:22.280 --> 44:24.200
Peter Allen, really nice work.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.040
He's retired now from Cranfield in England.

44:28.680 --> 44:33.800
But he did a lot of work with Prigazine in Brussels at the Free University.

44:34.760 --> 44:45.080
And the idea that the transition from independent photon streams to a laser,

44:45.080 --> 44:50.280
the transition from a independent water molecules to a benign cell,

44:50.280 --> 44:56.520
the transition from a whole bunch of chemical transformations to a living organism,

44:57.320 --> 45:05.960
is a, is akin to a, to a bifurcation, to a topological bifurcation,

45:05.960 --> 45:11.800
that you have entirely new coordinates that apply at this new level.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.920
That to me gives

45:18.200 --> 45:20.360
reality to emergent properties.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.640
Oh, ontologically real?

45:21.640 --> 45:24.600
Oh, I, I wanted to say ontologically real.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.400
Okay, that's dangerous.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.960
I don't have to worry about, about tenure.

45:27.960 --> 45:32.520
So I don't have to worry about, about retreating to epistemology

45:32.520 --> 45:33.560
where the going gets stuff.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.720
So well, you know, that's our models.

45:35.720 --> 45:40.440
And that's the way we make sense of information overload.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.040
And so, no, damn it.

45:42.040 --> 45:46.600
I want to say they are, they are ontologically real.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.360
That, that the constraint regime that holds a benign cell together

45:50.360 --> 45:54.600
or a culture together or a laser together.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.280
Are real.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.040
They are not stuff.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.160
They are not things.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.080
I certainly don't want to reify them.

46:01.800 --> 46:09.240
But I don't see why we don't allow the dynamical interdependencies,

46:09.240 --> 46:12.600
which is all these constraint regimes are, right?

46:12.600 --> 46:16.280
They are, they are interlocking interdependencies.

46:17.160 --> 46:19.480
I thought, I thought reify meant make real.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.000
Oh, well, yeah, sure.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.080
Part of it, but, but then only stuff, stuff is real.

46:27.080 --> 46:27.960
Oh, okay.

46:27.960 --> 46:28.440
Okay.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.480
So therefore process is our real process.

46:31.480 --> 46:35.800
That's why Whitehead rails against the reification

46:35.800 --> 46:39.880
because he emphasized that processes are real.

46:40.680 --> 46:44.600
And I want to say, and the constraints that keep processes

46:44.600 --> 46:50.520
within a certain space, face space are also real.

46:50.520 --> 46:53.400
They are as real as the face space they are kept into.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.080
Which one do you give, do you give more credence to processes

46:57.080 --> 46:59.560
or are you a process philosopher, so to speak?

46:59.560 --> 47:00.360
Good question.

47:00.920 --> 47:05.160
You know, dynamical systems theory seems to place

47:05.160 --> 47:11.240
and if nothing else equal to the links as the nodes.

47:11.880 --> 47:12.200
Yeah.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.920
The question of whether the nodes or condensates,

47:15.720 --> 47:20.280
Mark Bergauer uses that term, the condensates of links

47:21.240 --> 47:24.120
of a lot of stable linkages.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.240
Oh, that's cool.

47:25.240 --> 47:31.480
And the nodes as stable condensates, no, as nodes are condensates

47:31.480 --> 47:36.440
of stable links or those that happen very often and so on.

47:37.080 --> 47:42.120
So it's hard to say, in this new book, I stick my neck out

47:42.120 --> 47:45.480
because I did not realize that there's still a question

47:45.480 --> 47:49.080
about exactly what covalent bonds are.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.200
Oh, yeah.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.720
I think when you dig into any established thing,

47:53.720 --> 47:55.400
there's, we realize, yeah.

47:55.400 --> 47:55.880
There you go.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.760
And the interconversion of matter and energy certainly says,

47:58.760 --> 48:05.720
well, you know, so is a material thing simply the condensate

48:05.720 --> 48:12.120
of a bunch of constrained energy forces, links and constraints,

48:13.160 --> 48:18.440
or are the forces and the links, the manifestation

48:18.520 --> 48:23.800
or the behavior of the, then if relativity theory is correct,

48:23.800 --> 48:25.560
which I'm assuming, then it doesn't matter.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.920
They're interconvertebral, right?

48:28.840 --> 48:30.360
But again, they're very local.

48:31.480 --> 48:39.640
See, I want to, I was thinking, how on earth can I argue for a local science?

48:40.200 --> 48:43.640
I'm going to be laughed out of the room if I argue for a local science.

48:43.640 --> 48:47.480
But this is kind of what Bill Wimsat hints at in the causal ticket, right?

48:47.480 --> 48:48.600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

48:49.320 --> 48:54.360
I have a sweet spot in my heart for Bill Wimsat, even though I've never met him,

48:55.000 --> 49:01.400
because I learned that he, I don't know who told me or how I'd learned about it.

49:01.400 --> 49:05.480
He was on the committee that approved my first paper.

49:05.480 --> 49:06.440
Oh, oh.

49:06.440 --> 49:08.760
His action theory rests on a mistake.

49:08.760 --> 49:15.160
And so I think that I published that first paper so many years ago.

49:15.160 --> 49:15.720
Wow, that's awesome.

49:15.720 --> 49:21.240
I think Wimsat is fact, you know, and that brings in the notion of explanation, how

49:21.960 --> 49:28.280
he's been arguing that sometimes explanations look upwards, not just downwards.

49:28.920 --> 49:29.240
Why?

49:29.240 --> 49:35.720
Because if you do believe that there are emergent properties and they are causally constrained.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.240
With the eye roll, folks, who are only messing with me.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.280
Exactly.

49:40.280 --> 49:48.680
Then you have to be able to make reference in any complete explanation to its influence

49:49.400 --> 49:54.680
as well as to the influence of the bottom up components, which is the way we tend to,

49:54.680 --> 49:56.040
we always look downwards.

49:56.600 --> 49:56.840
Yeah.

49:58.360 --> 50:03.960
And let me tell you, I think the reason folks like David Chalmers and Company,

50:03.960 --> 50:10.600
all this business about psycho, panpsychism.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.040
Panpsychism, yeah.

50:12.040 --> 50:18.280
I think what's driving that is that any time you find top down causality, you cannot much

50:19.720 --> 50:23.400
deny, that's got to be mental.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.800
Well, let's put it differently.

50:25.800 --> 50:30.520
It's got to be top down and it's a constraint regime influencing its components.

50:31.160 --> 50:38.120
But I don't want to say that they're just as chemical properties are emergent for physical,

50:38.680 --> 50:43.320
biological properties are emergent from chemical, psychic properties are emergent

50:43.880 --> 50:45.640
at a certain level of organization.

50:46.280 --> 50:53.000
I don't want to say that that emergent property way up at the psychic level also exists.

50:53.720 --> 50:58.120
I really don't want to say the Bernard cell is thinking.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.920
Or is conscious or is aware.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.920
But I do want to say there is a top down phenomenon.

51:06.920 --> 51:11.720
I think I suspect that a lot of what's driving the panpsychic.

51:13.640 --> 51:14.920
What would we call it?

51:14.920 --> 51:15.240
Fad?

51:15.880 --> 51:17.240
I hope so.

51:17.240 --> 51:20.280
I cannot imagine that anybody's taking tears.

51:20.280 --> 51:25.560
I think it's a, it's a, that's all I can do.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.880
Let's call it paradigm to give it a little more credence than fad.

51:27.960 --> 51:34.920
I don't want to get in trouble, Alicia.

51:34.920 --> 51:42.360
Okay, I have to talk about that.

51:43.000 --> 51:49.080
I just spoke at the theory of consciousness conference in Taramina this past spring.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.480
And I suddenly realized I said the same thing I talked about.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.440
I talked with that conference in Antwerp 20 some years ago.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.760
And I was left out of the rule 20 some years ago.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.560
Oh, wow.

51:59.560 --> 52:03.320
I was talking about constraints and dynamical systems and so on.

52:03.320 --> 52:08.120
Going, now interesting, you get a lot of this talk about constraints.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.680
Say, I mean, people were talking a lot about constraints.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.800
What is the lesson from that?

52:13.800 --> 52:17.480
Because you've stuck to your guns and did you just brush that off your back?

52:17.480 --> 52:20.440
And this is an aside, it's more of a personal question, you know,

52:20.440 --> 52:24.120
because a lot of people face laughter or dismissal.

52:24.120 --> 52:27.480
Well, I wasn't literally left out, but I was ignored.

52:27.480 --> 52:31.080
And nobody asked me questions and they just said it's the equivalent.

52:31.080 --> 52:31.960
People were polite.

52:31.960 --> 52:33.240
Maybe they didn't understand it.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.800
Well, I didn't explain it clearly.

52:35.800 --> 52:44.360
But I think it was just, it didn't fit the standard bottom up identity theory

52:44.360 --> 52:48.760
or supervenience theory, which was what was popular at the time,

52:48.840 --> 52:52.920
or eliminatism, I never can say, at the time.

52:53.640 --> 52:58.360
So it was ignored just as, I hate to say it, absolutely.

53:00.440 --> 53:04.680
You know, Bill Bechtel, who's a nice guy and he's very good.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.040
He's a new mechanist.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.680
He's a mechanisms all the way proponent.

53:09.320 --> 53:13.880
Well, if you look at his mechanics, they've sort of changed.

53:14.440 --> 53:18.440
And he came to Cuba, he and Adele came to Cuba with me in a conference

53:18.440 --> 53:20.600
I organized in Havana years ago.

53:21.240 --> 53:25.800
And I think his mechanism is not your grandmother's mechanism.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.200
That's true.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.640
But he's adapted, like you just said.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.640
But it's sort of like, come on, Bill, just acknowledge complex, dynamical.

53:34.600 --> 53:35.080
Can't do it.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.040
It's kind of, yeah.

53:36.040 --> 53:41.080
Well, it's hard to change your mind when you've done it so wrong.

53:41.400 --> 53:41.720
Yeah.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.760
You mentioned explanation a few minutes ago.

53:46.760 --> 53:52.120
So in dynamics and action, I think the last chapter or the next last chapter,

53:52.120 --> 53:57.400
you make a call for the necessity of explaining these sorts of myriological

53:58.440 --> 54:01.480
interactions in terms of hermeneutics or a narrative story.

54:02.040 --> 54:07.720
And in this newer book, I think I searched and I think hermeneutics was in there maybe once or

54:07.720 --> 54:08.200
twice.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.640
But you also talk, you bring up the idea of order parameters, which are kind of like

54:11.640 --> 54:14.600
these hyperparameters of dynamical systems.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.560
So I'm wondering where you stand in terms of explanation.

54:18.280 --> 54:21.240
My original thought was, well, if I could just list all the constraints and the

54:21.240 --> 54:24.200
types of constraints and how they're interacting, is that an explanation?

54:24.200 --> 54:25.640
Do I need a narrative story?

54:25.640 --> 54:27.240
Are these order parameters?

54:28.200 --> 54:35.640
What would satisfy me or a reviewer of a paper as an explanation of some cognitive

54:36.440 --> 54:37.880
function, for example?

54:37.880 --> 54:41.000
Well, I used the term hermeneutics.

54:43.480 --> 54:44.200
Another eye roll.

54:44.200 --> 54:44.680
Another eye roll.

54:44.680 --> 54:44.920
Yeah.

54:44.920 --> 54:51.400
I mean, I don't like neologism, although that hermeneutics goes back to biblical

54:51.400 --> 54:52.360
existence.

54:52.360 --> 54:52.600
Right.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.680
Well, that's, yeah, when you look it up, it's all about the Bible.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.160
But your point was to go across levels.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.680
You really need to account for these things.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.120
And narrative might be the only way to do that.

55:00.120 --> 55:06.760
Gertz's notion that I borrowed that back then from Cliff Gertz, who almost defined

55:06.760 --> 55:09.560
her hermeneutics and said, it's kind of like sailing.

55:09.560 --> 55:14.040
You have to tack from the very global to the very local, back to the global, back to

55:14.040 --> 55:18.360
the local, and see how all these constraints interact and change each other.

55:18.360 --> 55:23.560
And I love also the notion of mutual constraint satisfaction, which is what I think is happening.

55:24.280 --> 55:30.680
I think probably narrative does a way better job of accomplishing that

55:31.400 --> 55:35.560
than a Hempel and Oppenheimer, Hempel and Oppenheimer,

55:35.560 --> 55:36.920
deductive, nomological model.

55:38.600 --> 55:42.920
So to that extent, I don't think I've changed my tune.

55:42.920 --> 55:45.400
I just, I'm not using the notion of narrative.

55:45.640 --> 55:58.680
When somebody nowadays says, Proust's Madeline's, you bring up the whole constraint regime of the

55:58.680 --> 56:04.440
culture of his history, of his childhood, of his experience, that to me is almost like an

56:04.440 --> 56:13.160
order of parameter. It's a parameter in that it is the intersection of a whole bunch of different

56:13.160 --> 56:21.160
independent variables that together give you a whole tapestry of a whole different face,

56:21.160 --> 56:25.960
possibility space. Could you think of a concept as a constraint?

56:25.960 --> 56:31.560
I think I certainly think of a concept of a constraint and a framework, a cognitive framework

56:31.560 --> 56:39.320
being a whole tapestry of concepts. But in such as cognitive, it's emotional.

56:40.120 --> 56:47.560
I mean, think of, think of, think of all faction. And all faction does not

56:49.480 --> 56:59.400
go directly to the cortex initially, right? But I think a concept has a lot of

56:59.400 --> 57:02.680
characteristics that are important. One is they're multiply realizable.

57:03.560 --> 57:04.680
That's a big theme in your book.

57:04.680 --> 57:10.440
That's a big theme in my book because a triangle or triangularity as a concept

57:12.920 --> 57:15.800
is multiply realizable. It's not a one-to-one

57:16.920 --> 57:25.080
capture of the individual physical features of one instance. And I think that we know the child

57:25.080 --> 57:32.600
is able to, has understood the concept when they're able to apply that concept to an instance they

57:32.600 --> 57:38.120
haven't seen before or they were not taught about. So I think that's extremely important.

57:39.240 --> 57:47.960
I think what a local constraint regime does is it captures a type, what philosophers used to call

57:47.960 --> 57:58.280
types and universals, or a concept or what we would call an emotion. Not this emotion now here.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.320
An emotion, yeah.

58:00.360 --> 58:09.400
You know, this type of emotion. It's a bunch of constraint regimes that can be identified

58:10.360 --> 58:23.880
with a term like fear or anger or pleasure or avoid an approach. All these are code terms.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.400
To that extent, the reductions, they're code terms, but they do capture something very real.

58:31.400 --> 58:35.000
And that is a whole complex constraint regime.

58:35.960 --> 58:42.040
That kind of swirls around this, let's say, fear or something. It takes with it, you know,

58:42.040 --> 58:47.880
fight or flight, et cetera. And it's almost like a process that is itself kind of condensated to

58:47.880 --> 58:52.760
use your term earlier, but still a process and brings with it, carries with it on its back

58:53.800 --> 58:56.200
its history and all of the things associated with it.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.720
Correct, correct, correct.

58:57.720 --> 59:04.120
Yeah. Okay, so I didn't tell you this. And I know we're jumping around. I actually

59:04.120 --> 59:09.880
elicited a few guest questions from previous guests. The first one I'm going to play for you,

59:10.520 --> 59:17.080
and this is kind of kind of maybe segue into a conversation about minds and brains and then

59:17.080 --> 59:20.840
later AI. The first one I'm going to play to you is from Kevin Mitchell. I'm going to have him

59:20.840 --> 59:28.440
back on the podcast in a couple of weeks about his new book, Agents, Free Agents,

59:28.440 --> 59:29.640
How Free Well Gave Us Agency.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.160
Okay, so I'm just going to play this to you, make sure that you can hear it.

59:34.840 --> 59:39.640
Hi, Alicia. This is Kevin Mitchell. I really loved your new book, which very clearly lays out the

59:39.640 --> 59:44.920
case that constraints are causes. That is that the way things are organized is every bit as much of

59:44.920 --> 59:50.920
a cause of how they evolve through time as the basic laws and forces of physics. In particular,

59:50.920 --> 59:56.680
you highlight the really key idea of enabling constraints, especially in hierarchical systems,

59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.400
that organizing the elements at one level can enable new kinds of properties to emerge at higher

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.960
levels. You say in chapter 16 that emergent properties and powers were not merely waiting to

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.640
be revealed. They are genuine creations of path dependent, multiple constraint satisfaction.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.560
And I wanted to push back on that a little and suggest that, in fact, many of the organizations

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.920
we see in living organisms and design systems are there because of some functionality.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.480
They serve a useful purpose, and that many such functional motifs or architectures

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.480
are in fact waiting to be revealed. Under this view, a lot of the design work done by evolution

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:41.560
is actually an exploration of a kind of platonic design space, followed by retention of useful

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:47.960
motifs rather than a real creation de novo. So I wonder what you make of that notion. Thanks.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.360
All right, so that was a long one, but did you get it all?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:01:01.080
Yes, I think I got it all. That's a heck of a question, because I think logically, of course,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:11.400
there is a platonic, maybe undercurrent. But in fact, I think I'm more like Aristotle did not

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:19.960
believe that Plato's forms existed in a transcendental realm. And I want to stay agnostic about

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.400
that. But I certainly want to say that they are embodied and revealed and acted upon

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:33.960
in virtue of the confluence of these constraints occurring at a particular moment, at a particular

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.880
time. Locally. You know, I think I used to think of myself more as a platonist when I remember

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:49.720
getting into philosophy. And I got into philosophy because back in the day, a lot of schools allowed

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.120
you to, if you were not a science or math major or engineering major, you could substitute a

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.680
symbolic logic course for math requirement as one of your requirements. Anything to get rid of,

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:08.680
not to do math, which I am sorry, I did. But when I took the first philosophy course, it was like

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:15.080
discovering a whole new platonic world. It was like, you know, if I'd taken another history course,

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.240
yeah, you know, it's another king, another queen, another war, another this. But this was like a

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.760
whole new floor in a building that I'd never seen before. That's that kind of transformation.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:33.640
But more and more, I want to kind of remain grounded and rooted to

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:45.800
natural phenomena. So I really want to naturalize my arguments and speculating about a platonic

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:53.000
transcendental realm. Well, he said a kind of platonic. He hedged a little bit. Well, if that's

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:02.360
the case, then I'm perfectly happy with his book that way. So that what is the kind? Well,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:09.000
in Aristotle's case, it's the Aristotle believed in forms. It's just that he believed in embodied

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.880
forms and forms as they were. And so what I want to say is that they are created by this confluence

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:26.120
of constraints. My main concern is to make sure that they are taken seriously such that

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.560
meaning is taken seriously. In other words, the unembedding

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:42.520
organizational level gives meaning to the components. The amount of

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:52.680
glucose in a fudge brownie that I can eat and not get sick is given meaning by what my homeostasis

01:03:52.680 --> 01:04:01.160
metabolism is operating as. Well, yeah, you're okay now, but don't do it very often kind of thing.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:08.200
So that meaning is the multiple realizability of the ambiguous

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:17.480
aspect being disambiguated by context. But but not not and I use the word context very deliberately.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:23.880
I don't want to use context to mean any old environment. I want to mean the environment

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:30.920
in which a system is embedded and from which it has drawn some of its context is enabling constraints

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:43.400
and in terms of which it implements its stabilizing or top down constraints. So so

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:52.680
I want to say these are these are new and the properties are real so that

01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:04.840
yes, superconductivity and a laser has brand new properties that are real. Did they exist in a

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:10.600
pre existing platonic realm? I don't think I want to speculate on that. I'm perfectly happy

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:17.960
so long and to me real means it has causal power. It has some kind of it makes it makes a difference.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.480
If it's any phenomenal, you know, then I don't that kind of emergence. Yeah, weak emerges that

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.400
kind of mergers doesn't interest me that much. Okay, I don't want to speak for Kevin, but

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.880
kind of reformulating his question, you know, a lot of what you and the field and dynamical

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.120
systems theories talks about is these state spaces and when you're on a dynamical like when

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:46.440
you're on a trajectory within the state space, you can visit different areas within the state

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.000
space, not all of them and the constraints constrain where you can visit in the state

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.360
space, right? But if you I wonder if that that kind of platonic realm that Kevin is alluding to

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.840
is you can think of it as the state space that whether a state space is a real thing, right,

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.960
on a trajectory, later we can say that we can define the state space by the trajectory and the

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.960
boundary conditions of the possible values that it could have taken. But if it's not visiting

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.200
a particular area of the state space, would that and it did, would that then be a new thing?

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.520
Or would it be visiting a thing for which it already had a capacity for and thinking in terms

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.960
of like the functions that Kevin was talking about? I think that's what normal science is. Normal

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:35.880
science is the visiting of areas in a possibility space. It hadn't visited before, but it's pretty

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:44.680
much the same possibility space. I think that's development, biology. I think evolution. I think

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:52.840
there are times when it's the entire possibility space that is new. That's what I want to call

01:06:53.640 --> 01:07:00.840
a creative emergent characteristic. Is this related to Stuart Kaufman's adjacent possible idea?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:09.880
Maybe. Whether we go step by step going from each adjacent possible or in the case of a

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.880
Bernard cell, it doesn't seem that it's adjacent possible. It seems as though there's a threshold

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:24.040
of instability on which you need to reorganize all the parameters, all the variables. Everything

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.640
acquires a different meaning because it's in a qualitatively different space.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:37.720
It seems to me that's what happens, for example, a cell in a petri dish as opposed to a cell

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:51.160
within a tissue. It's a different qualitative phenomenon. It's the new possibility space

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.000
that I want to say is being created is an emergent quality. It's not just a new

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.960
corner in the existing possibility space. I'm perfectly happy going adjacent possible.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:13.000
This is from Max Shine, who's been on the podcast. He calls himself a systems neurobiologist,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.480
and he really tries to think across scales. A lot of his research is dealing with things

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:24.200
like how neuromodulation interacts with network level things. These things are hard to think about

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:31.880
and to research, obviously. Let me pull up this question. Hi, Alicia. This is Max Shine from

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.360
the University of Sydney. When we think about top-down constraints over bottom-up activity,

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.960
we often invoke concepts like the self. I can imagine myself being hungry and that will help

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.920
constrain the types of actions that I might take in order to find food and satiate my hunger.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.120
There are a number of really fascinating situations, like the so-called flow state

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.080
and also states with pharmacological manipulation, when the sense of self can dissolve. Yet you

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.960
still see quite coherent cross-scale behavior. People don't just crumble into a heap. They can

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:09.720
still perform music and sports at a high level or have a nice walk through the forest. My question

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:15.560
is, do you view the sense of self as an illusion, or do you think of it just as one of many ways in

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.720
which a system that's organized across scales can be organized? Thanks. Max wants to know

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.840
whether his question was better than Kevin's. No, I'm just kidding. No, they're very good, both of

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:37.080
them. You know, I keep thinking how, with Gazaniga's experiments with the cut corpus callosum,

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:44.360
that there were a whole bunch of weird things like we discovered about somebody was shown an

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.920
image to the right eye, another image to the left eye, and people confabulated.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:55.400
And so you wonder if in these cases where the self seems to dissolve,

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:05.400
there's nevertheless enough connectivity to maintain a coherent structure.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.920
Structure being the self? What's the structure? Yes, I would say a dynamic, a whole dynamic

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:24.360
constraint that keeps being you. To a lesser example, I think people who sleep walk or who are

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:31.560
hypnotized will nevertheless not bump into the coffee table. They go around the coffee table.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.520
But these could be sort of on the automatic side of behavior, right? So there's automatic and

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.240
controlled processes. Right, right. So that, well, but there is control enough that you walk and you

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:50.920
don't, you maintain an awareness. Right, but maybe the flow state would be, because Max mentioned the

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:56.200
flow state, when that is like when your automatic processes take over, but you still barely have

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.080
some sort of control and you're in a heightened, you're trying really hard and it kind of switches

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.720
and then you're watching yourself do it kind of. Yeah, yeah. And you wonder whether we can,

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:12.680
could that be a bit like these optical illusions where you can see one side and not the other?

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:21.080
And so to what extent do those constraints, to what extent do those levels of awareness

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:29.480
conflict with each other, can mutually support each other and reinforce each other or not?

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:36.680
Again, I think that the next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.600
modes of constraint that are all operating simultaneously. As I started writing this,

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.960
all of a sudden things like entrenchment, like buffering, I have a whole chapter of where I

01:11:51.960 --> 01:12:01.080
catalog some of these buffering and entrenchment and scapholds and all of these that seem to

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.920
all be operating simultaneously and that certainly a lot of the social scientists have understood

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:13.960
very, very well. In public policy, oh look, have we entrenched this rule in regulation,

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:21.800
it will hang on for way longer and avoid any kind of attempts to remove it as a regulation that

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:30.920
I live in DC, that's why I think about it. And so you wonder, starting to map things in terms of

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:38.680
constraints, in terms of possibility spaces, might start to illustrate how all of these work and

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:48.280
the possibility of therapeutic intervention as a result because that's what all this recent talk

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:56.680
about psychedelics. No, you wonder to what extent a psychedelic literally disintegrates the

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:04.840
constraint regime of the self, of the pre-established coordinates and parameters and so on.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:17.880
Exactly, the ego. You wonder to what extent that is a disruption of the constraint regime,

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:25.400
more than the disruption of vision or, yeah, vision too, you get maybe hallucinations,

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.480
but that's not as interesting as, you know, I go like that and I push my elbow, I can hallucinate

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.600
all these standard, optical illusions, we don't call them hallucinations, we call them optical

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:42.040
illusions, right? So at what point do we start looking at this and the answer is that's going

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:49.560
to take a lot of very interesting research, kind of like Ramachandran's famous example with the

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:56.280
phantom limb and the mirror and so on. How is that possible unless there is some

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:09.400
control regime that is modulating the sense of pain that incorporates, you know, I can imagine

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.000
being in an automobile accident and having my arm mangled or I hear these descriptions of these

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.680
IEDs and you know, picking up chalkboard scraping and things like that. Correct, correct, and so

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:26.200
you go, well, here's everything together because if you didn't have the visual input, if you didn't

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.400
have the conceptual understanding of what this means, on and on and on, you wonder if the pain

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:41.560
would be, would be different. And so how all of these constraint regimes interact and what are

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.640
the necessary inputs at each point to maintain that particular constraint regime so that then

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:56.280
you have a global sense of self that I'm not sure we're all that coherent when every in every day.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.240
I don't feel coherent, but my wife would beg to differ.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:07.800
Weird enough to be operating, but it's not like, you know, if I heard something horrible happening

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:16.840
outside, I wouldn't react and I even even in a sense of flow, I think there's enough cognitive

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:24.120
control that if some horrendous perturbation, the standard answer is you drive home and you

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.880
don't even know if you went through that red light or you don't because you drive home in that

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.920
and that path every day and you don't even think about it. But certainly if a child ran across

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:42.120
your front of the then you'd immediately get out of that flow and react. So there's how much

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:49.560
control in which case, how can we use it therapeutically for obsessive compulsive disorders,

01:15:49.560 --> 01:16:02.600
for PTSD, for all of these, I think those are all disorders disorders of constraint regimes. So

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:08.520
regulation of regulate, it's a it's the regulatory system that's shot, it's like the on switches

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:15.000
on all the time, or the it is modulating it the way it's supposed to modulate it. So these are

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.680
regulatory meaning constraint regime issues, not structure, not function. It's the regulatory

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:31.240
constraint regime that modulates these other two that that we don't understand that much about, I

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:41.400
think, all CD, PTSD, chronic anxiety or depression, all of these that are sort of I think we've pretty

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.080
much taken care of, no, we haven't taken care of it, but we understand how it worked the low

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:50.680
hanging fruit of the, you know, yeah, well, you know, the glucose is out of whack, that causes,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:57.880
but where stress or epigenetic stress can be inherited several generations down,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.840
that's a regulatory issue. Then that's what methylation does. And that's what I think

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:08.200
a lot of these constraint regimes do. So there's this phenomenon sort of piggybacking on what

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:13.240
Mac was asking about, there's this phenomena in psychedelics, right, you can use them

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.560
therapeutically. And in some cases, like near death experiences serve as therapeutic events,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.280
and people come back kind of different, right? Correct. And is this a way to is one way to

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.360
imagine that, and maybe even electroshock therapy is another example, I'm not sure if that's a good

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.280
example, but yeah, yeah, you have all these kind of entrenched constraints locally in your brain

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.840
in your mind and operating things. And then when you so I'm sure you're aware of the psychedelic

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.640
study that when you administer psychedelics, often what happens is there's higher connectivity

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.520
in your brain, less modularity, right? And could could you maybe there's a speculation,

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:52.360
but would you think of that as just resetting all of the attractor states and then when they

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.520
come back up, they can come back in slightly different ways, they might not probably and it

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:03.960
might open up, it might make the interfaces more porous to contemporary experience. So

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:10.760
you don't have to be worried that the explosion is the IED, or that that that you don't have to

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:18.120
wash your hands a million times in order to because you know, yes, I think that the that more and

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:27.880
more as we read these kinds of novel forms of therapy that they are, they usually are targeting

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:38.680
issues of regulation. Really, to me, fascinating. Yeah, this is then starting to study how exactly

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:48.440
that connectiome stays stays whole. Strain dome connect, they all because all the connectome,

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:54.760
the proteomics and all the rest of them, all the ohms, all the ohms then are modulated by the whole

01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:03.000
constrained dome of the entire. But that also includes the constraints of your society. You

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.600
know, I love traveling to Europe. When I travel to Europe, the weight of history is very obvious

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:17.800
compared to the United States. You ask somebody at a restaurant in anywhere in Europe, and how do

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:26.120
you prepare this dish? Half of the time, it's the way it's always been prepared. Yeah. Whereas in

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.040
America, if you do it the same way as you did it six months ago, oh, you're stale, you're boring,

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.560
you're old, it's encouraged the constraint regime. Now, that's not to say that they're not all sorts

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.840
of problems for marginalized societies where the constraint regimes are very clearly kept and

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.880
trenched very deliberately. Yes, I understand that. But it's all a question of the constraint

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.240
coming from the culture as well. That's why in the four E's, the whole, for example, their emphasis

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.440
on affordances. This is the, so I don't know if we said earlier, this is like the inactive embodied,

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:03.240
what are the other two? The four E's. Anyways, embodied cognition. Correct. Yeah.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:10.200
Embodied cognition, which Andy Clark and Paolo and even Merlin Dallen, where about when? Extended.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.600
Extended embodied and acted. There we go. We got three out of four.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:22.280
You know, I always say, I frankly do not think that a chair affords opportunities for seating for

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:28.840
a lot of people. You hear stories of folks from, I don't know which culture who were brought to

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:36.040
the United States, and they will stand on the toilet because it didn't occur. And I don't think

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:43.640
a tatami mat affords opportunities for sleeping for those of us who were not raised in a Japanese

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:51.960
school. I mean, affordances are clearly embodied, embedded in the constraint of the society in which

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:57.720
you grew up, or you know about. Embedded. You just said the fourth E. It's embedded. It is. Okay.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:05.080
And I think how things get, see, I don't think you have embeddedness in Newtonian science. Right.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.320
Things are just plunked into a featureless space and time in Newtonian science.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.240
Yeah. Well, that's the beauty of it too, because it's simplicity, right? It's

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:22.600
spherical cows. It's in a vacuum. It's, yeah. Correct. But it's featureless. Whereas embeddedness

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:29.880
is you're really embedded, meaning that embedding layer affects you,

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:37.560
and you are a part of that embedding dynamic as well. It goes both ways.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.600
All right. I want to ask you, because we're coming up on time, and I have a thousand other things

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.440
to ask you, but let's stay on brain and mind for just one more question here. And then I have some,

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.400
I want to ask you about artificial intelligence and your thoughts on that. So thinking about

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:59.320
dimensionality and going up in these a myriological level, right? So a lot of this modern neuroscience

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.160
is reducing the dimensionality of your brain activity into these low dimensional manifold

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.320
structures, and then the dynamics come in when you have a trajectory along that manifold.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.280
And a lot of some people think that that's, well, maybe that's the closest thing that we

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:17.480
can get to right now in describing, in relating brains to minds. And then, but marrying that idea

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:25.080
with the idea of capacity. And this goes back to Kevin Mitchell's question. What I want to think

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.280
is that I'm not a low dimensional mind. I'm a, I have a high capacity, right? Is there a way,

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.360
like, is there a story I can tell myself that I'm going from the high dimensionality

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:41.640
brain activity that I have moving quote unquote up a level to mind? And that can, that's a messy

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.400
statement I know. Can I increase my dimensionality? Do I have to reduce it?

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:54.360
No, I think, for example, letters form words. I think of a word as

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.160
a higher dimension. You can do more with those words. You have options available in words

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.400
and keep going sentences. But that's certainly true for atoms, molecules.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.040
Is the higher dimension, does that, do you mean, is it a higher

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.320
possibility space? Or is it, I guess that's kind of equated to higher dimensionality.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:27.720
Yeah, that's what I think of. It's a higher possibility space whose coordinates are relational.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:36.600
Okay. And if that's the case, then you have a way higher possibility space. So that's why,

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.000
for example, the example I used in the book, which is Manté's understanding of how these chimps

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:59.800
are able to understand. Because the possibility space they have forged is a task defined

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:09.400
possibility space. But it's of a different type. Exactly. The type is simpler in that you have one

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:16.200
concept of a type that captures all the way. You have to look at the colored dots, you have to

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:23.960
look at the movement of the dots and so on. But it's the task that is defined. And the behavior is

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:31.720
executed in terms of that task. Is that lower dimensional? I think it's way more sophisticated

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:38.440
than it would just in terms of the intensity of the flash of light. But here the task is a huge

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:49.320
constraint as well. Yes, but it's a much more complex dynamic than would be the physical

01:24:49.400 --> 01:25:03.400
features alone, right? Yeah. So it's sometimes people say that complex systems are a simplified

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.600
description of what's going on. Sometimes I think of it more like streamlined. Okay. The

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:18.040
streamlining gives you characteristics that you wouldn't have otherwise. And so the organization

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:24.040
of that monkey's brain in response to training, which would be the neighboring constraints.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:35.480
All right. It seems to me opens up a world for the monkey that may be captured by

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:44.440
the essential characters of the task, but not of the pure physical component alone. So in that sense,

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:50.520
I think of it as an expansion. Chemistry can do more than physics. Biology can do more than

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:55.960
chemistry, even though they are nonetheless not violating any of the underlying laws. It's the

01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.920
organization and the complexity of that organization that opens up possibilities, I think.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.760
All right. So my mind could be more cool than my brain activity. I could feel better about my

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:15.080
mind than my brain. Probably, yeah. Brain gets really... And I think that's true. I think as

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:23.160
people age, they get worse at tasks that are just repetitive. Oh, I thought that's all they could

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.880
do are tasks that are repetitive. But I think understanding connections and understanding

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:35.400
nuances and things like that. Oh, I'm thinking way aged. You're thinking like our age, maybe.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.560
Well, I'm thinking of the difference between...

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:50.600
I don't know. It's more like difference between understanding and just pure speed of activity.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.880
But my grandmother, who's 99, she cannot learn a new card game.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.440
Right? She can play bridge, but she can't learn a new card game. But that's 99.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.640
Yeah. So maybe that's even a different type.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.680
Any one or maybe she's not interested in it. Maybe. Come on, grandma.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.080
Yeah. But I see it's a different kind of understanding. I don't know. Would you call that

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.720
wisdom? Well, hopefully, I think that's what philosophers were looking for. Yeah. And the

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.720
question is, but I don't think it automatically happens as you get older. An awful lot of old

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:26.360
fools around there. Sure are. Yeah. Sure are a lot of old fools out there.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.680
Okay, Alicia, I don't want to take all day for you. So I want to switch to artificial

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.360
intelligence here for a few moments. Are you good on time for a few more minutes?

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.920
Great. This is a lot of fun for me. No, me too. So I was actually kind of surprised

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.160
in revisiting dynamics in action. And you go into it in a little more detail, I think,

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:54.200
in context changes, everything that you refer to like neural network examples. And in both books,

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.760
you talk about the semantics that come along with syntax when you put recurrence in these

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:05.160
neural networks. And you cite Jeffrey Hinton and actually Michael Plout who or David Plout, who was

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.400
one of the authors on that paper, I did a course with him. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.240
But I always call them hidden plot and shallots because hidden and shallots probably plot and

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:20.600
shallots are hidden. But they're that that I will go ahead and finish up. Anyway, again,

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.160
I'm cute, but I shouldn't. Yeah. Well, so given what we've been talking about and, you know,

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:31.560
these interlocking systems and how important that is for complexity and the constraints,

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.880
given all that, I'm slightly surprised. And you talked about a constraint of closure from

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.080
Massimo and me. Moreno and Massimo. Moreno and Massimo, which I love that book also.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.360
But that is very specific to like biological systems and not just biological systems,

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.840
but complex systems in the natural world. And it's not those types of things that we've been

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.480
talking about are not built into neural networks or only some of them are because maybe you talk

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:03.480
about the recurrence and how that can lead to semantics. So anyway, I was slightly surprised

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.840
that I started reading about like the neural networks because I thought, oh, well, a lot of

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.480
the things that it seemed to be important in these complex dynamics that give rise to our

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.480
rich mental worlds and rich ecologies and stuff are missing in the artificial intelligence systems,

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.160
or maybe they're not. And I wonder what you think is missing in current AI.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:27.000
I think what's missing in current AI is context. In other words, somatic, somatic.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.680
Oh, okay. Well, because context, I think, is it context changes? No, no, that's the title of your

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.640
book. All you need is, all you need is attention, which is a different form of context. And like

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.960
the modern transformer, which underlies all these large language models is all about context

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:48.840
in terms of word. But it does not have somatic information. It does not include

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:58.360
historical context. Well, this is how it's changed over time. So I think you need,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:07.320
it does not include social, except indirectly as the social aspects get revealed in languages.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:16.280
Otherwise, you don't have direct somatic interaction. Now, once you have these things,

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:23.480
once you have the chip, or the video chip, in a machine that you kind of

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:32.360
raise as a child with all the video, with all the video, with all the auditory, with all that.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.200
You're actually, you're speaking exactly to my previous guest. I haven't released this yet,

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:41.080
but he raises artificial agent chicks exactly like newborn chicks to look at

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.640
this developmental trajectory of return. Which people did with chimps, remember? They

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:52.680
tried that without, did not turn out very well. Because at some point it didn't scale up. Now,

01:30:52.680 --> 01:31:05.400
the question is whether the, but I think that if in fact, we have, we have eons of evolution

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:15.800
behind us, of the planet of the, of life and so on, you wonder if you can short-circuit any of that

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:22.760
and get. Right. Well, we seem to be partially. Well, I mean, I certainly want to say a sunflower

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:29.320
is aware of the sun. Okay. Tropism is a form of awareness. I don't care what you call it.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:37.080
Is it self-awareness? No, I don't think so. I wouldn't want to say that. So it's the thought

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.640
example of the, you know, which the elephants and so on. Now they're saying crows can do it and so on.

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:47.560
So is that, what is it like to be a crow as well as a bat? So at what point do you start saying,

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:52.440
well, this is not just, it recognizes its body with something and you wonder,

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:58.760
or it really recognizes itself as a self or is there a self in the, in the

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:03.880
chimp that can point to the screen when it sees its image with a thought on its forehead.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.960
At each point, I would say it's an emergent property, but certainly I've got to tell you those

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:15.560
hint and plot and chalices. I had been playing around with these problems for ages and I had

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:22.120
not sat down to write dynamics in action until I read hint and plot and chalice, which at the time

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:29.080
was, I went, the fact that, that, that's really simple. I mean, we're talking how many decades ago,

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:35.800
neural network was able to, according to chalice, I think it was when somebody asked him, how do

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:41.560
you explain that it produces the errors of deep dyslexia, not surface dyslexia? And his answer

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:48.360
was, I can only explain it by saying it self-organized a semantic attractor. So semantics

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:54.200
would be an emergent property that changes the output. That's what I, why we would call it

01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:00.120
strong emergence. That's what I, why I would call it top down. It changes the probability

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:07.160
distribution of what its behavior is such that it produces an output that reflects the semantics

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:14.920
of the attractor. But so AI does not have closure of constraints. So this is another idea that,

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:21.000
you know, it's not self-generating. It's, it's byproducts don't feedback in that sense, or,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:28.040
or maybe you have a different outcome. Now, now. Now it doesn't. Exactly. Okay. That's the question.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:35.240
The question always is not, not what's practically doable today, but in principle. Sure, sure. But

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.000
I mean, are we going to have to emulate life then? Are we going to have to have artificial

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.280
life to have what, whatever the hell real artificial, real intelligence, real artificial

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:50.600
intelligence is, right? And that's again, an answer for the constraint on how many of these

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:57.720
constraints are really not necessary for, for intelligent systems that would assist a neurologist

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:03.640
or a, you know, maybe you don't need experience, you know, emotion or you know, I mean, I don't know.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:12.760
So, but my, but what I find fascinating is that even without somatic input, without any of this

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:20.040
other stuff, the kinds of errors that people talk, oh, they hallucinate, that it's so similar to the

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:28.760
kinds of errors that you got with the split brain gazaniga issues, the thing is making up

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.720
some kind of story that would make all the inputs it has so far coherent.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:43.720
Correct? Even if it is, well, that's a typo. I've seen one where the output, well, the people

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.400
were, the trainer was saying, no, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right. At one point

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.800
it said, well, you know, that wasn't just a typo. Excuse me. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:01.400
What ideas or concepts do you find yourself like revisiting the most when you're working? What

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.000
ideas do you have? Do you revisit and are unsure about or think you need to grapple with more?

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:16.520
I think the notion of how do you account for the emergent properties,

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:23.480
characteristics in each particular case in each particular individual? How do we

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:29.720
how? Is there any hope to be able to map this other than say, well, if each one is unique,

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.480
then well, then that's the end of science. That's it. I mean, we need some kind of general

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:44.760
formal. We both winced there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how to phrase it. Is it a back,

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:52.360
forth, hermeneutic kind of multiple constraint satisfaction? How does that work? And I love

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:59.160
that example that I got from Kusler and Koenig, I think their book way back went on psychology of,

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.280
you know, imagine you're renting out an apartment and the apartment has one large

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.440
wall and it's got a window here and so on. And this is going to be your bedroom and so

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.000
you're constrained because the bed has to fit against maybe a wall, but then the chest doesn't

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.040
fit because the other wall. So it's a question of multiple constraint satisfaction. So do you

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:25.240
turn the chest of drawers into a night table because that's the only place it fits. And so

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.680
you're adjusting it and it's constant adjustment, but that's what you see in dynamical systems.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:38.440
That's the kind of meta stability that someone riding a bike or someone on a tightrope, you

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:45.400
know, one of these people going on a highway or a tightrope. It's not the kind of equilibrium of

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:52.520
your old time, near equilibrium thermodynamics. It's a meta stability where it's a constant

01:36:52.520 --> 01:37:03.560
adjustment of constraints. Correct? And so how do we, is there any hope to be able to map this

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:10.280
in a way that provides some kind of general guidance as to how this is going to play out

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.360
in a particular situation? How much do you have to know of the background? How much, you know,

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.920
do you have to know of the context to be, you know, and I think, I think that's one good thing

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:29.480
about that Aristotle had said was, you don't, you can't teach law, medicine, and ethics,

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:36.120
because those are eminently context dependent compared to science. So, so how do you do it?

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.560
You can only do it through apprenticeships, because the apprentice gives you this. And

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:49.880
when I talk class, this is what I do. You know, you get a feel for it. So, so is that what a good

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:56.120
coach in a business does? Because they've got enough of a feel for it. They might not be able

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:04.040
to formalize it into a standard algorithm, but they've got a feel for the situation that therefore

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.600
can provide guidance. This is why a coach doesn't need to be more of an expert than the expert as

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:15.880
well, I imagine. You know, you have to have a feel for it. And how do you, how do you formalize the

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:22.200
feel of something? And that's what, that's what a, that's what a master musician does. I just

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:28.280
finished reading a book by Adam Gopnik called The Real Work, and it's about the mystery of mastery.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.640
Okay. Oh, it's fun to read. And so he talks about, you know, how do you,

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:42.200
is the master seeing something that's at a different level? And Hofstadter used to talk

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:49.080
about that when he talked about the chess master, who's shown a chess game in progress for a few

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.680
seconds, and then they're asked to reproduce the feel for the board. They would always put

01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.440
the pieces in different locations than what was actually presented to them. But the strategy,

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:07.080
the strategic position, white and black were in, remained the same. Interesting. So what are they

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:13.480
seeing? That the newbie doesn't see. The newbie is worried about

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.840
playing the piano one finger here, one finger there. Simulating each move. That's like the physical

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:28.680
signal that's coming in. Obviously mastery means that you see a level of organization

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:35.640
that in the case of chess's strategy, in the case of magician is the

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.280
prestidigitation, it's the magic. And what is it that you're seeing that then matters?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.120
And I think that's the constraint regime that we're all trying to figure out. Why is it that the

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:58.360
same person that the soldier next to that one didn't get PTSD? They were in the same explosion.

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:04.040
Because they were more of a man. See, that was the old tradition. It had to be an internal

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:10.760
and internal characteristic. Whereas what I'm saying is what are the interdependent constraints

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:18.200
that make a difference? You began that with like wondering if there is no hope,

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.840
or if there is hope. Is there hope? Do you feel optimistic? Look, you've got to assume

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:31.000
that we're all humans. So there's got to be some commonalities somewhere. At what scale,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.560
at what granularity? It's hard to say because you look at families and you see kids from the same

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.680
family raised by the same friends, going to the same school, and they're so different. So you wonder,

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:49.480
how does that happen? Is that all in birth order? I mean, there was a time where people

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.920
talked a lot about that. If temporal constraints matter, then temporal order has to matter at

01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.440
some point. But to what extent, to what degree? I think that's what the... What's fun about this

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:08.200
is that there's a whole new possibility space of research that opens up when you look in terms of

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.120
constraints rather than looking in terms of... When the people were into the genome, I thought,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.120
people are assuming again, one disease per genome. Looking back, that's crazy.

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:23.480
That's never going to happen. I knew that that was the case.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.480
You knew that. I didn't know that. I mean, yeah, because I had this linear thought,

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:33.000
that's the way I was raised. And so... We all were raised that way. That's what we all assume.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.400
But now the question is, well, is it going to be one protein fold per disease or per disease?

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:46.200
So at what point is it... No, it's the context that makes it fall this way rather than that,

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.680
and therefore gets this functionality rather than that, even though it's the same string of amino

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:57.000
acids. All right, so it's the confirmation. So what is it in the context that makes it conform a

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.560
certain way? Well, in the case of development, we know that one cell in one part of the fertilized

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.840
egg is the one that... Because if it's in that location, that's what's going to

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:13.400
turn into the first neural crest. Is that pure random? Then that raises, that brings randomness

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:19.400
there rather than at the quantum level. So how does that work? Who knows? But it's fun to think

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:26.760
about. It opens up a whole new way of looking at a whole level of organization that we thought was

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:32.840
just illusory or just epistemically convenient. But if we really say, all right, now let's pretend

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:37.320
just for the sake of argument, it's real. How does this play out? What does this mean? What are the

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.280
implications? I mean, it's not just one level, though. God, I now want to ask you, what's beyond

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:50.760
consciousness? What's... It's turtles all the way up. I just used that. It's everywhere. It's the

01:42:50.760 --> 01:43:01.080
whole tangled... It's an entangled bank that's... But it's not random. People use the word still,

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:07.640
use the word chaos when they refer to things like the Lorenz attractor to mean it's this sort...

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.920
No, it's just a high level of organization that we didn't appreciate before. That Lorenz

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:18.680
butterfly is very organized. Are you kidding? But it never repeats the same trajectory twice

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:24.040
because of its path dependence and so on. So we have to understand what are the constraints that

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:29.880
lead to that higher level of organization and how does that work? Well, Alicia, in terms of

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.960
possibility spaces, it just occurred to me that if the science, the philosophy of constraints,

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.680
is a possibility space, your book Context Changes Everything filled the hell out of that space.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.920
I'm glad that we got to visit some of those places today. I really appreciate it. Thank you for

01:43:46.920 --> 01:44:02.840
asking me. It was fun. A lot of fun. Thank you so much. Thank you.
