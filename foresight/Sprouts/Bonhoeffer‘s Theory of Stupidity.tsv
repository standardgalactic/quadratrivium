0	8000	In the darkest chapter of German history, during a time when incited mobs threw stones into the windows of innocent shop owners,
8000	21000	and women and children were cruelly humiliated in the open, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a young pastor, began to speak publicly against the atrocities that the regime had produced.
21000	33000	After years of trying to change people's minds, Dietrich Bonhoeffer came home one evening and his own father had to tell him that two men were waiting in his room to take him away.
34000	44000	In prison, Bonhoeffer began to reflect on how his country of poets and thinkers had turned into a collective of cowards, crooks and criminals.
44000	51000	Eventually, he concluded that the root of the problem was not malice, but stupidity.
55000	63000	In his famous Letters from Prison, Bonhoeffer argued that stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice,
63000	70000	because while one may protest against evil, it can be exposed and prevented by the use of force.
70000	77000	Against stupidity, we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here.
77000	80000	Reasons fall on deaf ears.
82000	94000	Facts that contradict a stupid person's prejudgment simply need not be believed, and when they are irrefutable, they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental.
95000	104000	In all this, the stupid person is self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.
106000	112000	For that reason, greater caution is caught for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one.
112000	118000	If we want to know how to get the better of stupidity, we must seek to understand its nature.
119000	126000	This much is certain. Stupidity is, in essence, not an intellectual defect, but a moral one.
126000	137000	There are human beings who are remarkably agile intellectually, yet stupid, and others who are intellectually dull, yet anything but stupid.
138000	148000	The impression one gains is not so much that stupidity is a congenital defect, but that, under certain circumstances, people are made stupid,
148000	151000	or rather, they allow this to happen to them.
152000	158000	People who live in solitude manifest this defect less frequently than individuals in groups,
158000	165000	and so it would seem that stupidity is perhaps less a psychological than a sociological problem.
167000	173000	It becomes apparent that every strong upsurge of power, be it of a political or religious nature,
173000	181000	infects a large part of humankind with stupidity, almost as if this is a sociological psychological law,
181000	185000	where the power of the one needs the stupidity of the other.
186000	193000	The process at work here is not that particular human capacities, such as intellect, suddenly fail.
193000	201000	Instead, it seems that under the overwhelming impact of rising power, humans are deprived of their inner independence,
201000	206000	and, more or less consciously, give up an autonomous position.
207000	214000	The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us from the fact that he is not independent.
214000	220000	In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with him as a person,
220000	225000	but with slogans, catch words, and the like that have taken possession of him.
227000	233000	He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and is abused in his very being.
233000	243000	Having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil, incapable of seeing that it is evil.
244000	250000	Only an act of liberation, not instruction, can overcome stupidity.
250000	261000	Here, we must come to terms with the fact that in most cases, a genuine internal liberation becomes possible only when external liberation has preceded it.
262000	268000	Until then, we must abandon all attempts to convince the stupid person.
269000	279000	Bonhoeffer died due to his involvement in a plot against Adolf Hitler at dawn on the 9th of April 1945 at Flossenberg concentration camp,
279000	284000	just two weeks before soldiers from the United States liberated the camp.
286000	291000	Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.
292000	299000	The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children, Bonhoeffer once said.
