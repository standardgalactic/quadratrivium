In the darkest chapter of German history, during a time when incited mobs threw stones into the windows of innocent shop owners,

00:08.000 --> 00:21.000
and women and children were cruelly humiliated in the open, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a young pastor, began to speak publicly against the atrocities that the regime had produced.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
After years of trying to change people's minds, Dietrich Bonhoeffer came home one evening and his own father had to tell him that two men were waiting in his room to take him away.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
In prison, Bonhoeffer began to reflect on how his country of poets and thinkers had turned into a collective of cowards, crooks and criminals.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Eventually, he concluded that the root of the problem was not malice, but stupidity.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
In his famous Letters from Prison, Bonhoeffer argued that stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice,

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
because while one may protest against evil, it can be exposed and prevented by the use of force.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Against stupidity, we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Reasons fall on deaf ears.

01:22.000 --> 01:34.000
Facts that contradict a stupid person's prejudgment simply need not be believed, and when they are irrefutable, they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
In all this, the stupid person is self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
For that reason, greater caution is caught for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
If we want to know how to get the better of stupidity, we must seek to understand its nature.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
This much is certain. Stupidity is, in essence, not an intellectual defect, but a moral one.

02:06.000 --> 02:17.000
There are human beings who are remarkably agile intellectually, yet stupid, and others who are intellectually dull, yet anything but stupid.

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
The impression one gains is not so much that stupidity is a congenital defect, but that, under certain circumstances, people are made stupid,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
or rather, they allow this to happen to them.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
People who live in solitude manifest this defect less frequently than individuals in groups,

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
and so it would seem that stupidity is perhaps less a psychological than a sociological problem.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
It becomes apparent that every strong upsurge of power, be it of a political or religious nature,

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
infects a large part of humankind with stupidity, almost as if this is a sociological psychological law,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
where the power of the one needs the stupidity of the other.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
The process at work here is not that particular human capacities, such as intellect, suddenly fail.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
Instead, it seems that under the overwhelming impact of rising power, humans are deprived of their inner independence,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and, more or less consciously, give up an autonomous position.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us from the fact that he is not independent.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with him as a person,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
but with slogans, catch words, and the like that have taken possession of him.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and is abused in his very being.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
Having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil, incapable of seeing that it is evil.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Only an act of liberation, not instruction, can overcome stupidity.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
Here, we must come to terms with the fact that in most cases, a genuine internal liberation becomes possible only when external liberation has preceded it.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Until then, we must abandon all attempts to convince the stupid person.

04:29.000 --> 04:39.000
Bonhoeffer died due to his involvement in a plot against Adolf Hitler at dawn on the 9th of April 1945 at Flossenberg concentration camp,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
just two weeks before soldiers from the United States liberated the camp.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children, Bonhoeffer once said.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
