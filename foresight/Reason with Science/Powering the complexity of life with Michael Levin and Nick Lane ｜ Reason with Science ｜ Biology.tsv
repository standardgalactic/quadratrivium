0	15680	Hi, everyone. Welcome to Reason with Science. I'm your host, Jigendra. This episode is with
15680	22320	Michael Levin and Nick Lane. Mike is a professor in the biology department at Tufts University,
22320	27840	where he studies the role of bioelectric signals in regulating development and regeneration in
27840	33520	animals. Nick is a professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London.
34080	40160	His work is focused on the fundamental processes that underlie the origin and evolution of life.
40800	46000	In this conversation, we talk about major transitions and key innovations in biology,
46640	53440	information in biological systems, bioelectricity, emergence of eukaryotes, and importance of
53440	59120	bioelectric signals to create artificial life. Enjoy the conversation, share, and subscribe
59120	66560	to support the podcast. Thank you for listening. Hi, Mike and hi, Nick. Welcome back. Hi. Thank you.
66560	74800	Hey, thanks for having me. Yeah, so, I mean, the kind of theme that I had in my mind is kind of
74800	81520	like talk about emergence of life. But of course, I don't want to ask you to define life because I
81520	87440	know your response. Both of you have been standing on this kind of response that life
87440	95280	is a continuum. So we can kind of take it from there. But when we think of emergence of life,
95280	101600	there is certainly a kind of transition we can think of. It's a transition of chemistry to biology.
101600	107120	And both of the frameworks that you guys are studying, I mean, the origin of life or developmental
107120	114160	biology, both of them, they are kind of this example of this transition. So let's take that
114160	122800	big picture view. How do you look at this continuum? How we can think of that continuum
124080	132640	depending upon a bacteria or a mold or a planaria living in a pond? So let's start with Nick.
133520	138880	Okay. I mean, you say a transition from chemistry to life. And I think both Mike and I would
140000	146880	probably emphasize electrochemistry or at least is borderline physics really in terms of what
146880	154080	we're talking about. And so the key, I suppose, in my mind is not a single moment where you
155280	158640	switch from one thing into another one. Even when you introduce information, there isn't a
158640	165040	single moment. But there's a process. And that process is partly over time and it's partly
165040	171200	structured. And the thing that I like most, I think, about the kind of environments I talk
171200	175520	about for the origin of life, which are mostly hydrothermal systems. But the nice thing about
175520	180720	those systems is really that they have a structure which is cell like. And they can template cells
180720	189520	that in effect can grow within them. And when I say cell like, the key attribute in my own mind
189520	196640	to cells is the charge on the membrane. It's really that that defines the cell from its environment
197440	202000	and which coordinates everything that's happening inside the cell. And so at the origin of life,
202000	206240	you have effectively a structure with charges on barriers that are cell like structures.
206960	210880	And it gives you this as a setup from the very beginning. And then there's lots of
210880	216480	interesting questions that we haven't really answered yet. But how does charge organize
216480	219680	things? It certainly does. But to what extent and in what ways?
221520	228800	Mike? Yeah, I think what I'd like to do is take, I mean, I agree with everything Nick just said,
228800	235280	but I will maybe take one step back and kind of talk about this question of physics versus
235360	244480	chemistry versus biology. I've come more and more to the view that what we're really talking about
244480	250720	in almost all of these problems has to be cashed out with respect to an observer. So to me,
250720	255120	the question of whether something is physics, or is it chemistry, or is it biology, or is it
255120	261280	psychology, or is it what you know, what is it to me, right? Is it should be specified relative
261280	266160	to an observer who chooses a particular lens? So one experience that I often have is that
267040	272400	I'll describe some amazing thing that the biological systems do and people say, wow,
272400	279120	this is super cool. And then if I happen to have the mechanism for it, I will say, here's the
279120	284800	mechanism. And then people say, oh, well, well, that's just physics. Well, that's not memory.
284800	288800	I can see how that works. That's not memory. That's just physics. And so there's this amazing
289760	296000	kind of moving of the goalposts that basically all of the interesting stuff, right? The cognition,
296000	301840	intelligence, memory, decision making, problem solving, meaning, all of these things,
301840	307040	the minute you show some sort of a mechanism underneath, then some people say, wow, that's
307040	312320	not that wasn't it at all. What I really mean is this other thing, this is just physics, right?
312320	318640	So what I prefer is this idea that you have a set of different tools that you can bring to
318640	324000	bear, and you can take anything and look at it and say, well, that's physics. And guess what
324000	329120	you'll see? You'll see physics. You bring your voltmeter, right? If you bring your ruler and your
329120	334080	way scale and stuff like that, guess what you'll see? You'll see physics. And if you bring other
334080	340720	kinds of tools that are conceptual tools that are better suited to recognize agency, so maybe you
340720	346400	bring something that recognizes virtual governors or it recognizes a decision making or something,
346400	349920	well, then maybe you'll find that and maybe you won't. So it's an empirical process, right?
349920	355520	So that's kind of my view on this. I think anything can be seen as just physics and many things
355520	360160	can also be seen as something much more and looked at at a higher level.
360160	366400	Yeah. I mean, actually the origin of life is kind of an exemplar of exactly that because there are
366400	373840	people who come from completely different disciplines in terms of training. So coming
373840	379520	as a physicist or as a chemist or as a geologist or as a cosmologist or a biologist and so on.
379520	386880	And you realize when you try to talk to people with a very different background that you don't
386880	393600	share the same language. And however much you try to be a scientist, you find that you're conditioned
393600	399840	and you have some blinkers on which make you see the problem with that toolkit. And half of the
399840	406560	problem that I have in working on the origin of life is to try and dismantle my own toolkit and
406560	411840	replace it with, well, just try to be a scientist. Just try to bring all these things together because
411840	417760	it is a question in all of those disciplines. And that's just the beginning of life. And once
417760	421440	we get into life, it just becomes more sophisticated and more of a problem. It's just that you can
421440	426880	see it really clearly at the origin of life. Yeah. Yeah. I think the, I mean, of course, it's,
426960	431120	it can also be the psychology itself that we like to categorize stuff. You know,
431120	438000	it's really this concept of categorical thinking itself. But let's not go into the psychology
438000	445280	right now. But maybe we can kind of replace the emergence of life, like kind of idea to
445280	451200	emergence of complexity, because certainly integration does happen. Stealing a word from
451200	456800	Nick Lane's, when we were chatting last time, you use this word of integration rather than
457600	464880	reductionist approach. So when we think of this integration of some sort of simpler molecules,
465920	471920	then we are, we are kind of talking about this biological system. So let's probably kind of
471920	477840	talk about the properties of biological systems. So what can be those, you know, or what are the
478640	488400	key innovations which enable, you know, life forms? Sorry, did you say, Mike?
488400	495680	Yeah. Well, I'll, okay, I'll pick, I'll pick just one thing, which is, which is what Nick
495680	500000	already mentioned, which is resting potential. And the thing that one, one interesting thing
500000	506800	about resting potential is that in many ways, it's a coarse grained sort of higher level entity,
506800	512400	because it's just, it's different if, if, if you are a mechanism that keys off of resting potential,
512960	518480	it is not the same as keying off of potassium concentration or sodium concentration or chloride
518480	524240	concentration, right? It's this, it's this slightly higher level thing. And so, so if, if you're, in,
524240	528640	in fact, it's one of these things like many other things in, in, in cognitive science, if,
528640	532640	if you want to be a micro reductionist, you might say, well, there's no such thing. You might say,
532640	536640	right? If you're sort of a Laplacian, the demon kind of creature, right? You might say,
536640	539680	there's no resting potential. What there is, is there's some sodiums and there's some
539680	545440	potassiums. And, you know, those are like, those are your low level kind of bedrock. But,
545440	551200	but what's cool about resting potential is one of many things is that it's one of the first steps
551200	556960	up that I think life does in generalizing coarse graining, getting good at noticing large scale
557920	563760	control elements that are not reducible down to individual details, right? And while all of these,
563760	568240	of course, the resting potential is, is, is of course a consequence of the various ions you have,
568240	573440	the fact that you can have the same resting potential from different concentration of ions,
573440	577840	right? As long as you change them out correctly, right? So, so you can, you can vary the low level
577840	583680	details and still get the same resting potential. And conversely, you can get different resting
583760	587520	potentials with exactly the same genetics, for example, with the same ion channels because
587520	591840	they could be open or closed. So you get this interesting bow tie kind of architecture where
591840	596240	there's this like functional node in the middle where things sort of feed into it and then multiple,
596240	601520	multiplicities come out of it. But it itself is the super interesting node from the perspective
601520	608640	of information theory control and all of that. So, Nick, before you respond to that, I will add
608640	614720	another point here. So, I mean, because the mainstream view is that the key innovation is the
614720	622400	genome, right? So let's, let's, let's kind of get it out of the way already and kind of already
622400	629760	mentioned it, why, you know, the, the information is not genome itself, but why we are talking about
629760	635760	the resting potential. I mean, I don't think that either of us would want to be pigeonholed as kind
635840	640400	of anti genome. It's just that it's not, the genome is not the only thing that's going on.
641520	646560	And as soon as, you know, as soon as Mike is talking about generating effectively a single
646560	650640	parameter, which is the resting potential, which could be multiple different ions, which is going
650640	655760	to require multiple different pumps in the membrane, but they're pumping against the pressure,
655760	663040	which is pushing back against them. So there is, there is a unified entity, which is,
663040	666640	which is the resting potential, which, which is kind of integrating everything.
668560	674400	And the trouble, I think with only seeing life as a genome is, is it tends to insist that the
674400	679520	genome invents cells as well and invent structure and space and charge and all of these other things.
679520	687200	And it really doesn't, it, it, it's capable of generating them, but it never really makes a
687200	692640	membrane. Membranes come from other membranes. The spatial setting of the cell is, you know,
692640	695920	it comes from other cells. And then people say, well, there's a chicken and egg problem at the
695920	700000	origin of life. Where does the cell come from? Well, you know, if you've got a cell shaped hole
700000	704640	and cells, you know, think, you know, it's not difficult actually to make a bilayer membrane
704640	708560	surrounding an aqueous space, that's a cell like structure. It's not a difficult thing to do.
709840	715280	But as soon as you've got that, then information has some meaning and genes begin to have some
715280	721360	meaning. But, but there's still, they need, they need, there's got to be some higher level of
721360	726960	integration for just to use the word meaning. Otherwise, everything's, you know, a bit and
726960	733760	they don't relate to each other. So I think that is why charge is so important. One way that I
733760	739600	like to think of it is if you have, I mean, I like to think of individual cells in part because I
739600	743520	work on them and in part because they're just easier for me to grasp the whole central nervous
743520	749040	system is just too big and complicated for me to really comprehend. But if you think about a single
749040	754720	cell and you think about the amount of biochemistry that's going on inside it, there's, you know,
754720	762480	there's a billion reactions a second going on in a bacterial cell. And a lot of them are repeat
762480	768640	things. So you could imagine there may be 10,000 Krebs cycles all spinning at the same time.
770000	774560	And they're all plugged into the membrane. And so the rate at which they spin and the
775200	782240	direction in which they spin is going to depend on this larger factor, which is the membrane
782240	791840	potential of the bacterium. So, you know, to pump against that potential requires a certain force.
791840	796400	And that force is coming from the environment that you're in. Do you have the substrate to
796400	801440	power the pumping? Or did you run out? Or was there any oxygen there or whatever? So it's
801440	807920	immediately giving you a kind of a feed in of what the environment is that you're in. And then a
807920	814800	feedback, which is, you know, which is integrating all these, all these 10,000 different cycles going
814800	821280	around every second. How do they all know what the other one is doing? How do you integrate all of
821280	826720	that into the behavior of a cell which is capable of kind of coordinating all of this? So you need
826720	832240	that higher level property. And I think that's where it's coming from.
833760	841040	So I think the hardware software analogy goes well here. Can we use that analogy to explain
841040	849440	this integration? What do you think, Mike? Yeah, I think that's a very good lens on all of these
849440	857280	things because we know that when we look at the genome, what do we see? We don't see any of the
857280	861440	large scale kinds of things that you might be interested in. How many eyes, what kind of legs,
861440	866320	and does it have legs? You don't see any of that. What you see is protein sequences. So the micro
866320	872640	level hardware that every cell gets to have. Now, as Nick points out, the context and the rest of
872640	877440	the cell is critical. Otherwise, this stuff means nothing. And then all of the actual large scale
877440	886240	features, the behavior is then the result of the physiology, literally the software. So in a
886240	892880	very simplistic analogy, you're looking at a typical computer. Sure, it's important that you have to
892880	898400	write silicon and copper and all of that. Yes, you need all that stuff. But after that, all the
898400	902480	action is in the software, all the actions in the algorithm. It's in the electrical physiology of
902480	910880	what this thing does. And I think it's no accident that our information technology and the way our
910880	916720	brains work and the non-neural bioelectricity, all of them use these electrical networks. They're
916720	923120	just a really powerful tool for processing information. And that's what the, again, as Nick
923120	928720	said, not to take anything away. You need certain hardware. So you need the genome to give you
928720	934080	certain things. But you don't get the membrane from the genome. You don't get the cytoskeleton
934800	938800	structure. You get the proteins, but you don't get the structure that it templates on the previous
938800	944400	cytoskeleton. All of these physiological things are over and above the genetic hardware.
945840	954480	Yeah. And I think it's quite interesting, the only, because I think about a lot of work that
954480	959360	we are doing in evolutionary biology, for example, where we just compare genomes and try to understand
960480	968240	the extinct species, et cetera. So then how much we can rely on that kind of information? I mean,
968240	974080	of course, we are getting to know more about the hardware then. What about the software?
974080	981920	Are there ways to do it or go there? I mean, you mentioned extinct species, but this is one of
981920	986080	the most important things about paleontology is the only way you know what a dinosaur looked like
986080	994160	is from finding a fossil of it. Most of the variety of life over the last 600 million years or so of
994160	999440	animals alone, the only way we know what they looked like. I mean, in principle, we could do it from
999440	1002880	the genome in the end, but in practice, we're a long way from being able to do that now.
1004000	1011200	And I don't know if we could ever do it in principle if we didn't have examples of the kind
1011200	1017760	of thing to compare it with. So I think we're quite shockingly ignorant about how this system
1017760	1025040	works from a genome level at the moment. And I think part of it is exactly what Mike was saying,
1025040	1028240	we're forgetting the software, we're looking at the hardware only, and we're not thinking about
1028240	1034000	how is this working as a unified system as an organism with physiology? And what makes that
1034000	1038080	physiology operated at a higher level to just the hardware that generates it?
1038800	1043440	Yeah, you know, this business of predicting, you're absolutely right. One of the things
1043440	1050160	that I show in some of my talks is here's a baby axolotl, it's a salamander, and they have little
1050160	1054640	legs, you know, the babies have legs. And here's a tadpole of a frog, Xenopus, they don't have legs.
1054640	1060400	And so in our lab, we make a frog a lot. 50% axolotl, 50% frog. Now you get a frog a lot.
1060400	1064720	So now I ask a simple question, you have the genome of the axolotl fully sequenced,
1064800	1069040	you've got the genome of the frog fully sequenced, is the frog a lot of going to have legs or not?
1069600	1074640	They have absolutely no idea. There's no way to tell, we have no way to tell. And if that's not
1074640	1080560	bad enough, like Nick was saying, if you don't actually have something to compare a genome to,
1080560	1084560	we don't know what the frog of the axolotl would look like either. We have no ability right now
1084560	1089360	to look at a genome and say, ah, yes, this thing has six legs and whatever, no, you have no ability
1089360	1096320	to do that other than comparing it to other ones that you've had. And not to mention all of the
1096320	1101680	scenarios in which, and we've shown many and other people have shown many scenarios in which
1101680	1109040	the genetic information literally misleads you because if there's interventions at the physiology
1109040	1114720	level, that tends to win. And so we have many examples where there's oncogenic mutations,
1114720	1119680	but no cancer, there are developmental mutations, but there's no defect because we've
1119680	1125440	intervened at the physiological level. Or we have worms that have the heads belonging to another
1125440	1130560	species of flatworm that's 150 million years distant and you sequence that genome, you will
1130560	1133840	not get the right answer about what the head of that animal looks like. You just won't get the
1133840	1139040	right answer. So both are important, but it's not all about the genome for sure.
1140000	1147920	Yeah, so let's kind of talk a little bit more about the software. So is it only about bioelectricity?
1147920	1154320	Maybe first you can introduce a little bit about what is bioelectricity and how we go about it.
1156640	1164000	Mike, do you want to go ahead? Sure. Okay, so where I take up, so to answer the second part,
1164800	1170080	I don't think it's only bioelectricity because there are some interesting, for example, recently
1170640	1176320	we and Richard Watson and some other people before that found, for example, that very simple
1177440	1181360	things like gene regulatory networks or pathways, it can be a protein pathway,
1181360	1185120	they actually have a kind of plasticity where they can do many different kinds of learning.
1185120	1189280	So you can do, they can do habituation, anticipation, associative learning,
1190240	1197200	we're just in the dynamical systems sense without any rewiring. So even chemical pathways can do
1197200	1201920	some of this. So some of this cognitive stuff goes all the way down. But what I really like about
1201920	1208240	bioelectricity and where I take it up is sort of after I sort of assume the cell is there and
1208240	1213600	everything is there. So Nick covers the earlier stuff, I kind of just assume it's all there.
1213600	1221440	And after that, what we see is this remarkable thing that because cells have the ability to
1222080	1225840	generate arresting potential using ion channels and pumps in the membrane,
1226480	1232240	and they have these little electrical synapses known as gap junctions, which allow them to share
1233040	1239040	their state with their neighbors. And both the channels and the gap junctions can themselves
1239040	1244480	be voltage sensitive. So now what you have is a voltage gated ion conductance, which is
1244480	1248960	basically a transistor that gives you a kind of historicity, it gives you feedback loops memory
1249760	1254080	right there, right, right, right, you know, right there. And when you connect, when these cells
1254080	1260560	connect with each other into electrical networks, you get some of the same phenomena we see in the
1260560	1265840	brain, just on a slower time scale. So these are not millisecond, these are hours, you know,
1265840	1270080	on the scale of hours. But there's all kinds of amazing information processing that these
1270080	1278080	networks can do that allow them to pursue larger goals. So I love the evolutionary
1279120	1284560	electrochemistry and the metabolic because I think these are the very first kinds of spaces in which
1284560	1289920	living systems solve problems, right, metabolic space, bioelectric space like that. But after that,
1289920	1294240	they can when they join into these electrical networks, now they can solve problems in anatomical
1294240	1299520	morpho space, they can do things like remember what the correct shape is, figure out do we have
1299520	1303520	the correct shape, what needs to be done, all of that. And then later on, you get a brain and now
1303520	1307360	you can you can operate in three dimensional behavioral space and linguistic space when it
1307360	1312320	was what else. So that's, you know, that's my story of electricity is this like transistor
1312320	1319760	like ability of cells to join into networks and compute after that. And can we reduce it to
1320320	1330720	to molecular level? Yes, I think we can. But I don't know that we have the ability to do it yet.
1333200	1340720	I mean, I tend to think in terms of mitochondria and how they're going to communicate, for example,
1341840	1347440	just take a really simple thing. There's two ways of seeing this apoptosis controlled cell death.
1348160	1353760	The mitochondria involved in that and loss of membrane potential is part of what's happening.
1354320	1361600	Also, whether mitochondria get targeted to be broken down or not. No one's ever quite got what's
1361600	1366960	happening. And it's partly because the mitochondria have two membranes and the outer membrane
1368080	1373040	is not electrically charged or at least not very much if it is at all. Whereas the inner
1373040	1379200	membrane has got a pretty high potential on it. But the proteins that are targeting the
1379200	1383280	mitochondria without a membrane potential are targeting the outer membrane. And there are protein
1383280	1388960	complexes that join the two up. And it's possible that it can work that way. But it's also possible
1388960	1393760	that there's electrical signaling across those distances. And I think it's likely that there
1393760	1400400	is. But then the question becomes, well, if it's simply an electrostatic potential,
1401200	1407200	then it falls off very quickly because it decays with the square root of the distance.
1410240	1416960	So it's not going to signal very far. Whereas electromagnetic fields potentially could signal
1416960	1423360	much further. But that requires a very specific morphology to be able to work at all. And there's
1423360	1429440	an interesting and difficult question about, well, just what could they do? How can they interact with
1429520	1434320	the hardware? And there are ways that they can undoubtedly. But is it strong enough? Can we
1434320	1439440	measure it? Do we have the facilities to get it all easy? So I think it does work at the molecular
1439440	1447680	level. And I think over very short distances. So for example, with the ATP synthase, there's a
1447680	1455280	beautiful work from Wayne Frash recently showing, I don't know, the C ring, which is basically
1455280	1462000	a rotating motor protein that sits in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. And there's in
1462000	1466880	ourselves as eight subunits in this ring and a proton binds on and it just kind of moves around.
1466880	1473120	So it needs each proton that binds on, it needs to move for eight subunits to turn in the complete
1473120	1480080	circle, that would be about 37 degrees or something like that. So the binding of the proton moves the
1480080	1489680	whole ring around by about 37 degrees. And how does it do that? Nobody has ever quite figured
1489680	1494880	it out, but it's been known for decades that the actual electrical potential on the membrane does
1494880	1502480	quite a lot of that work. And he's shown quite recently that actually, with just the proton,
1502480	1509760	it moves about 11 degrees. And with the electrical potential as well, that takes it another 25
1509760	1516560	degrees or something of that order of rotation. So it's this local electrostatic charge,
1516560	1521920	which is driving that. So over short distances, it's really beautifully demonstrated that
1521920	1526560	you need the charge on the membrane for this to work. But over longer distances,
1527760	1533280	if you're dealing with perhaps a few micrometers or something, then I would be surprised if
1533280	1540400	electrostatic charges alone were doing that. They certainly are at the plasma membrane in
1540400	1547120	terms of connections between cells and having the same charge across effectively wider expanses.
1547120	1550160	But the mitochondria are interesting in that sense as well in that the Christie are
1550880	1557200	closed very often and separate from each other. And so you can have different membrane
1557200	1561200	potentials in different Christie in the same mitochondria. You can have individual mitochondria
1561200	1567760	or you can have a network that all join together. There's so much subtlety in all of this.
1568800	1574640	And to underpin all of that, nobody has ever successfully measured the membrane potential
1574640	1580960	of mitochondria accurately. And the reason for that is if you simply use a microelectrode and you
1580960	1584960	insert it into the matrix of the mitochondria, into the middle of the mitochondria, what you'll
1584960	1590000	measure, and this is work going back decades from a guy called Tedeschi, but other people have come
1590000	1595600	to the same conclusion. You get about 10 or 20 millivolts, it's not much, somewhat less than the
1595600	1602240	plasma membrane. All of the calculations, all of the change in pH, all the chemiosmotic hypothesis
1602240	1607440	is saying it should be 150 to 200 millivolts. So where's that difference coming from? It's partly
1607440	1612800	that way we're using voltage sensitive dyes to accumulate and it's very difficult to calibrate
1612800	1617680	them. And it's partly that we now know the structure of the mitochondria is different.
1617680	1621840	They are closed Christi. So what you're measuring with the microelectrode is the difference between
1621840	1626000	the matrix space and the cytosol. And what we really want to measure is the difference between
1626000	1632720	the matrix space and the Christi space. And no one's really ever managed to get anything into
1632720	1639200	that Christi space, which is capable of reporting back on the charge there. So it's definitely
1639200	1645440	working at the molecular level for sure. It depends a lot on the actual structure, which only in the
1645440	1652080	last few years with super resolution microscopy and cryo tomography and things like that are we
1652080	1657200	able to really get a handle on exactly what is the structure of mitochondria and exactly
1657200	1662480	how do these spaces relate to each other and so on. And no one's ever measured it properly.
1662480	1667440	So it's kind of glaring ignorance again at the heart of all of this, but until we can measure
1667440	1672400	these things accurately and understand how they change over short periods of time, which maybe
1672400	1678720	seconds or minutes, I would think, then, you know, there's got to be a certain amount of
1678720	1683840	hand waving about it. But to think that it's not the right place to look is, I think, to
1683840	1690320	miss the most important things in science now. And this is totally not my area. So maybe this
1690320	1696240	is a dumb idea. But any chance that one could make a synthetic one that was big enough where
1697200	1700720	would that change everything if you sort of made one that was already, you know,
1700720	1706400	sort of basically synthetically try to make that, that, you know, a big mitochondria around some
1706400	1711840	sort of engineered electrodes that were already where you needed them to be and sort of assemble
1711840	1717680	the thing around them. Any chance somebody could build something like that? Or would that be totally
1717680	1721360	not informative? It would be a fun thing to try and do. I think it would be difficult because the
1723520	1727920	I think what you tend to build around it would be something in the structure of a sphere or
1728320	1733120	something along those lines. And what we're actually dealing with. I mean, there are again,
1733120	1738800	there are stunning structures to the Christie membranes. We tend to just see them as a wavy line
1738800	1746080	in the textbook. But they're stunningly structured. But sometimes you get amazing kind of arrays of
1746080	1751360	triangular shapes and things. You see some of, you know, they're doing bionegetics. But
1752320	1756480	in what world are they doing that? There definitely there's nothing in known bionegetics that says
1756880	1760160	why they have triangular shaped Christie. We just have no idea.
1762240	1767760	So for you, metabolism is like central to bioelectricity.
1769280	1773840	I think the two are connected and are integrated that way. I think they have been from the very
1773840	1782720	beginning because to my mind, you know, for any form of selection to work, you have to have growth.
1782720	1787360	You have to have cells which are duplicating themselves. And then you have some form of
1787360	1792080	selection, either they do it slowly or they would quickly or they survive longer or they,
1792080	1795760	you know, but you have different outcomes. As soon as you've got cells, you don't have to have
1795760	1800160	genes in those cells. You just have to have cells which are capable of doubling. And if you're
1800160	1807040	starting as life does on Earth with CO2, then the point of having the electrical membrane
1807040	1811760	potential is in effect to get CO2 to react with hydrogen. They don't, they're not particularly
1811760	1817200	reactive. They don't particularly want to react together. And cells today effectively
1817200	1824160	use the charge on the membrane to force them to react. And those charges make sense at the
1824160	1830640	origin of life because what you have, as Peter Mitchell actually said in 1957,
1832560	1839680	the inside and the outside of a cell, if you like, are two equivalent phases separated and
1839680	1846560	linked by the membrane that's between them. And those phases are not the same in terms of
1846560	1851200	their ionic composition or anything else. They cannot be. One is the living cell and the other
1851200	1858880	one is the outside world. And that necessarily generates charges on those membranes and those
1858880	1865440	charges necessarily organize things. So, you know, however much you, you know, it's just there. You
1865440	1869360	cannot avoid it. You will have a charge on a membrane and that charge on the membrane does
1869360	1876720	something useful, even in a purely prebiotic world, which is to say it will make carbon dioxide
1876720	1881600	react with hydrogen to make organic molecules inside this cell-like thing, which has now
1882240	1886400	got more organic molecules inside, which would include more membrane molecules and everything
1886400	1890560	else. And so it can grow. So the whole thing from the very beginning, way before we had genes,
1890560	1897440	is driven by charge and structure. Yeah, Richard. The late Richard Borgans had this, made this
1897520	1903280	interesting point where he said that as soon as, so super early on, as soon as you have a membrane
1903280	1909040	that segregates some goodies inside the organism versus outside, you're likely to have a charge
1909040	1913360	imbalance. And then if you get injured, so let's say the membrane gets perforated,
1914080	1918400	you immediately get a free vector to the side of the damage because of the short circuit of the
1918400	1923120	electric field. And you get that for free. That's a free gift from physics. You don't need a genome.
1923120	1927200	You don't need pathways. You don't need any of that. Immediately,
1927200	1933200	you know where the damage was. So if you have some sort of electrosensitive subunit as occurs in
1933200	1940240	wound healing and whatnot, it just, the physics tells you where to go to plug up the damage and
1940240	1945680	so on. So I'm guessing there are many of these things that are just, so these free gifts that
1945680	1951520	we get from chemistry and physics and then evolution exploits those in different ways.
1952000	1956320	So since you already mentioned evolution, let's talk about it. So how
1957680	1970160	these kinds of systems will evolve? Nick? I mean, I think, as I say, for bacterial cells,
1970160	1978640	for single cells, the membrane is what divides them from the outside world. And there's no way,
1979360	1989920	you know, how does it know what's happening outside? Well, things impinge on the membrane
1989920	1995120	and cross that membrane. And the cell with its biochemistry has to figure out, what does that
1995120	2001680	mean? And what am I going to do? Should I swim that way? Or should I swim this way? Or how am I
2001680	2007040	going to behave in response to this? So there's never, it doesn't know that there's an oil slick
2007040	2012720	over there or whatever it may be, but it's picked up something and it needs to make a decision as
2012720	2022240	a cell, what it's going to do next. So I quite like the ideas from Carl Friston on this, who
2022240	2026880	talks about a Markov blanket in the cell membrane as being a Markov blanket. And effectively, it's
2026880	2032800	translating between the language of the outside world and the language of biochemistry inside.
2032880	2040000	And that language of biochemistry inside is trying to find this low energy state in effect,
2040000	2046960	which is its homeostatic preferred place to be. I'm not sure I convey very well what he has to
2046960	2051360	say on this, but the way I interpret it or understand it is, well, if you're in a bad
2051360	2057280	environment, then, you know, your proteins start to unravel and denature. And that's actually a
2057280	2061360	higher energy state and not a place you want to be. And if you move over there and your proteins
2061360	2069120	start renaturing again, then that's a better place to be. But you still need to integrate all of,
2069120	2073200	you know, you've taken a statistical sampling of the outside world, you've got a correlation that
2073200	2079920	says this happened, therefore do that. But you take multiple samples of this through multiple
2079920	2084960	receptors and they're conflicting. Some of them say go over there, some of them say go over there.
2085520	2090320	So how do you integrate all that information and make a decision about what to do?
2091280	2095040	And that's where the plasma, the cell membrane, the plasma membrane, if you like,
2095680	2100320	begins to integrate all that information. If you're, you know, if the problem is that
2100320	2104240	you're poisoned and your substrates don't work, then your membrane potential is going to fall.
2104240	2110160	If your membrane potential falls, then you move over there sharpish. So, you know, it provides
2110160	2116480	you with information on your state in the world as a single entity. And I like to think of that as
2116480	2120800	the simplest possible imaginable form of the stream of consciousness, which is to say is
2120800	2126240	integrating real time information about your state in relation to the world in terms of am I good
2126240	2131760	or am I not good? Really, that's the simplest, simplest thing. Do I, do I go there? Do I,
2131760	2137040	do I stay here? What, you know, it's, it's, it's, that seems to me to be a fundamental
2137040	2142960	decision for a living cell to make, which is based entirely on its need to survive in the world and
2142960	2148000	which is integrated by the membrane and in effect by electrical charge on the membrane as you
2148000	2154000	integrating that information. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's a really good point. Chris Fields
2154800	2160240	talks about this kind of thing in bacteria as a, as an early form of metacognition,
2160240	2163600	because if you imagine you're a bacterial cell in some sort of gradient,
2164560	2169680	yeah, you can measure the actual molecule that you're interested in. But for example, it might
2169680	2174080	be poisonous. It might, there might be a poisonous version of it. And so what you might also want
2174080	2178880	to have in some bacteria have this is a way of measuring indirectly, instead of tracking the
2178880	2183520	thing you really want to track, what they track is your own metabolism. So, so, right? So, so it's,
2183520	2188560	it's a kind of a self monitoring loop, basically a simple example of metacognition, where you,
2188560	2192320	where, where you say, okay, I'm not going to worry about the details of, of what it is I'm
2192400	2196240	trying to metabolize. It was just, how are we doing? Are we like, you know, and, and, and that
2196240	2201920	gives you, there's some trade offs there, but it gives you this, this incredible power of
2201920	2207200	coarse graining over all kinds of details to have a large scale variable to deal with, right? And,
2207200	2212720	and maybe metabolic state and memory potential is a fantastic example of that. And I think
2212720	2218640	getting back to the evolution question, one, one sort of hypothesis I would, I will put out there
2218640	2225360	is that the fact that we have these metabolic needs and the fact that you don't have all the time
2225360	2230640	in the world to process every possible scenario because you're going to fall apart and be eaten
2231200	2236960	is really, I think a key driver of intelligence for the following reason. If you are a creature
2237840	2242080	that does not have these constraints, it doesn't have metabolic needs. For example,
2242080	2246480	like a modern AI, which is plugged into the wallet as all the energy it needs, it never has to worry
2246480	2252720	about getting, getting any energy. If you're a biologically, a biological agent that arose
2252720	2257200	in evolution under these constraints that you are constantly under this metabolic pressure,
2257760	2265120	one of the things you cannot afford to do is to be a micro reductionist, meaning that I'm going to
2265120	2270240	track all the micro states in my environment. You do not have time to, to try to be a Laplacian
2270240	2274800	demon. You did, there's just no time for that. Instead, there's great pressure to become really
2274800	2281920	good at coarse graining the world into chunks that you can, you can large scale affordances,
2281920	2288320	observables, control knobs, and, and pay attention to those and, and completely sort of abstract what's
2288320	2296960	underneath. So that pressure to, to, to, to cut up the, the, all the details into higher level
2296960	2301360	things that you're going to represent, like my metabolism, my resting potential, right?
2301360	2308640	These higher level things means that all of the, the ability to generalize, the ability to
2309360	2315280	abstract from, from individual instances to general rules and general observations. And
2316000	2322240	even dare, dare I say, for advanced organisms like us, the ability to tell stories about agents
2322240	2327040	doing things, in other words, to have an agential view on the world. In other words, in, right?
2327040	2331280	In, in, in modern humans to have a view of free will as an, I am a thing that does things and
2331280	2335760	there's a, there's a, there's a tiger and tigers and you know, our agents that do things and so on.
2335760	2342800	All of that has, I think, its origin all the way at the beginning, the first agential models were
2342800	2348480	made by, by microbes who had to adopt that stance. They had to adopt an agential stance in order to
2348480	2353040	survive in real metabolic, under metabolic constraints. And I think what evolution did after
2353040	2358160	that was scale it up to creatures that can then verbalize it that like us, I've got, you know,
2358160	2362560	I've got free will in this and that, but, but all of this goes all the way back to the beginning to
2362560	2367520	the necessity to make models of large scale variables, doing things, being important control
2367520	2372880	knobs. If my voltage is off, if my metabolism is off, I need to change my voltage. I'm not talking
2372880	2377200	about this sodium ion versus that sodium ion. I'm talking about getting my voltage fixed up.
2377280	2381520	And that's, you know, that I think is a driver of, of a ratchet for, for intelligence.
2382800	2389360	I mean, a couple of things. One, one thing about voltage and bacteria, there's a guy called Ken
2389360	2397920	Nielsen who for years has been culturing bacteria on electrodes. And the thing is that lots of
2397920	2403920	bacteria is, it's always proved impossible to culture them in a pure culture, which is to say
2403920	2408400	just those bacteria are nothing else. And the reason is basically that they, you know, they dump
2408400	2414640	their electrons onto their neighbor, which is the back, you know, another bacterial cell of a
2414640	2420320	different species, let's say, which wants those electrons. And so it's a, it's a synthrophy,
2420320	2426480	they're effectively living alongside each other. But the way to kind of escape from that is you,
2426480	2430640	you give them an electrode and you set that member, the potential, the electrical potential
2430720	2437280	electrode till let's say minus 300 millivolts or something like that. And they, you know,
2437280	2440720	they either dump their electrons onto that or they take their electrons from that.
2442480	2448720	But then they'll grow on that surface at that, at that voltage. And if you switch the voltage to
2448720	2455120	say minus 304 millivolts, you get a different bacterial population growing there. And you
2455120	2458720	change it by another three or four millivolts and you get a different and you can effectively
2458720	2464400	grow all of these pure cultures of bacteria by just shifting the voltage by just a few millivolts.
2464400	2471760	It's extra, it's exquisitely sensitive. The way that they, so again, it's how all this works at
2471760	2476320	the level of cells, I don't really know, but the voltage then in your environment and the way in
2476320	2479440	which you're, you know, where you're offloading your electrons and where you're gaining your
2479440	2486480	electrons from is, it's fundamental to how cells grow. But coming back to evolution again,
2488720	2495200	bacteria are using their membrane as the interface to the world. But then we have
2495200	2501600	eukaryotic cells that have internalized mitochondria. And they start using the plasma
2501600	2507520	membrane for something different. And they can be now much more interesting in what you do with
2507520	2511520	your plasma membrane. You don't have to be using it for energetics all the time. You can be using
2511520	2516400	it for much more interesting and subtle things, including changing shape and becoming a phagocyte
2516400	2525920	or beating silly or whatever it may be. But now the, this kind of simple idea that your metabolism
2525920	2529920	is directly plugged into your membrane and gives you an immediate integrated feedback on your state
2529920	2533840	in the world becomes much more complicated because a lot of your metabolism is happening in the
2533840	2538720	mitochondria. You may have got scores of mitochondria. They may all be doing different
2538720	2544960	things depending on where they are in the cell. And the cell now has a kind of, you know, a bigger
2544960	2549840	problem of how do I integrate all this extra information about how I'm doing in the environment?
2549840	2558320	And it seems to me almost necessary to bring it. I mean, you could imagine that it could all work
2558320	2563760	by, you know, phosphorylating everything. But I find it very hard to buy. I find it much easier to
2564480	2571840	imagine that either we've got networks, but more likely we're simply signaling electrically
2571840	2575520	between different mitochondria and between mitochondria and the cell membrane so that the
2575520	2580640	cell is integrating its state still electrically, but in a more subtle and sophisticated way.
2581280	2586080	So, you know, this is a big, I would say a big challenge at the origin of eukaryotic cell. How
2586080	2593040	do you, you know, rewire yourself to work as instead of being a consortium of cells that have
2593040	2598800	their own independence, but now some of them are inside, how do you kind of rewire so you act as
2598800	2604080	an entity, as an individual organism at the level of the cell with all of these things inside, all
2604080	2608800	of which are metabolizing potentially in different ways. So there's a problem with integration there.
2608800	2612400	And then you have the next level, which is you become multicellular, and then you've got another
2612400	2619440	problem with integration. So you're kind of taking up the, you're adjusting up the hardware required
2619440	2625520	to keep a signal, which is intelligible. And by the time you got into a central nervous system,
2626080	2632480	it's enormously complex, of course. I mean, that's what my next question was. So first of all,
2632480	2638560	the eukaryogenesis that you mentioned, it's again, like your argument that it happened
2638560	2644000	after two billion years. So this is also quite exciting that, you know, or interesting that
2644000	2650720	for two billion years bacteria were surviving somehow. And then with this certain transition
2651680	2657120	where to unicellular, they come together. Yeah. I mean, that's not really my argument so much
2657120	2663440	as that's an observation, which is to say there are, I mean, molecular clocks, which would not
2663440	2670960	to be believed very heartily for deep evolutionary history. But they're putting eukaryotes at one
2670960	2678160	and a half to two billion years ago, that kind of time. And eukaryotes all clearly share the
2678160	2683760	same cell structures. They clearly share a common ancestor, unless convergent evolution has an
2683760	2688240	astonishing power to regenerate exactly the same cell structures, but that's hard to buy.
2689280	2693920	And before that, there's plenty of evidence for bacteria going back to practically four
2693920	2699040	billion years ago. And there's plenty of evidence for all the big nutrient cycles,
2699040	2705760	iron cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and so on. So there's plenty of evidence
2705760	2713680	that there were bacteria throughout this whole time. So there is an issue with this apparently
2713680	2719280	unique origin of eukaryotic cells. Now it's quite possible that there were hundreds or thousands
2719280	2724400	of origins of complex cells and they all just disappeared without trace. But it's also possible
2724400	2728320	that that wasn't the case and that there are structural constraints on bacteria which relate
2728320	2734000	to having a charge on their membrane, which effectively say it's not easy to internalize
2734080	2738080	all of this stuff. It's a big, big structural change. It's not easy to get inside one. And when
2738080	2744000	you get inside it, you've got your own vested interests and chances are it will go wrong.
2744000	2749520	But I'm pointing to this electrical wiring issue. It's not just about integrating your
2749520	2755120	biochemistry. It's also about how do I reintegrate my wiring as an individual cell as an organism?
2755120	2762320	You look at, I think we both show the same video occasionally, Mike, of it's a ciliate.
2762880	2769520	I forget which one it is, but it's feeding this astonishing control. That's the one, yes.
2769520	2777040	It's astonishing control that it has. And you think, is it really detecting concentration
2777040	2782880	gradients of molecules or is it picking up on something electrical to do that? How does it know
2782880	2790160	that there's something right there and right there in the space of seconds or less than seconds?
2791040	2797600	Yeah. One fun thing that there's a cool paper by Min Zhao and colleagues where
2798640	2802720	he shows that there are cells, I think maybe keratocytes or something,
2802720	2807120	that crawl in a particular direction in an electric field. So they have very robust
2807120	2812400	electrotaxis. But if you actually cut up the cell into pieces, the pieces, the fragments,
2812400	2819840	crawl in the opposite direction. So it's a great example of, I think Richard Watson
2819920	2824400	says it this way that the point of holes is to get the parts to do things they wouldn't
2824400	2828720	normally do. And this is like a cool example of that because all the parts want to go that way,
2828720	2833440	the whole, the collective goes that way. And it's a very active electrosensitive process.
2834960	2841200	Fascinating. So maybe let's talk about multicellularity because I think that's,
2841760	2848240	so I mean, Mike is using this core screen kind of analogy or metaphor and
2849920	2855040	Nick is using integration. I don't know if they are different. I think it's probably
2855040	2861040	both. No, I think it amounts to the same thing. Yeah. So let's talk about multicellularity that,
2861600	2867680	and then interestingly, I mean, of course, nowadays we talk about biofilm, bacterial
2867680	2874400	biofilms that it happens also in bacteria, etc. But what is the difference between bacterial
2874400	2880560	biofilms and a multicellular organism like anything, any animal, we can talk about plant,
2880560	2887040	fungi, etc. Right. I mean, there's a simple answer to that, which is that they're all composed of
2887040	2893680	different cells, different genetically very different to each other. And the point about
2893680	2900880	pretty much all, well, all metazoans, all animals, all plants, they've all been through a single cell
2900880	2908480	stage and we're all basically clonal. So our genome is the same. So there are multicellular
2908480	2915760	bacteria. So filamentous cyanobacteria, they have two different cell types. So the nitrogen
2915760	2922720	fixing cells, the heterocysts and the photosynthetic cells. So it's not that it's not possible for
2922720	2931520	bacteria to do that. But they don't do much of it. Whereas a biofilm is, you know, is deep
2931520	2938000	cooperation between different types of cell. But the whole of evolutionary biology and pretty
2938000	2942800	much all the experiments on things like slime moles, which come together as genetically different
2942800	2950240	cells and then cooperate to build a stalk, for example, for distributing spores. Cheating is
2950240	2956480	a real issue that they never tend to generate greater complexity than something like a stalk,
2957200	2962000	because the cheats always win in the end, because they're genetically distinct to each other. So
2962000	2966880	I think, you know, mainstream evolutionary biology would just say animals are clonal.
2968080	2974640	And that restricts the amount of fighting that goes on between cells. And I don't see any reason
2974640	2980640	to argue with that. I think the reason that eukaryotic cells make animals and plants much
2980640	2984960	more readily is that we have much larger genomes and we can have much, much larger genomes because
2984960	2990800	we have mitochondria and much better energy generation, if you like, than bacteria. And
2990800	2996320	that means you can switch genes on and off in different tissues. And if you're switching genes
2996320	3001520	on and off in different tissues, then you're shifting not only the hardware, but also all
3001520	3006960	the electrical properties of different tissues as well. So the more the coarse-graining can be
3006960	3011200	then shifted as well. Whereas if you've got different types of bacterial cell, all of which
3011200	3016240	have got their own agenda, the idea of having a kind of network of cells which are generating a common
3017520	3024560	a common kind of electrical phase that they're in, becomes at least a lot more problematic,
3024560	3028160	I would say. Is that your take, Mike, or would you see it differently?
3028560	3035520	So yeah, it's a super interesting topic. First of all, about the bacteria stuff and you may want
3035520	3045360	to have him on. So if you haven't already, so Goral Soelle from UCSD who studies bacterial
3045360	3049440	biofilms and the way they coordinate using bioelectricity to make sure that everybody
3049440	3053680	gets fed and the population and all this kind of stuff. So there may be, and it's not my thing,
3053680	3058080	so you should talk to him. But I think there's some very interesting cooperativity stuff going
3058160	3065920	on there. What I think might be fun is being a kind of a spoil sport that I am. I want to poke,
3065920	3072480	and I don't disagree with this idea that of course going through this bottleneck is important
3072480	3077920	evolutionarily. But I just want to bring up a few examples that kind of poke some holes into
3077920	3084160	this story because I think they're worth getting to the bottom of a couple of things.
3084160	3094560	The first thing is that despite our largely genetic homogeneity inside our bodies, cells and
3094560	3099440	organs compete with each other. So for example, during development, there's really a strong
3099440	3106800	competition between all kinds of organs. And we have computational models of this and farmers
3106800	3110960	and other scientists have been publishing this stuff for a really long time. There's actually a
3110960	3119840	lot of competition and struggle. And the classical biologist Rue called this, he had a long
3119840	3124400	monograph called the struggle of the parts, where he talks about all of the ways that the pieces of
3124400	3128480	an embryo and of an organism are actually fighting each other for all kinds of stuff, even though
3128480	3134800	they have similar genetics. The other thing I want to talk about is how similar really the
3134800	3142640	genetics are. So in humans, Doug Brash tells me that there are about 100,000 mutations per skin
3142640	3147680	cell in normal skin. This is not cancer. This is normal skin, 100,000 mutations per cell.
3148400	3157600	So and people like I think Walsh at the Harvard Medical School is finding mutations
3158560	3165040	in the brain and in human neurons. So there's actually apparently there's a ton of genetic
3165040	3171440	variability and where it really reaches its kind of ultimate expression, I think this is one of the
3171440	3179600	most interesting stories, planaria are mixoploid. I mean, it's a certain species, every cell has
3179600	3184560	a different number of chromosomes. The genome is an unbelievable mess. And yet these are the
3184560	3191120	animals with the most regenerative ability, the cancer resistance immortal, as far as we can tell.
3191120	3196960	And it's kind of an amazing scandal that the animal with the best anatomical control, immortality
3196960	3206160	and regeneration is also the one with the most messy genome, right? The every cell. And so this
3206160	3211040	used to drive me completely crazy, this idea. Well, first of all, why does nobody talk about
3211040	3215920	this? We never hear about this, you know, in a standard develop isn't a standard biology kind
3215920	3220320	of curriculum. What they tell you is well, the genome is what sets your anatomy. So who would
3220320	3227280	expect the relationship to be backwards? It doesn't make any sense. Recently, literally in the last
3227280	3236160	few months, I think we've got kind of a handle on this story. And so I think we now have an
3236160	3241040	understanding of what's going on there. And if you want, I can talk about it. But
3241040	3252160	Yes, please. So imagine this. Typically, the way people simulate evolution is you've got some sort
3252160	3256880	of genotype, the genome codes for some sort of phenotype, and then selection. So you do your
3256880	3262080	mutation on the genotype, and you do your selection on the phenotype. What's often missing is that,
3262080	3266720	and this goes back to the initial conversation, that physiological layer in between, because the
3266720	3271360	genotypes actually don't almost never code directly for the phenotype. What they code for
3271360	3275440	is properties of some sort of physiological system where the software is going to determine the
3275440	3281200	phenotype. So we did some simulations, and we created this thing. It's extremely simple. It's
3281200	3286880	just that the genome is just a set of numbers, and they start off all mixed up. And the phenotype,
3286880	3291040	what you select for is making sure the numbers are all in nice order from zero to 100, let's say.
3291040	3295280	So this is the developmental equivalent of having a body axis, of having a primary axis
3295280	3298640	with your tail over here and your head over here and everything in the right order in between.
3299440	3303120	So if you just have genotype and phenotype, of course, a standard genetic algorithm will
3303120	3306720	eventually, and if you look at the fitness over time curve, it's this, you will, of course,
3306720	3311680	it will sort all the numbers and you will get your sort of embryo. That works fine. However,
3311680	3317440	now let's do something interesting. Let's put in, and this is the work of Shrisha Lakshwin
3318240	3325840	in my lab, a student, an undergrad actually. What we did was we put in a developmental
3326720	3332240	phase where, yeah, you've got your genome, but much like with real evolution, the cells aren't
3332240	3338480	passive, dumb material. They actually have a little bit of, they have their own agenda, right? And
3338480	3343840	during that process from being a genome to being an adult that you get selected on,
3344320	3349520	they have some time to do things. Cells are not a blank slate material, right? They always,
3349520	3353600	you know, they're always doing something. And so imagine if you put in just a little bit,
3353600	3359840	just a tiny bit of what we call competency on the cells, and the competency just works like
3359840	3364800	this. You look at your neighbor, and if they have an identity, a number that's way different from
3364800	3369600	yours, it stresses you out. You don't like it. And so during that developmental process, and this
3369600	3374480	is very developmentally, this is very much a fact that when you put two things together where
3374480	3378960	their positional information is too far off, that's how you get regeneration. They will both
3378960	3384240	generate things in between to separate themselves and put in, so if you put a five next to a 10,
3384240	3389920	they will generate the six, seven, eight inside, right? In between them. So you give cells just
3389920	3394480	a tiny ability for that competency just to look at their neighbors and maybe crawl around a little
3394480	3401040	bit to try and reduce their stress level. What happens then is that when an individual comes
3401040	3405760	up for evaluation of fitness, and they look pretty good, the numbers are kind of pretty sorted,
3406880	3411520	evolution doesn't know, selection doesn't know whether it looks good because the genome was
3411520	3415520	amazing, or it looks good because the genome was actually so-so, but everything sort of crawled
3415520	3421120	around. So what that means is that the genome now has a hard time selecting on the genotype. The
3422080	3427840	selection cannot see the defects of the genotype. So it has a really hard time making any progress
3427840	3433520	on improving the structural genome, but what it can do is put all its effort in improving
3433520	3437760	the competency. So in the next generation, what you get are individuals that are slightly more
3437760	3442160	competent. Now, this makes the problem worse because they're slightly more competent. It's even
3442160	3446320	harder to know what their genome was like because they look really great. Who knows what their genome
3446320	3451440	was like. And so you end up with this positive feedback loop where the minute you admit that
3451440	3456480	you're dealing not with a passive material, but with cells that can make some decisions locally,
3456480	3461840	you immediately get into this arms race where the effort starts going into increasing that
3461840	3467280	competency, not fixing the genotype. And so in the end, if you let it run all the way, now of
3467280	3472240	course, there are some other factors that can sort of dampen that runaway feedback loop,
3472240	3477120	but if you let it run all the way, what you get are exactly planaria. You get organisms that are
3477120	3482080	really good at making a good organism, no matter what the genome looks like. All the effort goes
3482080	3487040	into the algorithm. Very little pressure is left to keep a clean genome. The genomes look like hell,
3487040	3492480	but the organisms look amazing because all of the effort have gone into the mechanisms that allow
3492480	3497520	them to build what they need to build, even though the hardware is all over the place. And so what I
3497520	3503440	think happened in planaria, I think this went all the way up. And in other organisms like us,
3503440	3509040	and other other creatures, it sort of stopped halfway. There are other things that sort of
3509040	3514240	dampen it down. So we can kind of do that, but not as good, not as well as planaria. And it also
3514240	3520960	explains why it's such a weird thing. Any other animal, any other multicellular creature, you can
3520960	3526720	call a stock center and you can get a strain of abnormal mutants. So you can get flies with
3526720	3532640	pearly wings and mice with crooked tails and albinos. And planaria, there is no such thing as a
3532640	3537280	strain of abnormal planaria other than our two headed form. And those are not genetic. Those
3537280	3545360	are not genetic. And there's never been a planarian mutant line. Isn't that weird? Why not? And also
3545360	3551120	for now, I would say for about 30 years, maybe more, people have been trying to make transgenic
3551120	3556560	planaria and it's never worked. It just doesn't work. Why does it not work? And why do we not
3556560	3561520	have strains? I think because the algorithm is such that it basically ignores most of the genome,
3561520	3566960	not all of it, of course, because you still need the competency machinery. But the competency is
3566960	3572720	such that it can tolerate massive degrees of errors in the genome and it expects to. That's
3572720	3580240	why because of this runaway, you know, sort of runaway ratchet. So I think it is true,
3580240	3586240	like you said, I think, of course, we go through a bottleneck and we do share genetically much
3586240	3591040	more so than the bacteria. But I think there's a lot more play in that system, you know, I think
3591600	3598400	potentially we're not actually sharing all the DNA and even, right? And even when we do, I think,
3598400	3603840	and I think, I think Grohl would say that the bioelectrics actually is a really good way to
3603840	3607600	crank up cooperativity when you don't share genetics. I'm putting words in his mouth, I don't
3607600	3615040	know, but I think that's what his work says to me. Yeah. I mean, one, sorry, just one quick
3615040	3624880	thing on the biofilms before coming around to that. I mean, one question that I had at the back
3624880	3632400	of my mind is there's a lot of bacteria, for example, growing on, let's say, a rusty iron surface,
3632400	3637760	and they're, they're effectively putting their electrons onto the, onto the iron and dissolving
3637760	3642960	the rusty iron, and they're using it effectively as oxygen as an electron acceptor. And there's
3642960	3648880	been a question for a long time, okay, the bacteria that are touching the surface, no problem.
3649920	3654880	They just dump their electrons straight onto it, no problem. The ones which are up here somewhere,
3655520	3660240	not actually touching that surface at all. And there were all kinds of questions about
3660240	3665760	electron shuttles, quinones, external quinones that wasn't really clear quite what they were
3665760	3670240	doing. The implication was that they were somehow swimming down here, putting the electrons on,
3670240	3673760	and then swimming back again. And you think, well, how's a quinone going to do that?
3675120	3679920	And it seems much more likely that actually what they're doing is just dumping it on the next cell.
3681200	3686880	And that next cell dumps it on the one underneath. And so you end up with, yes, a, you know,
3686880	3693760	charge running straight through this entire colony. And it becomes in effect altruistic,
3693760	3697920	although all the individual cells were behaving selfishly and simply dumping their electrons
3697920	3704000	on their nearest neighbor. And to some extent, this is a little bit what you're saying about a
3704000	3708480	multi-cell plenarium where they're not genetically so similar, but they're freaked out by their neighbor,
3708480	3718400	which is doing something different. So they are responding to this by trying to put something
3718400	3727040	in the way, or presumably by fixing the charge in some way locally. So I don't really quite see
3727040	3733840	how this works. But how long can it last before the hardware itself breaks down sufficiently
3733840	3740320	that they can't tell that their neighboring cell is not like them or freaky? Or, you know,
3740320	3743600	they've got to be able to detect it. They've got to have some awareness of what's next to them.
3743600	3747120	You're able to do that. And presumably if your genome is completely riddled,
3747120	3752000	you must lose your ability to do that at some point. So here's what I'll say. I mean,
3752000	3757840	the thing we know for sure is that they've been around for 300 million years, 400 million years,
3757840	3763600	and going strong, no sign of any breakdown. But the other thing, and this is totally
3763680	3769520	unpublished, so treat this with every possible grain of salt. But I'll just sort of tell you,
3770480	3777120	we had a project a few years ago where we cultured plenaria in mutagens. So the stuff that you would
3777120	3782160	dip a zebrafish embryo in for a short period of time to make mutants, we cultured them in that
3782160	3789600	stuff for like a year. And what we saw was that the particular animals that were in the mutagen
3789600	3794320	would have some freaky sort of defects. But then you cut them into pieces, and after that,
3794320	3800240	you just get lines of absolutely normal plenaria after that. So I don't know. I assume there must
3800240	3804160	be some kind of limit, I think you're right. But I don't think we're anywhere near having reached
3804160	3807840	it, I think. And we're going to, this is something that we're actually investigating actively now
3807840	3812160	is just like, what's the limit of this? Like, how far can we really trash the genome before,
3812160	3817040	in an organism like this before there's a problem? Boy, I don't know.
3817760	3823040	How small a piece can you cut for it to regenerate the entire thing? I mean, are you down to just
3823040	3829200	a few cells more than that? It's more than a few cells. The record is something like 275,
3829200	3834880	and this was Thomas and Morgan in early 1900s. And maybe you could maybe now with antibiotics and
3834880	3839600	so on, we could do better, you know, even more single cells don't work. It's very hard. You
3839600	3843520	can't get a full plenarian out of one cell, but you know, little tiny chunks work.
3844320	3848240	So you need the context of the cells around you to have some kind of...
3850400	3856080	And I don't know if that's for a boring reason, meaning that the surface area to volume ratio
3856080	3861840	was too large and it loses all the goodies, that would be maybe like a mechanical reason.
3861840	3867920	Or if it's a deep reason, like the information on building a plenarian is a holographic kind of
3867920	3872720	storage. And if you don't have enough, it's just too fuzzy. You can't recover what you need, right?
3872720	3879280	I don't know which it is. But there is an interesting story that relates to what you
3879280	3884320	were just talking about, which suggests that these kind of electrical transfers
3885360	3891280	can override genetic, I'm just now thinking about this, can override genetic
3891920	3903360	dysrelatedness and potentiate cooperativity. And the story goes like this, in tadpoles,
3903360	3908080	we can inject a human K-RAS mutation, which is a nasty oncogenic mutation.
3908080	3912960	You inject it, those cells, they become a tumor, they invade the embryo, it's just, you know,
3912960	3920160	bad seed. What you can do is simultaneously co-inject an ion channel that forces the cells
3920160	3923600	to a voltage at which they will stay electrically connected to their neighbors.
3923600	3928880	And if you do that, even though the genetics has been, basically, there's a very, very powerful
3928880	3933120	hardware level mutation, the oncogene is blazing, it doesn't get destroyed or anything,
3933120	3936800	we can see it, we can see the protein is still there. But the cells don't make a tumor,
3936800	3940800	they cooperate, they continue to cooperate and they build nice skin and muscle and whatever.
3941520	3946800	And this just, you know, it dovetails with the story that we have about
3947760	3954880	gap junctions potentiating individuals into collectives where it wipes, it tends to
3954880	3959280	wipe that individuality on an informational level. You know, if you and I are connected
3959280	3965040	with a gap junctional signal and your memories and my memories, molecules are sort of floating
3965040	3971360	back and forth, we have no idea whose memory belongs to whom, right? And we become, you and I
3971360	3976560	become a we in the sense that we now have one shared pool of metabolic memories, everything,
3976640	3981840	it's very hard to keep identity. And so I think what you described in the bacteria is really
3981840	3987040	interesting. And the meta zone version of that is gap junctions, where you use that electrical
3987040	3993040	network to overcome differences in genetics and kind of potentiate the cooperativity.
3994720	4001920	I'm amazed that this hasn't caught on more. I mean, maybe you're in different circles to me,
4001920	4006480	but that when I talk to cancer people, not very many of them are thinking in these terms,
4006480	4011680	even though it's been known for a long time that if you transfer the nucleus of a cancer cell into a
4011680	4017200	non cancer cell, then it, you know, it doesn't become it doesn't become cancerous. It doesn't
4017200	4021520	become carcinogenic. It's not the nucleus, the cytoplasm, which is, which is, which is doing the
4021520	4027360	thing. And so many mutations that you see oncogenic mutations in a tumor, you see the same mutations,
4027440	4033440	you know, next to the tumor and elsewhere in the body. So it's, it's very much the context
4033440	4039120	they're setting on. I was talking to, there's a woman at King's College in London, who I
4039120	4047120	met recently, Jodie Rosenblatt. And she, she was working on epithelium. And this interesting
4047120	4054880	question that you have cells which are, which are producing, dividing and producing new cells,
4054880	4058640	and those new cells are growing towards each other. And they get to a place where they're
4058640	4063040	effectively pressing up against each other. And there are various mechanoreceptors.
4063760	4070320	And some of them pop out, but which ones pop out? And on what basis do they pop out? And the way
4070320	4076240	that she described all of this, I said, you should look at the chart on these cells. And I
4076240	4082400	mentioned your work to her. And, and, and she's, she's, she's been checking and, and it all works
4082400	4087360	on charge. There, there's a, I forget which way around it is, but I'm pretty sure they,
4087360	4094560	if they lose the membrane potential, they, they, they pop out. So it's, it seems ripe to explain
4094560	4100720	a lot of things which are, it's probably not only that, as you said earlier on, the mechanoreception
4100720	4104400	and your proximity to other cells, there's going to be other things going on as well. But
4105600	4110000	it's this balance. It must be a very fine balance. Yeah. It's allowing you to know
4110800	4115920	you're the odd one out. Off you go. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a different, it's a different
4115920	4120640	perspective on this whole problem because traditionally you would have like a, like,
4120640	4124720	for example, game theory approaches where you would say, well, the cancer cells are more selfish.
4124720	4128480	And that way they do this or that. I actually don't think they're any more selfish at all.
4128480	4132800	I think what it is is their selves are smaller. So what happens is if you have, if you're in
4132800	4139360	good gap junctional electrical connection, you are plugged into a network that yourself,
4139360	4142880	meaning the border between you and the outside world and tumors of the goals that you're going
4142880	4146400	to maintain, the internal milieu, all of these things is huge. You know, you might be a whole
4146400	4149520	hand or you might be a liver or a kidney, you know, it makes, it makes this large thing.
4150400	4154880	These oncogenes, one of the things they do is they cause gap junctional closure,
4154880	4158800	they cause depolarization and gap junctional closure. And as soon as you're a cell that
4159600	4165840	basically partially or completely disconnects from that network, now you're the border of
4165920	4170880	yourself is tiny. That's it. It's just this now. And at that, it's just the size of a single cell.
4170880	4175840	And at that point, you roll back to the kinds of goals that single cell creatures can pursue,
4175840	4180160	which is proliferation and migration to where life is good. And so now to you,
4180160	4184480	the rest of the animal is just external environment, right? The rest of the body is just outside
4184480	4188960	world for you because you're in amoeba. You're in amoeba now. And so that boundary between
4188960	4192960	self and world, one of the things that these electrical connections do is they inflate it,
4192960	4198160	right? During evolution of multicellularity, that boundary gets inflated so that now we
4198160	4204240	are a liver. It's not I'm a liver cell, we are a liver. Whereas, and it acts collectively to solve
4204240	4209440	large scale problems in morphogenetic spaces. As soon as you disconnect from that, you're back to
4209440	4215840	amoeba style where everything around you is just potentially a threat, potentially genetically
4215840	4220480	unrelated to you, all these things. And then of course you do whatever you can, which is
4220560	4228720	metastasized basically. There was some work some years ago now from a guy called Neil Blackstone
4228720	4240160	in Illinois. And he had been working on colonial, I forget what, but basically colonies. And a lot
4240160	4246160	there, they're forming effectively a multicellular organism is a colony rather than strictly
4246160	4251840	multicellular, but the gap is quite close. But they, the conditions that they're subject to
4252400	4256480	depends on where you are in the colony, or you are the edge in which case you've got a higher
4256480	4261840	oxygen concentration surrounding you, or are you in the middle in which case you're in hypoxic
4261840	4268880	conditions? Where do you put your flagella, the cells that differentiate into flagella and the
4268880	4273040	whole colony can paddle itself around then? Well, they're the ones on the outside that have got
4273040	4280160	plenty of oxygen. Which ones become the stem cells and the gametes for the next generation?
4280160	4283840	Well, they're the ones that are in the middle, which are effectively oxygen deprived. And so
4283840	4289680	just the structure of a blob immediately gives you a difference between the outside and the inside
4289680	4293920	and the likelihood of cells. And I remember reading that and the whole thing worked on
4293920	4300000	redox signaling. And of course, I like the idea of redox chemistry. And I looked into is there
4300000	4306960	something about mammalian development that works on redox signaling. And I didn't really find anything
4306960	4314800	very much that led through. And then I thought later on, well, this is a kind of a very hard
4314800	4319760	wiring, but every organ will be subjected to the same thing. You need to override that. You need
4319760	4324480	to have a better system of organizing it if you wish to become any more complicated than a blob.
4325440	4331840	And that's where I think the bioelectric feels the beginning to come in, is you've got a level
4331840	4336400	of organization that says where the same, where together, we're not quite an individual,
4338400	4346240	we're in this grouping here. But coming back to planaria, you cut it into a lump of 250,
4346240	4352800	270 cells, whatever it may be. I'm wondering about how do you prevent your genome becoming
4352800	4358800	completely trashed? And I suppose part of the answer would be, well, if you're not every cell
4358800	4363760	is going to get equally trashed, and not every bit of tissue is going to get equally trashed.
4363760	4368720	So if you would just slice it up into little bits, some bits would have a better genome
4368720	4373680	than others. They would have some level of genomic integrity, at least at a functional level,
4373680	4377840	not necessarily in terms of they've all got neat chromosomes, but they're capable of generating
4377840	4382720	the hardware which is required to regenerate the whole planarium. So there's a kind of a bottle
4382720	4387840	neck just in the pieces. And those pieces have to be large enough that they're able to reestablish
4388880	4393040	the bioelectric fields and know their own morphology. It has to be big enough that it
4393040	4397440	can reestablish a planarium. If it's one cell, it's got no idea what its neighbor is, so it
4397440	4403040	wouldn't do it. But that, I think from a point of view of kind of more conventional genetics,
4404000	4407680	you'd say there was some kind of bottleneck in cutting the planarium up and the smaller bits
4407680	4410640	that will lead to damage will be the ones most likely to regenerate.
4412000	4416240	Yeah. Well, the thing is they all regenerate. All of them do.
4419760	4425600	I mean, it's right. I think you would want to say something like that, but A, every piece
4425600	4432400	regenerates, and B, every mutation that doesn't kill the cell that it's in gets propagated. So
4432400	4437120	there are these stem cells. There's about 30% of the animal disease, neoblast. So when they get hit
4437120	4442080	with a mutation, anything that doesn't kill that stem cell, it now propagates when the thing divides
4442080	4446880	itself in half. It becomes sort of amplified in the next generation, which is why they look
4446880	4454640	like hell, the genetics look like hell. And so you would think that there's a limit to this,
4454640	4460320	but I think the pressure of having a nice clean genome is way low for these guys.
4461200	4466800	Just they've gone to the point. Steve Frank gave me a cool analogy to this. Did you know I
4466800	4470640	didn't know about this when I heard about this that, you know, I'm rate arrays in computers,
4470640	4475200	right, where you have a instead of one disc, you have like six discs, and there's a system which
4475200	4481040	does a parody thing so that so so apparently ever since rate arrays became a thing, the quality
4481040	4485840	of the media has gone down because there's no because the pressure on having a good disc is
4485840	4490000	down because that doesn't matter that much. You've got a rate array. And so and so right. So
4490960	4494560	so there's this feedback loop where the better your software for correcting errors, the less
4494560	4499600	pressure there is on the media to be to be reliable. But once you go there, it's hard to
4499600	4504240	write. It's a ratchet because once you can't suddenly say, well, I'm taking my rate array
4504240	4510880	off. Well, now you can't because you're because your media is crap now. So yeah, I mean, I some
4510880	4517360	of the stuff I do is on is on mitochondrial DNA, which is generally said to be at least evolving
4517360	4522240	about 10 times faster than the nuclear genes. There's not that much of it. It's quite small.
4522240	4526720	And it always comes in effect in colonies. So there may be several hundred thousand copies
4526720	4532080	in a single site. And so how does quality control work? And in the case of the mitochondria,
4532080	4536480	there definitely is quality control, even though it's evolving and mutating pretty quickly.
4537040	4540800	And again, you have a lot of differences in mitochondrial sequences between different
4540800	4546560	tissues and mutations accumulating as we age and so on, though probably not fast enough to
4546560	4554160	drive aging as a process. And again, there's a lot that can be done with
4556640	4559680	some form of bottlenecking in the broadest sense, which is to say,
4560800	4565920	you need I mean, the way the way that it seems to work with the mitochondria in the germline
4565920	4573840	is that there are groups of cells, clumps of cells, germline cysts, they're called in the female
4574320	4578640	germline. And they group together and they form cytoplasmic connections between them. And they
4578640	4585520	transfer mitochondria as well as Golgi apparatus and RNAs and things into the, it's not necessarily
4585520	4592480	the central cell, but a cell in the middle of this network. And that effectively accumulates
4593280	4599360	mitochondria in what's called the mitochondrial cloud sometimes, the Balbiani body. And there's
4599360	4603600	an interesting question then, you're bringing all this DNA together from separate sources.
4605040	4609520	What's going on? We've just gone through rounds of segregation during early germline development
4609520	4615840	where you produce something like six or seven million Ugonia, the very earliest germ cells
4615840	4621840	which are dividing by mitosis. And then we start fusing them together and transferring material
4621840	4631520	between them. We did a simulation study trying to work out, well, what would be the expected rate
4631520	4636880	of mutation accumulation? And can we compare it with mutations, mitochondria mutations in human
4636880	4642400	populations? What is the known incidence of mitochondrial diseases? And can we predict that?
4643040	4647840	And it turned out that if you had some level of selection on mitochondrial function,
4648640	4652800	which is to say the simplest way to see it will be membrane potential. If you can generate,
4652800	4657280	if you can, as a single mitochondrion with a bit of mitochondrial DNA, if you can generate a
4657280	4662800	membrane potential, you can go over there. If you can't do it, you stay here. So it's at the level
4662800	4667600	of the software, that's where the judgment is going on, but you're throwing out the hardware,
4667600	4673840	which is not very good, which is not very good in the sense of not able to generate the membrane
4673840	4678240	potential. And then you accumulate all the ones which are capable of generating a decent membrane
4678240	4686480	potential in what's now the primordial oocyte, and then amplify that up and it becomes, if it
4686480	4694480	matures, it becomes the oocyte. And that selection on the function as they're pulled together was
4694480	4700320	able to predict moderately accurately the actual incidence of mitochondrial diseases. So it's
4700400	4706000	not that you're avoiding mutations so much as you're able to kind of, despite the fact you've
4706000	4710720	always got large populations, you're able to kind of select on some level of function. I've
4710720	4715040	got no idea if there's anything like that happening in planaria, that there's some level that these
4715040	4722400	cells are capable of generating enough of a field that it's got the right tuning to regenerate.
4722400	4726160	I mean, you're saying everything can, but presumably there must be some point where it
4726160	4731840	collapses. Yeah. Well, I mean, so that's super interesting. One of the things we're going to
4731840	4741280	be looking for when we reprise this experiment of keeping them in mutagens and all that,
4742240	4748080	the prediction that I would make consistent with what you just said is that the one thing you can't
4748080	4754640	do is trash all of your ion channels. And we know that they're sensitive to that,
4754640	4759840	because we can make two-headed worms and worms that look like all kinds of crazy stuff. That's
4759840	4765040	very easy by targeting these capture agents. So one interesting hypothesis that comes out of
4765040	4771440	what you just said is that there is a selection step, which is make whatever mutations you want,
4771440	4776560	but if you lose the ability to be electrically, and I'm not sure if it's just keeping a certain
4776560	4780000	v-mem or maybe reacting, maybe it's a second order thing, I don't know, we'll see.
4780720	4785760	As long as you hold on to that, everything else is good to go. So that's a really interesting
4785760	4792000	idea. I love that idea that there's a minimal electrical competency that you get tested for,
4792560	4801280	and that that's your bottleneck. Yeah. I may ping you offline later for some references to this
4801280	4807040	thing in my country, because I think that's actually super interesting. Yeah. And I think also,
4807040	4814400	we can kind of talk about the, because there has to be some sort of plasticity threshold
4814400	4822560	of the genetics level. And I mean, that begs the question. I mean, first of all, can we understand
4822560	4833440	just by the genome, which organism, which species is it, et cetera? And how much plasticity can we
4833440	4842800	allow in the hardware? Yeah. I don't know. People say things like developmental constraints,
4842800	4848080	you can only make certain things with a certain genome. I am not sure of that at all. I think that
4850080	4856240	in my head, I have this challenge that I think what we should be aiming for is this thing I call
4856240	4861440	the anatomical compiler. And I think we ought to be able to do is in the future is sit down in front
4861440	4866720	of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want, whatever it is. I don't care what it is.
4866720	4870720	It's a seven legged frog with a propeller on top, but you know, anything you like,
4871760	4876400	right? Like anything you want. And if we knew what we were doing, this thing would compile
4876400	4881200	that description down into a set of stimuli that would get a standard set of cells to build whatever.
4881200	4885040	Now, you're not going to make things that disobey gravity. You're not going to make things that
4885360	4894160	have a copper armature for a motor. That's fine. But biologically, possible shapes, whatever they
4894160	4900960	are, you should be able to make. And I bet, I don't know if we'll live to see this thing, but
4900960	4907920	I would bet that it's possible. And from the plasticity that I see, even before we really
4907920	4912400	understand anything about how collectives of cells make decisions, but I think we already
4912400	4916800	have examples that I think are telling you that this standard thing we see in development
4916800	4923280	is just one of a huge space of possible things it can do. So if I had to put money down right now,
4923280	4931520	I would say that I think almost any allowable geometric shape could be made if we understood
4931520	4939360	how to communicate with cellular collectives. Sorry, go ahead. What do you think it is that's
4939360	4948960	tending to produce the same shape repeatedly? So here's my hypothesis on all of this.
4949680	4958480	I think that evolution does not counter to expectation. I think evolution generally
4958480	4964160	does not take the past literally. In other words, it does not over train on prior examples. In
4964160	4968480	machine learning, you have this notion of over training when the thing memorizes the past examples
4968480	4973280	instead of generalizing from them. And there may be organisms like that. Maybe C. elegans is like
4973280	4979680	that. I don't know. But generally, I think what evolution does is instead of producing a specific
4979680	4984720	solution to a specific environment, I think it generally makes problem solving machines. And
4984720	4988960	the reason I think it does that is because the environment, both the individual cell environment
4988960	4996000	and the overall environment is so uncertain that maybe we had creatures way at the beginning
4996000	4999920	that really were just suitable for one kind of environment. I think those are all gone now.
4999920	5005760	I think anything that we see now, our systems, what evolution gives us is a system that can
5008000	5013120	behave adaptively in a huge range of circumstances, not because we've seen those
5013120	5018320	circumstances before and now you've got built in abilities to handle them, although in some cases
5018320	5024480	they may. But what we're making is hardware that's a problem solver in a wide domain. And we have a
5024480	5029440	bunch of examples of that where we challenge living things with conditions that they've never
5029440	5036240	seen before. And they're fine. They do novel things that are completely unexpected. And so
5036240	5042560	I think what evolution does is produce hardware that under normal circumstances reliably does one
5042560	5048160	thing. But that's not the only thing it can do. It's sort of like I always envision you get this
5049520	5054320	calculator and you buy a thousand of them from a factory and you turn them all on and they
5054320	5060080	all say zero. You say, wow, this thing is incredibly reliable. Yeah, under those conditions,
5060080	5063920	they'll all say zero. That's not the only thing it can do. And with appropriate inputs and
5063920	5068080	appropriate other scenarios, it'll do all kinds of stuff. And you'll never know if all you're
5068080	5074000	watching is the standard. That's why I like synthetic morphology and I like challenging
5074000	5082400	things with all kinds of weird scenarios. I'll give you a couple of examples. Here's an example.
5082480	5088720	Take planarium and you put them in a solution of barium. Barium is a non-specific potassium
5088720	5093600	channel blocker. So all their potassium channels stop working. Their heads are full of neurons
5093600	5097520	and other things that like to transfer potassium. So their heads explode literally overnight.
5097520	5104640	Their heads explode. Well, you take those remaining bodies and you leave them in the barium. In fact,
5104640	5109760	you refresh the barium every couple of days. Within two weeks, they regrow a new head. The new
5109840	5115440	head doesn't care about barium at all. No problem. So we said, well, that's bizarre. How could that be?
5115440	5120640	So we took the original heads. We took the barium adapted heads. We did a really knowing that the
5120640	5126000	answer might not be transcriptional, but this is the tool we have. So basically what we did was
5126000	5130000	we just asked, what's different in the gene expression between the barium adapted heads and
5130000	5136640	the control heads? A very small number of genes different. And so imagine now. And so now here's
5136640	5141200	the trick. Plenarium never see barium in the wild. There's no barium out in the wild. There's no
5141200	5145280	evolutionary pressure to know what to do when you're poisoned by barium. That doesn't exist.
5145280	5152720	Imagine you're in this nuclear reactor control room. The genes are all the knobs. You've got
5152720	5157600	20,000 different knobs. You're hit with this physiological stressor. The thing's melting
5157600	5162800	down. It's going to explode. You don't have time to randomly try different knobs. You don't have
5162800	5166960	time for gradient descent. These are not bacteria that cells don't turn over all that fast. So you
5166960	5171520	can't just randomly mutate and see who survives and then they rebuild the head. There's no time for
5171520	5177200	that. The cells don't grow that fast. Within a very short period of time, this thing navigates the
5177200	5185520	whatever 20,000 dimensional space of gene expression to zero in on about a dozen transcripts that will
5185520	5191120	solve your physiological problem. Now, how in the heck does it know? For a completely new
5191200	5195920	stressor like this, how does it know which ones those are? So you can think about it. So we don't
5195920	5201600	know the answer to this. But one thing that it might be able to do is, okay, I've never seen
5201600	5208800	barium before, but I have seen epileptic seizures before. And so maybe the excitotoxicity of having
5208800	5214960	your neurons die from abnormal potassium flux is somewhat similar. So what you really have is
5214960	5219440	you have the ability to generalize. So this is a system that, in any other, if we had a robot
5219440	5223040	that did this, this would be generalization and learning of the highest degree, right? This is
5223040	5227600	like, I haven't seen this before, but I've seen something else. And I bet it's similar enough
5227600	5235520	to this that I can try this out, right? So that's one example. Another example is the xenobots.
5235520	5243040	So we take some skin from frog embryos. They replicate themselves with kinematic self-replication.
5243040	5246480	They run around, collect other skin cells, put them into a little ball and now you get your next
5247440	5251200	There's never been any xenobots in the wild. There's never been pressure to be a good xenobot.
5251200	5256400	There's no other animal does kinematic self-replication. So I think life is capable of
5256400	5263600	huge number of a variety of things that solve problems that go beyond the narrow default that
5263600	5269760	we see. I mean, just coming back to the barium issue and the generalization, I mean, there's
5269760	5277760	lots of, there was a bacterium dinococcus radiodurans, which is astonishing the radiation
5277760	5282000	resistance and grows on the inside of nuclear power stations and can survive in outer space
5282000	5286480	and all kinds of things like that. They sometimes call it, I think, colon the bacterium. And
5288240	5293840	the question is, well, how does it actually do that? And it's largely exposure to other types
5293840	5300000	of stress. So for example, dehydration stress generates pretty much the same kind of internal
5300000	5309920	metabolic problems that radiation does. And so in some sense, I would see it as your metabolism
5309920	5313360	is stressed in a particular way. It doesn't matter if it's barium or something else,
5313360	5317520	which is stressing it as an epileptic fit, which is stressing it in that way, excited toxicity
5317520	5322960	or whatever. There's a particular type of stress that the cell is experiencing in its
5322960	5328080	metabolism. And there's a physiological response to deal with that, which might be to express a
5330800	5336720	different iron pump on the membrane, which doesn't do potassium, but does sodium instead.
5336720	5341280	Or I don't know what do I do, but there'll be a physiological response that you could have to
5341280	5349680	that, which is in effect generalizing from the stress to the metabolism internally, rather than
5349680	5355840	being able to identify what the external problem is. I completely agree with that. So that's one
5357520	5361920	policy for handling the unknown. And I think that's exactly right. I think that
5363600	5370080	multi-scale architecture where you have the genetics and you have the physiology and then
5370080	5376720	you have anatomy and so on, it becomes like a neural network, not in the neural aspect,
5376960	5381120	but in the information processing aspect that generalizes for the same reason that
5382480	5388960	the connection is to networks generalize in machine learning. It's an inherent property
5388960	5393760	of these networks that they can do stuff like that. Every layer sort of generalizes to the
5393760	5399120	categories of the layer before it. And so that's why I think it's just an inherent structure.
5400080	5404480	Not to also forget that now we see that even pathways can learn. So they have
5404720	5411040	some ability to learn from experience and so on. So I think that's why I'm so sanguine on
5411040	5418560	being able to build anything for themselves. And where are or how these memories are stored?
5424080	5430640	I mean, Mike can probably answer that, but just one story to insert before he does.
5431200	5441920	There was a lady, she died recently at the age of 96 at UCL called Ursula Mitvok and she worked
5441920	5445040	on sex determination for a long time. And she was very interested in- Oh, she died?
5446000	5450720	Yes, you're familiar with Ursula's work. I know her, yeah. I didn't know she passed. I knew she was
5450720	5456400	quite old, yeah. Yeah, she was extraordinarily active until really only a couple of years ago.
5456800	5461200	I wrote an obituary of her. I really admired her work. I'll send it to you.
5463360	5470400	But she linked it to growth rates because there's all these different types of
5470400	5475440	chromosomal sex determination and X and Y chromosomes are only a part of it. There'd be
5475440	5481440	multiple origins of different types of X and Y chromosome birds and many other things have got
5481440	5487520	ZW chromosomes where it's the other way around that the male is the homogometic sex with two of
5487520	5494720	the same chromosomes. And then there's temperature dependent sex determination and she had linked
5494720	5500400	the whole lot to growth rates. And effectively what the Y chromosome is doing is activating
5500400	5506720	some growth factors that say, you know, go ahead and grow quickly. And there's some interesting
5506800	5512000	questions in my own mind about mitochondrial inheritance and when you are allowed to grow
5512000	5517840	quickly and when it's best not to grow quickly, which may. So this earliest distinction between
5519280	5528800	a male embryo developing a female is just size. Males grow faster early on, not necessarily
5528800	5535440	throughout the entire development, but grow faster earlier. And then she called attention to
5536320	5541440	stuchomaphodides who I think there's maybe a different term now, but effectively have an ovary
5541440	5547920	on one side and a testis on the other side. And it's not random which side it's on. The testis is
5547920	5553280	usually, you know, 70% of the time is on the right hand side and the ovary on the left hand side.
5555040	5559280	And there are slight differences in growth rates between the right hand side
5559280	5563440	and the left hand side at that early stage. Measurable differences, measurable, you know,
5563520	5571760	with a weighing scales or a ruler practically, that level of detection. And so, you know,
5571760	5576800	talking about developmental plasticity, what are you going to develop an ovary or a testis?
5577600	5581520	It's a pretty constrained developmental plasticity in relation to some of the things you're
5581520	5587840	talking about. But still, it's determined not just genetically. And there are all kinds of
5587840	5592000	interesting, you know, there are mice with mutations in particular genes that will lead
5592000	5596960	to a sex change, which have got nothing to do with the Y chromosome or with the
5597760	5604000	SLY gene or anything like that is able to overwrite the SLY gene simply by increasing the growth rate
5604000	5610400	of the embryo or decreasing it and becoming female instead of male. So there are these other,
5610400	5615600	in terms of what do you develop into and how much developmental plasticity is there,
5616560	5625760	factors like growth rates can play a major role. Exactly how and how common that is, I don't know,
5625760	5631200	but, you know, this whole idea that temperature dependent sex determination in amphibians and
5631200	5639040	so on, basically doing the same thing as the chromosome shows all this possibility of overwriting
5639040	5642720	things we think we know the answer to. We think the answer lies in a gene which says you're going
5642720	5647280	to become male, you're going to become female. And there's all of these, you know, intersexual
5647280	5653040	states, in fact, and mostly it's this or that. But there's a scope in the middle is what she
5653040	5660800	called, I think, I forget the term that she had for it, but it's basically a threshold
5660800	5666160	dichotomy, I think was the phrase that she used. So the genes tend to push you into one state or
5666160	5671760	the other state, but there's quite a lot of flex between the two. Yeah, amazing.
5673360	5679200	Yeah, so I can talk a little bit about the bioelectric memories that override the genetics,
5679200	5685200	but I want to go first, even just more basic than that. So here's the kind of, to me,
5685200	5691040	the most stunning thing. Imagine a single amniote embryo, let's say an amniote embryo,
5691040	5696240	so a bird or human or something. It's a flat blasted disk like this, about 50,000 cells.
5696880	5700720	So you look at an early stage, so you look at this thing, you say, well, there's an embryo,
5700720	5704880	and you might ask yourself, well, what are we counting when we say there's one embryo?
5704880	5711200	I mean, most of the time there's one embryo, but one thing you can do is you can, and I did this
5711200	5716560	as a grad student in ducks and chicken eggs, you can take a little needle and you can put a scratch
5716560	5720400	or multiple scratches through that blasted term. And this is a method discovered by this guy,
5720400	5725840	Lutz, in the 40s. So you put a couple of scratches in. And then what happens is that each region of
5725840	5732720	that blasted term for a while until it heals up, doesn't feel the other regions and self-organizes
5732720	5737920	into an embryo. And then when it heals up, you've got conjoined twins or triplets or whatever.
5739040	5744240	So now, so there's a couple of interesting things that come out of this. First of all,
5744240	5750400	what you're counting when you say it's an embryo is how many distinct locally aligned
5750400	5754960	collectives are there that are all working on one project? And usually there's one, and that project
5754960	5759440	is getting to a particular area of morphospace building the right kind of embryo. But there
5759440	5764160	doesn't have to be one. There could be anywhere from zero to probably 10 or so, I would guess.
5764880	5769600	And that number is absolutely not genetically determined. You don't know how many embryos
5769600	5775440	are in this thing until the physiology has had it say. And then you will find out maybe it's
5775440	5780640	typically one, but it doesn't have to be one. How many are in there is a funny kind of thing,
5780640	5784320	because it will self-organize, right? It doesn't, you don't know that there's one.
5784320	5788560	And what I like about this is that aside from the fact that it's just like this thing that's
5788560	5794560	totally not determined, again, what evolution has given us is a machine that generates
5794560	5799760	coordinated selves. It doesn't give us one coordinated self. It gives us a machine that
5799760	5804240	can generate these coordinated selves. And if you leave it alone, it'll give you one. If you
5804240	5808320	cut it in half, it'll give you two. And you can sort of, you know, you can have your pick.
5809120	5814720	It's a little bit, I think, linked to the same question in cognitive science. If I
5814720	5820160	show you a brain and you don't know what a human is, and I say to you, hey, look at this thing,
5820960	5825840	how many intelligences you're supposed to fit in there? You have no clue. We don't have any way
5825840	5830160	of estimating, you know, the number of intelligences per square, you know, per cubic inch of material,
5830160	5834800	like we don't know. But typically with typical humans, you say, well, that's one. That's, you
5834800	5840800	know, my friend, my friend, Joe. But actually, we know from split brain patients, from dissociative
5840800	5845200	disorders, that there's all kinds of potential individuals in there, right? And then, you know,
5845200	5850240	sort of think there's one. But so, so again, that, and again, not genetically determined,
5850240	5855280	it's all about inputs in history and, and, and learning and, and, you know, experiences and
5855280	5861760	who knows what else. So, so this, there's some very basic and fundamental stuff that
5861760	5866640	isn't genetic, because the genetics doesn't lay down the final answer, it generates, it gives you
5866640	5871440	a machine that will then generate these things in various, you know, in various orders. And in
5871440	5879360	planaria, so what we've done in, in planaria is just this, if you look down in, onto a planarian
5879360	5885200	using this voltage sensitive dye, you see a pattern, the voltage pattern, we've sort of
5885200	5889920	learned to decode it, we can tell when it says build one head versus two. The basic question was,
5889920	5894000	hey, how do you know how many heads you should have as a planarian? Yes. How would you know,
5894000	5897120	right? The assumption is, well, what else would it be? It's a, you know, it's a genetically
5897120	5902240	determined, it's one, what else would it be? Well, so, so what happens is, so, so what happens is,
5902240	5911440	there's a, there's a, there's a single, there's an electrical gradient that normally specifies
5911440	5917200	one head, one tail. Well, we use some ion channel drugs, and we, we changed that to say two heads,
5917840	5923120	and no genetic changes. So just a brief, what 48 hour physiological stimulus,
5924000	5930320	and then that, that animal will then, if you injure it, will then make two headed animals.
5930320	5937440	Now a couple of interesting things. That two headed pattern is read out from a one headed host. In
5937440	5941520	other words, it's not a pattern of what you have now. It doesn't reflect your current anatomy.
5941600	5947520	It's a, it's a counterfactual memory. It's a representation of what you will do if you get
5947520	5952160	injured in the future. So it's like a, it's like an early version of, of this kind of mental time
5952160	5956080	travel that brains are very good at, right? Imagining things that aren't true right now.
5958480	5962720	No, no genetic changes. And the amazing thing is that if you take these two headed animals and
5962720	5967520	you cut them further, they will continue to generate two headed worms forever, even though
5967520	5971920	there's nothing genetically wrong with any of them. So the question of, of right, the question of
5971920	5976400	what determines the number of heads in the planarian is kind of subtle. On the one hand,
5977200	5981520	you can sort of say it's DNA because if you didn't have the ion channels, none of this would be
5981520	5989200	happening. So okay, we need the hardware. We know that. But also it is the case that the exact same
5989200	5993920	hardware is perfectly happy making one head, two heads, heads from a different species, weird,
5994640	5999040	spiky cylinders that we've made that don't look anything like planaria. That same hardware is
5999040	6004320	perfectly happy making all of that stuff. And where, and the information is in the,
6007760	6011280	at least part of that, the important part of that information is in this, in this steady
6011280	6018240	state bio electrical gradient that is basically the software to the genetically specified hardware.
6018960	6024480	Yeah. And then you can see it, you can see it, you can rewrite it and it totally dominates the
6024480	6031680	default, you know, the default state. Have you managed to do the same kind of thing in,
6032960	6039840	say, tadpoles or other animals in planaria? Yeah, yeah. So in tadpoles, so this is what
6039840	6045600	we've done. We've made tadpole faces that look like other species of frogs. We've made tadpole
6045680	6052480	tails that look like zebrafish. And we've made frogs regenerate legs the way salamanders regenerate
6052480	6060480	legs. And, and we're currently all from, from the ion channels from modulating the expression of
6060480	6067440	ion channels, ion channels or neurotransmitters, which are often the downstream, you know, the
6067440	6071920	basically much like in the nervous system, the, the way that the electric circuit propagates its
6071920	6075840	decisions down is through movement of neurotransmitters, which then turn genes on and off,
6075840	6080960	which then do other stuff. So, so sometimes you can skip it, you can skip the, the, the top layer
6080960	6085120	and do the, and do the neurotransmitter thing. So we've done it that way too. But yeah, that's
6085120	6089600	basically, that's basically it. So we've done it, we've done it. And, and, and we know this works
6089600	6097760	in mammals because human channelopathies. So you've got human humans who have either taken drugs
6097760	6101680	that affect ion channels. So there's a bunch of ion channel drugs or teratogens.
6101680	6106960	They will have the same craniofacial defects as we see, for example, in, in, in a frog.
6108240	6115280	Same thing. How much of, of evolution is actually geared to restricting
6116720	6122480	the scope for phenotypic plasticity, do you think? I mean, it seems as if less in the case of
6122480	6130320	plenaria, more in the case of mammals, let's say, still the scope is there. But I suppose if what
6130320	6136320	you want to do is generally produce an organism that looks the same as its parents, then there must
6136320	6143360	be really strong selection pressure on the order in which especially ion channels are being expressed.
6144960	6150960	I mean, that's true. There certainly are stereotypical patterns of expression. I
6153440	6159760	I'm not sure. I'm not sure if the pressure is to produce the same thing that your parents were,
6159760	6166640	or if it's to produce something that's successful. And, you know, like, I, I don't know.
6166640	6171440	I mean, the fact that most animals do look like their parents implies that there's been selection
6171440	6176960	pressure to produce the same thing, despite the huge potential scope for doing something completely
6177040	6185360	different. They look like them under the same conditions. So, so people like the people who
6185360	6191200	work in plants will tell you that depending on depending on the the way you where you plant
6191200	6194720	that seed, you're going to get things that don't look anything like the like like the parents,
6194720	6201280	right? And I think I think in animals, it's, you know, sort of less that. But yeah, I don't know.
6201280	6205680	I don't know if the pressure is for consistency, or if the pressure is for some other kind of
6205680	6210480	second order parameter, like if, if the environment is what we've seen before,
6211360	6216720	don't do anything different, just do the exact same thing. But, but if circumstance does change,
6217520	6222960	you've got all these other tools that you can deploy. We will have, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't,
6222960	6226160	I don't like to talk about stuff that isn't published and peer reviewed, because then it's
6226160	6230160	just, you know, me telling stories. But I think in the next six months or so, you're going to see
6230160	6233840	a couple of, we're going to have a couple of papers come out that address this, this issue
6233840	6240720	that look at gene expression in xenobots compared to normal embryos. And xenobots made from other
6240720	6246480	cells that are not frog and have nothing to do with frog embryos. I think the plasticity is,
6246480	6250800	is enormous. I don't think we've been able to, we've even scratched the surface of all this.
6251920	6258320	I mean, when we are thinking of plasticity, I always also admire this idea of ploidy, for
6258320	6264720	example. So you mentioned that plenaria mix up mixed ploids, then there are, I mean, we can talk
6264720	6272400	about plants itself, we know that they change their ploidy. So how much that has to do, or do
6272400	6279520	you think that this can be also a factor? I don't know much about it, but, but, but I will tell
6279520	6287840	you my favorite ploidy story that I think bears on this. So salamanders, you can, there's a little
6288560	6292320	little tube that goes to the kidneys, the kidney tubule. If you take a cross section through
6292320	6297040	this kidney tubule, what you see is typically eight or 10 cells working together to make this
6297040	6303840	nice kidney tubule. Okay. If you can, if now one thing you can do is you can make these,
6303840	6308960	you can make these nudes that are multiple ploidy. So you can make four n, six n, eight n nudes,
6308960	6313760	right? So the first amazing thing is that you can, you can double or triple the amount of genetic
6313760	6318240	material. I don't care. Fine. You still get the same nudes. So, so that's kind of, you know, all,
6318240	6322960	that speaks to my same point is that it doesn't really assume. So, so embryogenesis does not
6322960	6327440	assume how many copies of your genetic material you have. So that's the first thing. The second
6327440	6333120	thing is as you increase the ploidy, the cells get physically bigger and bigger. Okay. Yes.
6333840	6338080	When the cells get bigger and bigger, the salamander stays exactly the same. How can it be?
6338080	6342480	Because fewer and fewer of the larger cells are being used to make the various organs.
6342480	6348080	So you can't count on how many copies of the genes you have. You can't count on what how many,
6348080	6353520	what your cell size is. If you're, if you're even a human embryo, we can cut you into four pieces
6353520	6358960	and you get four quadruplets. You can't even count on how many cells you have. Now the ploidy
6358960	6363600	story is, so you really, really just assume you have to, as a proper embryo, you have to assume
6363600	6367680	you don't know much going in. Who knows what things are going to be like and you still have
6367680	6372400	to be able to do the right thing. Now, now here's the ploidy, the rest of the ploidy story. So
6373200	6379120	when you make eight n nudes, the cells get so enormous that there's not room for more than
6379120	6385200	one cell to make a tubule. What do they do? A single cell bends around itself like this,
6385200	6390880	leaving a hole in the middle, which, which gives you the tubule. Now that, okay. So, so the thing,
6390880	6395920	the thing that's crazy about that is that now that's a completely different molecular mechanism
6395920	6399840	instead of cell to cell communication, which you need to make the tubule, you are now using
6399840	6405440	cytoskeletal bending to, to, to, to drag yourself into this crazy shape. So what I love, right?
6405440	6409760	It's amazing. And so, so what I love about this is that it's a good example of top down causation,
6409760	6416560	meaning that what you've got is in the service of this anatomical feature, different molecular
6416560	6421600	mechanisms get called up and we're seeing something like this in some of our not yet published stuff
6421600	6427840	in, in, in the Xenobots too, different molecular mechanisms get called up to do their thing to
6427840	6435280	achieve this, this sort of higher level outcome. So, you know, that's, so I think, yeah, I think
6435280	6439520	ploidy is, is a, is a fantastic example of this. Because if you can't count, if you can't, if you
6439520	6443440	don't assume how many copies of your instructions you're going to have, you don't assume how big
6443440	6449360	your cells are, you don't assume how many of them you have, you better have rock solid morphogenetic
6449360	6454640	control to get the job done despite all of that. And, and salamanders do, which is why they're so
6454640	6458320	regenerative, but they're not in the not as good as planaria, but they're pretty darn good. They
6458320	6464800	regenerate all kinds of organs. So I mean, under, underpinning all of that, this cell volume
6466080	6472480	and, and, and ploidy, it's not just ploidy, it's, it's genome is the total amount of DNA in the
6472480	6478720	nucleus. So it's the nuclear volume. There is a very tight correlation between nuclear volumes
6478720	6485520	and cell volume, which used to be known as the C value paradox, which is to say the cells,
6485520	6491840	mostly amoeba have some enormous genomes, you know, thousands of times larger than the human genome.
6493120	6497680	Why it's, you know, this whole idea of junk DNA, what are they putting in there?
6499120	6502960	A large amount of it is that you have a large cell, you have a large nucleus and you fill that
6502960	6507760	nucleus with DNA and ploidy forces you to have a larger, higher ploidy forces you to have a larger
6507760	6511840	nucleus, which forces you to have a larger cell. And that forces you to be resourceful in terms of
6511840	6517600	you want to make a tube, you do it from a single cell instead of 14 cells or what it used to be.
6517600	6524560	So there's, and I don't think there's ever been a good explanation for why a large cell would
6524560	6533360	have a large nucleus. There, there are ideas out there. But they often relate to the ratio
6533360	6538720	between the number of ribosomes and the number of nuclear pore complexes and this kind of thing.
6539360	6544480	None of them are particularly persuasive. I don't think we have a good explanation for why a large
6544480	6549280	cell should have a large nucleus. And yet it's able to force all of these changes on you.
6551360	6557760	Yeah, so since we are running out of time, I mean, maybe I can throw in like one last topic and
6557760	6563920	probably, I believe that probably both of you would kind of like to discuss about it.
6563920	6571040	So, so when you mentioned about neurotransmitters, which is like one level down kind of regulation,
6571920	6577600	let's talk about anesthesia, because I think that's also something which is one level down,
6578960	6585360	regulates it, I don't know how much of the work is done on some sort of, you know, simpler scales.
6585600	6592640	But okay, I mean, let's, well, you can anesthetize single cells, critters,
6592640	6598560	planaria and things like that. Yeah. I mean, I discussed in the last chapter of the book,
6598560	6604560	some of the work from Luca Turin, showing, showing that anesthetics
6605200	6611360	affects electron transfer to oxygen. And we've been doing some work on that just recently.
6611360	6614400	We've not published any of it yet. We've not gone very far at all. So I won't say much,
6614400	6620960	but we've basically, we also find that it's lower oxygen rate of consumption of oxygen.
6622160	6628720	And, and depending on the context in which you give them affects the membrane potential.
6629760	6638160	Now, to try and distinguish between just the mitochondria making ATP and that ATP being used
6638160	6644480	to control the plasma membrane, iron pump, for example, and ATP is in the membrane.
6645840	6649520	Obviously, if you don't have as much ATP, that pump is not going to work as well. And so,
6649520	6653040	you know, this is not a causal link between mitochondrial function and consciousness.
6653040	6657680	All it says is that underpinning this energy consuming process, which is consciousness,
6658240	6663280	energy matters, which is a statement of the obvious, I suppose. But there's also a possibility
6664000	6671920	that there are direct fields involved that you're influencing the electromagnetic fields
6671920	6675680	generated potentially by mitochondria. And then there can be direct interactions with
6675680	6681760	the plasma membrane field that way. That's a much more exciting possibility to my mind.
6682960	6689760	But very, very difficult to distinguish between how do you change the field in the measurable
6689760	6695440	way while maintaining ATP synthesis at the same level, which is a tricky thing,
6695440	6699760	a tricky mechanistic thing to do. But we're trying to get at that. I mean, I think this is,
6700880	6707280	this is perhaps one of the one of the biggest questions in science now is what actually
6708080	6713680	is going on in the in the wiring of consciousness, if you like, and I'm certain fields are involved.
6714640	6717440	But but how exactly I'm not so sure.
6719280	6725200	Yeah, so it's really interesting. You might enjoy, I've got this, this book from this guy,
6725200	6733040	JC Bose, B-O-S-E. And I can send you a PDF of it. He's an Indian guy from over 100 years ago that
6733040	6738640	was doing a bunch of physiology and he, and he started anesthetizing animal tissues and using
6738640	6743600	electrophysiology to monitor what happens. And then he did the plants, right? And then eventually,
6744080	6749040	a metal bar. So, so he's got this, he's got this book called response in the living and non-living,
6749600	6754160	where, you know, maybe so, so, so I don't know the mechanisms that underlie any of that. But,
6754160	6759120	but there could be, if it's, if it's, if it's the kind of thing you're talking about, I could easily
6759120	6764480	see why he would be seeing effects like this in in in organic substrates as well.
6766960	6773200	Yeah, I tend to draw a line at life, which is to say what I was talking about at the beginning
6773200	6780960	about bacteria using the, the, the fields on the membrane as a means of integrating the metabolism
6780960	6787120	of the cell. And I would see then the central nervous system as some kind of an amplification and
6789360	6794080	formal subtle and complex, of course, but, but, but, but still somehow linked to the
6794080	6800640	integration of information through, through linking your metabolic state at a cellular level,
6800640	6807600	and then at a network level and so on. Whether you need fields to be involved in that, I don't know,
6807600	6813120	but we can measure changes in the EEG. And I don't think we have an absolutely clear idea of
6813120	6818880	exactly what is generating the EEG at a subcellular level. Is it, is it just a plasma membrane,
6818880	6823840	the axonal membranes that are depolarizing or mitochondria playing a role in that as well.
6823840	6827600	So that's an area I'm fascinated by, but it's difficult to get at.
6830720	6838080	Yeah, so in the, like, I think, if we think of the same about the same topic,
6839040	6845040	interesting thing is so about the synthetic cells or synthetic life in general, like all the work
6845040	6850560	which is going on there, I mean, from the engineering perspective, right? That's also
6852160	6859760	kind of kind of let's say crucial in a way, or it is focused on the information centric view,
6859760	6866000	right? Like people are trying to put together again, some sort of genomes, some sort of genes,
6866000	6872320	transcription, translation, of course, they have membrane in. But my question, or maybe briefly,
6872320	6879280	if you can just explain your view, so how important would be this kind of bioelectric or
6879280	6884800	kind of this software that we have discussed today for to create those kind of synthetic systems?
6884800	6892800	Maybe one word answer, all all importance. I don't think you're going to do it without
6892800	6904000	100. Yeah, 100. Like, how or is it possible to kind of, you know, I don't know, do it without
6904000	6911840	the information part without the hardware? I think you can only go so far without genes at all.
6912560	6917520	How far? I don't know. I mean, you know, the plenarium is a very good example there. You can
6917520	6922160	you can stramble your genome, but presumably you can't completely collapse your genome.
6922720	6929760	When I think about it the other way up with the origin of life, how do, where does information
6929760	6936640	come from in biology? And I'm fairly persuaded now from our own experiments, but other people's
6936720	6943120	work around the world as well in the last five, six, seven years, a lot of a lot of metabolism
6943840	6948400	is spontaneously self-organizing. You start with CO2 and hydrogen and you get Krebs cycle
6948400	6953440	intermediates, you get amino acids, the same ones that we we have in metabolism. You get
6953440	6958720	nucleotides that way as well. We've not done them all yet, but we've done some and other people
6958720	6964480	have done others. And, you know, this idea then of a spontaneously self-organizing metabolism
6964560	6968640	that starts with CO2 and hydrogen and gives you all the monomers and eventually polymers.
6971520	6976880	By no means is any of this proved, but five or six years ago it would have been complete
6976880	6983600	hand-waving and now there's some experimental backing for quite a lot of it. And you think,
6983600	6989600	okay, well, it's going to make trace amounts of things like nucleotides. How can it reliably
6989600	6994320	make more nucleotides and get better at making copies of itself in the absence of genes or any
6994400	7000880	information? And the answer is, well, positive feedback loops will allow you to kind of feed off
7000880	7004640	the environment and off yourself to get better at making copies of yourself, but you're only ever
7004640	7009360	going to do, you're going to keep repeating the same network under the same conditions.
7009360	7012560	If you change the conditions, you might get a different network. It may or may not function,
7012560	7016720	but under this set of conditions, you will keep recovering that same network
7017440	7021760	until you introduce genes and information into it. And you can enter into that world,
7021760	7028480	you can introduce random sequences of RNA and they will have directly or indirectly some effect
7028480	7032880	on the rates of cell growth and flux of metabolism. Even just introducing a piece of RNA is actually
7032880	7036400	going to change the metabolic rate because you're now polymerizing nucleotides. So you're pulling
7036400	7041600	nucleotides out of solution and you pull metabolism through faster. So even making a completely random
7041600	7046640	piece of RNA makes you better at doing what you were doing before than if you hadn't done that.
7046640	7052560	So there's this kind of interesting insights into what is information in biology? Where is it
7052560	7061280	coming from? And what it seems to be allowing is effectively plasticity, which is to say you've
7061280	7067360	got this hardwired proto metabolism, which is basically thermodynamics and kinetics. And it's,
7067360	7072640	you know, you will go on recovering exactly the same thing. What genes allow you to do is just
7072720	7078800	change it a bit and allow a different outcome. And that outcome can be reliably inherited.
7079840	7084320	And by the time we're getting into networks of cells, then it's interesting because what I'm
7084320	7089840	taking from what Mike has been saying is that the genes are becoming almost buried again. And
7089840	7095600	it's the network of the cells which are generating higher level properties, which are forcing them
7095600	7100000	to behave in a similar way in a similar setting and a potentially completely different way
7100080	7106800	in a different setting. So there's this interplay all along between the kind of the hard wiring and
7106800	7110400	the plasticity and the information, which means different things in different contexts,
7110400	7118720	but allows the plasticity really. Yeah, so that's fascinating. And so with that, thank you so much
7118720	7124400	guys. Thank you for doing this. This was completely fun. I mean, I think the kind of ideas that we
7124400	7128880	have explored, it was amazing. So thank you so much. Thanks very much. Yeah, thanks for doing this.
7128880	7134960	Yes, thank you. That's been great fun. Yes, thank you. Talk soon everybody. Bye now.
