Hi, everyone. Welcome to Reason with Science. I'm your host, Jigendra. This episode is with

00:15.680 --> 00:22.320
Michael Levin and Nick Lane. Mike is a professor in the biology department at Tufts University,

00:22.320 --> 00:27.840
where he studies the role of bioelectric signals in regulating development and regeneration in

00:27.840 --> 00:33.520
animals. Nick is a professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.160
His work is focused on the fundamental processes that underlie the origin and evolution of life.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.000
In this conversation, we talk about major transitions and key innovations in biology,

00:46.640 --> 00:53.440
information in biological systems, bioelectricity, emergence of eukaryotes, and importance of

00:53.440 --> 00:59.120
bioelectric signals to create artificial life. Enjoy the conversation, share, and subscribe

00:59.120 --> 01:06.560
to support the podcast. Thank you for listening. Hi, Mike and hi, Nick. Welcome back. Hi. Thank you.

01:06.560 --> 01:14.800
Hey, thanks for having me. Yeah, so, I mean, the kind of theme that I had in my mind is kind of

01:14.800 --> 01:21.520
like talk about emergence of life. But of course, I don't want to ask you to define life because I

01:21.520 --> 01:27.440
know your response. Both of you have been standing on this kind of response that life

01:27.440 --> 01:35.280
is a continuum. So we can kind of take it from there. But when we think of emergence of life,

01:35.280 --> 01:41.600
there is certainly a kind of transition we can think of. It's a transition of chemistry to biology.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.120
And both of the frameworks that you guys are studying, I mean, the origin of life or developmental

01:47.120 --> 01:54.160
biology, both of them, they are kind of this example of this transition. So let's take that

01:54.160 --> 02:02.800
big picture view. How do you look at this continuum? How we can think of that continuum

02:04.080 --> 02:12.640
depending upon a bacteria or a mold or a planaria living in a pond? So let's start with Nick.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.880
Okay. I mean, you say a transition from chemistry to life. And I think both Mike and I would

02:20.000 --> 02:26.880
probably emphasize electrochemistry or at least is borderline physics really in terms of what

02:26.880 --> 02:34.080
we're talking about. And so the key, I suppose, in my mind is not a single moment where you

02:35.280 --> 02:38.640
switch from one thing into another one. Even when you introduce information, there isn't a

02:38.640 --> 02:45.040
single moment. But there's a process. And that process is partly over time and it's partly

02:45.040 --> 02:51.200
structured. And the thing that I like most, I think, about the kind of environments I talk

02:51.200 --> 02:55.520
about for the origin of life, which are mostly hydrothermal systems. But the nice thing about

02:55.520 --> 03:00.720
those systems is really that they have a structure which is cell like. And they can template cells

03:00.720 --> 03:09.520
that in effect can grow within them. And when I say cell like, the key attribute in my own mind

03:09.520 --> 03:16.640
to cells is the charge on the membrane. It's really that that defines the cell from its environment

03:17.440 --> 03:22.000
and which coordinates everything that's happening inside the cell. And so at the origin of life,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.240
you have effectively a structure with charges on barriers that are cell like structures.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.880
And it gives you this as a setup from the very beginning. And then there's lots of

03:30.880 --> 03:36.480
interesting questions that we haven't really answered yet. But how does charge organize

03:36.480 --> 03:39.680
things? It certainly does. But to what extent and in what ways?

03:41.520 --> 03:48.800
Mike? Yeah, I think what I'd like to do is take, I mean, I agree with everything Nick just said,

03:48.800 --> 03:55.280
but I will maybe take one step back and kind of talk about this question of physics versus

03:55.360 --> 04:04.480
chemistry versus biology. I've come more and more to the view that what we're really talking about

04:04.480 --> 04:10.720
in almost all of these problems has to be cashed out with respect to an observer. So to me,

04:10.720 --> 04:15.120
the question of whether something is physics, or is it chemistry, or is it biology, or is it

04:15.120 --> 04:21.280
psychology, or is it what you know, what is it to me, right? Is it should be specified relative

04:21.280 --> 04:26.160
to an observer who chooses a particular lens? So one experience that I often have is that

04:27.040 --> 04:32.400
I'll describe some amazing thing that the biological systems do and people say, wow,

04:32.400 --> 04:39.120
this is super cool. And then if I happen to have the mechanism for it, I will say, here's the

04:39.120 --> 04:44.800
mechanism. And then people say, oh, well, well, that's just physics. Well, that's not memory.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.800
I can see how that works. That's not memory. That's just physics. And so there's this amazing

04:49.760 --> 04:56.000
kind of moving of the goalposts that basically all of the interesting stuff, right? The cognition,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.840
intelligence, memory, decision making, problem solving, meaning, all of these things,

05:01.840 --> 05:07.040
the minute you show some sort of a mechanism underneath, then some people say, wow, that's

05:07.040 --> 05:12.320
not that wasn't it at all. What I really mean is this other thing, this is just physics, right?

05:12.320 --> 05:18.640
So what I prefer is this idea that you have a set of different tools that you can bring to

05:18.640 --> 05:24.000
bear, and you can take anything and look at it and say, well, that's physics. And guess what

05:24.000 --> 05:29.120
you'll see? You'll see physics. You bring your voltmeter, right? If you bring your ruler and your

05:29.120 --> 05:34.080
way scale and stuff like that, guess what you'll see? You'll see physics. And if you bring other

05:34.080 --> 05:40.720
kinds of tools that are conceptual tools that are better suited to recognize agency, so maybe you

05:40.720 --> 05:46.400
bring something that recognizes virtual governors or it recognizes a decision making or something,

05:46.400 --> 05:49.920
well, then maybe you'll find that and maybe you won't. So it's an empirical process, right?

05:49.920 --> 05:55.520
So that's kind of my view on this. I think anything can be seen as just physics and many things

05:55.520 --> 06:00.160
can also be seen as something much more and looked at at a higher level.

06:00.160 --> 06:06.400
Yeah. I mean, actually the origin of life is kind of an exemplar of exactly that because there are

06:06.400 --> 06:13.840
people who come from completely different disciplines in terms of training. So coming

06:13.840 --> 06:19.520
as a physicist or as a chemist or as a geologist or as a cosmologist or a biologist and so on.

06:19.520 --> 06:26.880
And you realize when you try to talk to people with a very different background that you don't

06:26.880 --> 06:33.600
share the same language. And however much you try to be a scientist, you find that you're conditioned

06:33.600 --> 06:39.840
and you have some blinkers on which make you see the problem with that toolkit. And half of the

06:39.840 --> 06:46.560
problem that I have in working on the origin of life is to try and dismantle my own toolkit and

06:46.560 --> 06:51.840
replace it with, well, just try to be a scientist. Just try to bring all these things together because

06:51.840 --> 06:57.760
it is a question in all of those disciplines. And that's just the beginning of life. And once

06:57.760 --> 07:01.440
we get into life, it just becomes more sophisticated and more of a problem. It's just that you can

07:01.440 --> 07:06.880
see it really clearly at the origin of life. Yeah. Yeah. I think the, I mean, of course, it's,

07:06.960 --> 07:11.120
it can also be the psychology itself that we like to categorize stuff. You know,

07:11.120 --> 07:18.000
it's really this concept of categorical thinking itself. But let's not go into the psychology

07:18.000 --> 07:25.280
right now. But maybe we can kind of replace the emergence of life, like kind of idea to

07:25.280 --> 07:31.200
emergence of complexity, because certainly integration does happen. Stealing a word from

07:31.200 --> 07:36.800
Nick Lane's, when we were chatting last time, you use this word of integration rather than

07:37.600 --> 07:44.880
reductionist approach. So when we think of this integration of some sort of simpler molecules,

07:45.920 --> 07:51.920
then we are, we are kind of talking about this biological system. So let's probably kind of

07:51.920 --> 07:57.840
talk about the properties of biological systems. So what can be those, you know, or what are the

07:58.640 --> 08:08.400
key innovations which enable, you know, life forms? Sorry, did you say, Mike?

08:08.400 --> 08:15.680
Yeah. Well, I'll, okay, I'll pick, I'll pick just one thing, which is, which is what Nick

08:15.680 --> 08:20.000
already mentioned, which is resting potential. And the thing that one, one interesting thing

08:20.000 --> 08:26.800
about resting potential is that in many ways, it's a coarse grained sort of higher level entity,

08:26.800 --> 08:32.400
because it's just, it's different if, if, if you are a mechanism that keys off of resting potential,

08:32.960 --> 08:38.480
it is not the same as keying off of potassium concentration or sodium concentration or chloride

08:38.480 --> 08:44.240
concentration, right? It's this, it's this slightly higher level thing. And so, so if, if you're, in,

08:44.240 --> 08:48.640
in fact, it's one of these things like many other things in, in, in cognitive science, if,

08:48.640 --> 08:52.640
if you want to be a micro reductionist, you might say, well, there's no such thing. You might say,

08:52.640 --> 08:56.640
right? If you're sort of a Laplacian, the demon kind of creature, right? You might say,

08:56.640 --> 08:59.680
there's no resting potential. What there is, is there's some sodiums and there's some

08:59.680 --> 09:05.440
potassiums. And, you know, those are like, those are your low level kind of bedrock. But,

09:05.440 --> 09:11.200
but what's cool about resting potential is one of many things is that it's one of the first steps

09:11.200 --> 09:16.960
up that I think life does in generalizing coarse graining, getting good at noticing large scale

09:17.920 --> 09:23.760
control elements that are not reducible down to individual details, right? And while all of these,

09:23.760 --> 09:28.240
of course, the resting potential is, is, is of course a consequence of the various ions you have,

09:28.240 --> 09:33.440
the fact that you can have the same resting potential from different concentration of ions,

09:33.440 --> 09:37.840
right? As long as you change them out correctly, right? So, so you can, you can vary the low level

09:37.840 --> 09:43.680
details and still get the same resting potential. And conversely, you can get different resting

09:43.760 --> 09:47.520
potentials with exactly the same genetics, for example, with the same ion channels because

09:47.520 --> 09:51.840
they could be open or closed. So you get this interesting bow tie kind of architecture where

09:51.840 --> 09:56.240
there's this like functional node in the middle where things sort of feed into it and then multiple,

09:56.240 --> 10:01.520
multiplicities come out of it. But it itself is the super interesting node from the perspective

10:01.520 --> 10:08.640
of information theory control and all of that. So, Nick, before you respond to that, I will add

10:08.640 --> 10:14.720
another point here. So, I mean, because the mainstream view is that the key innovation is the

10:14.720 --> 10:22.400
genome, right? So let's, let's, let's kind of get it out of the way already and kind of already

10:22.400 --> 10:29.760
mentioned it, why, you know, the, the information is not genome itself, but why we are talking about

10:29.760 --> 10:35.760
the resting potential. I mean, I don't think that either of us would want to be pigeonholed as kind

10:35.840 --> 10:40.400
of anti genome. It's just that it's not, the genome is not the only thing that's going on.

10:41.520 --> 10:46.560
And as soon as, you know, as soon as Mike is talking about generating effectively a single

10:46.560 --> 10:50.640
parameter, which is the resting potential, which could be multiple different ions, which is going

10:50.640 --> 10:55.760
to require multiple different pumps in the membrane, but they're pumping against the pressure,

10:55.760 --> 11:03.040
which is pushing back against them. So there is, there is a unified entity, which is,

11:03.040 --> 11:06.640
which is the resting potential, which, which is kind of integrating everything.

11:08.560 --> 11:14.400
And the trouble, I think with only seeing life as a genome is, is it tends to insist that the

11:14.400 --> 11:19.520
genome invents cells as well and invent structure and space and charge and all of these other things.

11:19.520 --> 11:27.200
And it really doesn't, it, it, it's capable of generating them, but it never really makes a

11:27.200 --> 11:32.640
membrane. Membranes come from other membranes. The spatial setting of the cell is, you know,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.920
it comes from other cells. And then people say, well, there's a chicken and egg problem at the

11:35.920 --> 11:40.000
origin of life. Where does the cell come from? Well, you know, if you've got a cell shaped hole

11:40.000 --> 11:44.640
and cells, you know, think, you know, it's not difficult actually to make a bilayer membrane

11:44.640 --> 11:48.560
surrounding an aqueous space, that's a cell like structure. It's not a difficult thing to do.

11:49.840 --> 11:55.280
But as soon as you've got that, then information has some meaning and genes begin to have some

11:55.280 --> 12:01.360
meaning. But, but there's still, they need, they need, there's got to be some higher level of

12:01.360 --> 12:06.960
integration for just to use the word meaning. Otherwise, everything's, you know, a bit and

12:06.960 --> 12:13.760
they don't relate to each other. So I think that is why charge is so important. One way that I

12:13.760 --> 12:19.600
like to think of it is if you have, I mean, I like to think of individual cells in part because I

12:19.600 --> 12:23.520
work on them and in part because they're just easier for me to grasp the whole central nervous

12:23.520 --> 12:29.040
system is just too big and complicated for me to really comprehend. But if you think about a single

12:29.040 --> 12:34.720
cell and you think about the amount of biochemistry that's going on inside it, there's, you know,

12:34.720 --> 12:42.480
there's a billion reactions a second going on in a bacterial cell. And a lot of them are repeat

12:42.480 --> 12:48.640
things. So you could imagine there may be 10,000 Krebs cycles all spinning at the same time.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.560
And they're all plugged into the membrane. And so the rate at which they spin and the

12:55.200 --> 13:02.240
direction in which they spin is going to depend on this larger factor, which is the membrane

13:02.240 --> 13:11.840
potential of the bacterium. So, you know, to pump against that potential requires a certain force.

13:11.840 --> 13:16.400
And that force is coming from the environment that you're in. Do you have the substrate to

13:16.400 --> 13:21.440
power the pumping? Or did you run out? Or was there any oxygen there or whatever? So it's

13:21.440 --> 13:27.920
immediately giving you a kind of a feed in of what the environment is that you're in. And then a

13:27.920 --> 13:34.800
feedback, which is, you know, which is integrating all these, all these 10,000 different cycles going

13:34.800 --> 13:41.280
around every second. How do they all know what the other one is doing? How do you integrate all of

13:41.280 --> 13:46.720
that into the behavior of a cell which is capable of kind of coordinating all of this? So you need

13:46.720 --> 13:52.240
that higher level property. And I think that's where it's coming from.

13:53.760 --> 14:01.040
So I think the hardware software analogy goes well here. Can we use that analogy to explain

14:01.040 --> 14:09.440
this integration? What do you think, Mike? Yeah, I think that's a very good lens on all of these

14:09.440 --> 14:17.280
things because we know that when we look at the genome, what do we see? We don't see any of the

14:17.280 --> 14:21.440
large scale kinds of things that you might be interested in. How many eyes, what kind of legs,

14:21.440 --> 14:26.320
and does it have legs? You don't see any of that. What you see is protein sequences. So the micro

14:26.320 --> 14:32.640
level hardware that every cell gets to have. Now, as Nick points out, the context and the rest of

14:32.640 --> 14:37.440
the cell is critical. Otherwise, this stuff means nothing. And then all of the actual large scale

14:37.440 --> 14:46.240
features, the behavior is then the result of the physiology, literally the software. So in a

14:46.240 --> 14:52.880
very simplistic analogy, you're looking at a typical computer. Sure, it's important that you have to

14:52.880 --> 14:58.400
write silicon and copper and all of that. Yes, you need all that stuff. But after that, all the

14:58.400 --> 15:02.480
action is in the software, all the actions in the algorithm. It's in the electrical physiology of

15:02.480 --> 15:10.880
what this thing does. And I think it's no accident that our information technology and the way our

15:10.880 --> 15:16.720
brains work and the non-neural bioelectricity, all of them use these electrical networks. They're

15:16.720 --> 15:23.120
just a really powerful tool for processing information. And that's what the, again, as Nick

15:23.120 --> 15:28.720
said, not to take anything away. You need certain hardware. So you need the genome to give you

15:28.720 --> 15:34.080
certain things. But you don't get the membrane from the genome. You don't get the cytoskeleton

15:34.800 --> 15:38.800
structure. You get the proteins, but you don't get the structure that it templates on the previous

15:38.800 --> 15:44.400
cytoskeleton. All of these physiological things are over and above the genetic hardware.

15:45.840 --> 15:54.480
Yeah. And I think it's quite interesting, the only, because I think about a lot of work that

15:54.480 --> 15:59.360
we are doing in evolutionary biology, for example, where we just compare genomes and try to understand

16:00.480 --> 16:08.240
the extinct species, et cetera. So then how much we can rely on that kind of information? I mean,

16:08.240 --> 16:14.080
of course, we are getting to know more about the hardware then. What about the software?

16:14.080 --> 16:21.920
Are there ways to do it or go there? I mean, you mentioned extinct species, but this is one of

16:21.920 --> 16:26.080
the most important things about paleontology is the only way you know what a dinosaur looked like

16:26.080 --> 16:34.160
is from finding a fossil of it. Most of the variety of life over the last 600 million years or so of

16:34.160 --> 16:39.440
animals alone, the only way we know what they looked like. I mean, in principle, we could do it from

16:39.440 --> 16:42.880
the genome in the end, but in practice, we're a long way from being able to do that now.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.200
And I don't know if we could ever do it in principle if we didn't have examples of the kind

16:51.200 --> 16:57.760
of thing to compare it with. So I think we're quite shockingly ignorant about how this system

16:57.760 --> 17:05.040
works from a genome level at the moment. And I think part of it is exactly what Mike was saying,

17:05.040 --> 17:08.240
we're forgetting the software, we're looking at the hardware only, and we're not thinking about

17:08.240 --> 17:14.000
how is this working as a unified system as an organism with physiology? And what makes that

17:14.000 --> 17:18.080
physiology operated at a higher level to just the hardware that generates it?

17:18.800 --> 17:23.440
Yeah, you know, this business of predicting, you're absolutely right. One of the things

17:23.440 --> 17:30.160
that I show in some of my talks is here's a baby axolotl, it's a salamander, and they have little

17:30.160 --> 17:34.640
legs, you know, the babies have legs. And here's a tadpole of a frog, Xenopus, they don't have legs.

17:34.640 --> 17:40.400
And so in our lab, we make a frog a lot. 50% axolotl, 50% frog. Now you get a frog a lot.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.720
So now I ask a simple question, you have the genome of the axolotl fully sequenced,

17:44.800 --> 17:49.040
you've got the genome of the frog fully sequenced, is the frog a lot of going to have legs or not?

17:49.600 --> 17:54.640
They have absolutely no idea. There's no way to tell, we have no way to tell. And if that's not

17:54.640 --> 18:00.560
bad enough, like Nick was saying, if you don't actually have something to compare a genome to,

18:00.560 --> 18:04.560
we don't know what the frog of the axolotl would look like either. We have no ability right now

18:04.560 --> 18:09.360
to look at a genome and say, ah, yes, this thing has six legs and whatever, no, you have no ability

18:09.360 --> 18:16.320
to do that other than comparing it to other ones that you've had. And not to mention all of the

18:16.320 --> 18:21.680
scenarios in which, and we've shown many and other people have shown many scenarios in which

18:21.680 --> 18:29.040
the genetic information literally misleads you because if there's interventions at the physiology

18:29.040 --> 18:34.720
level, that tends to win. And so we have many examples where there's oncogenic mutations,

18:34.720 --> 18:39.680
but no cancer, there are developmental mutations, but there's no defect because we've

18:39.680 --> 18:45.440
intervened at the physiological level. Or we have worms that have the heads belonging to another

18:45.440 --> 18:50.560
species of flatworm that's 150 million years distant and you sequence that genome, you will

18:50.560 --> 18:53.840
not get the right answer about what the head of that animal looks like. You just won't get the

18:53.840 --> 18:59.040
right answer. So both are important, but it's not all about the genome for sure.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.920
Yeah, so let's kind of talk a little bit more about the software. So is it only about bioelectricity?

19:07.920 --> 19:14.320
Maybe first you can introduce a little bit about what is bioelectricity and how we go about it.

19:16.640 --> 19:24.000
Mike, do you want to go ahead? Sure. Okay, so where I take up, so to answer the second part,

19:24.800 --> 19:30.080
I don't think it's only bioelectricity because there are some interesting, for example, recently

19:30.640 --> 19:36.320
we and Richard Watson and some other people before that found, for example, that very simple

19:37.440 --> 19:41.360
things like gene regulatory networks or pathways, it can be a protein pathway,

19:41.360 --> 19:45.120
they actually have a kind of plasticity where they can do many different kinds of learning.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.280
So you can do, they can do habituation, anticipation, associative learning,

19:50.240 --> 19:57.200
we're just in the dynamical systems sense without any rewiring. So even chemical pathways can do

19:57.200 --> 20:01.920
some of this. So some of this cognitive stuff goes all the way down. But what I really like about

20:01.920 --> 20:08.240
bioelectricity and where I take it up is sort of after I sort of assume the cell is there and

20:08.240 --> 20:13.600
everything is there. So Nick covers the earlier stuff, I kind of just assume it's all there.

20:13.600 --> 20:21.440
And after that, what we see is this remarkable thing that because cells have the ability to

20:22.080 --> 20:25.840
generate arresting potential using ion channels and pumps in the membrane,

20:26.480 --> 20:32.240
and they have these little electrical synapses known as gap junctions, which allow them to share

20:33.040 --> 20:39.040
their state with their neighbors. And both the channels and the gap junctions can themselves

20:39.040 --> 20:44.480
be voltage sensitive. So now what you have is a voltage gated ion conductance, which is

20:44.480 --> 20:48.960
basically a transistor that gives you a kind of historicity, it gives you feedback loops memory

20:49.760 --> 20:54.080
right there, right, right, right, you know, right there. And when you connect, when these cells

20:54.080 --> 21:00.560
connect with each other into electrical networks, you get some of the same phenomena we see in the

21:00.560 --> 21:05.840
brain, just on a slower time scale. So these are not millisecond, these are hours, you know,

21:05.840 --> 21:10.080
on the scale of hours. But there's all kinds of amazing information processing that these

21:10.080 --> 21:18.080
networks can do that allow them to pursue larger goals. So I love the evolutionary

21:19.120 --> 21:24.560
electrochemistry and the metabolic because I think these are the very first kinds of spaces in which

21:24.560 --> 21:29.920
living systems solve problems, right, metabolic space, bioelectric space like that. But after that,

21:29.920 --> 21:34.240
they can when they join into these electrical networks, now they can solve problems in anatomical

21:34.240 --> 21:39.520
morpho space, they can do things like remember what the correct shape is, figure out do we have

21:39.520 --> 21:43.520
the correct shape, what needs to be done, all of that. And then later on, you get a brain and now

21:43.520 --> 21:47.360
you can you can operate in three dimensional behavioral space and linguistic space when it

21:47.360 --> 21:52.320
was what else. So that's, you know, that's my story of electricity is this like transistor

21:52.320 --> 21:59.760
like ability of cells to join into networks and compute after that. And can we reduce it to

22:00.320 --> 22:10.720
to molecular level? Yes, I think we can. But I don't know that we have the ability to do it yet.

22:13.200 --> 22:20.720
I mean, I tend to think in terms of mitochondria and how they're going to communicate, for example,

22:21.840 --> 22:27.440
just take a really simple thing. There's two ways of seeing this apoptosis controlled cell death.

22:28.160 --> 22:33.760
The mitochondria involved in that and loss of membrane potential is part of what's happening.

22:34.320 --> 22:41.600
Also, whether mitochondria get targeted to be broken down or not. No one's ever quite got what's

22:41.600 --> 22:46.960
happening. And it's partly because the mitochondria have two membranes and the outer membrane

22:48.080 --> 22:53.040
is not electrically charged or at least not very much if it is at all. Whereas the inner

22:53.040 --> 22:59.200
membrane has got a pretty high potential on it. But the proteins that are targeting the

22:59.200 --> 23:03.280
mitochondria without a membrane potential are targeting the outer membrane. And there are protein

23:03.280 --> 23:08.960
complexes that join the two up. And it's possible that it can work that way. But it's also possible

23:08.960 --> 23:13.760
that there's electrical signaling across those distances. And I think it's likely that there

23:13.760 --> 23:20.400
is. But then the question becomes, well, if it's simply an electrostatic potential,

23:21.200 --> 23:27.200
then it falls off very quickly because it decays with the square root of the distance.

23:30.240 --> 23:36.960
So it's not going to signal very far. Whereas electromagnetic fields potentially could signal

23:36.960 --> 23:43.360
much further. But that requires a very specific morphology to be able to work at all. And there's

23:43.360 --> 23:49.440
an interesting and difficult question about, well, just what could they do? How can they interact with

23:49.520 --> 23:54.320
the hardware? And there are ways that they can undoubtedly. But is it strong enough? Can we

23:54.320 --> 23:59.440
measure it? Do we have the facilities to get it all easy? So I think it does work at the molecular

23:59.440 --> 24:07.680
level. And I think over very short distances. So for example, with the ATP synthase, there's a

24:07.680 --> 24:15.280
beautiful work from Wayne Frash recently showing, I don't know, the C ring, which is basically

24:15.280 --> 24:22.000
a rotating motor protein that sits in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. And there's in

24:22.000 --> 24:26.880
ourselves as eight subunits in this ring and a proton binds on and it just kind of moves around.

24:26.880 --> 24:33.120
So it needs each proton that binds on, it needs to move for eight subunits to turn in the complete

24:33.120 --> 24:40.080
circle, that would be about 37 degrees or something like that. So the binding of the proton moves the

24:40.080 --> 24:49.680
whole ring around by about 37 degrees. And how does it do that? Nobody has ever quite figured

24:49.680 --> 24:54.880
it out, but it's been known for decades that the actual electrical potential on the membrane does

24:54.880 --> 25:02.480
quite a lot of that work. And he's shown quite recently that actually, with just the proton,

25:02.480 --> 25:09.760
it moves about 11 degrees. And with the electrical potential as well, that takes it another 25

25:09.760 --> 25:16.560
degrees or something of that order of rotation. So it's this local electrostatic charge,

25:16.560 --> 25:21.920
which is driving that. So over short distances, it's really beautifully demonstrated that

25:21.920 --> 25:26.560
you need the charge on the membrane for this to work. But over longer distances,

25:27.760 --> 25:33.280
if you're dealing with perhaps a few micrometers or something, then I would be surprised if

25:33.280 --> 25:40.400
electrostatic charges alone were doing that. They certainly are at the plasma membrane in

25:40.400 --> 25:47.120
terms of connections between cells and having the same charge across effectively wider expanses.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.160
But the mitochondria are interesting in that sense as well in that the Christie are

25:50.880 --> 25:57.200
closed very often and separate from each other. And so you can have different membrane

25:57.200 --> 26:01.200
potentials in different Christie in the same mitochondria. You can have individual mitochondria

26:01.200 --> 26:07.760
or you can have a network that all join together. There's so much subtlety in all of this.

26:08.800 --> 26:14.640
And to underpin all of that, nobody has ever successfully measured the membrane potential

26:14.640 --> 26:20.960
of mitochondria accurately. And the reason for that is if you simply use a microelectrode and you

26:20.960 --> 26:24.960
insert it into the matrix of the mitochondria, into the middle of the mitochondria, what you'll

26:24.960 --> 26:30.000
measure, and this is work going back decades from a guy called Tedeschi, but other people have come

26:30.000 --> 26:35.600
to the same conclusion. You get about 10 or 20 millivolts, it's not much, somewhat less than the

26:35.600 --> 26:42.240
plasma membrane. All of the calculations, all of the change in pH, all the chemiosmotic hypothesis

26:42.240 --> 26:47.440
is saying it should be 150 to 200 millivolts. So where's that difference coming from? It's partly

26:47.440 --> 26:52.800
that way we're using voltage sensitive dyes to accumulate and it's very difficult to calibrate

26:52.800 --> 26:57.680
them. And it's partly that we now know the structure of the mitochondria is different.

26:57.680 --> 27:01.840
They are closed Christi. So what you're measuring with the microelectrode is the difference between

27:01.840 --> 27:06.000
the matrix space and the cytosol. And what we really want to measure is the difference between

27:06.000 --> 27:12.720
the matrix space and the Christi space. And no one's really ever managed to get anything into

27:12.720 --> 27:19.200
that Christi space, which is capable of reporting back on the charge there. So it's definitely

27:19.200 --> 27:25.440
working at the molecular level for sure. It depends a lot on the actual structure, which only in the

27:25.440 --> 27:32.080
last few years with super resolution microscopy and cryo tomography and things like that are we

27:32.080 --> 27:37.200
able to really get a handle on exactly what is the structure of mitochondria and exactly

27:37.200 --> 27:42.480
how do these spaces relate to each other and so on. And no one's ever measured it properly.

27:42.480 --> 27:47.440
So it's kind of glaring ignorance again at the heart of all of this, but until we can measure

27:47.440 --> 27:52.400
these things accurately and understand how they change over short periods of time, which maybe

27:52.400 --> 27:58.720
seconds or minutes, I would think, then, you know, there's got to be a certain amount of

27:58.720 --> 28:03.840
hand waving about it. But to think that it's not the right place to look is, I think, to

28:03.840 --> 28:10.320
miss the most important things in science now. And this is totally not my area. So maybe this

28:10.320 --> 28:16.240
is a dumb idea. But any chance that one could make a synthetic one that was big enough where

28:17.200 --> 28:20.720
would that change everything if you sort of made one that was already, you know,

28:20.720 --> 28:26.400
sort of basically synthetically try to make that, that, you know, a big mitochondria around some

28:26.400 --> 28:31.840
sort of engineered electrodes that were already where you needed them to be and sort of assemble

28:31.840 --> 28:37.680
the thing around them. Any chance somebody could build something like that? Or would that be totally

28:37.680 --> 28:41.360
not informative? It would be a fun thing to try and do. I think it would be difficult because the

28:43.520 --> 28:47.920
I think what you tend to build around it would be something in the structure of a sphere or

28:48.320 --> 28:53.120
something along those lines. And what we're actually dealing with. I mean, there are again,

28:53.120 --> 28:58.800
there are stunning structures to the Christie membranes. We tend to just see them as a wavy line

28:58.800 --> 29:06.080
in the textbook. But they're stunningly structured. But sometimes you get amazing kind of arrays of

29:06.080 --> 29:11.360
triangular shapes and things. You see some of, you know, they're doing bionegetics. But

29:12.320 --> 29:16.480
in what world are they doing that? There definitely there's nothing in known bionegetics that says

29:16.880 --> 29:20.160
why they have triangular shaped Christie. We just have no idea.

29:22.240 --> 29:27.760
So for you, metabolism is like central to bioelectricity.

29:29.280 --> 29:33.840
I think the two are connected and are integrated that way. I think they have been from the very

29:33.840 --> 29:42.720
beginning because to my mind, you know, for any form of selection to work, you have to have growth.

29:42.720 --> 29:47.360
You have to have cells which are duplicating themselves. And then you have some form of

29:47.360 --> 29:52.080
selection, either they do it slowly or they would quickly or they survive longer or they,

29:52.080 --> 29:55.760
you know, but you have different outcomes. As soon as you've got cells, you don't have to have

29:55.760 --> 30:00.160
genes in those cells. You just have to have cells which are capable of doubling. And if you're

30:00.160 --> 30:07.040
starting as life does on Earth with CO2, then the point of having the electrical membrane

30:07.040 --> 30:11.760
potential is in effect to get CO2 to react with hydrogen. They don't, they're not particularly

30:11.760 --> 30:17.200
reactive. They don't particularly want to react together. And cells today effectively

30:17.200 --> 30:24.160
use the charge on the membrane to force them to react. And those charges make sense at the

30:24.160 --> 30:30.640
origin of life because what you have, as Peter Mitchell actually said in 1957,

30:32.560 --> 30:39.680
the inside and the outside of a cell, if you like, are two equivalent phases separated and

30:39.680 --> 30:46.560
linked by the membrane that's between them. And those phases are not the same in terms of

30:46.560 --> 30:51.200
their ionic composition or anything else. They cannot be. One is the living cell and the other

30:51.200 --> 30:58.880
one is the outside world. And that necessarily generates charges on those membranes and those

30:58.880 --> 31:05.440
charges necessarily organize things. So, you know, however much you, you know, it's just there. You

31:05.440 --> 31:09.360
cannot avoid it. You will have a charge on a membrane and that charge on the membrane does

31:09.360 --> 31:16.720
something useful, even in a purely prebiotic world, which is to say it will make carbon dioxide

31:16.720 --> 31:21.600
react with hydrogen to make organic molecules inside this cell-like thing, which has now

31:22.240 --> 31:26.400
got more organic molecules inside, which would include more membrane molecules and everything

31:26.400 --> 31:30.560
else. And so it can grow. So the whole thing from the very beginning, way before we had genes,

31:30.560 --> 31:37.440
is driven by charge and structure. Yeah, Richard. The late Richard Borgans had this, made this

31:37.520 --> 31:43.280
interesting point where he said that as soon as, so super early on, as soon as you have a membrane

31:43.280 --> 31:49.040
that segregates some goodies inside the organism versus outside, you're likely to have a charge

31:49.040 --> 31:53.360
imbalance. And then if you get injured, so let's say the membrane gets perforated,

31:54.080 --> 31:58.400
you immediately get a free vector to the side of the damage because of the short circuit of the

31:58.400 --> 32:03.120
electric field. And you get that for free. That's a free gift from physics. You don't need a genome.

32:03.120 --> 32:07.200
You don't need pathways. You don't need any of that. Immediately,

32:07.200 --> 32:13.200
you know where the damage was. So if you have some sort of electrosensitive subunit as occurs in

32:13.200 --> 32:20.240
wound healing and whatnot, it just, the physics tells you where to go to plug up the damage and

32:20.240 --> 32:25.680
so on. So I'm guessing there are many of these things that are just, so these free gifts that

32:25.680 --> 32:31.520
we get from chemistry and physics and then evolution exploits those in different ways.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.320
So since you already mentioned evolution, let's talk about it. So how

32:37.680 --> 32:50.160
these kinds of systems will evolve? Nick? I mean, I think, as I say, for bacterial cells,

32:50.160 --> 32:58.640
for single cells, the membrane is what divides them from the outside world. And there's no way,

32:59.360 --> 33:09.920
you know, how does it know what's happening outside? Well, things impinge on the membrane

33:09.920 --> 33:15.120
and cross that membrane. And the cell with its biochemistry has to figure out, what does that

33:15.120 --> 33:21.680
mean? And what am I going to do? Should I swim that way? Or should I swim this way? Or how am I

33:21.680 --> 33:27.040
going to behave in response to this? So there's never, it doesn't know that there's an oil slick

33:27.040 --> 33:32.720
over there or whatever it may be, but it's picked up something and it needs to make a decision as

33:32.720 --> 33:42.240
a cell, what it's going to do next. So I quite like the ideas from Carl Friston on this, who

33:42.240 --> 33:46.880
talks about a Markov blanket in the cell membrane as being a Markov blanket. And effectively, it's

33:46.880 --> 33:52.800
translating between the language of the outside world and the language of biochemistry inside.

33:52.880 --> 34:00.000
And that language of biochemistry inside is trying to find this low energy state in effect,

34:00.000 --> 34:06.960
which is its homeostatic preferred place to be. I'm not sure I convey very well what he has to

34:06.960 --> 34:11.360
say on this, but the way I interpret it or understand it is, well, if you're in a bad

34:11.360 --> 34:17.280
environment, then, you know, your proteins start to unravel and denature. And that's actually a

34:17.280 --> 34:21.360
higher energy state and not a place you want to be. And if you move over there and your proteins

34:21.360 --> 34:29.120
start renaturing again, then that's a better place to be. But you still need to integrate all of,

34:29.120 --> 34:33.200
you know, you've taken a statistical sampling of the outside world, you've got a correlation that

34:33.200 --> 34:39.920
says this happened, therefore do that. But you take multiple samples of this through multiple

34:39.920 --> 34:44.960
receptors and they're conflicting. Some of them say go over there, some of them say go over there.

34:45.520 --> 34:50.320
So how do you integrate all that information and make a decision about what to do?

34:51.280 --> 34:55.040
And that's where the plasma, the cell membrane, the plasma membrane, if you like,

34:55.680 --> 35:00.320
begins to integrate all that information. If you're, you know, if the problem is that

35:00.320 --> 35:04.240
you're poisoned and your substrates don't work, then your membrane potential is going to fall.

35:04.240 --> 35:10.160
If your membrane potential falls, then you move over there sharpish. So, you know, it provides

35:10.160 --> 35:16.480
you with information on your state in the world as a single entity. And I like to think of that as

35:16.480 --> 35:20.800
the simplest possible imaginable form of the stream of consciousness, which is to say is

35:20.800 --> 35:26.240
integrating real time information about your state in relation to the world in terms of am I good

35:26.240 --> 35:31.760
or am I not good? Really, that's the simplest, simplest thing. Do I, do I go there? Do I,

35:31.760 --> 35:37.040
do I stay here? What, you know, it's, it's, it's, that seems to me to be a fundamental

35:37.040 --> 35:42.960
decision for a living cell to make, which is based entirely on its need to survive in the world and

35:42.960 --> 35:48.000
which is integrated by the membrane and in effect by electrical charge on the membrane as you

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
integrating that information. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's a really good point. Chris Fields

35:54.800 --> 36:00.240
talks about this kind of thing in bacteria as a, as an early form of metacognition,

36:00.240 --> 36:03.600
because if you imagine you're a bacterial cell in some sort of gradient,

36:04.560 --> 36:09.680
yeah, you can measure the actual molecule that you're interested in. But for example, it might

36:09.680 --> 36:14.080
be poisonous. It might, there might be a poisonous version of it. And so what you might also want

36:14.080 --> 36:18.880
to have in some bacteria have this is a way of measuring indirectly, instead of tracking the

36:18.880 --> 36:23.520
thing you really want to track, what they track is your own metabolism. So, so, right? So, so it's,

36:23.520 --> 36:28.560
it's a kind of a self monitoring loop, basically a simple example of metacognition, where you,

36:28.560 --> 36:32.320
where, where you say, okay, I'm not going to worry about the details of, of what it is I'm

36:32.400 --> 36:36.240
trying to metabolize. It was just, how are we doing? Are we like, you know, and, and, and that

36:36.240 --> 36:41.920
gives you, there's some trade offs there, but it gives you this, this incredible power of

36:41.920 --> 36:47.200
coarse graining over all kinds of details to have a large scale variable to deal with, right? And,

36:47.200 --> 36:52.720
and maybe metabolic state and memory potential is a fantastic example of that. And I think

36:52.720 --> 36:58.640
getting back to the evolution question, one, one sort of hypothesis I would, I will put out there

36:58.640 --> 37:05.360
is that the fact that we have these metabolic needs and the fact that you don't have all the time

37:05.360 --> 37:10.640
in the world to process every possible scenario because you're going to fall apart and be eaten

37:11.200 --> 37:16.960
is really, I think a key driver of intelligence for the following reason. If you are a creature

37:17.840 --> 37:22.080
that does not have these constraints, it doesn't have metabolic needs. For example,

37:22.080 --> 37:26.480
like a modern AI, which is plugged into the wallet as all the energy it needs, it never has to worry

37:26.480 --> 37:32.720
about getting, getting any energy. If you're a biologically, a biological agent that arose

37:32.720 --> 37:37.200
in evolution under these constraints that you are constantly under this metabolic pressure,

37:37.760 --> 37:45.120
one of the things you cannot afford to do is to be a micro reductionist, meaning that I'm going to

37:45.120 --> 37:50.240
track all the micro states in my environment. You do not have time to, to try to be a Laplacian

37:50.240 --> 37:54.800
demon. You did, there's just no time for that. Instead, there's great pressure to become really

37:54.800 --> 38:01.920
good at coarse graining the world into chunks that you can, you can large scale affordances,

38:01.920 --> 38:08.320
observables, control knobs, and, and pay attention to those and, and completely sort of abstract what's

38:08.320 --> 38:16.960
underneath. So that pressure to, to, to, to cut up the, the, all the details into higher level

38:16.960 --> 38:21.360
things that you're going to represent, like my metabolism, my resting potential, right?

38:21.360 --> 38:28.640
These higher level things means that all of the, the ability to generalize, the ability to

38:29.360 --> 38:35.280
abstract from, from individual instances to general rules and general observations. And

38:36.000 --> 38:42.240
even dare, dare I say, for advanced organisms like us, the ability to tell stories about agents

38:42.240 --> 38:47.040
doing things, in other words, to have an agential view on the world. In other words, in, right?

38:47.040 --> 38:51.280
In, in, in modern humans to have a view of free will as an, I am a thing that does things and

38:51.280 --> 38:55.760
there's a, there's a, there's a tiger and tigers and you know, our agents that do things and so on.

38:55.760 --> 39:02.800
All of that has, I think, its origin all the way at the beginning, the first agential models were

39:02.800 --> 39:08.480
made by, by microbes who had to adopt that stance. They had to adopt an agential stance in order to

39:08.480 --> 39:13.040
survive in real metabolic, under metabolic constraints. And I think what evolution did after

39:13.040 --> 39:18.160
that was scale it up to creatures that can then verbalize it that like us, I've got, you know,

39:18.160 --> 39:22.560
I've got free will in this and that, but, but all of this goes all the way back to the beginning to

39:22.560 --> 39:27.520
the necessity to make models of large scale variables, doing things, being important control

39:27.520 --> 39:32.880
knobs. If my voltage is off, if my metabolism is off, I need to change my voltage. I'm not talking

39:32.880 --> 39:37.200
about this sodium ion versus that sodium ion. I'm talking about getting my voltage fixed up.

39:37.280 --> 39:41.520
And that's, you know, that I think is a driver of, of a ratchet for, for intelligence.

39:42.800 --> 39:49.360
I mean, a couple of things. One, one thing about voltage and bacteria, there's a guy called Ken

39:49.360 --> 39:57.920
Nielsen who for years has been culturing bacteria on electrodes. And the thing is that lots of

39:57.920 --> 40:03.920
bacteria is, it's always proved impossible to culture them in a pure culture, which is to say

40:03.920 --> 40:08.400
just those bacteria are nothing else. And the reason is basically that they, you know, they dump

40:08.400 --> 40:14.640
their electrons onto their neighbor, which is the back, you know, another bacterial cell of a

40:14.640 --> 40:20.320
different species, let's say, which wants those electrons. And so it's a, it's a synthrophy,

40:20.320 --> 40:26.480
they're effectively living alongside each other. But the way to kind of escape from that is you,

40:26.480 --> 40:30.640
you give them an electrode and you set that member, the potential, the electrical potential

40:30.720 --> 40:37.280
electrode till let's say minus 300 millivolts or something like that. And they, you know,

40:37.280 --> 40:40.720
they either dump their electrons onto that or they take their electrons from that.

40:42.480 --> 40:48.720
But then they'll grow on that surface at that, at that voltage. And if you switch the voltage to

40:48.720 --> 40:55.120
say minus 304 millivolts, you get a different bacterial population growing there. And you

40:55.120 --> 40:58.720
change it by another three or four millivolts and you get a different and you can effectively

40:58.720 --> 41:04.400
grow all of these pure cultures of bacteria by just shifting the voltage by just a few millivolts.

41:04.400 --> 41:11.760
It's extra, it's exquisitely sensitive. The way that they, so again, it's how all this works at

41:11.760 --> 41:16.320
the level of cells, I don't really know, but the voltage then in your environment and the way in

41:16.320 --> 41:19.440
which you're, you know, where you're offloading your electrons and where you're gaining your

41:19.440 --> 41:26.480
electrons from is, it's fundamental to how cells grow. But coming back to evolution again,

41:28.720 --> 41:35.200
bacteria are using their membrane as the interface to the world. But then we have

41:35.200 --> 41:41.600
eukaryotic cells that have internalized mitochondria. And they start using the plasma

41:41.600 --> 41:47.520
membrane for something different. And they can be now much more interesting in what you do with

41:47.520 --> 41:51.520
your plasma membrane. You don't have to be using it for energetics all the time. You can be using

41:51.520 --> 41:56.400
it for much more interesting and subtle things, including changing shape and becoming a phagocyte

41:56.400 --> 42:05.920
or beating silly or whatever it may be. But now the, this kind of simple idea that your metabolism

42:05.920 --> 42:09.920
is directly plugged into your membrane and gives you an immediate integrated feedback on your state

42:09.920 --> 42:13.840
in the world becomes much more complicated because a lot of your metabolism is happening in the

42:13.840 --> 42:18.720
mitochondria. You may have got scores of mitochondria. They may all be doing different

42:18.720 --> 42:24.960
things depending on where they are in the cell. And the cell now has a kind of, you know, a bigger

42:24.960 --> 42:29.840
problem of how do I integrate all this extra information about how I'm doing in the environment?

42:29.840 --> 42:38.320
And it seems to me almost necessary to bring it. I mean, you could imagine that it could all work

42:38.320 --> 42:43.760
by, you know, phosphorylating everything. But I find it very hard to buy. I find it much easier to

42:44.480 --> 42:51.840
imagine that either we've got networks, but more likely we're simply signaling electrically

42:51.840 --> 42:55.520
between different mitochondria and between mitochondria and the cell membrane so that the

42:55.520 --> 43:00.640
cell is integrating its state still electrically, but in a more subtle and sophisticated way.

43:01.280 --> 43:06.080
So, you know, this is a big, I would say a big challenge at the origin of eukaryotic cell. How

43:06.080 --> 43:13.040
do you, you know, rewire yourself to work as instead of being a consortium of cells that have

43:13.040 --> 43:18.800
their own independence, but now some of them are inside, how do you kind of rewire so you act as

43:18.800 --> 43:24.080
an entity, as an individual organism at the level of the cell with all of these things inside, all

43:24.080 --> 43:28.800
of which are metabolizing potentially in different ways. So there's a problem with integration there.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.400
And then you have the next level, which is you become multicellular, and then you've got another

43:32.400 --> 43:39.440
problem with integration. So you're kind of taking up the, you're adjusting up the hardware required

43:39.440 --> 43:45.520
to keep a signal, which is intelligible. And by the time you got into a central nervous system,

43:46.080 --> 43:52.480
it's enormously complex, of course. I mean, that's what my next question was. So first of all,

43:52.480 --> 43:58.560
the eukaryogenesis that you mentioned, it's again, like your argument that it happened

43:58.560 --> 44:04.000
after two billion years. So this is also quite exciting that, you know, or interesting that

44:04.000 --> 44:10.720
for two billion years bacteria were surviving somehow. And then with this certain transition

44:11.680 --> 44:17.120
where to unicellular, they come together. Yeah. I mean, that's not really my argument so much

44:17.120 --> 44:23.440
as that's an observation, which is to say there are, I mean, molecular clocks, which would not

44:23.440 --> 44:30.960
to be believed very heartily for deep evolutionary history. But they're putting eukaryotes at one

44:30.960 --> 44:38.160
and a half to two billion years ago, that kind of time. And eukaryotes all clearly share the

44:38.160 --> 44:43.760
same cell structures. They clearly share a common ancestor, unless convergent evolution has an

44:43.760 --> 44:48.240
astonishing power to regenerate exactly the same cell structures, but that's hard to buy.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.920
And before that, there's plenty of evidence for bacteria going back to practically four

44:53.920 --> 44:59.040
billion years ago. And there's plenty of evidence for all the big nutrient cycles,

44:59.040 --> 45:05.760
iron cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and so on. So there's plenty of evidence

45:05.760 --> 45:13.680
that there were bacteria throughout this whole time. So there is an issue with this apparently

45:13.680 --> 45:19.280
unique origin of eukaryotic cells. Now it's quite possible that there were hundreds or thousands

45:19.280 --> 45:24.400
of origins of complex cells and they all just disappeared without trace. But it's also possible

45:24.400 --> 45:28.320
that that wasn't the case and that there are structural constraints on bacteria which relate

45:28.320 --> 45:34.000
to having a charge on their membrane, which effectively say it's not easy to internalize

45:34.080 --> 45:38.080
all of this stuff. It's a big, big structural change. It's not easy to get inside one. And when

45:38.080 --> 45:44.000
you get inside it, you've got your own vested interests and chances are it will go wrong.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.520
But I'm pointing to this electrical wiring issue. It's not just about integrating your

45:49.520 --> 45:55.120
biochemistry. It's also about how do I reintegrate my wiring as an individual cell as an organism?

45:55.120 --> 46:02.320
You look at, I think we both show the same video occasionally, Mike, of it's a ciliate.

46:02.880 --> 46:09.520
I forget which one it is, but it's feeding this astonishing control. That's the one, yes.

46:09.520 --> 46:17.040
It's astonishing control that it has. And you think, is it really detecting concentration

46:17.040 --> 46:22.880
gradients of molecules or is it picking up on something electrical to do that? How does it know

46:22.880 --> 46:30.160
that there's something right there and right there in the space of seconds or less than seconds?

46:31.040 --> 46:37.600
Yeah. One fun thing that there's a cool paper by Min Zhao and colleagues where

46:38.640 --> 46:42.720
he shows that there are cells, I think maybe keratocytes or something,

46:42.720 --> 46:47.120
that crawl in a particular direction in an electric field. So they have very robust

46:47.120 --> 46:52.400
electrotaxis. But if you actually cut up the cell into pieces, the pieces, the fragments,

46:52.400 --> 46:59.840
crawl in the opposite direction. So it's a great example of, I think Richard Watson

46:59.920 --> 47:04.400
says it this way that the point of holes is to get the parts to do things they wouldn't

47:04.400 --> 47:08.720
normally do. And this is like a cool example of that because all the parts want to go that way,

47:08.720 --> 47:13.440
the whole, the collective goes that way. And it's a very active electrosensitive process.

47:14.960 --> 47:21.200
Fascinating. So maybe let's talk about multicellularity because I think that's,

47:21.760 --> 47:28.240
so I mean, Mike is using this core screen kind of analogy or metaphor and

47:29.920 --> 47:35.040
Nick is using integration. I don't know if they are different. I think it's probably

47:35.040 --> 47:41.040
both. No, I think it amounts to the same thing. Yeah. So let's talk about multicellularity that,

47:41.600 --> 47:47.680
and then interestingly, I mean, of course, nowadays we talk about biofilm, bacterial

47:47.680 --> 47:54.400
biofilms that it happens also in bacteria, etc. But what is the difference between bacterial

47:54.400 --> 48:00.560
biofilms and a multicellular organism like anything, any animal, we can talk about plant,

48:00.560 --> 48:07.040
fungi, etc. Right. I mean, there's a simple answer to that, which is that they're all composed of

48:07.040 --> 48:13.680
different cells, different genetically very different to each other. And the point about

48:13.680 --> 48:20.880
pretty much all, well, all metazoans, all animals, all plants, they've all been through a single cell

48:20.880 --> 48:28.480
stage and we're all basically clonal. So our genome is the same. So there are multicellular

48:28.480 --> 48:35.760
bacteria. So filamentous cyanobacteria, they have two different cell types. So the nitrogen

48:35.760 --> 48:42.720
fixing cells, the heterocysts and the photosynthetic cells. So it's not that it's not possible for

48:42.720 --> 48:51.520
bacteria to do that. But they don't do much of it. Whereas a biofilm is, you know, is deep

48:51.520 --> 48:58.000
cooperation between different types of cell. But the whole of evolutionary biology and pretty

48:58.000 --> 49:02.800
much all the experiments on things like slime moles, which come together as genetically different

49:02.800 --> 49:10.240
cells and then cooperate to build a stalk, for example, for distributing spores. Cheating is

49:10.240 --> 49:16.480
a real issue that they never tend to generate greater complexity than something like a stalk,

49:17.200 --> 49:22.000
because the cheats always win in the end, because they're genetically distinct to each other. So

49:22.000 --> 49:26.880
I think, you know, mainstream evolutionary biology would just say animals are clonal.

49:28.080 --> 49:34.640
And that restricts the amount of fighting that goes on between cells. And I don't see any reason

49:34.640 --> 49:40.640
to argue with that. I think the reason that eukaryotic cells make animals and plants much

49:40.640 --> 49:44.960
more readily is that we have much larger genomes and we can have much, much larger genomes because

49:44.960 --> 49:50.800
we have mitochondria and much better energy generation, if you like, than bacteria. And

49:50.800 --> 49:56.320
that means you can switch genes on and off in different tissues. And if you're switching genes

49:56.320 --> 50:01.520
on and off in different tissues, then you're shifting not only the hardware, but also all

50:01.520 --> 50:06.960
the electrical properties of different tissues as well. So the more the coarse-graining can be

50:06.960 --> 50:11.200
then shifted as well. Whereas if you've got different types of bacterial cell, all of which

50:11.200 --> 50:16.240
have got their own agenda, the idea of having a kind of network of cells which are generating a common

50:17.520 --> 50:24.560
a common kind of electrical phase that they're in, becomes at least a lot more problematic,

50:24.560 --> 50:28.160
I would say. Is that your take, Mike, or would you see it differently?

50:28.560 --> 50:35.520
So yeah, it's a super interesting topic. First of all, about the bacteria stuff and you may want

50:35.520 --> 50:45.360
to have him on. So if you haven't already, so Goral Soelle from UCSD who studies bacterial

50:45.360 --> 50:49.440
biofilms and the way they coordinate using bioelectricity to make sure that everybody

50:49.440 --> 50:53.680
gets fed and the population and all this kind of stuff. So there may be, and it's not my thing,

50:53.680 --> 50:58.080
so you should talk to him. But I think there's some very interesting cooperativity stuff going

50:58.160 --> 51:05.920
on there. What I think might be fun is being a kind of a spoil sport that I am. I want to poke,

51:05.920 --> 51:12.480
and I don't disagree with this idea that of course going through this bottleneck is important

51:12.480 --> 51:17.920
evolutionarily. But I just want to bring up a few examples that kind of poke some holes into

51:17.920 --> 51:24.160
this story because I think they're worth getting to the bottom of a couple of things.

51:24.160 --> 51:34.560
The first thing is that despite our largely genetic homogeneity inside our bodies, cells and

51:34.560 --> 51:39.440
organs compete with each other. So for example, during development, there's really a strong

51:39.440 --> 51:46.800
competition between all kinds of organs. And we have computational models of this and farmers

51:46.800 --> 51:50.960
and other scientists have been publishing this stuff for a really long time. There's actually a

51:50.960 --> 51:59.840
lot of competition and struggle. And the classical biologist Rue called this, he had a long

51:59.840 --> 52:04.400
monograph called the struggle of the parts, where he talks about all of the ways that the pieces of

52:04.400 --> 52:08.480
an embryo and of an organism are actually fighting each other for all kinds of stuff, even though

52:08.480 --> 52:14.800
they have similar genetics. The other thing I want to talk about is how similar really the

52:14.800 --> 52:22.640
genetics are. So in humans, Doug Brash tells me that there are about 100,000 mutations per skin

52:22.640 --> 52:27.680
cell in normal skin. This is not cancer. This is normal skin, 100,000 mutations per cell.

52:28.400 --> 52:37.600
So and people like I think Walsh at the Harvard Medical School is finding mutations

52:38.560 --> 52:45.040
in the brain and in human neurons. So there's actually apparently there's a ton of genetic

52:45.040 --> 52:51.440
variability and where it really reaches its kind of ultimate expression, I think this is one of the

52:51.440 --> 52:59.600
most interesting stories, planaria are mixoploid. I mean, it's a certain species, every cell has

52:59.600 --> 53:04.560
a different number of chromosomes. The genome is an unbelievable mess. And yet these are the

53:04.560 --> 53:11.120
animals with the most regenerative ability, the cancer resistance immortal, as far as we can tell.

53:11.120 --> 53:16.960
And it's kind of an amazing scandal that the animal with the best anatomical control, immortality

53:16.960 --> 53:26.160
and regeneration is also the one with the most messy genome, right? The every cell. And so this

53:26.160 --> 53:31.040
used to drive me completely crazy, this idea. Well, first of all, why does nobody talk about

53:31.040 --> 53:35.920
this? We never hear about this, you know, in a standard develop isn't a standard biology kind

53:35.920 --> 53:40.320
of curriculum. What they tell you is well, the genome is what sets your anatomy. So who would

53:40.320 --> 53:47.280
expect the relationship to be backwards? It doesn't make any sense. Recently, literally in the last

53:47.280 --> 53:56.160
few months, I think we've got kind of a handle on this story. And so I think we now have an

53:56.160 --> 54:01.040
understanding of what's going on there. And if you want, I can talk about it. But

54:01.040 --> 54:12.160
Yes, please. So imagine this. Typically, the way people simulate evolution is you've got some sort

54:12.160 --> 54:16.880
of genotype, the genome codes for some sort of phenotype, and then selection. So you do your

54:16.880 --> 54:22.080
mutation on the genotype, and you do your selection on the phenotype. What's often missing is that,

54:22.080 --> 54:26.720
and this goes back to the initial conversation, that physiological layer in between, because the

54:26.720 --> 54:31.360
genotypes actually don't almost never code directly for the phenotype. What they code for

54:31.360 --> 54:35.440
is properties of some sort of physiological system where the software is going to determine the

54:35.440 --> 54:41.200
phenotype. So we did some simulations, and we created this thing. It's extremely simple. It's

54:41.200 --> 54:46.880
just that the genome is just a set of numbers, and they start off all mixed up. And the phenotype,

54:46.880 --> 54:51.040
what you select for is making sure the numbers are all in nice order from zero to 100, let's say.

54:51.040 --> 54:55.280
So this is the developmental equivalent of having a body axis, of having a primary axis

54:55.280 --> 54:58.640
with your tail over here and your head over here and everything in the right order in between.

54:59.440 --> 55:03.120
So if you just have genotype and phenotype, of course, a standard genetic algorithm will

55:03.120 --> 55:06.720
eventually, and if you look at the fitness over time curve, it's this, you will, of course,

55:06.720 --> 55:11.680
it will sort all the numbers and you will get your sort of embryo. That works fine. However,

55:11.680 --> 55:17.440
now let's do something interesting. Let's put in, and this is the work of Shrisha Lakshwin

55:18.240 --> 55:25.840
in my lab, a student, an undergrad actually. What we did was we put in a developmental

55:26.720 --> 55:32.240
phase where, yeah, you've got your genome, but much like with real evolution, the cells aren't

55:32.240 --> 55:38.480
passive, dumb material. They actually have a little bit of, they have their own agenda, right? And

55:38.480 --> 55:43.840
during that process from being a genome to being an adult that you get selected on,

55:44.320 --> 55:49.520
they have some time to do things. Cells are not a blank slate material, right? They always,

55:49.520 --> 55:53.600
you know, they're always doing something. And so imagine if you put in just a little bit,

55:53.600 --> 55:59.840
just a tiny bit of what we call competency on the cells, and the competency just works like

55:59.840 --> 56:04.800
this. You look at your neighbor, and if they have an identity, a number that's way different from

56:04.800 --> 56:09.600
yours, it stresses you out. You don't like it. And so during that developmental process, and this

56:09.600 --> 56:14.480
is very developmentally, this is very much a fact that when you put two things together where

56:14.480 --> 56:18.960
their positional information is too far off, that's how you get regeneration. They will both

56:18.960 --> 56:24.240
generate things in between to separate themselves and put in, so if you put a five next to a 10,

56:24.240 --> 56:29.920
they will generate the six, seven, eight inside, right? In between them. So you give cells just

56:29.920 --> 56:34.480
a tiny ability for that competency just to look at their neighbors and maybe crawl around a little

56:34.480 --> 56:41.040
bit to try and reduce their stress level. What happens then is that when an individual comes

56:41.040 --> 56:45.760
up for evaluation of fitness, and they look pretty good, the numbers are kind of pretty sorted,

56:46.880 --> 56:51.520
evolution doesn't know, selection doesn't know whether it looks good because the genome was

56:51.520 --> 56:55.520
amazing, or it looks good because the genome was actually so-so, but everything sort of crawled

56:55.520 --> 57:01.120
around. So what that means is that the genome now has a hard time selecting on the genotype. The

57:02.080 --> 57:07.840
selection cannot see the defects of the genotype. So it has a really hard time making any progress

57:07.840 --> 57:13.520
on improving the structural genome, but what it can do is put all its effort in improving

57:13.520 --> 57:17.760
the competency. So in the next generation, what you get are individuals that are slightly more

57:17.760 --> 57:22.160
competent. Now, this makes the problem worse because they're slightly more competent. It's even

57:22.160 --> 57:26.320
harder to know what their genome was like because they look really great. Who knows what their genome

57:26.320 --> 57:31.440
was like. And so you end up with this positive feedback loop where the minute you admit that

57:31.440 --> 57:36.480
you're dealing not with a passive material, but with cells that can make some decisions locally,

57:36.480 --> 57:41.840
you immediately get into this arms race where the effort starts going into increasing that

57:41.840 --> 57:47.280
competency, not fixing the genotype. And so in the end, if you let it run all the way, now of

57:47.280 --> 57:52.240
course, there are some other factors that can sort of dampen that runaway feedback loop,

57:52.240 --> 57:57.120
but if you let it run all the way, what you get are exactly planaria. You get organisms that are

57:57.120 --> 58:02.080
really good at making a good organism, no matter what the genome looks like. All the effort goes

58:02.080 --> 58:07.040
into the algorithm. Very little pressure is left to keep a clean genome. The genomes look like hell,

58:07.040 --> 58:12.480
but the organisms look amazing because all of the effort have gone into the mechanisms that allow

58:12.480 --> 58:17.520
them to build what they need to build, even though the hardware is all over the place. And so what I

58:17.520 --> 58:23.440
think happened in planaria, I think this went all the way up. And in other organisms like us,

58:23.440 --> 58:29.040
and other other creatures, it sort of stopped halfway. There are other things that sort of

58:29.040 --> 58:34.240
dampen it down. So we can kind of do that, but not as good, not as well as planaria. And it also

58:34.240 --> 58:40.960
explains why it's such a weird thing. Any other animal, any other multicellular creature, you can

58:40.960 --> 58:46.720
call a stock center and you can get a strain of abnormal mutants. So you can get flies with

58:46.720 --> 58:52.640
pearly wings and mice with crooked tails and albinos. And planaria, there is no such thing as a

58:52.640 --> 58:57.280
strain of abnormal planaria other than our two headed form. And those are not genetic. Those

58:57.280 --> 59:05.360
are not genetic. And there's never been a planarian mutant line. Isn't that weird? Why not? And also

59:05.360 --> 59:11.120
for now, I would say for about 30 years, maybe more, people have been trying to make transgenic

59:11.120 --> 59:16.560
planaria and it's never worked. It just doesn't work. Why does it not work? And why do we not

59:16.560 --> 59:21.520
have strains? I think because the algorithm is such that it basically ignores most of the genome,

59:21.520 --> 59:26.960
not all of it, of course, because you still need the competency machinery. But the competency is

59:26.960 --> 59:32.720
such that it can tolerate massive degrees of errors in the genome and it expects to. That's

59:32.720 --> 59:40.240
why because of this runaway, you know, sort of runaway ratchet. So I think it is true,

59:40.240 --> 59:46.240
like you said, I think, of course, we go through a bottleneck and we do share genetically much

59:46.240 --> 59:51.040
more so than the bacteria. But I think there's a lot more play in that system, you know, I think

59:51.600 --> 59:58.400
potentially we're not actually sharing all the DNA and even, right? And even when we do, I think,

59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.840
and I think, I think Grohl would say that the bioelectrics actually is a really good way to

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.600
crank up cooperativity when you don't share genetics. I'm putting words in his mouth, I don't

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:15.040
know, but I think that's what his work says to me. Yeah. I mean, one, sorry, just one quick

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:24.880
thing on the biofilms before coming around to that. I mean, one question that I had at the back

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:32.400
of my mind is there's a lot of bacteria, for example, growing on, let's say, a rusty iron surface,

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.760
and they're, they're effectively putting their electrons onto the, onto the iron and dissolving

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.960
the rusty iron, and they're using it effectively as oxygen as an electron acceptor. And there's

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.880
been a question for a long time, okay, the bacteria that are touching the surface, no problem.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.880
They just dump their electrons straight onto it, no problem. The ones which are up here somewhere,

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.240
not actually touching that surface at all. And there were all kinds of questions about

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.760
electron shuttles, quinones, external quinones that wasn't really clear quite what they were

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.240
doing. The implication was that they were somehow swimming down here, putting the electrons on,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.760
and then swimming back again. And you think, well, how's a quinone going to do that?

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.920
And it seems much more likely that actually what they're doing is just dumping it on the next cell.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.880
And that next cell dumps it on the one underneath. And so you end up with, yes, a, you know,

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.760
charge running straight through this entire colony. And it becomes in effect altruistic,

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.920
although all the individual cells were behaving selfishly and simply dumping their electrons

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.000
on their nearest neighbor. And to some extent, this is a little bit what you're saying about a

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.480
multi-cell plenarium where they're not genetically so similar, but they're freaked out by their neighbor,

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:58.400
which is doing something different. So they are responding to this by trying to put something

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:07.040
in the way, or presumably by fixing the charge in some way locally. So I don't really quite see

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:13.840
how this works. But how long can it last before the hardware itself breaks down sufficiently

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.320
that they can't tell that their neighboring cell is not like them or freaky? Or, you know,

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.600
they've got to be able to detect it. They've got to have some awareness of what's next to them.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.120
You're able to do that. And presumably if your genome is completely riddled,

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.000
you must lose your ability to do that at some point. So here's what I'll say. I mean,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.840
the thing we know for sure is that they've been around for 300 million years, 400 million years,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.600
and going strong, no sign of any breakdown. But the other thing, and this is totally

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.520
unpublished, so treat this with every possible grain of salt. But I'll just sort of tell you,

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:57.120
we had a project a few years ago where we cultured plenaria in mutagens. So the stuff that you would

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.160
dip a zebrafish embryo in for a short period of time to make mutants, we cultured them in that

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:09.600
stuff for like a year. And what we saw was that the particular animals that were in the mutagen

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.320
would have some freaky sort of defects. But then you cut them into pieces, and after that,

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.240
you just get lines of absolutely normal plenaria after that. So I don't know. I assume there must

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.160
be some kind of limit, I think you're right. But I don't think we're anywhere near having reached

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.840
it, I think. And we're going to, this is something that we're actually investigating actively now

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.160
is just like, what's the limit of this? Like, how far can we really trash the genome before,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.040
in an organism like this before there's a problem? Boy, I don't know.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.040
How small a piece can you cut for it to regenerate the entire thing? I mean, are you down to just

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:49.200
a few cells more than that? It's more than a few cells. The record is something like 275,

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.880
and this was Thomas and Morgan in early 1900s. And maybe you could maybe now with antibiotics and

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.600
so on, we could do better, you know, even more single cells don't work. It's very hard. You

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.520
can't get a full plenarian out of one cell, but you know, little tiny chunks work.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.240
So you need the context of the cells around you to have some kind of...

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.080
And I don't know if that's for a boring reason, meaning that the surface area to volume ratio

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:21.840
was too large and it loses all the goodies, that would be maybe like a mechanical reason.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.920
Or if it's a deep reason, like the information on building a plenarian is a holographic kind of

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.720
storage. And if you don't have enough, it's just too fuzzy. You can't recover what you need, right?

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.280
I don't know which it is. But there is an interesting story that relates to what you

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.320
were just talking about, which suggests that these kind of electrical transfers

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.280
can override genetic, I'm just now thinking about this, can override genetic

01:04:51.920 --> 01:05:03.360
dysrelatedness and potentiate cooperativity. And the story goes like this, in tadpoles,

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.080
we can inject a human K-RAS mutation, which is a nasty oncogenic mutation.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.960
You inject it, those cells, they become a tumor, they invade the embryo, it's just, you know,

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:20.160
bad seed. What you can do is simultaneously co-inject an ion channel that forces the cells

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.600
to a voltage at which they will stay electrically connected to their neighbors.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.880
And if you do that, even though the genetics has been, basically, there's a very, very powerful

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.120
hardware level mutation, the oncogene is blazing, it doesn't get destroyed or anything,

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.800
we can see it, we can see the protein is still there. But the cells don't make a tumor,

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.800
they cooperate, they continue to cooperate and they build nice skin and muscle and whatever.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.800
And this just, you know, it dovetails with the story that we have about

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.880
gap junctions potentiating individuals into collectives where it wipes, it tends to

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.280
wipe that individuality on an informational level. You know, if you and I are connected

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:05.040
with a gap junctional signal and your memories and my memories, molecules are sort of floating

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.360
back and forth, we have no idea whose memory belongs to whom, right? And we become, you and I

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.560
become a we in the sense that we now have one shared pool of metabolic memories, everything,

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.840
it's very hard to keep identity. And so I think what you described in the bacteria is really

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.040
interesting. And the meta zone version of that is gap junctions, where you use that electrical

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.040
network to overcome differences in genetics and kind of potentiate the cooperativity.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:41.920
I'm amazed that this hasn't caught on more. I mean, maybe you're in different circles to me,

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.480
but that when I talk to cancer people, not very many of them are thinking in these terms,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:51.680
even though it's been known for a long time that if you transfer the nucleus of a cancer cell into a

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:57.200
non cancer cell, then it, you know, it doesn't become it doesn't become cancerous. It doesn't

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.520
become carcinogenic. It's not the nucleus, the cytoplasm, which is, which is, which is doing the

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:07.360
thing. And so many mutations that you see oncogenic mutations in a tumor, you see the same mutations,

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.440
you know, next to the tumor and elsewhere in the body. So it's, it's very much the context

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.120
they're setting on. I was talking to, there's a woman at King's College in London, who I

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:27.120
met recently, Jodie Rosenblatt. And she, she was working on epithelium. And this interesting

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:34.880
question that you have cells which are, which are producing, dividing and producing new cells,

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.640
and those new cells are growing towards each other. And they get to a place where they're

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.040
effectively pressing up against each other. And there are various mechanoreceptors.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:50.320
And some of them pop out, but which ones pop out? And on what basis do they pop out? And the way

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:56.240
that she described all of this, I said, you should look at the chart on these cells. And I

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.400
mentioned your work to her. And, and, and she's, she's, she's been checking and, and it all works

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.360
on charge. There, there's a, I forget which way around it is, but I'm pretty sure they,

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:14.560
if they lose the membrane potential, they, they, they pop out. So it's, it seems ripe to explain

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.720
a lot of things which are, it's probably not only that, as you said earlier on, the mechanoreception

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.400
and your proximity to other cells, there's going to be other things going on as well. But

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.000
it's this balance. It must be a very fine balance. Yeah. It's allowing you to know

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.920
you're the odd one out. Off you go. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a different, it's a different

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.640
perspective on this whole problem because traditionally you would have like a, like,

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.720
for example, game theory approaches where you would say, well, the cancer cells are more selfish.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.480
And that way they do this or that. I actually don't think they're any more selfish at all.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.800
I think what it is is their selves are smaller. So what happens is if you have, if you're in

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:59.360
good gap junctional electrical connection, you are plugged into a network that yourself,

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.880
meaning the border between you and the outside world and tumors of the goals that you're going

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.400
to maintain, the internal milieu, all of these things is huge. You know, you might be a whole

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.520
hand or you might be a liver or a kidney, you know, it makes, it makes this large thing.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.880
These oncogenes, one of the things they do is they cause gap junctional closure,

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.800
they cause depolarization and gap junctional closure. And as soon as you're a cell that

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.840
basically partially or completely disconnects from that network, now you're the border of

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.880
yourself is tiny. That's it. It's just this now. And at that, it's just the size of a single cell.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.840
And at that point, you roll back to the kinds of goals that single cell creatures can pursue,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.160
which is proliferation and migration to where life is good. And so now to you,

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.480
the rest of the animal is just external environment, right? The rest of the body is just outside

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.960
world for you because you're in amoeba. You're in amoeba now. And so that boundary between

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.960
self and world, one of the things that these electrical connections do is they inflate it,

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.160
right? During evolution of multicellularity, that boundary gets inflated so that now we

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.240
are a liver. It's not I'm a liver cell, we are a liver. Whereas, and it acts collectively to solve

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.440
large scale problems in morphogenetic spaces. As soon as you disconnect from that, you're back to

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.840
amoeba style where everything around you is just potentially a threat, potentially genetically

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.480
unrelated to you, all these things. And then of course you do whatever you can, which is

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:28.720
metastasized basically. There was some work some years ago now from a guy called Neil Blackstone

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:40.160
in Illinois. And he had been working on colonial, I forget what, but basically colonies. And a lot

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.160
there, they're forming effectively a multicellular organism is a colony rather than strictly

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.840
multicellular, but the gap is quite close. But they, the conditions that they're subject to

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.480
depends on where you are in the colony, or you are the edge in which case you've got a higher

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.840
oxygen concentration surrounding you, or are you in the middle in which case you're in hypoxic

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.880
conditions? Where do you put your flagella, the cells that differentiate into flagella and the

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.040
whole colony can paddle itself around then? Well, they're the ones on the outside that have got

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:20.160
plenty of oxygen. Which ones become the stem cells and the gametes for the next generation?

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.840
Well, they're the ones that are in the middle, which are effectively oxygen deprived. And so

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.680
just the structure of a blob immediately gives you a difference between the outside and the inside

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.920
and the likelihood of cells. And I remember reading that and the whole thing worked on

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.000
redox signaling. And of course, I like the idea of redox chemistry. And I looked into is there

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.960
something about mammalian development that works on redox signaling. And I didn't really find anything

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:54.800
very much that led through. And then I thought later on, well, this is a kind of a very hard

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.760
wiring, but every organ will be subjected to the same thing. You need to override that. You need

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.480
to have a better system of organizing it if you wish to become any more complicated than a blob.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.840
And that's where I think the bioelectric feels the beginning to come in, is you've got a level

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.400
of organization that says where the same, where together, we're not quite an individual,

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:26.240
we're in this grouping here. But coming back to planaria, you cut it into a lump of 250,

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:32.800
270 cells, whatever it may be. I'm wondering about how do you prevent your genome becoming

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.800
completely trashed? And I suppose part of the answer would be, well, if you're not every cell

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.760
is going to get equally trashed, and not every bit of tissue is going to get equally trashed.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.720
So if you would just slice it up into little bits, some bits would have a better genome

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.680
than others. They would have some level of genomic integrity, at least at a functional level,

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.840
not necessarily in terms of they've all got neat chromosomes, but they're capable of generating

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.720
the hardware which is required to regenerate the whole planarium. So there's a kind of a bottle

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.840
neck just in the pieces. And those pieces have to be large enough that they're able to reestablish

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.040
the bioelectric fields and know their own morphology. It has to be big enough that it

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.440
can reestablish a planarium. If it's one cell, it's got no idea what its neighbor is, so it

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:23.040
wouldn't do it. But that, I think from a point of view of kind of more conventional genetics,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.680
you'd say there was some kind of bottleneck in cutting the planarium up and the smaller bits

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.640
that will lead to damage will be the ones most likely to regenerate.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.240
Yeah. Well, the thing is they all regenerate. All of them do.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.600
I mean, it's right. I think you would want to say something like that, but A, every piece

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:52.400
regenerates, and B, every mutation that doesn't kill the cell that it's in gets propagated. So

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.120
there are these stem cells. There's about 30% of the animal disease, neoblast. So when they get hit

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.080
with a mutation, anything that doesn't kill that stem cell, it now propagates when the thing divides

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.880
itself in half. It becomes sort of amplified in the next generation, which is why they look

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:14.640
like hell, the genetics look like hell. And so you would think that there's a limit to this,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:20.320
but I think the pressure of having a nice clean genome is way low for these guys.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.800
Just they've gone to the point. Steve Frank gave me a cool analogy to this. Did you know I

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.640
didn't know about this when I heard about this that, you know, I'm rate arrays in computers,

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.200
right, where you have a instead of one disc, you have like six discs, and there's a system which

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.040
does a parody thing so that so so apparently ever since rate arrays became a thing, the quality

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.840
of the media has gone down because there's no because the pressure on having a good disc is

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.000
down because that doesn't matter that much. You've got a rate array. And so and so right. So

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.560
so there's this feedback loop where the better your software for correcting errors, the less

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.600
pressure there is on the media to be to be reliable. But once you go there, it's hard to

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.240
write. It's a ratchet because once you can't suddenly say, well, I'm taking my rate array

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.880
off. Well, now you can't because you're because your media is crap now. So yeah, I mean, I some

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:17.360
of the stuff I do is on is on mitochondrial DNA, which is generally said to be at least evolving

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.240
about 10 times faster than the nuclear genes. There's not that much of it. It's quite small.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.720
And it always comes in effect in colonies. So there may be several hundred thousand copies

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:32.080
in a single site. And so how does quality control work? And in the case of the mitochondria,

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.480
there definitely is quality control, even though it's evolving and mutating pretty quickly.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.800
And again, you have a lot of differences in mitochondrial sequences between different

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.560
tissues and mutations accumulating as we age and so on, though probably not fast enough to

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:54.160
drive aging as a process. And again, there's a lot that can be done with

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.680
some form of bottlenecking in the broadest sense, which is to say,

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.920
you need I mean, the way the way that it seems to work with the mitochondria in the germline

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:13.840
is that there are groups of cells, clumps of cells, germline cysts, they're called in the female

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.640
germline. And they group together and they form cytoplasmic connections between them. And they

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:25.520
transfer mitochondria as well as Golgi apparatus and RNAs and things into the, it's not necessarily

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.480
the central cell, but a cell in the middle of this network. And that effectively accumulates

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.360
mitochondria in what's called the mitochondrial cloud sometimes, the Balbiani body. And there's

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.600
an interesting question then, you're bringing all this DNA together from separate sources.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.520
What's going on? We've just gone through rounds of segregation during early germline development

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.840
where you produce something like six or seven million Ugonia, the very earliest germ cells

01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:01.840
which are dividing by mitosis. And then we start fusing them together and transferring material

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:11.520
between them. We did a simulation study trying to work out, well, what would be the expected rate

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.880
of mutation accumulation? And can we compare it with mutations, mitochondria mutations in human

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.400
populations? What is the known incidence of mitochondrial diseases? And can we predict that?

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.840
And it turned out that if you had some level of selection on mitochondrial function,

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.800
which is to say the simplest way to see it will be membrane potential. If you can generate,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.280
if you can, as a single mitochondrion with a bit of mitochondrial DNA, if you can generate a

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.800
membrane potential, you can go over there. If you can't do it, you stay here. So it's at the level

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.600
of the software, that's where the judgment is going on, but you're throwing out the hardware,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:53.840
which is not very good, which is not very good in the sense of not able to generate the membrane

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.240
potential. And then you accumulate all the ones which are capable of generating a decent membrane

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:06.480
potential in what's now the primordial oocyte, and then amplify that up and it becomes, if it

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:14.480
matures, it becomes the oocyte. And that selection on the function as they're pulled together was

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.320
able to predict moderately accurately the actual incidence of mitochondrial diseases. So it's

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.000
not that you're avoiding mutations so much as you're able to kind of, despite the fact you've

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.720
always got large populations, you're able to kind of select on some level of function. I've

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.040
got no idea if there's anything like that happening in planaria, that there's some level that these

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:42.400
cells are capable of generating enough of a field that it's got the right tuning to regenerate.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.160
I mean, you're saying everything can, but presumably there must be some point where it

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.840
collapses. Yeah. Well, I mean, so that's super interesting. One of the things we're going to

01:18:51.840 --> 01:19:01.280
be looking for when we reprise this experiment of keeping them in mutagens and all that,

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.080
the prediction that I would make consistent with what you just said is that the one thing you can't

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:14.640
do is trash all of your ion channels. And we know that they're sensitive to that,

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.840
because we can make two-headed worms and worms that look like all kinds of crazy stuff. That's

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:25.040
very easy by targeting these capture agents. So one interesting hypothesis that comes out of

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:31.440
what you just said is that there is a selection step, which is make whatever mutations you want,

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.560
but if you lose the ability to be electrically, and I'm not sure if it's just keeping a certain

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.000
v-mem or maybe reacting, maybe it's a second order thing, I don't know, we'll see.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.760
As long as you hold on to that, everything else is good to go. So that's a really interesting

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.000
idea. I love that idea that there's a minimal electrical competency that you get tested for,

01:19:52.560 --> 01:20:01.280
and that that's your bottleneck. Yeah. I may ping you offline later for some references to this

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.040
thing in my country, because I think that's actually super interesting. Yeah. And I think also,

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:14.400
we can kind of talk about the, because there has to be some sort of plasticity threshold

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:22.560
of the genetics level. And I mean, that begs the question. I mean, first of all, can we understand

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:33.440
just by the genome, which organism, which species is it, et cetera? And how much plasticity can we

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:42.800
allow in the hardware? Yeah. I don't know. People say things like developmental constraints,

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:48.080
you can only make certain things with a certain genome. I am not sure of that at all. I think that

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.240
in my head, I have this challenge that I think what we should be aiming for is this thing I call

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.440
the anatomical compiler. And I think we ought to be able to do is in the future is sit down in front

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.720
of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want, whatever it is. I don't care what it is.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.720
It's a seven legged frog with a propeller on top, but you know, anything you like,

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.400
right? Like anything you want. And if we knew what we were doing, this thing would compile

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.200
that description down into a set of stimuli that would get a standard set of cells to build whatever.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:25.040
Now, you're not going to make things that disobey gravity. You're not going to make things that

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:34.160
have a copper armature for a motor. That's fine. But biologically, possible shapes, whatever they

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:40.960
are, you should be able to make. And I bet, I don't know if we'll live to see this thing, but

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.920
I would bet that it's possible. And from the plasticity that I see, even before we really

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.400
understand anything about how collectives of cells make decisions, but I think we already

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.800
have examples that I think are telling you that this standard thing we see in development

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:03.280
is just one of a huge space of possible things it can do. So if I had to put money down right now,

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:11.520
I would say that I think almost any allowable geometric shape could be made if we understood

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:19.360
how to communicate with cellular collectives. Sorry, go ahead. What do you think it is that's

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:28.960
tending to produce the same shape repeatedly? So here's my hypothesis on all of this.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:38.480
I think that evolution does not counter to expectation. I think evolution generally

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:44.160
does not take the past literally. In other words, it does not over train on prior examples. In

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.480
machine learning, you have this notion of over training when the thing memorizes the past examples

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.280
instead of generalizing from them. And there may be organisms like that. Maybe C. elegans is like

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:59.680
that. I don't know. But generally, I think what evolution does is instead of producing a specific

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.720
solution to a specific environment, I think it generally makes problem solving machines. And

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.960
the reason I think it does that is because the environment, both the individual cell environment

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:16.000
and the overall environment is so uncertain that maybe we had creatures way at the beginning

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.920
that really were just suitable for one kind of environment. I think those are all gone now.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.760
I think anything that we see now, our systems, what evolution gives us is a system that can

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.120
behave adaptively in a huge range of circumstances, not because we've seen those

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.320
circumstances before and now you've got built in abilities to handle them, although in some cases

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:44.480
they may. But what we're making is hardware that's a problem solver in a wide domain. And we have a

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.440
bunch of examples of that where we challenge living things with conditions that they've never

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:56.240
seen before. And they're fine. They do novel things that are completely unexpected. And so

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:02.560
I think what evolution does is produce hardware that under normal circumstances reliably does one

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.160
thing. But that's not the only thing it can do. It's sort of like I always envision you get this

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.320
calculator and you buy a thousand of them from a factory and you turn them all on and they

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:20.080
all say zero. You say, wow, this thing is incredibly reliable. Yeah, under those conditions,

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.920
they'll all say zero. That's not the only thing it can do. And with appropriate inputs and

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.080
appropriate other scenarios, it'll do all kinds of stuff. And you'll never know if all you're

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:34.000
watching is the standard. That's why I like synthetic morphology and I like challenging

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.400
things with all kinds of weird scenarios. I'll give you a couple of examples. Here's an example.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:48.720
Take planarium and you put them in a solution of barium. Barium is a non-specific potassium

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.600
channel blocker. So all their potassium channels stop working. Their heads are full of neurons

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.520
and other things that like to transfer potassium. So their heads explode literally overnight.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:04.640
Their heads explode. Well, you take those remaining bodies and you leave them in the barium. In fact,

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.760
you refresh the barium every couple of days. Within two weeks, they regrow a new head. The new

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.440
head doesn't care about barium at all. No problem. So we said, well, that's bizarre. How could that be?

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.640
So we took the original heads. We took the barium adapted heads. We did a really knowing that the

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.000
answer might not be transcriptional, but this is the tool we have. So basically what we did was

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
we just asked, what's different in the gene expression between the barium adapted heads and

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.640
the control heads? A very small number of genes different. And so imagine now. And so now here's

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.200
the trick. Plenarium never see barium in the wild. There's no barium out in the wild. There's no

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.280
evolutionary pressure to know what to do when you're poisoned by barium. That doesn't exist.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:52.720
Imagine you're in this nuclear reactor control room. The genes are all the knobs. You've got

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.600
20,000 different knobs. You're hit with this physiological stressor. The thing's melting

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.800
down. It's going to explode. You don't have time to randomly try different knobs. You don't have

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.960
time for gradient descent. These are not bacteria that cells don't turn over all that fast. So you

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.520
can't just randomly mutate and see who survives and then they rebuild the head. There's no time for

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:17.200
that. The cells don't grow that fast. Within a very short period of time, this thing navigates the

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:25.520
whatever 20,000 dimensional space of gene expression to zero in on about a dozen transcripts that will

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:31.120
solve your physiological problem. Now, how in the heck does it know? For a completely new

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.920
stressor like this, how does it know which ones those are? So you can think about it. So we don't

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.600
know the answer to this. But one thing that it might be able to do is, okay, I've never seen

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.800
barium before, but I have seen epileptic seizures before. And so maybe the excitotoxicity of having

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.960
your neurons die from abnormal potassium flux is somewhat similar. So what you really have is

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.440
you have the ability to generalize. So this is a system that, in any other, if we had a robot

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.040
that did this, this would be generalization and learning of the highest degree, right? This is

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.600
like, I haven't seen this before, but I've seen something else. And I bet it's similar enough

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:15.520
to this that I can try this out, right? So that's one example. Another example is the xenobots.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:23.040
So we take some skin from frog embryos. They replicate themselves with kinematic self-replication.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.480
They run around, collect other skin cells, put them into a little ball and now you get your next

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.200
There's never been any xenobots in the wild. There's never been pressure to be a good xenobot.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.400
There's no other animal does kinematic self-replication. So I think life is capable of

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.600
huge number of a variety of things that solve problems that go beyond the narrow default that

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.760
we see. I mean, just coming back to the barium issue and the generalization, I mean, there's

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:57.760
lots of, there was a bacterium dinococcus radiodurans, which is astonishing the radiation

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:02.000
resistance and grows on the inside of nuclear power stations and can survive in outer space

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.480
and all kinds of things like that. They sometimes call it, I think, colon the bacterium. And

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.840
the question is, well, how does it actually do that? And it's largely exposure to other types

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.000
of stress. So for example, dehydration stress generates pretty much the same kind of internal

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:29.920
metabolic problems that radiation does. And so in some sense, I would see it as your metabolism

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.360
is stressed in a particular way. It doesn't matter if it's barium or something else,

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.520
which is stressing it as an epileptic fit, which is stressing it in that way, excited toxicity

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.960
or whatever. There's a particular type of stress that the cell is experiencing in its

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.080
metabolism. And there's a physiological response to deal with that, which might be to express a

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:56.720
different iron pump on the membrane, which doesn't do potassium, but does sodium instead.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.280
Or I don't know what do I do, but there'll be a physiological response that you could have to

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:09.680
that, which is in effect generalizing from the stress to the metabolism internally, rather than

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.840
being able to identify what the external problem is. I completely agree with that. So that's one

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.920
policy for handling the unknown. And I think that's exactly right. I think that

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:30.080
multi-scale architecture where you have the genetics and you have the physiology and then

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.720
you have anatomy and so on, it becomes like a neural network, not in the neural aspect,

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.120
but in the information processing aspect that generalizes for the same reason that

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:48.960
the connection is to networks generalize in machine learning. It's an inherent property

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.760
of these networks that they can do stuff like that. Every layer sort of generalizes to the

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.120
categories of the layer before it. And so that's why I think it's just an inherent structure.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.480
Not to also forget that now we see that even pathways can learn. So they have

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:11.040
some ability to learn from experience and so on. So I think that's why I'm so sanguine on

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:18.560
being able to build anything for themselves. And where are or how these memories are stored?

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:30.640
I mean, Mike can probably answer that, but just one story to insert before he does.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:41.920
There was a lady, she died recently at the age of 96 at UCL called Ursula Mitvok and she worked

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.040
on sex determination for a long time. And she was very interested in- Oh, she died?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.720
Yes, you're familiar with Ursula's work. I know her, yeah. I didn't know she passed. I knew she was

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.400
quite old, yeah. Yeah, she was extraordinarily active until really only a couple of years ago.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:01.200
I wrote an obituary of her. I really admired her work. I'll send it to you.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:10.400
But she linked it to growth rates because there's all these different types of

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:15.440
chromosomal sex determination and X and Y chromosomes are only a part of it. There'd be

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.440
multiple origins of different types of X and Y chromosome birds and many other things have got

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:27.520
ZW chromosomes where it's the other way around that the male is the homogometic sex with two of

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.720
the same chromosomes. And then there's temperature dependent sex determination and she had linked

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:40.400
the whole lot to growth rates. And effectively what the Y chromosome is doing is activating

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:46.720
some growth factors that say, you know, go ahead and grow quickly. And there's some interesting

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.000
questions in my own mind about mitochondrial inheritance and when you are allowed to grow

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.840
quickly and when it's best not to grow quickly, which may. So this earliest distinction between

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:08.800
a male embryo developing a female is just size. Males grow faster early on, not necessarily

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:15.440
throughout the entire development, but grow faster earlier. And then she called attention to

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:21.440
stuchomaphodides who I think there's maybe a different term now, but effectively have an ovary

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:27.920
on one side and a testis on the other side. And it's not random which side it's on. The testis is

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:33.280
usually, you know, 70% of the time is on the right hand side and the ovary on the left hand side.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.280
And there are slight differences in growth rates between the right hand side

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:43.440
and the left hand side at that early stage. Measurable differences, measurable, you know,

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:51.760
with a weighing scales or a ruler practically, that level of detection. And so, you know,

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.800
talking about developmental plasticity, what are you going to develop an ovary or a testis?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.520
It's a pretty constrained developmental plasticity in relation to some of the things you're

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:07.840
talking about. But still, it's determined not just genetically. And there are all kinds of

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:12.000
interesting, you know, there are mice with mutations in particular genes that will lead

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.960
to a sex change, which have got nothing to do with the Y chromosome or with the

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:24.000
SLY gene or anything like that is able to overwrite the SLY gene simply by increasing the growth rate

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.400
of the embryo or decreasing it and becoming female instead of male. So there are these other,

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.600
in terms of what do you develop into and how much developmental plasticity is there,

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:45.760
factors like growth rates can play a major role. Exactly how and how common that is, I don't know,

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.200
but, you know, this whole idea that temperature dependent sex determination in amphibians and

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:59.040
so on, basically doing the same thing as the chromosome shows all this possibility of overwriting

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.720
things we think we know the answer to. We think the answer lies in a gene which says you're going

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.280
to become male, you're going to become female. And there's all of these, you know, intersexual

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:13.040
states, in fact, and mostly it's this or that. But there's a scope in the middle is what she

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:20.800
called, I think, I forget the term that she had for it, but it's basically a threshold

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.160
dichotomy, I think was the phrase that she used. So the genes tend to push you into one state or

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.760
the other state, but there's quite a lot of flex between the two. Yeah, amazing.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:39.200
Yeah, so I can talk a little bit about the bioelectric memories that override the genetics,

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:45.200
but I want to go first, even just more basic than that. So here's the kind of, to me,

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.040
the most stunning thing. Imagine a single amniote embryo, let's say an amniote embryo,

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.240
so a bird or human or something. It's a flat blasted disk like this, about 50,000 cells.

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.720
So you look at an early stage, so you look at this thing, you say, well, there's an embryo,

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:04.880
and you might ask yourself, well, what are we counting when we say there's one embryo?

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.200
I mean, most of the time there's one embryo, but one thing you can do is you can, and I did this

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.560
as a grad student in ducks and chicken eggs, you can take a little needle and you can put a scratch

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.400
or multiple scratches through that blasted term. And this is a method discovered by this guy,

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:25.840
Lutz, in the 40s. So you put a couple of scratches in. And then what happens is that each region of

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.720
that blasted term for a while until it heals up, doesn't feel the other regions and self-organizes

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.920
into an embryo. And then when it heals up, you've got conjoined twins or triplets or whatever.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.240
So now, so there's a couple of interesting things that come out of this. First of all,

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:50.400
what you're counting when you say it's an embryo is how many distinct locally aligned

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.960
collectives are there that are all working on one project? And usually there's one, and that project

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.440
is getting to a particular area of morphospace building the right kind of embryo. But there

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.160
doesn't have to be one. There could be anywhere from zero to probably 10 or so, I would guess.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:09.600
And that number is absolutely not genetically determined. You don't know how many embryos

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.440
are in this thing until the physiology has had it say. And then you will find out maybe it's

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.640
typically one, but it doesn't have to be one. How many are in there is a funny kind of thing,

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.320
because it will self-organize, right? It doesn't, you don't know that there's one.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.560
And what I like about this is that aside from the fact that it's just like this thing that's

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:34.560
totally not determined, again, what evolution has given us is a machine that generates

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.760
coordinated selves. It doesn't give us one coordinated self. It gives us a machine that

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.240
can generate these coordinated selves. And if you leave it alone, it'll give you one. If you

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.320
cut it in half, it'll give you two. And you can sort of, you know, you can have your pick.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.720
It's a little bit, I think, linked to the same question in cognitive science. If I

01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.160
show you a brain and you don't know what a human is, and I say to you, hey, look at this thing,

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.840
how many intelligences you're supposed to fit in there? You have no clue. We don't have any way

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.160
of estimating, you know, the number of intelligences per square, you know, per cubic inch of material,

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:14.800
like we don't know. But typically with typical humans, you say, well, that's one. That's, you

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:20.800
know, my friend, my friend, Joe. But actually, we know from split brain patients, from dissociative

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.200
disorders, that there's all kinds of potential individuals in there, right? And then, you know,

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.240
sort of think there's one. But so, so again, that, and again, not genetically determined,

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.280
it's all about inputs in history and, and, and learning and, and, you know, experiences and

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:41.760
who knows what else. So, so this, there's some very basic and fundamental stuff that

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:46.640
isn't genetic, because the genetics doesn't lay down the final answer, it generates, it gives you

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.440
a machine that will then generate these things in various, you know, in various orders. And in

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:59.360
planaria, so what we've done in, in planaria is just this, if you look down in, onto a planarian

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.200
using this voltage sensitive dye, you see a pattern, the voltage pattern, we've sort of

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.920
learned to decode it, we can tell when it says build one head versus two. The basic question was,

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.000
hey, how do you know how many heads you should have as a planarian? Yes. How would you know,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.120
right? The assumption is, well, what else would it be? It's a, you know, it's a genetically

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.240
determined, it's one, what else would it be? Well, so, so what happens is, so, so what happens is,

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:31.440
there's a, there's a, there's a single, there's an electrical gradient that normally specifies

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:37.200
one head, one tail. Well, we use some ion channel drugs, and we, we changed that to say two heads,

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.120
and no genetic changes. So just a brief, what 48 hour physiological stimulus,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.320
and then that, that animal will then, if you injure it, will then make two headed animals.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:57.440
Now a couple of interesting things. That two headed pattern is read out from a one headed host. In

01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.520
other words, it's not a pattern of what you have now. It doesn't reflect your current anatomy.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:07.520
It's a, it's a counterfactual memory. It's a representation of what you will do if you get

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.160
injured in the future. So it's like a, it's like an early version of, of this kind of mental time

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.080
travel that brains are very good at, right? Imagining things that aren't true right now.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.720
No, no genetic changes. And the amazing thing is that if you take these two headed animals and

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.520
you cut them further, they will continue to generate two headed worms forever, even though

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.920
there's nothing genetically wrong with any of them. So the question of, of right, the question of

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.400
what determines the number of heads in the planarian is kind of subtle. On the one hand,

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.520
you can sort of say it's DNA because if you didn't have the ion channels, none of this would be

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:49.200
happening. So okay, we need the hardware. We know that. But also it is the case that the exact same

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.920
hardware is perfectly happy making one head, two heads, heads from a different species, weird,

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.040
spiky cylinders that we've made that don't look anything like planaria. That same hardware is

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.320
perfectly happy making all of that stuff. And where, and the information is in the,

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.280
at least part of that, the important part of that information is in this, in this steady

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:18.240
state bio electrical gradient that is basically the software to the genetically specified hardware.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.480
Yeah. And then you can see it, you can see it, you can rewrite it and it totally dominates the

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:31.680
default, you know, the default state. Have you managed to do the same kind of thing in,

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:39.840
say, tadpoles or other animals in planaria? Yeah, yeah. So in tadpoles, so this is what

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.600
we've done. We've made tadpole faces that look like other species of frogs. We've made tadpole

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.480
tails that look like zebrafish. And we've made frogs regenerate legs the way salamanders regenerate

01:40:52.480 --> 01:41:00.480
legs. And, and we're currently all from, from the ion channels from modulating the expression of

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.440
ion channels, ion channels or neurotransmitters, which are often the downstream, you know, the

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.920
basically much like in the nervous system, the, the way that the electric circuit propagates its

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.840
decisions down is through movement of neurotransmitters, which then turn genes on and off,

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.960
which then do other stuff. So, so sometimes you can skip it, you can skip the, the, the top layer

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.120
and do the, and do the neurotransmitter thing. So we've done it that way too. But yeah, that's

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.600
basically, that's basically it. So we've done it, we've done it. And, and, and we know this works

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:37.760
in mammals because human channelopathies. So you've got human humans who have either taken drugs

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.680
that affect ion channels. So there's a bunch of ion channel drugs or teratogens.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.960
They will have the same craniofacial defects as we see, for example, in, in, in a frog.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:55.280
Same thing. How much of, of evolution is actually geared to restricting

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.480
the scope for phenotypic plasticity, do you think? I mean, it seems as if less in the case of

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:10.320
plenaria, more in the case of mammals, let's say, still the scope is there. But I suppose if what

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:16.320
you want to do is generally produce an organism that looks the same as its parents, then there must

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:23.360
be really strong selection pressure on the order in which especially ion channels are being expressed.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.960
I mean, that's true. There certainly are stereotypical patterns of expression. I

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.760
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if the pressure is to produce the same thing that your parents were,

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:46.640
or if it's to produce something that's successful. And, you know, like, I, I don't know.

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.440
I mean, the fact that most animals do look like their parents implies that there's been selection

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.960
pressure to produce the same thing, despite the huge potential scope for doing something completely

01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:05.360
different. They look like them under the same conditions. So, so people like the people who

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.200
work in plants will tell you that depending on depending on the the way you where you plant

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:14.720
that seed, you're going to get things that don't look anything like the like like the parents,

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:21.280
right? And I think I think in animals, it's, you know, sort of less that. But yeah, I don't know.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.680
I don't know if the pressure is for consistency, or if the pressure is for some other kind of

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.480
second order parameter, like if, if the environment is what we've seen before,

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.720
don't do anything different, just do the exact same thing. But, but if circumstance does change,

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.960
you've got all these other tools that you can deploy. We will have, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't,

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.160
I don't like to talk about stuff that isn't published and peer reviewed, because then it's

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:50.160
just, you know, me telling stories. But I think in the next six months or so, you're going to see

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.840
a couple of, we're going to have a couple of papers come out that address this, this issue

01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:00.720
that look at gene expression in xenobots compared to normal embryos. And xenobots made from other

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:06.480
cells that are not frog and have nothing to do with frog embryos. I think the plasticity is,

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.800
is enormous. I don't think we've been able to, we've even scratched the surface of all this.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:18.320
I mean, when we are thinking of plasticity, I always also admire this idea of ploidy, for

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.720
example. So you mentioned that plenaria mix up mixed ploids, then there are, I mean, we can talk

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:32.400
about plants itself, we know that they change their ploidy. So how much that has to do, or do

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:39.520
you think that this can be also a factor? I don't know much about it, but, but, but I will tell

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:47.840
you my favorite ploidy story that I think bears on this. So salamanders, you can, there's a little

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.320
little tube that goes to the kidneys, the kidney tubule. If you take a cross section through

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.040
this kidney tubule, what you see is typically eight or 10 cells working together to make this

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:03.840
nice kidney tubule. Okay. If you can, if now one thing you can do is you can make these,

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.960
you can make these nudes that are multiple ploidy. So you can make four n, six n, eight n nudes,

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.760
right? So the first amazing thing is that you can, you can double or triple the amount of genetic

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.240
material. I don't care. Fine. You still get the same nudes. So, so that's kind of, you know, all,

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.960
that speaks to my same point is that it doesn't really assume. So, so embryogenesis does not

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:27.440
assume how many copies of your genetic material you have. So that's the first thing. The second

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.120
thing is as you increase the ploidy, the cells get physically bigger and bigger. Okay. Yes.

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.080
When the cells get bigger and bigger, the salamander stays exactly the same. How can it be?

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.480
Because fewer and fewer of the larger cells are being used to make the various organs.

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.080
So you can't count on how many copies of the genes you have. You can't count on what how many,

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.520
what your cell size is. If you're, if you're even a human embryo, we can cut you into four pieces

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:58.960
and you get four quadruplets. You can't even count on how many cells you have. Now the ploidy

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.600
story is, so you really, really just assume you have to, as a proper embryo, you have to assume

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.680
you don't know much going in. Who knows what things are going to be like and you still have

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.400
to be able to do the right thing. Now, now here's the ploidy, the rest of the ploidy story. So

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:19.120
when you make eight n nudes, the cells get so enormous that there's not room for more than

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:25.200
one cell to make a tubule. What do they do? A single cell bends around itself like this,

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.880
leaving a hole in the middle, which, which gives you the tubule. Now that, okay. So, so the thing,

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.920
the thing that's crazy about that is that now that's a completely different molecular mechanism

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.840
instead of cell to cell communication, which you need to make the tubule, you are now using

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:45.440
cytoskeletal bending to, to, to, to drag yourself into this crazy shape. So what I love, right?

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.760
It's amazing. And so, so what I love about this is that it's a good example of top down causation,

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:56.560
meaning that what you've got is in the service of this anatomical feature, different molecular

01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:01.600
mechanisms get called up and we're seeing something like this in some of our not yet published stuff

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.840
in, in, in the Xenobots too, different molecular mechanisms get called up to do their thing to

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:15.280
achieve this, this sort of higher level outcome. So, you know, that's, so I think, yeah, I think

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.520
ploidy is, is a, is a fantastic example of this. Because if you can't count, if you can't, if you

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:23.440
don't assume how many copies of your instructions you're going to have, you don't assume how big

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.360
your cells are, you don't assume how many of them you have, you better have rock solid morphogenetic

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.640
control to get the job done despite all of that. And, and salamanders do, which is why they're so

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.320
regenerative, but they're not in the not as good as planaria, but they're pretty darn good. They

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.800
regenerate all kinds of organs. So I mean, under, underpinning all of that, this cell volume

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.480
and, and, and ploidy, it's not just ploidy, it's, it's genome is the total amount of DNA in the

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.720
nucleus. So it's the nuclear volume. There is a very tight correlation between nuclear volumes

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:05.520
and cell volume, which used to be known as the C value paradox, which is to say the cells,

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:11.840
mostly amoeba have some enormous genomes, you know, thousands of times larger than the human genome.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.680
Why it's, you know, this whole idea of junk DNA, what are they putting in there?

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.960
A large amount of it is that you have a large cell, you have a large nucleus and you fill that

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.760
nucleus with DNA and ploidy forces you to have a larger, higher ploidy forces you to have a larger

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.840
nucleus, which forces you to have a larger cell. And that forces you to be resourceful in terms of

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:37.600
you want to make a tube, you do it from a single cell instead of 14 cells or what it used to be.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.560
So there's, and I don't think there's ever been a good explanation for why a large cell would

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:53.360
have a large nucleus. There, there are ideas out there. But they often relate to the ratio

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:58.720
between the number of ribosomes and the number of nuclear pore complexes and this kind of thing.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.480
None of them are particularly persuasive. I don't think we have a good explanation for why a large

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.280
cell should have a large nucleus. And yet it's able to force all of these changes on you.

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:17.760
Yeah, so since we are running out of time, I mean, maybe I can throw in like one last topic and

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.920
probably, I believe that probably both of you would kind of like to discuss about it.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:31.040
So, so when you mentioned about neurotransmitters, which is like one level down kind of regulation,

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:37.600
let's talk about anesthesia, because I think that's also something which is one level down,

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:45.360
regulates it, I don't know how much of the work is done on some sort of, you know, simpler scales.

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:52.640
But okay, I mean, let's, well, you can anesthetize single cells, critters,

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:58.560
planaria and things like that. Yeah. I mean, I discussed in the last chapter of the book,

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:04.560
some of the work from Luca Turin, showing, showing that anesthetics

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:11.360
affects electron transfer to oxygen. And we've been doing some work on that just recently.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.400
We've not published any of it yet. We've not gone very far at all. So I won't say much,

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:20.960
but we've basically, we also find that it's lower oxygen rate of consumption of oxygen.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:28.720
And, and depending on the context in which you give them affects the membrane potential.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:38.160
Now, to try and distinguish between just the mitochondria making ATP and that ATP being used

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:44.480
to control the plasma membrane, iron pump, for example, and ATP is in the membrane.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.520
Obviously, if you don't have as much ATP, that pump is not going to work as well. And so,

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.040
you know, this is not a causal link between mitochondrial function and consciousness.

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.680
All it says is that underpinning this energy consuming process, which is consciousness,

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.280
energy matters, which is a statement of the obvious, I suppose. But there's also a possibility

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:11.920
that there are direct fields involved that you're influencing the electromagnetic fields

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.680
generated potentially by mitochondria. And then there can be direct interactions with

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:21.760
the plasma membrane field that way. That's a much more exciting possibility to my mind.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:29.760
But very, very difficult to distinguish between how do you change the field in the measurable

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.440
way while maintaining ATP synthesis at the same level, which is a tricky thing,

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.760
a tricky mechanistic thing to do. But we're trying to get at that. I mean, I think this is,

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:47.280
this is perhaps one of the one of the biggest questions in science now is what actually

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.680
is going on in the in the wiring of consciousness, if you like, and I'm certain fields are involved.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:57.440
But but how exactly I'm not so sure.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:05.200
Yeah, so it's really interesting. You might enjoy, I've got this, this book from this guy,

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:13.040
JC Bose, B-O-S-E. And I can send you a PDF of it. He's an Indian guy from over 100 years ago that

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:18.640
was doing a bunch of physiology and he, and he started anesthetizing animal tissues and using

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:23.600
electrophysiology to monitor what happens. And then he did the plants, right? And then eventually,

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:29.040
a metal bar. So, so he's got this, he's got this book called response in the living and non-living,

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.160
where, you know, maybe so, so, so I don't know the mechanisms that underlie any of that. But,

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:39.120
but there could be, if it's, if it's, if it's the kind of thing you're talking about, I could easily

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:44.480
see why he would be seeing effects like this in in in organic substrates as well.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:53.200
Yeah, I tend to draw a line at life, which is to say what I was talking about at the beginning

01:52:53.200 --> 01:53:00.960
about bacteria using the, the, the fields on the membrane as a means of integrating the metabolism

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:07.120
of the cell. And I would see then the central nervous system as some kind of an amplification and

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.080
formal subtle and complex, of course, but, but, but, but still somehow linked to the

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:20.640
integration of information through, through linking your metabolic state at a cellular level,

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:27.600
and then at a network level and so on. Whether you need fields to be involved in that, I don't know,

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:33.120
but we can measure changes in the EEG. And I don't think we have an absolutely clear idea of

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:38.880
exactly what is generating the EEG at a subcellular level. Is it, is it just a plasma membrane,

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.840
the axonal membranes that are depolarizing or mitochondria playing a role in that as well.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.600
So that's an area I'm fascinated by, but it's difficult to get at.

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:58.080
Yeah, so in the, like, I think, if we think of the same about the same topic,

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:05.040
interesting thing is so about the synthetic cells or synthetic life in general, like all the work

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:10.560
which is going on there, I mean, from the engineering perspective, right? That's also

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.760
kind of kind of let's say crucial in a way, or it is focused on the information centric view,

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:26.000
right? Like people are trying to put together again, some sort of genomes, some sort of genes,

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.320
transcription, translation, of course, they have membrane in. But my question, or maybe briefly,

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:39.280
if you can just explain your view, so how important would be this kind of bioelectric or

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.800
kind of this software that we have discussed today for to create those kind of synthetic systems?

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:52.800
Maybe one word answer, all all importance. I don't think you're going to do it without

01:54:52.800 --> 01:55:04.000
100. Yeah, 100. Like, how or is it possible to kind of, you know, I don't know, do it without

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:11.840
the information part without the hardware? I think you can only go so far without genes at all.

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:17.520
How far? I don't know. I mean, you know, the plenarium is a very good example there. You can

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:22.160
you can stramble your genome, but presumably you can't completely collapse your genome.

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:29.760
When I think about it the other way up with the origin of life, how do, where does information

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:36.640
come from in biology? And I'm fairly persuaded now from our own experiments, but other people's

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:43.120
work around the world as well in the last five, six, seven years, a lot of a lot of metabolism

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.400
is spontaneously self-organizing. You start with CO2 and hydrogen and you get Krebs cycle

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.440
intermediates, you get amino acids, the same ones that we we have in metabolism. You get

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.720
nucleotides that way as well. We've not done them all yet, but we've done some and other people

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:04.480
have done others. And, you know, this idea then of a spontaneously self-organizing metabolism

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.640
that starts with CO2 and hydrogen and gives you all the monomers and eventually polymers.

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.880
By no means is any of this proved, but five or six years ago it would have been complete

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:23.600
hand-waving and now there's some experimental backing for quite a lot of it. And you think,

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:29.600
okay, well, it's going to make trace amounts of things like nucleotides. How can it reliably

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.320
make more nucleotides and get better at making copies of itself in the absence of genes or any

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.880
information? And the answer is, well, positive feedback loops will allow you to kind of feed off

01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.640
the environment and off yourself to get better at making copies of yourself, but you're only ever

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.360
going to do, you're going to keep repeating the same network under the same conditions.

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:52.560
If you change the conditions, you might get a different network. It may or may not function,

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.720
but under this set of conditions, you will keep recovering that same network

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.760
until you introduce genes and information into it. And you can enter into that world,

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:08.480
you can introduce random sequences of RNA and they will have directly or indirectly some effect

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.880
on the rates of cell growth and flux of metabolism. Even just introducing a piece of RNA is actually

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.400
going to change the metabolic rate because you're now polymerizing nucleotides. So you're pulling

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.600
nucleotides out of solution and you pull metabolism through faster. So even making a completely random

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.640
piece of RNA makes you better at doing what you were doing before than if you hadn't done that.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:32.560
So there's this kind of interesting insights into what is information in biology? Where is it

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:41.280
coming from? And what it seems to be allowing is effectively plasticity, which is to say you've

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:47.360
got this hardwired proto metabolism, which is basically thermodynamics and kinetics. And it's,

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:52.640
you know, you will go on recovering exactly the same thing. What genes allow you to do is just

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:58.800
change it a bit and allow a different outcome. And that outcome can be reliably inherited.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.320
And by the time we're getting into networks of cells, then it's interesting because what I'm

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:09.840
taking from what Mike has been saying is that the genes are becoming almost buried again. And

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:15.600
it's the network of the cells which are generating higher level properties, which are forcing them

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:20.000
to behave in a similar way in a similar setting and a potentially completely different way

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:26.800
in a different setting. So there's this interplay all along between the kind of the hard wiring and

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.400
the plasticity and the information, which means different things in different contexts,

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:38.720
but allows the plasticity really. Yeah, so that's fascinating. And so with that, thank you so much

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:44.400
guys. Thank you for doing this. This was completely fun. I mean, I think the kind of ideas that we

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.880
have explored, it was amazing. So thank you so much. Thanks very much. Yeah, thanks for doing this.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:54.960
Yes, thank you. That's been great fun. Yes, thank you. Talk soon everybody. Bye now.
