00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Hi, everyone. Welcome to Reason with Science. I'm your host, Jigendra. This episode is with

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,320
Michael Levin and Nick Lane. Mike is a professor in the biology department at Tufts University,

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,840
where he studies the role of bioelectric signals in regulating development and regeneration in

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,520
animals. Nick is a professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London.

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,160
His work is focused on the fundamental processes that underlie the origin and evolution of life.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,000
In this conversation, we talk about major transitions and key innovations in biology,

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,440
information in biological systems, bioelectricity, emergence of eukaryotes, and importance of

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,120
bioelectric signals to create artificial life. Enjoy the conversation, share, and subscribe

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,560
to support the podcast. Thank you for listening. Hi, Mike and hi, Nick. Welcome back. Hi. Thank you.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Hey, thanks for having me. Yeah, so, I mean, the kind of theme that I had in my mind is kind of

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,520
like talk about emergence of life. But of course, I don't want to ask you to define life because I

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,440
know your response. Both of you have been standing on this kind of response that life

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:35,280
is a continuum. So we can kind of take it from there. But when we think of emergence of life,

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,600
there is certainly a kind of transition we can think of. It's a transition of chemistry to biology.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,120
And both of the frameworks that you guys are studying, I mean, the origin of life or developmental

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,160
biology, both of them, they are kind of this example of this transition. So let's take that

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,800
big picture view. How do you look at this continuum? How we can think of that continuum

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:12,640
depending upon a bacteria or a mold or a planaria living in a pond? So let's start with Nick.

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,880
Okay. I mean, you say a transition from chemistry to life. And I think both Mike and I would

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,880
probably emphasize electrochemistry or at least is borderline physics really in terms of what

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,080
we're talking about. And so the key, I suppose, in my mind is not a single moment where you

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
switch from one thing into another one. Even when you introduce information, there isn't a

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,040
single moment. But there's a process. And that process is partly over time and it's partly

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,200
structured. And the thing that I like most, I think, about the kind of environments I talk

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,520
about for the origin of life, which are mostly hydrothermal systems. But the nice thing about

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,720
those systems is really that they have a structure which is cell like. And they can template cells

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,520
that in effect can grow within them. And when I say cell like, the key attribute in my own mind

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,640
to cells is the charge on the membrane. It's really that that defines the cell from its environment

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
and which coordinates everything that's happening inside the cell. And so at the origin of life,

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,240
you have effectively a structure with charges on barriers that are cell like structures.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,880
And it gives you this as a setup from the very beginning. And then there's lots of

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,480
interesting questions that we haven't really answered yet. But how does charge organize

33
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
things? It certainly does. But to what extent and in what ways?

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,800
Mike? Yeah, I think what I'd like to do is take, I mean, I agree with everything Nick just said,

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,280
but I will maybe take one step back and kind of talk about this question of physics versus

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:04,480
chemistry versus biology. I've come more and more to the view that what we're really talking about

37
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
in almost all of these problems has to be cashed out with respect to an observer. So to me,

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,120
the question of whether something is physics, or is it chemistry, or is it biology, or is it

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,280
psychology, or is it what you know, what is it to me, right? Is it should be specified relative

40
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,160
to an observer who chooses a particular lens? So one experience that I often have is that

41
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
I'll describe some amazing thing that the biological systems do and people say, wow,

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,120
this is super cool. And then if I happen to have the mechanism for it, I will say, here's the

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,800
mechanism. And then people say, oh, well, well, that's just physics. Well, that's not memory.

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I can see how that works. That's not memory. That's just physics. And so there's this amazing

45
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,000
kind of moving of the goalposts that basically all of the interesting stuff, right? The cognition,

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,840
intelligence, memory, decision making, problem solving, meaning, all of these things,

47
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,040
the minute you show some sort of a mechanism underneath, then some people say, wow, that's

48
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,320
not that wasn't it at all. What I really mean is this other thing, this is just physics, right?

49
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,640
So what I prefer is this idea that you have a set of different tools that you can bring to

50
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,000
bear, and you can take anything and look at it and say, well, that's physics. And guess what

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,120
you'll see? You'll see physics. You bring your voltmeter, right? If you bring your ruler and your

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,080
way scale and stuff like that, guess what you'll see? You'll see physics. And if you bring other

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,720
kinds of tools that are conceptual tools that are better suited to recognize agency, so maybe you

54
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,400
bring something that recognizes virtual governors or it recognizes a decision making or something,

55
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,920
well, then maybe you'll find that and maybe you won't. So it's an empirical process, right?

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,520
So that's kind of my view on this. I think anything can be seen as just physics and many things

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
can also be seen as something much more and looked at at a higher level.

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Yeah. I mean, actually the origin of life is kind of an exemplar of exactly that because there are

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,840
people who come from completely different disciplines in terms of training. So coming

60
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,520
as a physicist or as a chemist or as a geologist or as a cosmologist or a biologist and so on.

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,880
And you realize when you try to talk to people with a very different background that you don't

62
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,600
share the same language. And however much you try to be a scientist, you find that you're conditioned

63
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,840
and you have some blinkers on which make you see the problem with that toolkit. And half of the

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,560
problem that I have in working on the origin of life is to try and dismantle my own toolkit and

65
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,840
replace it with, well, just try to be a scientist. Just try to bring all these things together because

66
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,760
it is a question in all of those disciplines. And that's just the beginning of life. And once

67
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,440
we get into life, it just becomes more sophisticated and more of a problem. It's just that you can

68
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,880
see it really clearly at the origin of life. Yeah. Yeah. I think the, I mean, of course, it's,

69
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
it can also be the psychology itself that we like to categorize stuff. You know,

70
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,000
it's really this concept of categorical thinking itself. But let's not go into the psychology

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,280
right now. But maybe we can kind of replace the emergence of life, like kind of idea to

72
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,200
emergence of complexity, because certainly integration does happen. Stealing a word from

73
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Nick Lane's, when we were chatting last time, you use this word of integration rather than

74
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,880
reductionist approach. So when we think of this integration of some sort of simpler molecules,

75
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,920
then we are, we are kind of talking about this biological system. So let's probably kind of

76
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,840
talk about the properties of biological systems. So what can be those, you know, or what are the

77
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:08,400
key innovations which enable, you know, life forms? Sorry, did you say, Mike?

78
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah. Well, I'll, okay, I'll pick, I'll pick just one thing, which is, which is what Nick

79
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
already mentioned, which is resting potential. And the thing that one, one interesting thing

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,800
about resting potential is that in many ways, it's a coarse grained sort of higher level entity,

81
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,400
because it's just, it's different if, if, if you are a mechanism that keys off of resting potential,

82
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,480
it is not the same as keying off of potassium concentration or sodium concentration or chloride

83
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,240
concentration, right? It's this, it's this slightly higher level thing. And so, so if, if you're, in,

84
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,640
in fact, it's one of these things like many other things in, in, in cognitive science, if,

85
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,640
if you want to be a micro reductionist, you might say, well, there's no such thing. You might say,

86
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
right? If you're sort of a Laplacian, the demon kind of creature, right? You might say,

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
there's no resting potential. What there is, is there's some sodiums and there's some

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,440
potassiums. And, you know, those are like, those are your low level kind of bedrock. But,

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,200
but what's cool about resting potential is one of many things is that it's one of the first steps

90
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,960
up that I think life does in generalizing coarse graining, getting good at noticing large scale

91
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,760
control elements that are not reducible down to individual details, right? And while all of these,

92
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,240
of course, the resting potential is, is, is of course a consequence of the various ions you have,

93
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,440
the fact that you can have the same resting potential from different concentration of ions,

94
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,840
right? As long as you change them out correctly, right? So, so you can, you can vary the low level

95
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,680
details and still get the same resting potential. And conversely, you can get different resting

96
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,520
potentials with exactly the same genetics, for example, with the same ion channels because

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,840
they could be open or closed. So you get this interesting bow tie kind of architecture where

98
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
there's this like functional node in the middle where things sort of feed into it and then multiple,

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,520
multiplicities come out of it. But it itself is the super interesting node from the perspective

100
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,640
of information theory control and all of that. So, Nick, before you respond to that, I will add

101
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,720
another point here. So, I mean, because the mainstream view is that the key innovation is the

102
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,400
genome, right? So let's, let's, let's kind of get it out of the way already and kind of already

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,760
mentioned it, why, you know, the, the information is not genome itself, but why we are talking about

104
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,760
the resting potential. I mean, I don't think that either of us would want to be pigeonholed as kind

105
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,400
of anti genome. It's just that it's not, the genome is not the only thing that's going on.

106
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,560
And as soon as, you know, as soon as Mike is talking about generating effectively a single

107
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
parameter, which is the resting potential, which could be multiple different ions, which is going

108
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,760
to require multiple different pumps in the membrane, but they're pumping against the pressure,

109
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,040
which is pushing back against them. So there is, there is a unified entity, which is,

110
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
which is the resting potential, which, which is kind of integrating everything.

111
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,400
And the trouble, I think with only seeing life as a genome is, is it tends to insist that the

112
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,520
genome invents cells as well and invent structure and space and charge and all of these other things.

113
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:27,200
And it really doesn't, it, it, it's capable of generating them, but it never really makes a

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,640
membrane. Membranes come from other membranes. The spatial setting of the cell is, you know,

115
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
it comes from other cells. And then people say, well, there's a chicken and egg problem at the

116
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
origin of life. Where does the cell come from? Well, you know, if you've got a cell shaped hole

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,640
and cells, you know, think, you know, it's not difficult actually to make a bilayer membrane

118
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,560
surrounding an aqueous space, that's a cell like structure. It's not a difficult thing to do.

119
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,280
But as soon as you've got that, then information has some meaning and genes begin to have some

120
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,360
meaning. But, but there's still, they need, they need, there's got to be some higher level of

121
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,960
integration for just to use the word meaning. Otherwise, everything's, you know, a bit and

122
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,760
they don't relate to each other. So I think that is why charge is so important. One way that I

123
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,600
like to think of it is if you have, I mean, I like to think of individual cells in part because I

124
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,520
work on them and in part because they're just easier for me to grasp the whole central nervous

125
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,040
system is just too big and complicated for me to really comprehend. But if you think about a single

126
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,720
cell and you think about the amount of biochemistry that's going on inside it, there's, you know,

127
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,480
there's a billion reactions a second going on in a bacterial cell. And a lot of them are repeat

128
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,640
things. So you could imagine there may be 10,000 Krebs cycles all spinning at the same time.

129
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,560
And they're all plugged into the membrane. And so the rate at which they spin and the

130
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,240
direction in which they spin is going to depend on this larger factor, which is the membrane

131
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:11,840
potential of the bacterium. So, you know, to pump against that potential requires a certain force.

132
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,400
And that force is coming from the environment that you're in. Do you have the substrate to

133
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,440
power the pumping? Or did you run out? Or was there any oxygen there or whatever? So it's

134
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,920
immediately giving you a kind of a feed in of what the environment is that you're in. And then a

135
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,800
feedback, which is, you know, which is integrating all these, all these 10,000 different cycles going

136
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,280
around every second. How do they all know what the other one is doing? How do you integrate all of

137
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,720
that into the behavior of a cell which is capable of kind of coordinating all of this? So you need

138
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,240
that higher level property. And I think that's where it's coming from.

139
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,040
So I think the hardware software analogy goes well here. Can we use that analogy to explain

140
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,440
this integration? What do you think, Mike? Yeah, I think that's a very good lens on all of these

141
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,280
things because we know that when we look at the genome, what do we see? We don't see any of the

142
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,440
large scale kinds of things that you might be interested in. How many eyes, what kind of legs,

143
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,320
and does it have legs? You don't see any of that. What you see is protein sequences. So the micro

144
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,640
level hardware that every cell gets to have. Now, as Nick points out, the context and the rest of

145
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,440
the cell is critical. Otherwise, this stuff means nothing. And then all of the actual large scale

146
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:46,240
features, the behavior is then the result of the physiology, literally the software. So in a

147
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,880
very simplistic analogy, you're looking at a typical computer. Sure, it's important that you have to

148
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,400
write silicon and copper and all of that. Yes, you need all that stuff. But after that, all the

149
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,480
action is in the software, all the actions in the algorithm. It's in the electrical physiology of

150
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,880
what this thing does. And I think it's no accident that our information technology and the way our

151
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,720
brains work and the non-neural bioelectricity, all of them use these electrical networks. They're

152
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,120
just a really powerful tool for processing information. And that's what the, again, as Nick

153
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,720
said, not to take anything away. You need certain hardware. So you need the genome to give you

154
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,080
certain things. But you don't get the membrane from the genome. You don't get the cytoskeleton

155
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
structure. You get the proteins, but you don't get the structure that it templates on the previous

156
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,400
cytoskeleton. All of these physiological things are over and above the genetic hardware.

157
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Yeah. And I think it's quite interesting, the only, because I think about a lot of work that

158
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,360
we are doing in evolutionary biology, for example, where we just compare genomes and try to understand

159
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,240
the extinct species, et cetera. So then how much we can rely on that kind of information? I mean,

160
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,080
of course, we are getting to know more about the hardware then. What about the software?

161
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Are there ways to do it or go there? I mean, you mentioned extinct species, but this is one of

162
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,080
the most important things about paleontology is the only way you know what a dinosaur looked like

163
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,160
is from finding a fossil of it. Most of the variety of life over the last 600 million years or so of

164
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,440
animals alone, the only way we know what they looked like. I mean, in principle, we could do it from

165
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
the genome in the end, but in practice, we're a long way from being able to do that now.

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,200
And I don't know if we could ever do it in principle if we didn't have examples of the kind

167
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,760
of thing to compare it with. So I think we're quite shockingly ignorant about how this system

168
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:05,040
works from a genome level at the moment. And I think part of it is exactly what Mike was saying,

169
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,240
we're forgetting the software, we're looking at the hardware only, and we're not thinking about

170
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,000
how is this working as a unified system as an organism with physiology? And what makes that

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,080
physiology operated at a higher level to just the hardware that generates it?

172
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,440
Yeah, you know, this business of predicting, you're absolutely right. One of the things

173
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,160
that I show in some of my talks is here's a baby axolotl, it's a salamander, and they have little

174
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,640
legs, you know, the babies have legs. And here's a tadpole of a frog, Xenopus, they don't have legs.

175
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,400
And so in our lab, we make a frog a lot. 50% axolotl, 50% frog. Now you get a frog a lot.

176
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,720
So now I ask a simple question, you have the genome of the axolotl fully sequenced,

177
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,040
you've got the genome of the frog fully sequenced, is the frog a lot of going to have legs or not?

178
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,640
They have absolutely no idea. There's no way to tell, we have no way to tell. And if that's not

179
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,560
bad enough, like Nick was saying, if you don't actually have something to compare a genome to,

180
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,560
we don't know what the frog of the axolotl would look like either. We have no ability right now

181
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,360
to look at a genome and say, ah, yes, this thing has six legs and whatever, no, you have no ability

182
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,320
to do that other than comparing it to other ones that you've had. And not to mention all of the

183
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,680
scenarios in which, and we've shown many and other people have shown many scenarios in which

184
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:29,040
the genetic information literally misleads you because if there's interventions at the physiology

185
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,720
level, that tends to win. And so we have many examples where there's oncogenic mutations,

186
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,680
but no cancer, there are developmental mutations, but there's no defect because we've

187
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,440
intervened at the physiological level. Or we have worms that have the heads belonging to another

188
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,560
species of flatworm that's 150 million years distant and you sequence that genome, you will

189
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,840
not get the right answer about what the head of that animal looks like. You just won't get the

190
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,040
right answer. So both are important, but it's not all about the genome for sure.

191
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,920
Yeah, so let's kind of talk a little bit more about the software. So is it only about bioelectricity?

192
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,320
Maybe first you can introduce a little bit about what is bioelectricity and how we go about it.

193
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,000
Mike, do you want to go ahead? Sure. Okay, so where I take up, so to answer the second part,

194
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,080
I don't think it's only bioelectricity because there are some interesting, for example, recently

195
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,320
we and Richard Watson and some other people before that found, for example, that very simple

196
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
things like gene regulatory networks or pathways, it can be a protein pathway,

197
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,120
they actually have a kind of plasticity where they can do many different kinds of learning.

198
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,280
So you can do, they can do habituation, anticipation, associative learning,

199
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,200
we're just in the dynamical systems sense without any rewiring. So even chemical pathways can do

200
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,920
some of this. So some of this cognitive stuff goes all the way down. But what I really like about

201
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,240
bioelectricity and where I take it up is sort of after I sort of assume the cell is there and

202
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,600
everything is there. So Nick covers the earlier stuff, I kind of just assume it's all there.

203
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,440
And after that, what we see is this remarkable thing that because cells have the ability to

204
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
generate arresting potential using ion channels and pumps in the membrane,

205
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,240
and they have these little electrical synapses known as gap junctions, which allow them to share

206
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,040
their state with their neighbors. And both the channels and the gap junctions can themselves

207
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,480
be voltage sensitive. So now what you have is a voltage gated ion conductance, which is

208
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,960
basically a transistor that gives you a kind of historicity, it gives you feedback loops memory

209
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,080
right there, right, right, right, you know, right there. And when you connect, when these cells

210
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,560
connect with each other into electrical networks, you get some of the same phenomena we see in the

211
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,840
brain, just on a slower time scale. So these are not millisecond, these are hours, you know,

212
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,080
on the scale of hours. But there's all kinds of amazing information processing that these

213
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:18,080
networks can do that allow them to pursue larger goals. So I love the evolutionary

214
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,560
electrochemistry and the metabolic because I think these are the very first kinds of spaces in which

215
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,920
living systems solve problems, right, metabolic space, bioelectric space like that. But after that,

216
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,240
they can when they join into these electrical networks, now they can solve problems in anatomical

217
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,520
morpho space, they can do things like remember what the correct shape is, figure out do we have

218
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
the correct shape, what needs to be done, all of that. And then later on, you get a brain and now

219
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,360
you can you can operate in three dimensional behavioral space and linguistic space when it

220
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,320
was what else. So that's, you know, that's my story of electricity is this like transistor

221
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,760
like ability of cells to join into networks and compute after that. And can we reduce it to

222
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:10,720
to molecular level? Yes, I think we can. But I don't know that we have the ability to do it yet.

223
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,720
I mean, I tend to think in terms of mitochondria and how they're going to communicate, for example,

224
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,440
just take a really simple thing. There's two ways of seeing this apoptosis controlled cell death.

225
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,760
The mitochondria involved in that and loss of membrane potential is part of what's happening.

226
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,600
Also, whether mitochondria get targeted to be broken down or not. No one's ever quite got what's

227
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,960
happening. And it's partly because the mitochondria have two membranes and the outer membrane

228
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,040
is not electrically charged or at least not very much if it is at all. Whereas the inner

229
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,200
membrane has got a pretty high potential on it. But the proteins that are targeting the

230
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
mitochondria without a membrane potential are targeting the outer membrane. And there are protein

231
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,960
complexes that join the two up. And it's possible that it can work that way. But it's also possible

232
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,760
that there's electrical signaling across those distances. And I think it's likely that there

233
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,400
is. But then the question becomes, well, if it's simply an electrostatic potential,

234
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,200
then it falls off very quickly because it decays with the square root of the distance.

235
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,960
So it's not going to signal very far. Whereas electromagnetic fields potentially could signal

236
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,360
much further. But that requires a very specific morphology to be able to work at all. And there's

237
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,440
an interesting and difficult question about, well, just what could they do? How can they interact with

238
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,320
the hardware? And there are ways that they can undoubtedly. But is it strong enough? Can we

239
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,440
measure it? Do we have the facilities to get it all easy? So I think it does work at the molecular

240
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,680
level. And I think over very short distances. So for example, with the ATP synthase, there's a

241
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:15,280
beautiful work from Wayne Frash recently showing, I don't know, the C ring, which is basically

242
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:22,000
a rotating motor protein that sits in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. And there's in

243
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,880
ourselves as eight subunits in this ring and a proton binds on and it just kind of moves around.

244
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,120
So it needs each proton that binds on, it needs to move for eight subunits to turn in the complete

245
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,080
circle, that would be about 37 degrees or something like that. So the binding of the proton moves the

246
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:49,680
whole ring around by about 37 degrees. And how does it do that? Nobody has ever quite figured

247
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,880
it out, but it's been known for decades that the actual electrical potential on the membrane does

248
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,480
quite a lot of that work. And he's shown quite recently that actually, with just the proton,

249
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,760
it moves about 11 degrees. And with the electrical potential as well, that takes it another 25

250
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,560
degrees or something of that order of rotation. So it's this local electrostatic charge,

251
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,920
which is driving that. So over short distances, it's really beautifully demonstrated that

252
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,560
you need the charge on the membrane for this to work. But over longer distances,

253
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,280
if you're dealing with perhaps a few micrometers or something, then I would be surprised if

254
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,400
electrostatic charges alone were doing that. They certainly are at the plasma membrane in

255
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,120
terms of connections between cells and having the same charge across effectively wider expanses.

256
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,160
But the mitochondria are interesting in that sense as well in that the Christie are

257
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,200
closed very often and separate from each other. And so you can have different membrane

258
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,200
potentials in different Christie in the same mitochondria. You can have individual mitochondria

259
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,760
or you can have a network that all join together. There's so much subtlety in all of this.

260
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,640
And to underpin all of that, nobody has ever successfully measured the membrane potential

261
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,960
of mitochondria accurately. And the reason for that is if you simply use a microelectrode and you

262
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
insert it into the matrix of the mitochondria, into the middle of the mitochondria, what you'll

263
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,000
measure, and this is work going back decades from a guy called Tedeschi, but other people have come

264
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,600
to the same conclusion. You get about 10 or 20 millivolts, it's not much, somewhat less than the

265
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,240
plasma membrane. All of the calculations, all of the change in pH, all the chemiosmotic hypothesis

266
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,440
is saying it should be 150 to 200 millivolts. So where's that difference coming from? It's partly

267
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,800
that way we're using voltage sensitive dyes to accumulate and it's very difficult to calibrate

268
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,680
them. And it's partly that we now know the structure of the mitochondria is different.

269
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,840
They are closed Christi. So what you're measuring with the microelectrode is the difference between

270
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,000
the matrix space and the cytosol. And what we really want to measure is the difference between

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,720
the matrix space and the Christi space. And no one's really ever managed to get anything into

272
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,200
that Christi space, which is capable of reporting back on the charge there. So it's definitely

273
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,440
working at the molecular level for sure. It depends a lot on the actual structure, which only in the

274
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,080
last few years with super resolution microscopy and cryo tomography and things like that are we

275
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,200
able to really get a handle on exactly what is the structure of mitochondria and exactly

276
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,480
how do these spaces relate to each other and so on. And no one's ever measured it properly.

277
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,440
So it's kind of glaring ignorance again at the heart of all of this, but until we can measure

278
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,400
these things accurately and understand how they change over short periods of time, which maybe

279
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,720
seconds or minutes, I would think, then, you know, there's got to be a certain amount of

280
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,840
hand waving about it. But to think that it's not the right place to look is, I think, to

281
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,320
miss the most important things in science now. And this is totally not my area. So maybe this

282
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,240
is a dumb idea. But any chance that one could make a synthetic one that was big enough where

283
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
would that change everything if you sort of made one that was already, you know,

284
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,400
sort of basically synthetically try to make that, that, you know, a big mitochondria around some

285
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,840
sort of engineered electrodes that were already where you needed them to be and sort of assemble

286
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,680
the thing around them. Any chance somebody could build something like that? Or would that be totally

287
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,360
not informative? It would be a fun thing to try and do. I think it would be difficult because the

288
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,920
I think what you tend to build around it would be something in the structure of a sphere or

289
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,120
something along those lines. And what we're actually dealing with. I mean, there are again,

290
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,800
there are stunning structures to the Christie membranes. We tend to just see them as a wavy line

291
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:06,080
in the textbook. But they're stunningly structured. But sometimes you get amazing kind of arrays of

292
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,360
triangular shapes and things. You see some of, you know, they're doing bionegetics. But

293
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
in what world are they doing that? There definitely there's nothing in known bionegetics that says

294
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,160
why they have triangular shaped Christie. We just have no idea.

295
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,760
So for you, metabolism is like central to bioelectricity.

296
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,840
I think the two are connected and are integrated that way. I think they have been from the very

297
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:42,720
beginning because to my mind, you know, for any form of selection to work, you have to have growth.

298
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,360
You have to have cells which are duplicating themselves. And then you have some form of

299
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,080
selection, either they do it slowly or they would quickly or they survive longer or they,

300
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
you know, but you have different outcomes. As soon as you've got cells, you don't have to have

301
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,160
genes in those cells. You just have to have cells which are capable of doubling. And if you're

302
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:07,040
starting as life does on Earth with CO2, then the point of having the electrical membrane

303
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,760
potential is in effect to get CO2 to react with hydrogen. They don't, they're not particularly

304
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,200
reactive. They don't particularly want to react together. And cells today effectively

305
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,160
use the charge on the membrane to force them to react. And those charges make sense at the

306
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,640
origin of life because what you have, as Peter Mitchell actually said in 1957,

307
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,680
the inside and the outside of a cell, if you like, are two equivalent phases separated and

308
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:46,560
linked by the membrane that's between them. And those phases are not the same in terms of

309
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,200
their ionic composition or anything else. They cannot be. One is the living cell and the other

310
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,880
one is the outside world. And that necessarily generates charges on those membranes and those

311
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,440
charges necessarily organize things. So, you know, however much you, you know, it's just there. You

312
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,360
cannot avoid it. You will have a charge on a membrane and that charge on the membrane does

313
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,720
something useful, even in a purely prebiotic world, which is to say it will make carbon dioxide

314
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,600
react with hydrogen to make organic molecules inside this cell-like thing, which has now

315
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,400
got more organic molecules inside, which would include more membrane molecules and everything

316
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,560
else. And so it can grow. So the whole thing from the very beginning, way before we had genes,

317
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:37,440
is driven by charge and structure. Yeah, Richard. The late Richard Borgans had this, made this

318
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,280
interesting point where he said that as soon as, so super early on, as soon as you have a membrane

319
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,040
that segregates some goodies inside the organism versus outside, you're likely to have a charge

320
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,360
imbalance. And then if you get injured, so let's say the membrane gets perforated,

321
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,400
you immediately get a free vector to the side of the damage because of the short circuit of the

322
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,120
electric field. And you get that for free. That's a free gift from physics. You don't need a genome.

323
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,200
You don't need pathways. You don't need any of that. Immediately,

324
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,200
you know where the damage was. So if you have some sort of electrosensitive subunit as occurs in

325
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,240
wound healing and whatnot, it just, the physics tells you where to go to plug up the damage and

326
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,680
so on. So I'm guessing there are many of these things that are just, so these free gifts that

327
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,520
we get from chemistry and physics and then evolution exploits those in different ways.

328
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,320
So since you already mentioned evolution, let's talk about it. So how

329
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:50,160
these kinds of systems will evolve? Nick? I mean, I think, as I say, for bacterial cells,

330
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:58,640
for single cells, the membrane is what divides them from the outside world. And there's no way,

331
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:09,920
you know, how does it know what's happening outside? Well, things impinge on the membrane

332
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,120
and cross that membrane. And the cell with its biochemistry has to figure out, what does that

333
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,680
mean? And what am I going to do? Should I swim that way? Or should I swim this way? Or how am I

334
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,040
going to behave in response to this? So there's never, it doesn't know that there's an oil slick

335
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,720
over there or whatever it may be, but it's picked up something and it needs to make a decision as

336
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:42,240
a cell, what it's going to do next. So I quite like the ideas from Carl Friston on this, who

337
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,880
talks about a Markov blanket in the cell membrane as being a Markov blanket. And effectively, it's

338
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,800
translating between the language of the outside world and the language of biochemistry inside.

339
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,000
And that language of biochemistry inside is trying to find this low energy state in effect,

340
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,960
which is its homeostatic preferred place to be. I'm not sure I convey very well what he has to

341
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,360
say on this, but the way I interpret it or understand it is, well, if you're in a bad

342
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,280
environment, then, you know, your proteins start to unravel and denature. And that's actually a

343
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,360
higher energy state and not a place you want to be. And if you move over there and your proteins

344
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,120
start renaturing again, then that's a better place to be. But you still need to integrate all of,

345
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,200
you know, you've taken a statistical sampling of the outside world, you've got a correlation that

346
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,920
says this happened, therefore do that. But you take multiple samples of this through multiple

347
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,960
receptors and they're conflicting. Some of them say go over there, some of them say go over there.

348
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,320
So how do you integrate all that information and make a decision about what to do?

349
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,040
And that's where the plasma, the cell membrane, the plasma membrane, if you like,

350
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,320
begins to integrate all that information. If you're, you know, if the problem is that

351
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,240
you're poisoned and your substrates don't work, then your membrane potential is going to fall.

352
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,160
If your membrane potential falls, then you move over there sharpish. So, you know, it provides

353
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,480
you with information on your state in the world as a single entity. And I like to think of that as

354
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,800
the simplest possible imaginable form of the stream of consciousness, which is to say is

355
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,240
integrating real time information about your state in relation to the world in terms of am I good

356
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,760
or am I not good? Really, that's the simplest, simplest thing. Do I, do I go there? Do I,

357
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,040
do I stay here? What, you know, it's, it's, it's, that seems to me to be a fundamental

358
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,960
decision for a living cell to make, which is based entirely on its need to survive in the world and

359
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,000
which is integrated by the membrane and in effect by electrical charge on the membrane as you

360
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
integrating that information. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's a really good point. Chris Fields

361
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,240
talks about this kind of thing in bacteria as a, as an early form of metacognition,

362
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,600
because if you imagine you're a bacterial cell in some sort of gradient,

363
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,680
yeah, you can measure the actual molecule that you're interested in. But for example, it might

364
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,080
be poisonous. It might, there might be a poisonous version of it. And so what you might also want

365
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,880
to have in some bacteria have this is a way of measuring indirectly, instead of tracking the

366
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,520
thing you really want to track, what they track is your own metabolism. So, so, right? So, so it's,

367
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,560
it's a kind of a self monitoring loop, basically a simple example of metacognition, where you,

368
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,320
where, where you say, okay, I'm not going to worry about the details of, of what it is I'm

369
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
trying to metabolize. It was just, how are we doing? Are we like, you know, and, and, and that

370
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,920
gives you, there's some trade offs there, but it gives you this, this incredible power of

371
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,200
coarse graining over all kinds of details to have a large scale variable to deal with, right? And,

372
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,720
and maybe metabolic state and memory potential is a fantastic example of that. And I think

373
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,640
getting back to the evolution question, one, one sort of hypothesis I would, I will put out there

374
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,360
is that the fact that we have these metabolic needs and the fact that you don't have all the time

375
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,640
in the world to process every possible scenario because you're going to fall apart and be eaten

376
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,960
is really, I think a key driver of intelligence for the following reason. If you are a creature

377
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,080
that does not have these constraints, it doesn't have metabolic needs. For example,

378
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,480
like a modern AI, which is plugged into the wallet as all the energy it needs, it never has to worry

379
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,720
about getting, getting any energy. If you're a biologically, a biological agent that arose

380
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,200
in evolution under these constraints that you are constantly under this metabolic pressure,

381
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,120
one of the things you cannot afford to do is to be a micro reductionist, meaning that I'm going to

382
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,240
track all the micro states in my environment. You do not have time to, to try to be a Laplacian

383
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,800
demon. You did, there's just no time for that. Instead, there's great pressure to become really

384
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,920
good at coarse graining the world into chunks that you can, you can large scale affordances,

385
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,320
observables, control knobs, and, and pay attention to those and, and completely sort of abstract what's

386
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,960
underneath. So that pressure to, to, to, to cut up the, the, all the details into higher level

387
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,360
things that you're going to represent, like my metabolism, my resting potential, right?

388
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:28,640
These higher level things means that all of the, the ability to generalize, the ability to

389
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,280
abstract from, from individual instances to general rules and general observations. And

390
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,240
even dare, dare I say, for advanced organisms like us, the ability to tell stories about agents

391
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,040
doing things, in other words, to have an agential view on the world. In other words, in, right?

392
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,280
In, in, in modern humans to have a view of free will as an, I am a thing that does things and

393
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
there's a, there's a, there's a tiger and tigers and you know, our agents that do things and so on.

394
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,800
All of that has, I think, its origin all the way at the beginning, the first agential models were

395
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,480
made by, by microbes who had to adopt that stance. They had to adopt an agential stance in order to

396
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,040
survive in real metabolic, under metabolic constraints. And I think what evolution did after

397
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,160
that was scale it up to creatures that can then verbalize it that like us, I've got, you know,

398
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,560
I've got free will in this and that, but, but all of this goes all the way back to the beginning to

399
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,520
the necessity to make models of large scale variables, doing things, being important control

400
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,880
knobs. If my voltage is off, if my metabolism is off, I need to change my voltage. I'm not talking

401
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
about this sodium ion versus that sodium ion. I'm talking about getting my voltage fixed up.

402
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,520
And that's, you know, that I think is a driver of, of a ratchet for, for intelligence.

403
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,360
I mean, a couple of things. One, one thing about voltage and bacteria, there's a guy called Ken

404
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:57,920
Nielsen who for years has been culturing bacteria on electrodes. And the thing is that lots of

405
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,920
bacteria is, it's always proved impossible to culture them in a pure culture, which is to say

406
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,400
just those bacteria are nothing else. And the reason is basically that they, you know, they dump

407
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,640
their electrons onto their neighbor, which is the back, you know, another bacterial cell of a

408
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,320
different species, let's say, which wants those electrons. And so it's a, it's a synthrophy,

409
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,480
they're effectively living alongside each other. But the way to kind of escape from that is you,

410
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,640
you give them an electrode and you set that member, the potential, the electrical potential

411
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,280
electrode till let's say minus 300 millivolts or something like that. And they, you know,

412
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,720
they either dump their electrons onto that or they take their electrons from that.

413
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,720
But then they'll grow on that surface at that, at that voltage. And if you switch the voltage to

414
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,120
say minus 304 millivolts, you get a different bacterial population growing there. And you

415
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,720
change it by another three or four millivolts and you get a different and you can effectively

416
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,400
grow all of these pure cultures of bacteria by just shifting the voltage by just a few millivolts.

417
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,760
It's extra, it's exquisitely sensitive. The way that they, so again, it's how all this works at

418
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,320
the level of cells, I don't really know, but the voltage then in your environment and the way in

419
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,440
which you're, you know, where you're offloading your electrons and where you're gaining your

420
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,480
electrons from is, it's fundamental to how cells grow. But coming back to evolution again,

421
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,200
bacteria are using their membrane as the interface to the world. But then we have

422
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,600
eukaryotic cells that have internalized mitochondria. And they start using the plasma

423
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,520
membrane for something different. And they can be now much more interesting in what you do with

424
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,520
your plasma membrane. You don't have to be using it for energetics all the time. You can be using

425
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,400
it for much more interesting and subtle things, including changing shape and becoming a phagocyte

426
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:05,920
or beating silly or whatever it may be. But now the, this kind of simple idea that your metabolism

427
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,920
is directly plugged into your membrane and gives you an immediate integrated feedback on your state

428
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,840
in the world becomes much more complicated because a lot of your metabolism is happening in the

429
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,720
mitochondria. You may have got scores of mitochondria. They may all be doing different

430
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,960
things depending on where they are in the cell. And the cell now has a kind of, you know, a bigger

431
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,840
problem of how do I integrate all this extra information about how I'm doing in the environment?

432
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:38,320
And it seems to me almost necessary to bring it. I mean, you could imagine that it could all work

433
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,760
by, you know, phosphorylating everything. But I find it very hard to buy. I find it much easier to

434
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,840
imagine that either we've got networks, but more likely we're simply signaling electrically

435
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,520
between different mitochondria and between mitochondria and the cell membrane so that the

436
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,640
cell is integrating its state still electrically, but in a more subtle and sophisticated way.

437
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,080
So, you know, this is a big, I would say a big challenge at the origin of eukaryotic cell. How

438
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:13,040
do you, you know, rewire yourself to work as instead of being a consortium of cells that have

439
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,800
their own independence, but now some of them are inside, how do you kind of rewire so you act as

440
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,080
an entity, as an individual organism at the level of the cell with all of these things inside, all

441
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,800
of which are metabolizing potentially in different ways. So there's a problem with integration there.

442
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,400
And then you have the next level, which is you become multicellular, and then you've got another

443
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,440
problem with integration. So you're kind of taking up the, you're adjusting up the hardware required

444
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,520
to keep a signal, which is intelligible. And by the time you got into a central nervous system,

445
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:52,480
it's enormously complex, of course. I mean, that's what my next question was. So first of all,

446
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,560
the eukaryogenesis that you mentioned, it's again, like your argument that it happened

447
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,000
after two billion years. So this is also quite exciting that, you know, or interesting that

448
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,720
for two billion years bacteria were surviving somehow. And then with this certain transition

449
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,120
where to unicellular, they come together. Yeah. I mean, that's not really my argument so much

450
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,440
as that's an observation, which is to say there are, I mean, molecular clocks, which would not

451
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,960
to be believed very heartily for deep evolutionary history. But they're putting eukaryotes at one

452
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,160
and a half to two billion years ago, that kind of time. And eukaryotes all clearly share the

453
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,760
same cell structures. They clearly share a common ancestor, unless convergent evolution has an

454
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,240
astonishing power to regenerate exactly the same cell structures, but that's hard to buy.

455
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,920
And before that, there's plenty of evidence for bacteria going back to practically four

456
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,040
billion years ago. And there's plenty of evidence for all the big nutrient cycles,

457
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,760
iron cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and so on. So there's plenty of evidence

458
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:13,680
that there were bacteria throughout this whole time. So there is an issue with this apparently

459
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,280
unique origin of eukaryotic cells. Now it's quite possible that there were hundreds or thousands

460
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,400
of origins of complex cells and they all just disappeared without trace. But it's also possible

461
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,320
that that wasn't the case and that there are structural constraints on bacteria which relate

462
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,000
to having a charge on their membrane, which effectively say it's not easy to internalize

463
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,080
all of this stuff. It's a big, big structural change. It's not easy to get inside one. And when

464
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:44,000
you get inside it, you've got your own vested interests and chances are it will go wrong.

465
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,520
But I'm pointing to this electrical wiring issue. It's not just about integrating your

466
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,120
biochemistry. It's also about how do I reintegrate my wiring as an individual cell as an organism?

467
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:02,320
You look at, I think we both show the same video occasionally, Mike, of it's a ciliate.

468
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,520
I forget which one it is, but it's feeding this astonishing control. That's the one, yes.

469
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:17,040
It's astonishing control that it has. And you think, is it really detecting concentration

470
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,880
gradients of molecules or is it picking up on something electrical to do that? How does it know

471
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,160
that there's something right there and right there in the space of seconds or less than seconds?

472
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,600
Yeah. One fun thing that there's a cool paper by Min Zhao and colleagues where

473
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,720
he shows that there are cells, I think maybe keratocytes or something,

474
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,120
that crawl in a particular direction in an electric field. So they have very robust

475
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,400
electrotaxis. But if you actually cut up the cell into pieces, the pieces, the fragments,

476
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,840
crawl in the opposite direction. So it's a great example of, I think Richard Watson

477
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,400
says it this way that the point of holes is to get the parts to do things they wouldn't

478
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,720
normally do. And this is like a cool example of that because all the parts want to go that way,

479
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,440
the whole, the collective goes that way. And it's a very active electrosensitive process.

480
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,200
Fascinating. So maybe let's talk about multicellularity because I think that's,

481
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,240
so I mean, Mike is using this core screen kind of analogy or metaphor and

482
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,040
Nick is using integration. I don't know if they are different. I think it's probably

483
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,040
both. No, I think it amounts to the same thing. Yeah. So let's talk about multicellularity that,

484
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,680
and then interestingly, I mean, of course, nowadays we talk about biofilm, bacterial

485
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,400
biofilms that it happens also in bacteria, etc. But what is the difference between bacterial

486
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,560
biofilms and a multicellular organism like anything, any animal, we can talk about plant,

487
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:07,040
fungi, etc. Right. I mean, there's a simple answer to that, which is that they're all composed of

488
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:13,680
different cells, different genetically very different to each other. And the point about

489
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,880
pretty much all, well, all metazoans, all animals, all plants, they've all been through a single cell

490
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,480
stage and we're all basically clonal. So our genome is the same. So there are multicellular

491
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,760
bacteria. So filamentous cyanobacteria, they have two different cell types. So the nitrogen

492
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,720
fixing cells, the heterocysts and the photosynthetic cells. So it's not that it's not possible for

493
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:51,520
bacteria to do that. But they don't do much of it. Whereas a biofilm is, you know, is deep

494
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:58,000
cooperation between different types of cell. But the whole of evolutionary biology and pretty

495
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,800
much all the experiments on things like slime moles, which come together as genetically different

496
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,240
cells and then cooperate to build a stalk, for example, for distributing spores. Cheating is

497
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,480
a real issue that they never tend to generate greater complexity than something like a stalk,

498
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,000
because the cheats always win in the end, because they're genetically distinct to each other. So

499
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,880
I think, you know, mainstream evolutionary biology would just say animals are clonal.

500
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,640
And that restricts the amount of fighting that goes on between cells. And I don't see any reason

501
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,640
to argue with that. I think the reason that eukaryotic cells make animals and plants much

502
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,960
more readily is that we have much larger genomes and we can have much, much larger genomes because

503
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,800
we have mitochondria and much better energy generation, if you like, than bacteria. And

504
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,320
that means you can switch genes on and off in different tissues. And if you're switching genes

505
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,520
on and off in different tissues, then you're shifting not only the hardware, but also all

506
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,960
the electrical properties of different tissues as well. So the more the coarse-graining can be

507
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,200
then shifted as well. Whereas if you've got different types of bacterial cell, all of which

508
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,240
have got their own agenda, the idea of having a kind of network of cells which are generating a common

509
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,560
a common kind of electrical phase that they're in, becomes at least a lot more problematic,

510
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,160
I would say. Is that your take, Mike, or would you see it differently?

511
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,520
So yeah, it's a super interesting topic. First of all, about the bacteria stuff and you may want

512
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:45,360
to have him on. So if you haven't already, so Goral Soelle from UCSD who studies bacterial

513
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,440
biofilms and the way they coordinate using bioelectricity to make sure that everybody

514
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,680
gets fed and the population and all this kind of stuff. So there may be, and it's not my thing,

515
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,080
so you should talk to him. But I think there's some very interesting cooperativity stuff going

516
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:05,920
on there. What I think might be fun is being a kind of a spoil sport that I am. I want to poke,

517
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:12,480
and I don't disagree with this idea that of course going through this bottleneck is important

518
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,920
evolutionarily. But I just want to bring up a few examples that kind of poke some holes into

519
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,160
this story because I think they're worth getting to the bottom of a couple of things.

520
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:34,560
The first thing is that despite our largely genetic homogeneity inside our bodies, cells and

521
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,440
organs compete with each other. So for example, during development, there's really a strong

522
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:46,800
competition between all kinds of organs. And we have computational models of this and farmers

523
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,960
and other scientists have been publishing this stuff for a really long time. There's actually a

524
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:59,840
lot of competition and struggle. And the classical biologist Rue called this, he had a long

525
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,400
monograph called the struggle of the parts, where he talks about all of the ways that the pieces of

526
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,480
an embryo and of an organism are actually fighting each other for all kinds of stuff, even though

527
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,800
they have similar genetics. The other thing I want to talk about is how similar really the

528
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,640
genetics are. So in humans, Doug Brash tells me that there are about 100,000 mutations per skin

529
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,680
cell in normal skin. This is not cancer. This is normal skin, 100,000 mutations per cell.

530
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:37,600
So and people like I think Walsh at the Harvard Medical School is finding mutations

531
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:45,040
in the brain and in human neurons. So there's actually apparently there's a ton of genetic

532
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,440
variability and where it really reaches its kind of ultimate expression, I think this is one of the

533
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:59,600
most interesting stories, planaria are mixoploid. I mean, it's a certain species, every cell has

534
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,560
a different number of chromosomes. The genome is an unbelievable mess. And yet these are the

535
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:11,120
animals with the most regenerative ability, the cancer resistance immortal, as far as we can tell.

536
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,960
And it's kind of an amazing scandal that the animal with the best anatomical control, immortality

537
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:26,160
and regeneration is also the one with the most messy genome, right? The every cell. And so this

538
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,040
used to drive me completely crazy, this idea. Well, first of all, why does nobody talk about

539
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,920
this? We never hear about this, you know, in a standard develop isn't a standard biology kind

540
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,320
of curriculum. What they tell you is well, the genome is what sets your anatomy. So who would

541
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:47,280
expect the relationship to be backwards? It doesn't make any sense. Recently, literally in the last

542
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:56,160
few months, I think we've got kind of a handle on this story. And so I think we now have an

543
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,040
understanding of what's going on there. And if you want, I can talk about it. But

544
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:12,160
Yes, please. So imagine this. Typically, the way people simulate evolution is you've got some sort

545
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,880
of genotype, the genome codes for some sort of phenotype, and then selection. So you do your

546
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,080
mutation on the genotype, and you do your selection on the phenotype. What's often missing is that,

547
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,720
and this goes back to the initial conversation, that physiological layer in between, because the

548
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,360
genotypes actually don't almost never code directly for the phenotype. What they code for

549
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,440
is properties of some sort of physiological system where the software is going to determine the

550
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,200
phenotype. So we did some simulations, and we created this thing. It's extremely simple. It's

551
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,880
just that the genome is just a set of numbers, and they start off all mixed up. And the phenotype,

552
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,040
what you select for is making sure the numbers are all in nice order from zero to 100, let's say.

553
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,280
So this is the developmental equivalent of having a body axis, of having a primary axis

554
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,640
with your tail over here and your head over here and everything in the right order in between.

555
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,120
So if you just have genotype and phenotype, of course, a standard genetic algorithm will

556
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,720
eventually, and if you look at the fitness over time curve, it's this, you will, of course,

557
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,680
it will sort all the numbers and you will get your sort of embryo. That works fine. However,

558
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,440
now let's do something interesting. Let's put in, and this is the work of Shrisha Lakshwin

559
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:25,840
in my lab, a student, an undergrad actually. What we did was we put in a developmental

560
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,240
phase where, yeah, you've got your genome, but much like with real evolution, the cells aren't

561
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,480
passive, dumb material. They actually have a little bit of, they have their own agenda, right? And

562
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,840
during that process from being a genome to being an adult that you get selected on,

563
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,520
they have some time to do things. Cells are not a blank slate material, right? They always,

564
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,600
you know, they're always doing something. And so imagine if you put in just a little bit,

565
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,840
just a tiny bit of what we call competency on the cells, and the competency just works like

566
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,800
this. You look at your neighbor, and if they have an identity, a number that's way different from

567
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,600
yours, it stresses you out. You don't like it. And so during that developmental process, and this

568
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,480
is very developmentally, this is very much a fact that when you put two things together where

569
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,960
their positional information is too far off, that's how you get regeneration. They will both

570
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,240
generate things in between to separate themselves and put in, so if you put a five next to a 10,

571
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,920
they will generate the six, seven, eight inside, right? In between them. So you give cells just

572
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,480
a tiny ability for that competency just to look at their neighbors and maybe crawl around a little

573
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:41,040
bit to try and reduce their stress level. What happens then is that when an individual comes

574
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,760
up for evaluation of fitness, and they look pretty good, the numbers are kind of pretty sorted,

575
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,520
evolution doesn't know, selection doesn't know whether it looks good because the genome was

576
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,520
amazing, or it looks good because the genome was actually so-so, but everything sort of crawled

577
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,120
around. So what that means is that the genome now has a hard time selecting on the genotype. The

578
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,840
selection cannot see the defects of the genotype. So it has a really hard time making any progress

579
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,520
on improving the structural genome, but what it can do is put all its effort in improving

580
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,760
the competency. So in the next generation, what you get are individuals that are slightly more

581
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,160
competent. Now, this makes the problem worse because they're slightly more competent. It's even

582
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,320
harder to know what their genome was like because they look really great. Who knows what their genome

583
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,440
was like. And so you end up with this positive feedback loop where the minute you admit that

584
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,480
you're dealing not with a passive material, but with cells that can make some decisions locally,

585
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,840
you immediately get into this arms race where the effort starts going into increasing that

586
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,280
competency, not fixing the genotype. And so in the end, if you let it run all the way, now of

587
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,240
course, there are some other factors that can sort of dampen that runaway feedback loop,

588
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,120
but if you let it run all the way, what you get are exactly planaria. You get organisms that are

589
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,080
really good at making a good organism, no matter what the genome looks like. All the effort goes

590
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:07,040
into the algorithm. Very little pressure is left to keep a clean genome. The genomes look like hell,

591
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,480
but the organisms look amazing because all of the effort have gone into the mechanisms that allow

592
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,520
them to build what they need to build, even though the hardware is all over the place. And so what I

593
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,440
think happened in planaria, I think this went all the way up. And in other organisms like us,

594
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,040
and other other creatures, it sort of stopped halfway. There are other things that sort of

595
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,240
dampen it down. So we can kind of do that, but not as good, not as well as planaria. And it also

596
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:40,960
explains why it's such a weird thing. Any other animal, any other multicellular creature, you can

597
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,720
call a stock center and you can get a strain of abnormal mutants. So you can get flies with

598
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,640
pearly wings and mice with crooked tails and albinos. And planaria, there is no such thing as a

599
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,280
strain of abnormal planaria other than our two headed form. And those are not genetic. Those

600
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:05,360
are not genetic. And there's never been a planarian mutant line. Isn't that weird? Why not? And also

601
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,120
for now, I would say for about 30 years, maybe more, people have been trying to make transgenic

602
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:16,560
planaria and it's never worked. It just doesn't work. Why does it not work? And why do we not

603
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,520
have strains? I think because the algorithm is such that it basically ignores most of the genome,

604
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,960
not all of it, of course, because you still need the competency machinery. But the competency is

605
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,720
such that it can tolerate massive degrees of errors in the genome and it expects to. That's

606
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:40,240
why because of this runaway, you know, sort of runaway ratchet. So I think it is true,

607
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,240
like you said, I think, of course, we go through a bottleneck and we do share genetically much

608
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,040
more so than the bacteria. But I think there's a lot more play in that system, you know, I think

609
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:58,400
potentially we're not actually sharing all the DNA and even, right? And even when we do, I think,

610
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,840
and I think, I think Grohl would say that the bioelectrics actually is a really good way to

611
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,600
crank up cooperativity when you don't share genetics. I'm putting words in his mouth, I don't

612
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:15,040
know, but I think that's what his work says to me. Yeah. I mean, one, sorry, just one quick

613
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:24,880
thing on the biofilms before coming around to that. I mean, one question that I had at the back

614
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:32,400
of my mind is there's a lot of bacteria, for example, growing on, let's say, a rusty iron surface,

615
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,760
and they're, they're effectively putting their electrons onto the, onto the iron and dissolving

616
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,960
the rusty iron, and they're using it effectively as oxygen as an electron acceptor. And there's

617
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,880
been a question for a long time, okay, the bacteria that are touching the surface, no problem.

618
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,880
They just dump their electrons straight onto it, no problem. The ones which are up here somewhere,

619
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,240
not actually touching that surface at all. And there were all kinds of questions about

620
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,760
electron shuttles, quinones, external quinones that wasn't really clear quite what they were

621
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,240
doing. The implication was that they were somehow swimming down here, putting the electrons on,

622
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,760
and then swimming back again. And you think, well, how's a quinone going to do that?

623
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,920
And it seems much more likely that actually what they're doing is just dumping it on the next cell.

624
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,880
And that next cell dumps it on the one underneath. And so you end up with, yes, a, you know,

625
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,760
charge running straight through this entire colony. And it becomes in effect altruistic,

626
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,920
although all the individual cells were behaving selfishly and simply dumping their electrons

627
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:44,000
on their nearest neighbor. And to some extent, this is a little bit what you're saying about a

628
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,480
multi-cell plenarium where they're not genetically so similar, but they're freaked out by their neighbor,

629
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:58,400
which is doing something different. So they are responding to this by trying to put something

630
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:07,040
in the way, or presumably by fixing the charge in some way locally. So I don't really quite see

631
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,840
how this works. But how long can it last before the hardware itself breaks down sufficiently

632
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:20,320
that they can't tell that their neighboring cell is not like them or freaky? Or, you know,

633
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,600
they've got to be able to detect it. They've got to have some awareness of what's next to them.

634
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,120
You're able to do that. And presumably if your genome is completely riddled,

635
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,000
you must lose your ability to do that at some point. So here's what I'll say. I mean,

636
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,840
the thing we know for sure is that they've been around for 300 million years, 400 million years,

637
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,600
and going strong, no sign of any breakdown. But the other thing, and this is totally

638
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,520
unpublished, so treat this with every possible grain of salt. But I'll just sort of tell you,

639
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:57,120
we had a project a few years ago where we cultured plenaria in mutagens. So the stuff that you would

640
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:02,160
dip a zebrafish embryo in for a short period of time to make mutants, we cultured them in that

641
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:09,600
stuff for like a year. And what we saw was that the particular animals that were in the mutagen

642
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,320
would have some freaky sort of defects. But then you cut them into pieces, and after that,

643
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,240
you just get lines of absolutely normal plenaria after that. So I don't know. I assume there must

644
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,160
be some kind of limit, I think you're right. But I don't think we're anywhere near having reached

645
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,840
it, I think. And we're going to, this is something that we're actually investigating actively now

646
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,160
is just like, what's the limit of this? Like, how far can we really trash the genome before,

647
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,040
in an organism like this before there's a problem? Boy, I don't know.

648
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,040
How small a piece can you cut for it to regenerate the entire thing? I mean, are you down to just

649
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:49,200
a few cells more than that? It's more than a few cells. The record is something like 275,

650
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,880
and this was Thomas and Morgan in early 1900s. And maybe you could maybe now with antibiotics and

651
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,600
so on, we could do better, you know, even more single cells don't work. It's very hard. You

652
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,520
can't get a full plenarian out of one cell, but you know, little tiny chunks work.

653
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,240
So you need the context of the cells around you to have some kind of...

654
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,080
And I don't know if that's for a boring reason, meaning that the surface area to volume ratio

655
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:21,840
was too large and it loses all the goodies, that would be maybe like a mechanical reason.

656
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:27,920
Or if it's a deep reason, like the information on building a plenarian is a holographic kind of

657
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,720
storage. And if you don't have enough, it's just too fuzzy. You can't recover what you need, right?

658
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:39,280
I don't know which it is. But there is an interesting story that relates to what you

659
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,320
were just talking about, which suggests that these kind of electrical transfers

660
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:51,280
can override genetic, I'm just now thinking about this, can override genetic

661
01:04:51,920 --> 01:05:03,360
dysrelatedness and potentiate cooperativity. And the story goes like this, in tadpoles,

662
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,080
we can inject a human K-RAS mutation, which is a nasty oncogenic mutation.

663
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,960
You inject it, those cells, they become a tumor, they invade the embryo, it's just, you know,

664
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:20,160
bad seed. What you can do is simultaneously co-inject an ion channel that forces the cells

665
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,600
to a voltage at which they will stay electrically connected to their neighbors.

666
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:28,880
And if you do that, even though the genetics has been, basically, there's a very, very powerful

667
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,120
hardware level mutation, the oncogene is blazing, it doesn't get destroyed or anything,

668
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,800
we can see it, we can see the protein is still there. But the cells don't make a tumor,

669
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,800
they cooperate, they continue to cooperate and they build nice skin and muscle and whatever.

670
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,800
And this just, you know, it dovetails with the story that we have about

671
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,880
gap junctions potentiating individuals into collectives where it wipes, it tends to

672
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,280
wipe that individuality on an informational level. You know, if you and I are connected

673
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,040
with a gap junctional signal and your memories and my memories, molecules are sort of floating

674
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,360
back and forth, we have no idea whose memory belongs to whom, right? And we become, you and I

675
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,560
become a we in the sense that we now have one shared pool of metabolic memories, everything,

676
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,840
it's very hard to keep identity. And so I think what you described in the bacteria is really

677
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:27,040
interesting. And the meta zone version of that is gap junctions, where you use that electrical

678
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:33,040
network to overcome differences in genetics and kind of potentiate the cooperativity.

679
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:41,920
I'm amazed that this hasn't caught on more. I mean, maybe you're in different circles to me,

680
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,480
but that when I talk to cancer people, not very many of them are thinking in these terms,

681
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,680
even though it's been known for a long time that if you transfer the nucleus of a cancer cell into a

682
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,200
non cancer cell, then it, you know, it doesn't become it doesn't become cancerous. It doesn't

683
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,520
become carcinogenic. It's not the nucleus, the cytoplasm, which is, which is, which is doing the

684
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,360
thing. And so many mutations that you see oncogenic mutations in a tumor, you see the same mutations,

685
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,440
you know, next to the tumor and elsewhere in the body. So it's, it's very much the context

686
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,120
they're setting on. I was talking to, there's a woman at King's College in London, who I

687
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:27,120
met recently, Jodie Rosenblatt. And she, she was working on epithelium. And this interesting

688
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:34,880
question that you have cells which are, which are producing, dividing and producing new cells,

689
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,640
and those new cells are growing towards each other. And they get to a place where they're

690
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,040
effectively pressing up against each other. And there are various mechanoreceptors.

691
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,320
And some of them pop out, but which ones pop out? And on what basis do they pop out? And the way

692
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:56,240
that she described all of this, I said, you should look at the chart on these cells. And I

693
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:02,400
mentioned your work to her. And, and, and she's, she's, she's been checking and, and it all works

694
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,360
on charge. There, there's a, I forget which way around it is, but I'm pretty sure they,

695
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:14,560
if they lose the membrane potential, they, they, they pop out. So it's, it seems ripe to explain

696
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:20,720
a lot of things which are, it's probably not only that, as you said earlier on, the mechanoreception

697
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,400
and your proximity to other cells, there's going to be other things going on as well. But

698
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,000
it's this balance. It must be a very fine balance. Yeah. It's allowing you to know

699
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,920
you're the odd one out. Off you go. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a different, it's a different

700
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,640
perspective on this whole problem because traditionally you would have like a, like,

701
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,720
for example, game theory approaches where you would say, well, the cancer cells are more selfish.

702
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,480
And that way they do this or that. I actually don't think they're any more selfish at all.

703
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,800
I think what it is is their selves are smaller. So what happens is if you have, if you're in

704
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:59,360
good gap junctional electrical connection, you are plugged into a network that yourself,

705
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,880
meaning the border between you and the outside world and tumors of the goals that you're going

706
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,400
to maintain, the internal milieu, all of these things is huge. You know, you might be a whole

707
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,520
hand or you might be a liver or a kidney, you know, it makes, it makes this large thing.

708
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,880
These oncogenes, one of the things they do is they cause gap junctional closure,

709
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,800
they cause depolarization and gap junctional closure. And as soon as you're a cell that

710
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,840
basically partially or completely disconnects from that network, now you're the border of

711
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,880
yourself is tiny. That's it. It's just this now. And at that, it's just the size of a single cell.

712
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,840
And at that point, you roll back to the kinds of goals that single cell creatures can pursue,

713
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,160
which is proliferation and migration to where life is good. And so now to you,

714
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,480
the rest of the animal is just external environment, right? The rest of the body is just outside

715
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,960
world for you because you're in amoeba. You're in amoeba now. And so that boundary between

716
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,960
self and world, one of the things that these electrical connections do is they inflate it,

717
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,160
right? During evolution of multicellularity, that boundary gets inflated so that now we

718
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:04,240
are a liver. It's not I'm a liver cell, we are a liver. Whereas, and it acts collectively to solve

719
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:09,440
large scale problems in morphogenetic spaces. As soon as you disconnect from that, you're back to

720
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:15,840
amoeba style where everything around you is just potentially a threat, potentially genetically

721
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,480
unrelated to you, all these things. And then of course you do whatever you can, which is

722
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:28,720
metastasized basically. There was some work some years ago now from a guy called Neil Blackstone

723
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:40,160
in Illinois. And he had been working on colonial, I forget what, but basically colonies. And a lot

724
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:46,160
there, they're forming effectively a multicellular organism is a colony rather than strictly

725
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,840
multicellular, but the gap is quite close. But they, the conditions that they're subject to

726
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,480
depends on where you are in the colony, or you are the edge in which case you've got a higher

727
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,840
oxygen concentration surrounding you, or are you in the middle in which case you're in hypoxic

728
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:08,880
conditions? Where do you put your flagella, the cells that differentiate into flagella and the

729
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,040
whole colony can paddle itself around then? Well, they're the ones on the outside that have got

730
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:20,160
plenty of oxygen. Which ones become the stem cells and the gametes for the next generation?

731
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,840
Well, they're the ones that are in the middle, which are effectively oxygen deprived. And so

732
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,680
just the structure of a blob immediately gives you a difference between the outside and the inside

733
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,920
and the likelihood of cells. And I remember reading that and the whole thing worked on

734
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,000
redox signaling. And of course, I like the idea of redox chemistry. And I looked into is there

735
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,960
something about mammalian development that works on redox signaling. And I didn't really find anything

736
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:54,800
very much that led through. And then I thought later on, well, this is a kind of a very hard

737
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,760
wiring, but every organ will be subjected to the same thing. You need to override that. You need

738
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,480
to have a better system of organizing it if you wish to become any more complicated than a blob.

739
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:11,840
And that's where I think the bioelectric feels the beginning to come in, is you've got a level

740
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,400
of organization that says where the same, where together, we're not quite an individual,

741
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:26,240
we're in this grouping here. But coming back to planaria, you cut it into a lump of 250,

742
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,800
270 cells, whatever it may be. I'm wondering about how do you prevent your genome becoming

743
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,800
completely trashed? And I suppose part of the answer would be, well, if you're not every cell

744
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,760
is going to get equally trashed, and not every bit of tissue is going to get equally trashed.

745
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,720
So if you would just slice it up into little bits, some bits would have a better genome

746
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,680
than others. They would have some level of genomic integrity, at least at a functional level,

747
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,840
not necessarily in terms of they've all got neat chromosomes, but they're capable of generating

748
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,720
the hardware which is required to regenerate the whole planarium. So there's a kind of a bottle

749
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,840
neck just in the pieces. And those pieces have to be large enough that they're able to reestablish

750
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,040
the bioelectric fields and know their own morphology. It has to be big enough that it

751
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,440
can reestablish a planarium. If it's one cell, it's got no idea what its neighbor is, so it

752
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:23,040
wouldn't do it. But that, I think from a point of view of kind of more conventional genetics,

753
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,680
you'd say there was some kind of bottleneck in cutting the planarium up and the smaller bits

754
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,640
that will lead to damage will be the ones most likely to regenerate.

755
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,240
Yeah. Well, the thing is they all regenerate. All of them do.

756
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,600
I mean, it's right. I think you would want to say something like that, but A, every piece

757
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:52,400
regenerates, and B, every mutation that doesn't kill the cell that it's in gets propagated. So

758
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,120
there are these stem cells. There's about 30% of the animal disease, neoblast. So when they get hit

759
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,080
with a mutation, anything that doesn't kill that stem cell, it now propagates when the thing divides

760
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,880
itself in half. It becomes sort of amplified in the next generation, which is why they look

761
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:14,640
like hell, the genetics look like hell. And so you would think that there's a limit to this,

762
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:20,320
but I think the pressure of having a nice clean genome is way low for these guys.

763
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:26,800
Just they've gone to the point. Steve Frank gave me a cool analogy to this. Did you know I

764
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,640
didn't know about this when I heard about this that, you know, I'm rate arrays in computers,

765
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,200
right, where you have a instead of one disc, you have like six discs, and there's a system which

766
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:41,040
does a parody thing so that so so apparently ever since rate arrays became a thing, the quality

767
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,840
of the media has gone down because there's no because the pressure on having a good disc is

768
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,000
down because that doesn't matter that much. You've got a rate array. And so and so right. So

769
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,560
so there's this feedback loop where the better your software for correcting errors, the less

770
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,600
pressure there is on the media to be to be reliable. But once you go there, it's hard to

771
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,240
write. It's a ratchet because once you can't suddenly say, well, I'm taking my rate array

772
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:10,880
off. Well, now you can't because you're because your media is crap now. So yeah, I mean, I some

773
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:17,360
of the stuff I do is on is on mitochondrial DNA, which is generally said to be at least evolving

774
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:22,240
about 10 times faster than the nuclear genes. There's not that much of it. It's quite small.

775
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,720
And it always comes in effect in colonies. So there may be several hundred thousand copies

776
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:32,080
in a single site. And so how does quality control work? And in the case of the mitochondria,

777
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,480
there definitely is quality control, even though it's evolving and mutating pretty quickly.

778
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,800
And again, you have a lot of differences in mitochondrial sequences between different

779
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,560
tissues and mutations accumulating as we age and so on, though probably not fast enough to

780
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:54,160
drive aging as a process. And again, there's a lot that can be done with

781
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,680
some form of bottlenecking in the broadest sense, which is to say,

782
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,920
you need I mean, the way the way that it seems to work with the mitochondria in the germline

783
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:13,840
is that there are groups of cells, clumps of cells, germline cysts, they're called in the female

784
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,640
germline. And they group together and they form cytoplasmic connections between them. And they

785
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:25,520
transfer mitochondria as well as Golgi apparatus and RNAs and things into the, it's not necessarily

786
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:32,480
the central cell, but a cell in the middle of this network. And that effectively accumulates

787
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:39,360
mitochondria in what's called the mitochondrial cloud sometimes, the Balbiani body. And there's

788
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,600
an interesting question then, you're bringing all this DNA together from separate sources.

789
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,520
What's going on? We've just gone through rounds of segregation during early germline development

790
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,840
where you produce something like six or seven million Ugonia, the very earliest germ cells

791
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,840
which are dividing by mitosis. And then we start fusing them together and transferring material

792
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:11,520
between them. We did a simulation study trying to work out, well, what would be the expected rate

793
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,880
of mutation accumulation? And can we compare it with mutations, mitochondria mutations in human

794
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,400
populations? What is the known incidence of mitochondrial diseases? And can we predict that?

795
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,840
And it turned out that if you had some level of selection on mitochondrial function,

796
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,800
which is to say the simplest way to see it will be membrane potential. If you can generate,

797
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,280
if you can, as a single mitochondrion with a bit of mitochondrial DNA, if you can generate a

798
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,800
membrane potential, you can go over there. If you can't do it, you stay here. So it's at the level

799
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,600
of the software, that's where the judgment is going on, but you're throwing out the hardware,

800
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,840
which is not very good, which is not very good in the sense of not able to generate the membrane

801
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,240
potential. And then you accumulate all the ones which are capable of generating a decent membrane

802
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:06,480
potential in what's now the primordial oocyte, and then amplify that up and it becomes, if it

803
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:14,480
matures, it becomes the oocyte. And that selection on the function as they're pulled together was

804
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:20,320
able to predict moderately accurately the actual incidence of mitochondrial diseases. So it's

805
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:26,000
not that you're avoiding mutations so much as you're able to kind of, despite the fact you've

806
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,720
always got large populations, you're able to kind of select on some level of function. I've

807
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,040
got no idea if there's anything like that happening in planaria, that there's some level that these

808
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:42,400
cells are capable of generating enough of a field that it's got the right tuning to regenerate.

809
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,160
I mean, you're saying everything can, but presumably there must be some point where it

810
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:51,840
collapses. Yeah. Well, I mean, so that's super interesting. One of the things we're going to

811
01:18:51,840 --> 01:19:01,280
be looking for when we reprise this experiment of keeping them in mutagens and all that,

812
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:08,080
the prediction that I would make consistent with what you just said is that the one thing you can't

813
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:14,640
do is trash all of your ion channels. And we know that they're sensitive to that,

814
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,840
because we can make two-headed worms and worms that look like all kinds of crazy stuff. That's

815
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,040
very easy by targeting these capture agents. So one interesting hypothesis that comes out of

816
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:31,440
what you just said is that there is a selection step, which is make whatever mutations you want,

817
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,560
but if you lose the ability to be electrically, and I'm not sure if it's just keeping a certain

818
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,000
v-mem or maybe reacting, maybe it's a second order thing, I don't know, we'll see.

819
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:45,760
As long as you hold on to that, everything else is good to go. So that's a really interesting

820
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:52,000
idea. I love that idea that there's a minimal electrical competency that you get tested for,

821
01:19:52,560 --> 01:20:01,280
and that that's your bottleneck. Yeah. I may ping you offline later for some references to this

822
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:07,040
thing in my country, because I think that's actually super interesting. Yeah. And I think also,

823
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:14,400
we can kind of talk about the, because there has to be some sort of plasticity threshold

824
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:22,560
of the genetics level. And I mean, that begs the question. I mean, first of all, can we understand

825
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:33,440
just by the genome, which organism, which species is it, et cetera? And how much plasticity can we

826
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:42,800
allow in the hardware? Yeah. I don't know. People say things like developmental constraints,

827
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,080
you can only make certain things with a certain genome. I am not sure of that at all. I think that

828
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:56,240
in my head, I have this challenge that I think what we should be aiming for is this thing I call

829
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:01,440
the anatomical compiler. And I think we ought to be able to do is in the future is sit down in front

830
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,720
of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want, whatever it is. I don't care what it is.

831
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,720
It's a seven legged frog with a propeller on top, but you know, anything you like,

832
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,400
right? Like anything you want. And if we knew what we were doing, this thing would compile

833
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:21,200
that description down into a set of stimuli that would get a standard set of cells to build whatever.

834
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,040
Now, you're not going to make things that disobey gravity. You're not going to make things that

835
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:34,160
have a copper armature for a motor. That's fine. But biologically, possible shapes, whatever they

836
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,960
are, you should be able to make. And I bet, I don't know if we'll live to see this thing, but

837
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,920
I would bet that it's possible. And from the plasticity that I see, even before we really

838
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,400
understand anything about how collectives of cells make decisions, but I think we already

839
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,800
have examples that I think are telling you that this standard thing we see in development

840
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:03,280
is just one of a huge space of possible things it can do. So if I had to put money down right now,

841
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:11,520
I would say that I think almost any allowable geometric shape could be made if we understood

842
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:19,360
how to communicate with cellular collectives. Sorry, go ahead. What do you think it is that's

843
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:28,960
tending to produce the same shape repeatedly? So here's my hypothesis on all of this.

844
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:38,480
I think that evolution does not counter to expectation. I think evolution generally

845
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:44,160
does not take the past literally. In other words, it does not over train on prior examples. In

846
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,480
machine learning, you have this notion of over training when the thing memorizes the past examples

847
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,280
instead of generalizing from them. And there may be organisms like that. Maybe C. elegans is like

848
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:59,680
that. I don't know. But generally, I think what evolution does is instead of producing a specific

849
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:04,720
solution to a specific environment, I think it generally makes problem solving machines. And

850
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:08,960
the reason I think it does that is because the environment, both the individual cell environment

851
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:16,000
and the overall environment is so uncertain that maybe we had creatures way at the beginning

852
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,920
that really were just suitable for one kind of environment. I think those are all gone now.

853
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:25,760
I think anything that we see now, our systems, what evolution gives us is a system that can

854
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,120
behave adaptively in a huge range of circumstances, not because we've seen those

855
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:38,320
circumstances before and now you've got built in abilities to handle them, although in some cases

856
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:44,480
they may. But what we're making is hardware that's a problem solver in a wide domain. And we have a

857
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,440
bunch of examples of that where we challenge living things with conditions that they've never

858
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:56,240
seen before. And they're fine. They do novel things that are completely unexpected. And so

859
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:02,560
I think what evolution does is produce hardware that under normal circumstances reliably does one

860
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,160
thing. But that's not the only thing it can do. It's sort of like I always envision you get this

861
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,320
calculator and you buy a thousand of them from a factory and you turn them all on and they

862
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:20,080
all say zero. You say, wow, this thing is incredibly reliable. Yeah, under those conditions,

863
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,920
they'll all say zero. That's not the only thing it can do. And with appropriate inputs and

864
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,080
appropriate other scenarios, it'll do all kinds of stuff. And you'll never know if all you're

865
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,000
watching is the standard. That's why I like synthetic morphology and I like challenging

866
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:42,400
things with all kinds of weird scenarios. I'll give you a couple of examples. Here's an example.

867
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,720
Take planarium and you put them in a solution of barium. Barium is a non-specific potassium

868
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,600
channel blocker. So all their potassium channels stop working. Their heads are full of neurons

869
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,520
and other things that like to transfer potassium. So their heads explode literally overnight.

870
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:04,640
Their heads explode. Well, you take those remaining bodies and you leave them in the barium. In fact,

871
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,760
you refresh the barium every couple of days. Within two weeks, they regrow a new head. The new

872
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,440
head doesn't care about barium at all. No problem. So we said, well, that's bizarre. How could that be?

873
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:20,640
So we took the original heads. We took the barium adapted heads. We did a really knowing that the

874
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:26,000
answer might not be transcriptional, but this is the tool we have. So basically what we did was

875
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
we just asked, what's different in the gene expression between the barium adapted heads and

876
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,640
the control heads? A very small number of genes different. And so imagine now. And so now here's

877
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:41,200
the trick. Plenarium never see barium in the wild. There's no barium out in the wild. There's no

878
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,280
evolutionary pressure to know what to do when you're poisoned by barium. That doesn't exist.

879
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:52,720
Imagine you're in this nuclear reactor control room. The genes are all the knobs. You've got

880
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,600
20,000 different knobs. You're hit with this physiological stressor. The thing's melting

881
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,800
down. It's going to explode. You don't have time to randomly try different knobs. You don't have

882
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,960
time for gradient descent. These are not bacteria that cells don't turn over all that fast. So you

883
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,520
can't just randomly mutate and see who survives and then they rebuild the head. There's no time for

884
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:17,200
that. The cells don't grow that fast. Within a very short period of time, this thing navigates the

885
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:25,520
whatever 20,000 dimensional space of gene expression to zero in on about a dozen transcripts that will

886
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:31,120
solve your physiological problem. Now, how in the heck does it know? For a completely new

887
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,920
stressor like this, how does it know which ones those are? So you can think about it. So we don't

888
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,600
know the answer to this. But one thing that it might be able to do is, okay, I've never seen

889
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:48,800
barium before, but I have seen epileptic seizures before. And so maybe the excitotoxicity of having

890
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,960
your neurons die from abnormal potassium flux is somewhat similar. So what you really have is

891
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,440
you have the ability to generalize. So this is a system that, in any other, if we had a robot

892
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,040
that did this, this would be generalization and learning of the highest degree, right? This is

893
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,600
like, I haven't seen this before, but I've seen something else. And I bet it's similar enough

894
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:15,520
to this that I can try this out, right? So that's one example. Another example is the xenobots.

895
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:23,040
So we take some skin from frog embryos. They replicate themselves with kinematic self-replication.

896
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,480
They run around, collect other skin cells, put them into a little ball and now you get your next

897
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,200
There's never been any xenobots in the wild. There's never been pressure to be a good xenobot.

898
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:36,400
There's no other animal does kinematic self-replication. So I think life is capable of

899
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,600
huge number of a variety of things that solve problems that go beyond the narrow default that

900
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:49,760
we see. I mean, just coming back to the barium issue and the generalization, I mean, there's

901
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:57,760
lots of, there was a bacterium dinococcus radiodurans, which is astonishing the radiation

902
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,000
resistance and grows on the inside of nuclear power stations and can survive in outer space

903
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,480
and all kinds of things like that. They sometimes call it, I think, colon the bacterium. And

904
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,840
the question is, well, how does it actually do that? And it's largely exposure to other types

905
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:20,000
of stress. So for example, dehydration stress generates pretty much the same kind of internal

906
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:29,920
metabolic problems that radiation does. And so in some sense, I would see it as your metabolism

907
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,360
is stressed in a particular way. It doesn't matter if it's barium or something else,

908
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,520
which is stressing it as an epileptic fit, which is stressing it in that way, excited toxicity

909
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,960
or whatever. There's a particular type of stress that the cell is experiencing in its

910
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,080
metabolism. And there's a physiological response to deal with that, which might be to express a

911
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:56,720
different iron pump on the membrane, which doesn't do potassium, but does sodium instead.

912
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:01,280
Or I don't know what do I do, but there'll be a physiological response that you could have to

913
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:09,680
that, which is in effect generalizing from the stress to the metabolism internally, rather than

914
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:15,840
being able to identify what the external problem is. I completely agree with that. So that's one

915
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,920
policy for handling the unknown. And I think that's exactly right. I think that

916
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:30,080
multi-scale architecture where you have the genetics and you have the physiology and then

917
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:36,720
you have anatomy and so on, it becomes like a neural network, not in the neural aspect,

918
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,120
but in the information processing aspect that generalizes for the same reason that

919
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:48,960
the connection is to networks generalize in machine learning. It's an inherent property

920
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,760
of these networks that they can do stuff like that. Every layer sort of generalizes to the

921
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:59,120
categories of the layer before it. And so that's why I think it's just an inherent structure.

922
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,480
Not to also forget that now we see that even pathways can learn. So they have

923
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:11,040
some ability to learn from experience and so on. So I think that's why I'm so sanguine on

924
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:18,560
being able to build anything for themselves. And where are or how these memories are stored?

925
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,640
I mean, Mike can probably answer that, but just one story to insert before he does.

926
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:41,920
There was a lady, she died recently at the age of 96 at UCL called Ursula Mitvok and she worked

927
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,040
on sex determination for a long time. And she was very interested in- Oh, she died?

928
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,720
Yes, you're familiar with Ursula's work. I know her, yeah. I didn't know she passed. I knew she was

929
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:56,400
quite old, yeah. Yeah, she was extraordinarily active until really only a couple of years ago.

930
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,200
I wrote an obituary of her. I really admired her work. I'll send it to you.

931
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:10,400
But she linked it to growth rates because there's all these different types of

932
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:15,440
chromosomal sex determination and X and Y chromosomes are only a part of it. There'd be

933
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:21,440
multiple origins of different types of X and Y chromosome birds and many other things have got

934
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:27,520
ZW chromosomes where it's the other way around that the male is the homogometic sex with two of

935
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:34,720
the same chromosomes. And then there's temperature dependent sex determination and she had linked

936
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:40,400
the whole lot to growth rates. And effectively what the Y chromosome is doing is activating

937
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:46,720
some growth factors that say, you know, go ahead and grow quickly. And there's some interesting

938
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,000
questions in my own mind about mitochondrial inheritance and when you are allowed to grow

939
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,840
quickly and when it's best not to grow quickly, which may. So this earliest distinction between

940
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:08,800
a male embryo developing a female is just size. Males grow faster early on, not necessarily

941
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:15,440
throughout the entire development, but grow faster earlier. And then she called attention to

942
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,440
stuchomaphodides who I think there's maybe a different term now, but effectively have an ovary

943
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:27,920
on one side and a testis on the other side. And it's not random which side it's on. The testis is

944
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:33,280
usually, you know, 70% of the time is on the right hand side and the ovary on the left hand side.

945
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,280
And there are slight differences in growth rates between the right hand side

946
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:43,440
and the left hand side at that early stage. Measurable differences, measurable, you know,

947
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:51,760
with a weighing scales or a ruler practically, that level of detection. And so, you know,

948
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,800
talking about developmental plasticity, what are you going to develop an ovary or a testis?

949
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,520
It's a pretty constrained developmental plasticity in relation to some of the things you're

950
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:07,840
talking about. But still, it's determined not just genetically. And there are all kinds of

951
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,000
interesting, you know, there are mice with mutations in particular genes that will lead

952
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,960
to a sex change, which have got nothing to do with the Y chromosome or with the

953
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:24,000
SLY gene or anything like that is able to overwrite the SLY gene simply by increasing the growth rate

954
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,400
of the embryo or decreasing it and becoming female instead of male. So there are these other,

955
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:35,600
in terms of what do you develop into and how much developmental plasticity is there,

956
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:45,760
factors like growth rates can play a major role. Exactly how and how common that is, I don't know,

957
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,200
but, you know, this whole idea that temperature dependent sex determination in amphibians and

958
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:59,040
so on, basically doing the same thing as the chromosome shows all this possibility of overwriting

959
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,720
things we think we know the answer to. We think the answer lies in a gene which says you're going

960
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,280
to become male, you're going to become female. And there's all of these, you know, intersexual

961
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:13,040
states, in fact, and mostly it's this or that. But there's a scope in the middle is what she

962
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:20,800
called, I think, I forget the term that she had for it, but it's basically a threshold

963
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:26,160
dichotomy, I think was the phrase that she used. So the genes tend to push you into one state or

964
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:31,760
the other state, but there's quite a lot of flex between the two. Yeah, amazing.

965
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:39,200
Yeah, so I can talk a little bit about the bioelectric memories that override the genetics,

966
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:45,200
but I want to go first, even just more basic than that. So here's the kind of, to me,

967
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:51,040
the most stunning thing. Imagine a single amniote embryo, let's say an amniote embryo,

968
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:56,240
so a bird or human or something. It's a flat blasted disk like this, about 50,000 cells.

969
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,720
So you look at an early stage, so you look at this thing, you say, well, there's an embryo,

970
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:04,880
and you might ask yourself, well, what are we counting when we say there's one embryo?

971
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:11,200
I mean, most of the time there's one embryo, but one thing you can do is you can, and I did this

972
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:16,560
as a grad student in ducks and chicken eggs, you can take a little needle and you can put a scratch

973
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,400
or multiple scratches through that blasted term. And this is a method discovered by this guy,

974
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:25,840
Lutz, in the 40s. So you put a couple of scratches in. And then what happens is that each region of

975
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:32,720
that blasted term for a while until it heals up, doesn't feel the other regions and self-organizes

976
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:37,920
into an embryo. And then when it heals up, you've got conjoined twins or triplets or whatever.

977
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,240
So now, so there's a couple of interesting things that come out of this. First of all,

978
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:50,400
what you're counting when you say it's an embryo is how many distinct locally aligned

979
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,960
collectives are there that are all working on one project? And usually there's one, and that project

980
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,440
is getting to a particular area of morphospace building the right kind of embryo. But there

981
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,160
doesn't have to be one. There could be anywhere from zero to probably 10 or so, I would guess.

982
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,600
And that number is absolutely not genetically determined. You don't know how many embryos

983
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:15,440
are in this thing until the physiology has had it say. And then you will find out maybe it's

984
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:20,640
typically one, but it doesn't have to be one. How many are in there is a funny kind of thing,

985
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:24,320
because it will self-organize, right? It doesn't, you don't know that there's one.

986
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,560
And what I like about this is that aside from the fact that it's just like this thing that's

987
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:34,560
totally not determined, again, what evolution has given us is a machine that generates

988
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,760
coordinated selves. It doesn't give us one coordinated self. It gives us a machine that

989
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:44,240
can generate these coordinated selves. And if you leave it alone, it'll give you one. If you

990
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:48,320
cut it in half, it'll give you two. And you can sort of, you know, you can have your pick.

991
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:54,720
It's a little bit, I think, linked to the same question in cognitive science. If I

992
01:36:54,720 --> 01:37:00,160
show you a brain and you don't know what a human is, and I say to you, hey, look at this thing,

993
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,840
how many intelligences you're supposed to fit in there? You have no clue. We don't have any way

994
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,160
of estimating, you know, the number of intelligences per square, you know, per cubic inch of material,

995
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,800
like we don't know. But typically with typical humans, you say, well, that's one. That's, you

996
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,800
know, my friend, my friend, Joe. But actually, we know from split brain patients, from dissociative

997
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,200
disorders, that there's all kinds of potential individuals in there, right? And then, you know,

998
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:30,240
sort of think there's one. But so, so again, that, and again, not genetically determined,

999
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:35,280
it's all about inputs in history and, and, and learning and, and, you know, experiences and

1000
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:41,760
who knows what else. So, so this, there's some very basic and fundamental stuff that

1001
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,640
isn't genetic, because the genetics doesn't lay down the final answer, it generates, it gives you

1002
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:51,440
a machine that will then generate these things in various, you know, in various orders. And in

1003
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:59,360
planaria, so what we've done in, in planaria is just this, if you look down in, onto a planarian

1004
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:05,200
using this voltage sensitive dye, you see a pattern, the voltage pattern, we've sort of

1005
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:09,920
learned to decode it, we can tell when it says build one head versus two. The basic question was,

1006
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:14,000
hey, how do you know how many heads you should have as a planarian? Yes. How would you know,

1007
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,120
right? The assumption is, well, what else would it be? It's a, you know, it's a genetically

1008
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:22,240
determined, it's one, what else would it be? Well, so, so what happens is, so, so what happens is,

1009
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:31,440
there's a, there's a, there's a single, there's an electrical gradient that normally specifies

1010
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:37,200
one head, one tail. Well, we use some ion channel drugs, and we, we changed that to say two heads,

1011
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,120
and no genetic changes. So just a brief, what 48 hour physiological stimulus,

1012
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,320
and then that, that animal will then, if you injure it, will then make two headed animals.

1013
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:57,440
Now a couple of interesting things. That two headed pattern is read out from a one headed host. In

1014
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:01,520
other words, it's not a pattern of what you have now. It doesn't reflect your current anatomy.

1015
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:07,520
It's a, it's a counterfactual memory. It's a representation of what you will do if you get

1016
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:12,160
injured in the future. So it's like a, it's like an early version of, of this kind of mental time

1017
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:16,080
travel that brains are very good at, right? Imagining things that aren't true right now.

1018
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,720
No, no genetic changes. And the amazing thing is that if you take these two headed animals and

1019
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:27,520
you cut them further, they will continue to generate two headed worms forever, even though

1020
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,920
there's nothing genetically wrong with any of them. So the question of, of right, the question of

1021
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,400
what determines the number of heads in the planarian is kind of subtle. On the one hand,

1022
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,520
you can sort of say it's DNA because if you didn't have the ion channels, none of this would be

1023
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:49,200
happening. So okay, we need the hardware. We know that. But also it is the case that the exact same

1024
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,920
hardware is perfectly happy making one head, two heads, heads from a different species, weird,

1025
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,040
spiky cylinders that we've made that don't look anything like planaria. That same hardware is

1026
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,320
perfectly happy making all of that stuff. And where, and the information is in the,

1027
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,280
at least part of that, the important part of that information is in this, in this steady

1028
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:18,240
state bio electrical gradient that is basically the software to the genetically specified hardware.

1029
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:24,480
Yeah. And then you can see it, you can see it, you can rewrite it and it totally dominates the

1030
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:31,680
default, you know, the default state. Have you managed to do the same kind of thing in,

1031
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:39,840
say, tadpoles or other animals in planaria? Yeah, yeah. So in tadpoles, so this is what

1032
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,600
we've done. We've made tadpole faces that look like other species of frogs. We've made tadpole

1033
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:52,480
tails that look like zebrafish. And we've made frogs regenerate legs the way salamanders regenerate

1034
01:40:52,480 --> 01:41:00,480
legs. And, and we're currently all from, from the ion channels from modulating the expression of

1035
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:07,440
ion channels, ion channels or neurotransmitters, which are often the downstream, you know, the

1036
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,920
basically much like in the nervous system, the, the way that the electric circuit propagates its

1037
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,840
decisions down is through movement of neurotransmitters, which then turn genes on and off,

1038
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,960
which then do other stuff. So, so sometimes you can skip it, you can skip the, the, the top layer

1039
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,120
and do the, and do the neurotransmitter thing. So we've done it that way too. But yeah, that's

1040
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,600
basically, that's basically it. So we've done it, we've done it. And, and, and we know this works

1041
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:37,760
in mammals because human channelopathies. So you've got human humans who have either taken drugs

1042
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,680
that affect ion channels. So there's a bunch of ion channel drugs or teratogens.

1043
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,960
They will have the same craniofacial defects as we see, for example, in, in, in a frog.

1044
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:55,280
Same thing. How much of, of evolution is actually geared to restricting

1045
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:02,480
the scope for phenotypic plasticity, do you think? I mean, it seems as if less in the case of

1046
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:10,320
plenaria, more in the case of mammals, let's say, still the scope is there. But I suppose if what

1047
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:16,320
you want to do is generally produce an organism that looks the same as its parents, then there must

1048
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:23,360
be really strong selection pressure on the order in which especially ion channels are being expressed.

1049
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,960
I mean, that's true. There certainly are stereotypical patterns of expression. I

1050
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:39,760
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if the pressure is to produce the same thing that your parents were,

1051
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:46,640
or if it's to produce something that's successful. And, you know, like, I, I don't know.

1052
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,440
I mean, the fact that most animals do look like their parents implies that there's been selection

1053
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,960
pressure to produce the same thing, despite the huge potential scope for doing something completely

1054
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:05,360
different. They look like them under the same conditions. So, so people like the people who

1055
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:11,200
work in plants will tell you that depending on depending on the the way you where you plant

1056
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,720
that seed, you're going to get things that don't look anything like the like like the parents,

1057
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:21,280
right? And I think I think in animals, it's, you know, sort of less that. But yeah, I don't know.

1058
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,680
I don't know if the pressure is for consistency, or if the pressure is for some other kind of

1059
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:30,480
second order parameter, like if, if the environment is what we've seen before,

1060
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:36,720
don't do anything different, just do the exact same thing. But, but if circumstance does change,

1061
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:42,960
you've got all these other tools that you can deploy. We will have, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't,

1062
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,160
I don't like to talk about stuff that isn't published and peer reviewed, because then it's

1063
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:50,160
just, you know, me telling stories. But I think in the next six months or so, you're going to see

1064
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,840
a couple of, we're going to have a couple of papers come out that address this, this issue

1065
01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:00,720
that look at gene expression in xenobots compared to normal embryos. And xenobots made from other

1066
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:06,480
cells that are not frog and have nothing to do with frog embryos. I think the plasticity is,

1067
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:10,800
is enormous. I don't think we've been able to, we've even scratched the surface of all this.

1068
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:18,320
I mean, when we are thinking of plasticity, I always also admire this idea of ploidy, for

1069
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:24,720
example. So you mentioned that plenaria mix up mixed ploids, then there are, I mean, we can talk

1070
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:32,400
about plants itself, we know that they change their ploidy. So how much that has to do, or do

1071
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:39,520
you think that this can be also a factor? I don't know much about it, but, but, but I will tell

1072
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:47,840
you my favorite ploidy story that I think bears on this. So salamanders, you can, there's a little

1073
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,320
little tube that goes to the kidneys, the kidney tubule. If you take a cross section through

1074
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:57,040
this kidney tubule, what you see is typically eight or 10 cells working together to make this

1075
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:03,840
nice kidney tubule. Okay. If you can, if now one thing you can do is you can make these,

1076
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:08,960
you can make these nudes that are multiple ploidy. So you can make four n, six n, eight n nudes,

1077
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:13,760
right? So the first amazing thing is that you can, you can double or triple the amount of genetic

1078
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,240
material. I don't care. Fine. You still get the same nudes. So, so that's kind of, you know, all,

1079
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,960
that speaks to my same point is that it doesn't really assume. So, so embryogenesis does not

1080
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,440
assume how many copies of your genetic material you have. So that's the first thing. The second

1081
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:33,120
thing is as you increase the ploidy, the cells get physically bigger and bigger. Okay. Yes.

1082
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,080
When the cells get bigger and bigger, the salamander stays exactly the same. How can it be?

1083
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:42,480
Because fewer and fewer of the larger cells are being used to make the various organs.

1084
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:48,080
So you can't count on how many copies of the genes you have. You can't count on what how many,

1085
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,520
what your cell size is. If you're, if you're even a human embryo, we can cut you into four pieces

1086
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,960
and you get four quadruplets. You can't even count on how many cells you have. Now the ploidy

1087
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,600
story is, so you really, really just assume you have to, as a proper embryo, you have to assume

1088
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,680
you don't know much going in. Who knows what things are going to be like and you still have

1089
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:12,400
to be able to do the right thing. Now, now here's the ploidy, the rest of the ploidy story. So

1090
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:19,120
when you make eight n nudes, the cells get so enormous that there's not room for more than

1091
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:25,200
one cell to make a tubule. What do they do? A single cell bends around itself like this,

1092
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:30,880
leaving a hole in the middle, which, which gives you the tubule. Now that, okay. So, so the thing,

1093
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,920
the thing that's crazy about that is that now that's a completely different molecular mechanism

1094
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,840
instead of cell to cell communication, which you need to make the tubule, you are now using

1095
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:45,440
cytoskeletal bending to, to, to, to drag yourself into this crazy shape. So what I love, right?

1096
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,760
It's amazing. And so, so what I love about this is that it's a good example of top down causation,

1097
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:56,560
meaning that what you've got is in the service of this anatomical feature, different molecular

1098
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,600
mechanisms get called up and we're seeing something like this in some of our not yet published stuff

1099
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:07,840
in, in, in the Xenobots too, different molecular mechanisms get called up to do their thing to

1100
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:15,280
achieve this, this sort of higher level outcome. So, you know, that's, so I think, yeah, I think

1101
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:19,520
ploidy is, is a, is a fantastic example of this. Because if you can't count, if you can't, if you

1102
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,440
don't assume how many copies of your instructions you're going to have, you don't assume how big

1103
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:29,360
your cells are, you don't assume how many of them you have, you better have rock solid morphogenetic

1104
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,640
control to get the job done despite all of that. And, and salamanders do, which is why they're so

1105
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:38,320
regenerative, but they're not in the not as good as planaria, but they're pretty darn good. They

1106
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:44,800
regenerate all kinds of organs. So I mean, under, underpinning all of that, this cell volume

1107
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:52,480
and, and, and ploidy, it's not just ploidy, it's, it's genome is the total amount of DNA in the

1108
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:58,720
nucleus. So it's the nuclear volume. There is a very tight correlation between nuclear volumes

1109
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:05,520
and cell volume, which used to be known as the C value paradox, which is to say the cells,

1110
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:11,840
mostly amoeba have some enormous genomes, you know, thousands of times larger than the human genome.

1111
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,680
Why it's, you know, this whole idea of junk DNA, what are they putting in there?

1112
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:22,960
A large amount of it is that you have a large cell, you have a large nucleus and you fill that

1113
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,760
nucleus with DNA and ploidy forces you to have a larger, higher ploidy forces you to have a larger

1114
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,840
nucleus, which forces you to have a larger cell. And that forces you to be resourceful in terms of

1115
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:37,600
you want to make a tube, you do it from a single cell instead of 14 cells or what it used to be.

1116
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:44,560
So there's, and I don't think there's ever been a good explanation for why a large cell would

1117
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:53,360
have a large nucleus. There, there are ideas out there. But they often relate to the ratio

1118
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:58,720
between the number of ribosomes and the number of nuclear pore complexes and this kind of thing.

1119
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:04,480
None of them are particularly persuasive. I don't think we have a good explanation for why a large

1120
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:09,280
cell should have a large nucleus. And yet it's able to force all of these changes on you.

1121
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:17,760
Yeah, so since we are running out of time, I mean, maybe I can throw in like one last topic and

1122
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,920
probably, I believe that probably both of you would kind of like to discuss about it.

1123
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:31,040
So, so when you mentioned about neurotransmitters, which is like one level down kind of regulation,

1124
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:37,600
let's talk about anesthesia, because I think that's also something which is one level down,

1125
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:45,360
regulates it, I don't know how much of the work is done on some sort of, you know, simpler scales.

1126
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:52,640
But okay, I mean, let's, well, you can anesthetize single cells, critters,

1127
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:58,560
planaria and things like that. Yeah. I mean, I discussed in the last chapter of the book,

1128
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:04,560
some of the work from Luca Turin, showing, showing that anesthetics

1129
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:11,360
affects electron transfer to oxygen. And we've been doing some work on that just recently.

1130
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,400
We've not published any of it yet. We've not gone very far at all. So I won't say much,

1131
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:20,960
but we've basically, we also find that it's lower oxygen rate of consumption of oxygen.

1132
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:28,720
And, and depending on the context in which you give them affects the membrane potential.

1133
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:38,160
Now, to try and distinguish between just the mitochondria making ATP and that ATP being used

1134
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:44,480
to control the plasma membrane, iron pump, for example, and ATP is in the membrane.

1135
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,520
Obviously, if you don't have as much ATP, that pump is not going to work as well. And so,

1136
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,040
you know, this is not a causal link between mitochondrial function and consciousness.

1137
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:57,680
All it says is that underpinning this energy consuming process, which is consciousness,

1138
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,280
energy matters, which is a statement of the obvious, I suppose. But there's also a possibility

1139
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:11,920
that there are direct fields involved that you're influencing the electromagnetic fields

1140
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,680
generated potentially by mitochondria. And then there can be direct interactions with

1141
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:21,760
the plasma membrane field that way. That's a much more exciting possibility to my mind.

1142
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:29,760
But very, very difficult to distinguish between how do you change the field in the measurable

1143
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,440
way while maintaining ATP synthesis at the same level, which is a tricky thing,

1144
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:39,760
a tricky mechanistic thing to do. But we're trying to get at that. I mean, I think this is,

1145
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:47,280
this is perhaps one of the one of the biggest questions in science now is what actually

1146
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:53,680
is going on in the in the wiring of consciousness, if you like, and I'm certain fields are involved.

1147
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,440
But but how exactly I'm not so sure.

1148
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:05,200
Yeah, so it's really interesting. You might enjoy, I've got this, this book from this guy,

1149
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:13,040
JC Bose, B-O-S-E. And I can send you a PDF of it. He's an Indian guy from over 100 years ago that

1150
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:18,640
was doing a bunch of physiology and he, and he started anesthetizing animal tissues and using

1151
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:23,600
electrophysiology to monitor what happens. And then he did the plants, right? And then eventually,

1152
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:29,040
a metal bar. So, so he's got this, he's got this book called response in the living and non-living,

1153
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:34,160
where, you know, maybe so, so, so I don't know the mechanisms that underlie any of that. But,

1154
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:39,120
but there could be, if it's, if it's, if it's the kind of thing you're talking about, I could easily

1155
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:44,480
see why he would be seeing effects like this in in in organic substrates as well.

1156
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:53,200
Yeah, I tend to draw a line at life, which is to say what I was talking about at the beginning

1157
01:52:53,200 --> 01:53:00,960
about bacteria using the, the, the fields on the membrane as a means of integrating the metabolism

1158
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:07,120
of the cell. And I would see then the central nervous system as some kind of an amplification and

1159
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:14,080
formal subtle and complex, of course, but, but, but, but still somehow linked to the

1160
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:20,640
integration of information through, through linking your metabolic state at a cellular level,

1161
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:27,600
and then at a network level and so on. Whether you need fields to be involved in that, I don't know,

1162
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:33,120
but we can measure changes in the EEG. And I don't think we have an absolutely clear idea of

1163
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:38,880
exactly what is generating the EEG at a subcellular level. Is it, is it just a plasma membrane,

1164
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,840
the axonal membranes that are depolarizing or mitochondria playing a role in that as well.

1165
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,600
So that's an area I'm fascinated by, but it's difficult to get at.

1166
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:58,080
Yeah, so in the, like, I think, if we think of the same about the same topic,

1167
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,040
interesting thing is so about the synthetic cells or synthetic life in general, like all the work

1168
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:10,560
which is going on there, I mean, from the engineering perspective, right? That's also

1169
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:19,760
kind of kind of let's say crucial in a way, or it is focused on the information centric view,

1170
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:26,000
right? Like people are trying to put together again, some sort of genomes, some sort of genes,

1171
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,320
transcription, translation, of course, they have membrane in. But my question, or maybe briefly,

1172
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:39,280
if you can just explain your view, so how important would be this kind of bioelectric or

1173
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:44,800
kind of this software that we have discussed today for to create those kind of synthetic systems?

1174
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:52,800
Maybe one word answer, all all importance. I don't think you're going to do it without

1175
01:54:52,800 --> 01:55:04,000
100. Yeah, 100. Like, how or is it possible to kind of, you know, I don't know, do it without

1176
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:11,840
the information part without the hardware? I think you can only go so far without genes at all.

1177
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,520
How far? I don't know. I mean, you know, the plenarium is a very good example there. You can

1178
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:22,160
you can stramble your genome, but presumably you can't completely collapse your genome.

1179
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:29,760
When I think about it the other way up with the origin of life, how do, where does information

1180
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:36,640
come from in biology? And I'm fairly persuaded now from our own experiments, but other people's

1181
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:43,120
work around the world as well in the last five, six, seven years, a lot of a lot of metabolism

1182
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,400
is spontaneously self-organizing. You start with CO2 and hydrogen and you get Krebs cycle

1183
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:53,440
intermediates, you get amino acids, the same ones that we we have in metabolism. You get

1184
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:58,720
nucleotides that way as well. We've not done them all yet, but we've done some and other people

1185
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:04,480
have done others. And, you know, this idea then of a spontaneously self-organizing metabolism

1186
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,640
that starts with CO2 and hydrogen and gives you all the monomers and eventually polymers.

1187
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,880
By no means is any of this proved, but five or six years ago it would have been complete

1188
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:23,600
hand-waving and now there's some experimental backing for quite a lot of it. And you think,

1189
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:29,600
okay, well, it's going to make trace amounts of things like nucleotides. How can it reliably

1190
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:34,320
make more nucleotides and get better at making copies of itself in the absence of genes or any

1191
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:40,880
information? And the answer is, well, positive feedback loops will allow you to kind of feed off

1192
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,640
the environment and off yourself to get better at making copies of yourself, but you're only ever

1193
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:49,360
going to do, you're going to keep repeating the same network under the same conditions.

1194
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:52,560
If you change the conditions, you might get a different network. It may or may not function,

1195
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,720
but under this set of conditions, you will keep recovering that same network

1196
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,760
until you introduce genes and information into it. And you can enter into that world,

1197
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:08,480
you can introduce random sequences of RNA and they will have directly or indirectly some effect

1198
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:12,880
on the rates of cell growth and flux of metabolism. Even just introducing a piece of RNA is actually

1199
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,400
going to change the metabolic rate because you're now polymerizing nucleotides. So you're pulling

1200
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:21,600
nucleotides out of solution and you pull metabolism through faster. So even making a completely random

1201
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:26,640
piece of RNA makes you better at doing what you were doing before than if you hadn't done that.

1202
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:32,560
So there's this kind of interesting insights into what is information in biology? Where is it

1203
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:41,280
coming from? And what it seems to be allowing is effectively plasticity, which is to say you've

1204
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:47,360
got this hardwired proto metabolism, which is basically thermodynamics and kinetics. And it's,

1205
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:52,640
you know, you will go on recovering exactly the same thing. What genes allow you to do is just

1206
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:58,800
change it a bit and allow a different outcome. And that outcome can be reliably inherited.

1207
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,320
And by the time we're getting into networks of cells, then it's interesting because what I'm

1208
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:09,840
taking from what Mike has been saying is that the genes are becoming almost buried again. And

1209
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:15,600
it's the network of the cells which are generating higher level properties, which are forcing them

1210
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:20,000
to behave in a similar way in a similar setting and a potentially completely different way

1211
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:26,800
in a different setting. So there's this interplay all along between the kind of the hard wiring and

1212
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,400
the plasticity and the information, which means different things in different contexts,

1213
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:38,720
but allows the plasticity really. Yeah, so that's fascinating. And so with that, thank you so much

1214
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:44,400
guys. Thank you for doing this. This was completely fun. I mean, I think the kind of ideas that we

1215
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,880
have explored, it was amazing. So thank you so much. Thanks very much. Yeah, thanks for doing this.

1216
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:54,960
Yes, thank you. That's been great fun. Yes, thank you. Talk soon everybody. Bye now.
