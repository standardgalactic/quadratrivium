Checking The Spectator/Peter Boghossian： how the Academy got woke and why the 'New Atheists' are to blame ｜ SpectatorTV.txt
 In this conversation, Peter Boghosian discusses the importance of integrity and believing true things in every realm, emphasizing that individuals cannot compromise their beliefs for societal smoothness or personal gain. He believes that maintaining one's integrity is crucial, even if it means challenging deeply held societal beliefs or metaphysical concepts. He also talks about his nonprofit organization, National Progress Alliance, which promotes free speech, civil discourse, and fights against what he perceives as destructive woke ideology. The organization operates with a small team of full-time and part-time employees and is entirely donor-funded. They produce YouTube videos, give talks, and educate institutions on how to avoid the negative impacts of wokeism. Boghosian shares that his work is inspired by overcoming past challenges, like his experience at Point State University, and aims to contribute positively to society, as guided by his father's advice to leave the world better than he found it. The conversation also touches on the balance between holding true beliefs and engaging in civil discourse, and the role of community and dedication in achieving impactful change.
