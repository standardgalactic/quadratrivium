1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,400
Okay, well, thank you all for coming. I'm John Dupre, as it says on the board. I'm

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,040
physically here from the University of Exeter. So, let me start off with a very kind of general

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,200
comment about the kind of thing that I'm doing. Actually, as a sort of background, a lot of

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,120
people I work with call themselves nowadays philosophers of science in practice, which

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,400
sometimes means philosophers of science in practice, and sometimes means philosophers

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,000
of science in practice. But either way, people are supposed to be doing something relevant,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,400
connected to science. And I have to say, some of my colleagues sometimes will say, metaphysics,

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,400
what's that? Why do we care about that? I thought we're supposed to be concerned with

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,400
science and engage with science. Well, so I would just start off by saying that I think

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,240
there are many reasons in my mind for being concerned with very general, very abstract

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,160
accounts of what we're talking about when or what indeed science is talking about. And

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,280
so I'm interested as a philosopher of biology, which is my sort of primary job description,

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,560
giving or offering at least a very general account of living things. And I think that

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:38,040
this is really important for biology, that this is in my way of doing things, it's supposed

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,840
to be what we sometimes call a naturalistic account. That's to say, a metaphysics grounded

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,840
in the science, but also one that feeds back into the science. So we look at, we try and

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,520
find out what the world looks like from the point of view of the best science we're currently

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,680
doing. And then we might ask whether some bits of science need to pay more attention or perhaps

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,680
are using a kind of an outdated or not very defensible view of their subject matter. And

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,880
we could perhaps set them back onto the path of truth and goodness and beauty. And I guess

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,280
another, you know, apart from all that, as this quote from a much maligned 20th century

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,080
philosophy of biology, Joseph Henry Woodyer says, you can't avoid it. You can't do science

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,000
without a general picture of what you're talking about. And the general picture of what you're

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,680
talking about is what I call metaphysics. Okay. So, so I think there is a constant interaction

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,600
between metaphysics, ontology, what there is, what exists, and empirical science. Okay.

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,560
So let me just start off with a very brief bit of history. The topic I'm talking about is a

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,000
really ancient one that goes back to the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers at least. And here are two

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,600
kind of archetypal figures from that period. Parmenides, who is famous for saying change is

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,800
an illusion. There is everything is just what it is, and stays that way. And, you know, we kind of

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,680
from our very limited perspective, see all kinds of things happening. But really, you know, from,

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,160
from a broader point of view, there is just the way things are. The complete opposite view perhaps

32
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,800
was expressed by famously by Heraclitus, the sort of patron saint of process philosophers who said

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,200
something like, nothing endures but change. There is only change. And this is, I guess, you

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,880
will realize the view that I think at least some version of which I would like to commend to you.

35
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:03,560
Now, of course, I just say change is an illusion is probably not a very fair, you know, certainly

36
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,520
for a philosopher of science in practice is not a very fair characterization of the alternative to

37
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:19,600
process metaphysics. So, perhaps we should go rather to Democritus, who allegedly said, nothing

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,520
except exists, except atoms and empty space. Everything else is opinion. So, why is this,

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:35,680
this is, is close to the Parmenidian view, because all the really is, is a lot of atoms. And the

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,520
atoms are defined as being unchanging. Nothing happens to them. The only thing that changes is

41
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,160
their relation to one another. That's to say, you know, the atoms move around, and then they come

42
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,280
together and form you and me for a, for a tiny instant in eternity. But they don't really change.

43
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,800
All that changes is, is their relations to one another. Okay, so moving on, a millennium and a

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,520
half or so, we come to sort of dawn of Western science. And my basic message is, Parmenides,

45
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,240
or at least Democritus, won. And, and we have, and he sort of quotes from, I know I got these

46
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,600
separated from Robert Boyle, one of the better known scientists of that, of the scientific

47
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,960
revolution. The naturalist in explaining particular phenomena considers only the size, shape, motion,

48
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,240
or want of it, texture, and the resulting qualities and attributes of the small particles of matter.

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,880
Basically, something very close to the Democritian view. They really are just atoms moving around,

50
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,160
when we want to understand the things that seem to change, the sort of complex structures we

51
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,080
encounter, we really just need to find out what the atoms are doing, how they stick together,

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,720
perhaps they nudge one another, and things like that. But, but the things that we encounter at

53
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:08,560
our kind of spatial and temporal scales are, in some sense, not really real. So what I want to

54
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:17,120
say in this talk is that Parmenides' victory was a very disastrous one for the future study of

55
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,440
biology, because it's much better to think of the living world in the Heraclitian view as composed

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,680
of processes change, as always dynamic, and in no way should we think in terms of the kind of

57
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,920
Parmenidaean, basically there's just atoms moving around in the void way of seeing things.

58
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay, so that's about it for history. So what am I going to do in this talk, moving into the

59
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,480
future? So the talk is that all living beings are processes, rather than substances, this is kind

60
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,160
of rather technical term in, in the history of philosophy, that I shall avoid on the whole. And

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,920
I just tend to talk about things. Now, of course, there's no really good word that, you know,

62
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,600
that's why we have technical words like substance, but I'll say a bit what I mean by thing. So I mean,

63
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,240
don't, don't just take it absolutely as any interpretation you might have of thing. And I

64
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,760
shall use this to contrast with processes, and I'll explain this more. So, so I'll say I start off

65
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,240
with saying about something about this difference. And then I'll talk about why I think organisms as

66
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,720
one kind of paradigmatic example should be thought of as processes and not as things. I should mention

67
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,920
in passing, I just probably mentioned this again. I am actually very strongly drawn to the view that

68
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,600
it's processes all the way down, that, you know, the even down to, you know, subatomic physics,

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,160
it's all processes. But I'm not, I don't feel comfortable defending that view. I mean, it obviously

70
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,280
would take one into some fairly technical bits of physics. I'm pretty comfortable down to the level

71
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:15,200
of macromolecules. But if you want to go down to, you know, quarks and things and, you know, some,

72
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,720
and you have physical, physical expertise as a physicist, which tells you the quarks really are

73
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,240
atoms as democratists might have thought of them. I won't argue with you, though I could if I really

74
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,440
had to wheel up a few physicists or at least philosophers of physics who would disagree,

75
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
but, but that's not my. So if you want to take this, this is, this is really a talk

76
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,320
arguing that life, living things are all living things. It's very hard to avoid the word, which

77
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:57,200
tells you something that living beings, living systems are processes and not things. And I'll talk

78
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,880
after talking about organisms, I'll talk more briefly about how we might incorporate some other

79
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,080
levels of biological organization and form a general, might we say, metaphysics of life.

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,840
And then at the end, I will just say a few things rather briefly about why this matters. Some of

81
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:24,320
them I'll say a bit more about in further lectures this week. Okay. So first of all, things and

82
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,920
processes. Okay. So what's a thing? So I think this is, this is the philosophical

83
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,920
orthodoxy that the world is made up of things. They are, and they're things specific with properties

84
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,840
we have. And that, that's, I say, as a kind of basis for a great deal of contemporary philosophy,

85
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,440
the world, there are these things in the world and they have various properties.

86
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:59,360
Particularly, they have, and this, this is, of course, is, is another big area that I won't go

87
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,760
into a great detail. But one kind of properties that's very important in, in this metaphysical

88
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,440
tradition are essential properties, the properties that make the thing a particular thing, either

89
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,960
a particular kind of thing, or the very specific particular thing it is. And, and there are reasons

90
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:28,880
why it's quite hard to make sense of a ontology of things without appealing to some kind of

91
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,520
essential properties. But again, I won't, I'm happy to talk about this later, but I won't say

92
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,720
much more about that now. Things are autonomous. And this, I think, is something that is really

93
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,920
very important to the tradition of thinking about things. If you have a thing, it could be the only

94
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,800
thing in the universe, right? I mean, it's, it doesn't depend on anything else for its existence,

95
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,120
or for its relations to anything else for its existence. Now, of course, there are maybe some

96
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
things that contingently do for reasons of, you know, for kind of for, for specific reasons, a

97
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,880
thing of that kind wouldn't actually continue to exist if it didn't, wasn't related to something

98
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,040
else. But in general, the interesting things, the most important things that we're going to talk

99
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,280
about and, and, and assume in our philosophy of things are things that are autonomous in that

100
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,760
sense. And finally, a thing has reasonably clear boundaries. Now, of course, you know, as always,

101
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,880
one can have a bit of fuzziness, but not too much fuzziness. I mean, there's, we really ought to be

102
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,280
able to, to see where, roughly where it begins and ends. And this is actually important for one, for,

103
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,480
for another reason that a lot of, of, of the discussion of why we should think about things

104
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,720
has to do with counting. We want to know how many things there are. And to be able to divide the

105
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,400
world into a definite number of things requires that we know roughly where one ends and the next

106
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,680
one begins. Okay. And, and I guess I've actually rather oddly arranged because I've gone back to

107
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
essential properties. I'm sorry about that in the slide. I don't know quite what I was thinking.

108
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,040
But when I say other properties, what I mean is essential, non essential properties can change.

109
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,280
And, but crucially, when other properties of things change, we typically want an explanation,

110
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,480
because the default for a thing is to stay the same. And I think this is a very important point

111
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,840
for understanding what attracts the interest of scientists. They tend to be interested in

112
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,720
why things change, giving explanations of change, typically by giving causes of change.

113
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,880
Okay. So the default state of a thing is stasis. Now I've got to, you know, here are some examples of

114
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:02,720
what we classically think of things. As I said, in, in my true view of the world, these are all

115
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,480
probably processes too. But, but I'm not going to argue that today. So I'm going to take, you know,

116
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,760
these very, you know, a bit of furniture is very thing like it certainly has clear boundaries,

117
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,640
doesn't seem to depend on anything else, and so on. Okay. So the question, of course, is whether,

118
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:30,320
you know, maybe this is a, is a thing. And I guess in, in traditional philosophical thought,

119
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,400
this is a standard, certainly in, if one use the technical word substance, this is a paradigm

120
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,440
example of a substance. And I think it's tends to be thought of in a thing like way. So what about

121
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,400
a process for a process philosophy? Being is dynamic. Everything is changing all the time.

122
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,560
And what we thought of as things, certainly the biological things are, as I like to say, and

123
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,800
not not the only process philosopher who has had this kind of paradigm for this eddies.

124
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Things are eddies in a flux of process, which would think of the world as at its most fundamental

125
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:21,040
level, just stuff happening. But somehow, and that's the great challenge to understand the world,

126
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,400
somehow out of this flux emerge structures that have more or less stability, never complete

127
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:37,280
stability. And the stability they have is maintained always by changes by things happening. And

128
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,840
my kind of definition here of a process is for it to continue to exist for a process to carry on,

129
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,000
it has to change, things have to happen. So here's one of my favorite paradigms is I had to

130
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,680
actually, Jupiter was one of my examples of a thing. Here we have the red spot on Jupiter,

131
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,560
which you might have thought was, you know, an island or some kind of, but actually, what we

132
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:10,720
know is that it is a storm, essentially. It's a storm maintained by winds, very high velocity

133
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,120
winds. And the reason I like this example is ever since we've had telescopes big enough to see it,

134
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,720
the red spot has been there on Jupiter. It changes its shape, you know, but that's about 400 years,

135
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,320
I think, that we've observed this entity, which as I say, looks from a distance. You might be

136
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,440
a thing, but it's actually a process. If it stopped, if the wind stopped flowing around it,

137
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,800
if the activity stopped, it would rapidly dissipate. And then here's some more

138
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,200
typical kind of examples of processes. A river, which I guess was Heraclitus, most famous example,

139
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,120
you probably all heard the saying from Heraclitus, which I won't try and discuss, though again,

140
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
we could bring it up that you can never step into the same river twice. He didn't actually quite

141
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,680
say that, or nobody knows what he quite said, but he probably didn't. Nobody actually thinks he

142
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,320
quite said that and so on, but that's what he's the most famous for. And then, of course, finally,

143
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,520
we move on to the most un-thing-like processes. I have an example of a battle, which clearly,

144
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,080
if everybody stops fighting, there's no more battle, right? So this is a very clearly fits

145
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,720
this definition. And again, of course, we can ask whether these paradigmatic organisms are

146
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,680
processes, which of course is my thesis. So just to summarize, we have a conception of a thing

147
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,720
as integrated. I didn't actually talk about that, but I guess it's almost implicit. It's always so

148
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,680
obvious to say things and perhaps follows from the boundaries. Independent, not dependent on,

149
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,760
for its existence, on anything else, stable by default and has definite boundaries. Now,

150
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,920
none of these is necessary or even typical for processes. Processes persist through activity,

151
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:14,960
i.e. they are not stable by default. And this is the strongest contest I make as against things

152
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,200
for which the default condition is stasis. And again, this is something I think has

153
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,920
some real practical implications for how we should think about some scientific problems.

154
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,160
So just a quote from one of the, well, actually two mentioned here of the most prominent contemporary

155
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,160
defendants of Processed Philosopher, Nicholas Rescher. And then the Stanford Encyclopedia,

156
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,880
his article was updated by Nicholas Rescher, by John Assyk. As process ontologists see it,

157
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,160
enduring things are never more than patterns of stability in a sea of process. So that's really

158
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,560
the thesis. And by process, I understand again, something, and I often notice the embarrassment

159
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,800
that in English, one can't help saying something, anything, everything, all the time when one's

160
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:15,120
trying to say there are no things. So please forgive this linguistic annoyance. Some entity,

161
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,320
which just doesn't work in English, for which change or activity is necessary for it to continue

162
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:29,200
to be the kind of entity it is. Okay. So one last sort of preliminary note, many people will

163
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,360
associate Processed Philosophy with Alfred North Whitehead, who is certainly the most famous

164
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,440
recent advocate of Processed Philosophy. And I certainly don't want to demean the contributions

165
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:54,080
of Whitehead, which were many including this. But I really want to bypass Whitehead in my work

166
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:02,240
for a couple of reasons. One is he is notoriously difficult to understand, possibly obscure. He

167
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,320
also has some views tied in with his Processed Philosophy that I don't want to endorse. I mean,

168
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,840
I guess panpsychism, maybe sometimes I feel a little tiny pull in that direction, but it's

169
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:25,440
fairly small. I'm not comfortable with it, certainly, or theology, which again, as I suppose, is

170
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,880
quite widely associated with Processed Theology, but with Processed Philosophy, but not in my

171
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,640
view of the world. And I guess finally, to be rather mean to Whitehead, I don't really think he's

172
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,520
a Processed Philosopher. And that's because I think he has an atomistic view of processes.

173
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:56,720
So any of you here who are Whitehead aficionados, he has little things called occasions, actual

174
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:05,520
occasions, things which look to me a bit like unchanging atoms which make up the processes.

175
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,280
And I don't think we need or want such things. Anyhow, again, no disrespect to an important

176
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,040
contributor, but I find it easier to reinvent wheels sometimes than try and figure out where the

177
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:29,680
wheel is underneath all the mud in a very overused kind of vest. This has gone much too far. Okay,

178
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:38,720
right. So organisms and why organisms are processes. So I think there are three reasons

179
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,520
for thinking organisms are process, each of which is sufficient. And together, we really,

180
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,760
really shouldn't have any debate about this. So first of all, organisms, we all know,

181
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,760
are dynamically stabilized. They are systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, right? That's

182
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,640
it's, you know, one of the puzzles for understanding life has always been

183
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:09,280
how something so thermodynamically improbable stays around. And of course, we know the answer to this

184
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,960
is through, I mean, in outline, there's a constant turnover of matter, organisms take in

185
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,600
matter and energy, and they process it, and they process it to maintain their structures and their

186
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:30,800
functions. And so it's the very nature of such a system, far from thermodynamic equilibrium,

187
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:39,040
that it's doing stuff to maintain itself as what it is. Second, organisms have life cycles.

188
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,800
They, they are not even apparently constant structures. In fact, they have a sequence

189
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:53,680
of different stages, sometimes quite dramatically different from one another. And third, and this

190
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:01,680
is, I think, is actually the thing that, that the aspect that really led me into process thinking

191
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,440
was realizing the omnipresence of symbiosis, and that actually organisms stabilize themselves,

192
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,920
not merely by what they do, their own taking in energy and processing it, but through their

193
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,520
relations to many other organisms, cooperative relations, which I guess, you know, we mostly,

194
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,560
we know, perhaps best through what we've all learned recently about our gut,

195
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,040
microbiomes, but of course we have lots of other organisms we're related to in many other

196
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,640
different ways. And I'll say more about all of these. So, so let me just go through these quickly,

197
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,200
not much really to say more about this. Organisms are thermodynamically open systems,

198
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,000
far from equilibrium, and this implies that they are not independent, they require constant input

199
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,200
from the environment, type of the, nor stable by default. I, if an organism doesn't do anything,

200
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,680
I mean, if nothing happens, you know, there's trillions of things happening inside all of us,

201
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,000
and every second, if those stop happening, we cease, we become dead organisms, and if we stop

202
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,600
taking in matter from the environment, we also more slowly become dead organisms. In fact,

203
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,240
if you count oxygen, we quite quickly become dead organisms. So, it's, it's, they're certainly not,

204
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,520
you know, independent autonomous entities. Secondly, they are developmental processes,

205
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,240
and I just give an example, which will all be quite familiar, possibly not the

206
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,400
wonderful sea creature, I don't know what that is, Medusa, on the bottom, there are some sea

207
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,360
creatures just have wonderful life cycles. But my point is that properties change dramatically

208
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,720
over the life cycle. They were all very used to the idea that the egg and the caterpillar and the

209
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,680
pupa and the adult are the same organism, but if we were trying to understand how that could be

210
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,800
the same thing, and there could be some essential property that said this is some same

211
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:16,000
entity going through all these drastic changes, it's quite a struggle. And I don't know if I might

212
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:23,280
go to this later, but people sometimes think we may be answered to that with the genome,

213
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,320
happy to talk about this, but just let me, just two things, genomes are highly dynamic,

214
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,560
of course, but also there are lots of genomes in an organism, and they're not all the same by any

215
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,360
means, and for various reasons. So, I could, I can certainly talk more about that if anybody

216
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,480
would like to become a genome essentialist and defend the, that is a way of saying an organism

217
00:24:50,480 --> 00:25:00,400
is a thing at least against this objection. So, organisms don't persist by default, but as quite

218
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,080
often happens for process, they persist, well, sorry, as always happens for organisms, they persist

219
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,960
by some kind of causal continuity, but this is consistent with going through drastically

220
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,640
different stages. And somebody in the seminar this morning brought up the example of a party

221
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,760
as a process where parties can be lively at one point, and then most people can leave, and they

222
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,040
can be really desultory, and nobody's really saying anything, and nobody thinks the party is

223
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,600
absolutely ended because it stops being lively, or people stop dancing. We're used to the idea

224
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,960
that processes can go through changes. These are rather more dramatic changes, perhaps, I mean,

225
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:48,480
from a, from a pupa to an adult insect is about as dramatic a change as you could easily imagine,

226
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,760
and yet we have no trouble in the idea that just the causal continuity of the process

227
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:04,000
leads us to say that this is still the same organism. Finally, symbiosis, and I just got some,

228
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:13,120
you know, a few randomly selected illustrations here, but, you know, the basic point is that we

229
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,440
now think pretty much all organisms, you know, there are some, some sort of a few things floating

230
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,880
around in the oceans that maybe don't have much to do with anything else, but on the whole organisms

231
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:35,920
are symbiotic. The famous one that, you know, has heard of humans, and there's a debate whether,

232
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,760
you know, something between 50 and 90 percent of the cells in a human body are not what we

233
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:51,840
used to call human cells, they're microbial cells. Trees have amazingly complex, or plants generally,

234
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,640
relations to bacteria and fungi, there are whole these amazingly complex systems that interact

235
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,000
with the roots, the fungi actually kind of live inside the roots and then through and out into,

236
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,160
send their hyphae out into the surrounding soil where they interact with consortia of bacteria,

237
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,520
all processing the materials going in and out, and indeed, as now quite famously, passing material

238
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,040
down the hyphae networks to other plants in their vicinity, sometimes plants of different species,

239
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:35,840
so the degree of interconnectedness in complex botanical systems is stunning, and I guess, you

240
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,000
know, we often see the mushrooms that come out of these systems, but if we once thought that they

241
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,400
were kind of independent autonomous organisms, now realizing their very complex, intimate relations

242
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,720
to the plants, they live around, see something quite different, and I don't think I'll go into the

243
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:03,440
insects, that's another nice system that's been much studied, so autonomous is not a word that

244
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,600
really applies well to any organ, or any but a very small minority at any rate of organisms.

245
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Okay, and so I just, you know, I like this a lot, so I just give one example,

246
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,400
which leads to a thesis that I like to kind of use to illustrate the significance,

247
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,400
in one significance of this process, your perspective. So here's one of the most successful

248
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,720
organisms in a typical forest environment, leaf cutter ants, I won't go too much into the biology,

249
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
but you can see here's a picture of them carrying off little bits of leaf

250
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,600
into their colonies, where they go various different casts, some carry the leaves,

251
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,800
some defend the colony, some look after the insides of the colony in various different ways,

252
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:05,120
but more interestingly, inside the colonies there are things that you can think of as the stomach

253
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,000
of the whole system, whether leaves are processed by specialist fungi, actually by specialist fungi,

254
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:19,680
and that depend themselves on consortia of bacteria, there are different consortia in other

255
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:27,600
parts of the system, and it turns out actually that I mentioned insects and some of their

256
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,960
obligate symbionts while back here are very well known when they actually also involved in

257
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:43,360
these ants, and kind of rather interestingly in some cases the while back here determine the sex

258
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,240
of the ants, so if you're looking for some organisms that's running the system since it's

259
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,960
really quite important, which what the sex of the ants are, and the cast of the ants, it may be the

260
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,360
while back here that are really running it as little micro reduced bacterial symbionts inside

261
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,000
the ants, I don't think anybody has studied the role of viruses, but almost certainly viruses

262
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,240
are involved, I think they're involved in pretty much any system, I'm not sure if I can mention

263
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,200
that further today, and so what I want to say is there's lots of ways you could sort out an organism

264
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,200
here, people will often say the colony is a super organism, sort of technical term, but it's a

265
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:35,120
very well integrated whole, the individual ants look most like organisms, but people often say

266
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,000
well they're so far from autonomous, I mean most of them are not sexual, so they can't

267
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,480
reproduce themselves, but also they can't, I mean there's nothing they can do to survive on their own,

268
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,680
you might think of the fungal stomach as an organism, a just a specialized organism for

269
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,040
living inside ant colonies, because I mean it's nothing, it's not related by descent to the ants,

270
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,800
it's a collaboration that's come together over time, and so on, so I mean there are many ways

271
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,640
you can carve, and of course you know there are questions at each point whether you include the

272
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,480
obligate microbial symbionts as part of the organisms or not, there are many different ways

273
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:34,080
you could carve up this flow of biological activity into organisms, which I call this

274
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,760
thesis of promiscuous individualism, and I won't go into some of you may know I have a

275
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,360
somewhat similar system view, which I call promiscuous realism about kinds,

276
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,520
but basically this thesis is just organisms are abstracted from this flux for particular

277
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,040
reasons according to what you're interested in, why you're doing it. Okay so processes,

278
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,080
and I just want to say this is quite characteristic of a lot of processes, processes intertwine with

279
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,560
one another in quite complex ways and have quite indeterminate boundaries, this is quite natural

280
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:25,200
for processes, very hard to understand things as entangled in this sort of way with one another,

281
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,720
and I you know I come back to the sort of example famous from Heraclitus of the river,

282
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,000
and I think you know the way rivers keep constantly changing, merging, separating is actually

283
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,640
remarkably similar in some ways to the way organisms, particularly the evolutionary

284
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,480
flow of organisms, but also just the flow of organisms in a complex system like the ant colony

285
00:32:53,040 --> 00:33:01,600
can be thought of. Okay so biology is all process and another crucial thing to understand

286
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,680
is that this process has multiple timescales, so evolution I guess being the slowest timescale

287
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:15,680
which can be we can think of in terms of you know many millions of years, development which

288
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:26,320
can take from minutes to decades, and I guess something that maybe I should should say I hope

289
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,280
it's obvious in a sense it is the developmental system or cycle which is the the entity that evolves,

290
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,320
so you couldn't evolve just you know an ant caterpillar, I'm sorry a butterfly caterpillar,

291
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,080
you could what has evolved is the system, the caterpillar can't exist except as part of this

292
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:57,200
flow of process through the various stages. Metabolism at much faster rates is a great

293
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,320
number of processes that keep the parts of the system running, keeping them in

294
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:14,400
stable in non-thermal, far from thermal equilibrium at many different rates.

295
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:24,960
So all of the entities that one might think of in a hierarchy of biological systems are processes

296
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,320
at these various timescales and one of the really fascinating things in trying to get a

297
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,000
big picture of biology is understanding how these timescales interact, how the processes at these

298
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:47,360
different timescales build up or down to interconnect and maintain the stability of the whole flow.

299
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,720
So what is an organism? Now it's a horrible thing that I think I've never done before

300
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,080
which is that philosophers sometimes do is when they want to break up words into bits

301
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,280
put little subscripts on them, so I apologize but it just did seem it's a natural way of

302
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:14,960
doing it. One of the, so if you ask most biologists what they mean by an organism,

303
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,080
they will say something like I think what I said by organism, by organism sub one.

304
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,040
So there are bacteria which are single-celled organisms and then there are multicellular

305
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:34,160
organisms which typically or perhaps always come about from a starting cell which divides

306
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,480
multiple times, differentiates, the cells differentiate and we end up with a multicellular

307
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:49,920
organism. Basically all cells with roughly the same genetic constitution, I say roughly because

308
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,320
that's problematic. But when we actually look at the systems that I've been looking at we see

309
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:06,480
that actually these, a real organism moving around contains cells from many different sources

310
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,760
that combine to form a functional system or the one that really interacts with the rest of the

311
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,320
biological world. So I'll call this an organism two and as I say living systems typically involve

312
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:26,000
a complexly intertwined interaction between many distinct organisms one and this of course is

313
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,240
why defining the boundaries of organisms two which is I think is the most fundamental sense

314
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,360
is very difficult, undetermined and interest relative because you know that there are different

315
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:46,160
levels of interconnectedness between the various processes that interact but it is these very

316
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:54,240
roughly defined systems with somewhat indeterminate boundaries that I think what we mean when we

317
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,480
refer to organisms. When I you know point to a cow I don't mean as I say that's a cow I don't mean

318
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,240
apart from all the bacteria in its four stomachs. I mean the whole thing that walks around and

319
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:15,920
processes grass. So and this is actually something that I formulate in a particular way

320
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,960
as what an organism or what indeed a biological system is is the intersection between lineages

321
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,440
and the metabolic intersection of various biological lineages produces these stable

322
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,160
thing-like organisms and the stabilization you know facilitates of these processes in turn

323
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,040
facilitate the persistence of the lineage. I haven't really talked about that I'll get onto that a bit

324
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:50,160
later. So here's the sort of picture in the middle of the picture we have a traditional

325
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:58,000
kind of thing-like view of how I think it's still very common to think of the biological world

326
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,520
is a hierarchy of things that are put together to form bigger things so molecules making cells

327
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,120
cells making tissues organs so on. What I want to say is that these are actually all processes

328
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,240
processes synchronized between different time scales and crucially processes that

329
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,320
the synchronization is both from above and from below so the traditional picture that I'm arguing

330
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,080
against tends to be really bottom up the molecules explain how the cells work and then when you

331
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,560
know how the cells work you can put them together to form tissues and so on but I just you know

332
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,480
looking right in the middle and it was something like the heart we all know actually that of

333
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,400
course the heart has a physiology it's made of certain kinds of cells that you know oscillate

334
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,880
in certain kinds of ways but we also know that if the organism doesn't take its proper exercise and

335
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,960
eat its five portions of vegetables a day that it won't function very well so actually the persistence

336
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,040
of the organ depends entirely on its positioning within a more complex system that it's part of

337
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,680
and of course we could also say well the organisms would not persist if they were not

338
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:27,280
part of lineages that keep throwing them out and so on so all along I think that we should look at

339
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,800
not only the way the components at the lower level interact to get the behaviors of things

340
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,560
at the higher level but also the way the embedding in the higher level systems actually

341
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,640
helps to explain the properties of the components themselves okay so

342
00:39:50,560 --> 00:40:00,080
so I guess what I want to say is that that's basically it that that's my summary of of what

343
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,720
the difference between a thing and a process is and why organisms and in fact

344
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:18,080
everything along the the hierarchy of biological complexity is is really best seen as a process

345
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,840
I just want to now just say a few things about some implications that this has for

346
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:37,040
what we should how we should think about some quite significant problems the first one to say is

347
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:47,600
medicine it's I think extremely standard to think of medical medicine in relation to the organism

348
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,880
as a mechanism a mechanism that has you know the set of parts that interact with one another to

349
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:02,880
produce healthy existence and something gets broken right we have to figure so what we do is

350
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,800
first of all figure out what the broken part is and figure out how we're going to fix it and of

351
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,960
course you know sometimes that works very well if you break your leg and you can't walk we we

352
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,840
quite rightly think the best way forward is to try and get the leg to join together and restore

353
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,360
its structural integrity and then you could with luck walk again so it's not that there's nothing

354
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,880
nothing right about this it's just that it's I think a very limited perspective because I think

355
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,320
from a process perspective the the the central mission of medical research is rather to understand

356
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,680
the processes that stabilize human life cycles at these various time scales and develop interventions

357
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,680
that maintain fortify or of course sometimes restore these processes I remember years and years

358
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,200
ago somebody told me and it I don't know whether it's true or not and it didn't mean much apart

359
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,440
from being memorable at the time that in Chinese medicine you pay your doctor as long as you don't

360
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:19,920
get sick if you get sick then you stop paying your doctor that came back to me I just thought

361
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,840
that is quite wonderful that is exactly how medicine should work of course you know and I

362
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,000
guess you contrast it with you know the power the opposite paradigm which I guess I think lived in

363
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,400
the US American medicine is desperately trying to invent sicknesses so that you can be paid you

364
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:47,120
pay somebody to say you don't have them anymore I'm a bit simplistic I know but but it does seem

365
00:42:47,120 --> 00:43:00,240
to me that that if you if you accept the view that the default of a process is actually ceasing

366
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,160
to persist I mean that that process is persist by doing things then you shouldn't have this you know

367
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,360
that this is very different in its implications from the mechanistic view and I think my my my

368
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,160
favorite illustration I'm favorite I mean sounds if I love this stuff I mean I don't mean this you

369
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:29,520
know and I like it kind of way but I think the the the the illness that makes this clearest to me

370
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,880
is cancer so let me just say a little bit about this so when you think about human development

371
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:45,600
which is by which I don't just mean you know like zero to 15 I mean minus three quarters to

372
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:54,400
however long you live is a process of human development and as we we certainly know the

373
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,160
this process involves this constant and massive division differentiation and disposal of cells

374
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:10,640
right we you know the all through the life cycle we are cells dividing at various different rates

375
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,640
and at certain points differentiating so that we have different organs and and and so on and and

376
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,600
there's also we we we now know they're a process of time times at which cells are disposed of they've

377
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:33,920
outlived their usefulness now if you just try and imagine how exquisitely this process is timed

378
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:43,600
to enable a human to go through a life cycle if it goes wrong if this doesn't happen right a lot of

379
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,560
the things that go wrong are things we call cancer i.e cells are not being disposed of as they should

380
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,160
or cells are dividing when they shouldn't or cells are differentiating in ways that they're not

381
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,000
supposed to i don't have you ever seen some of these appalling cancers where you have little

382
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,960
bits of organs in a tumor um a little bit of yes one yeah yeah quite quite one seed never forgotten

383
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:18,480
but um yeah that's sort of thing feet and near here and a bit of yeah um but i mean it's it's

384
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,040
once yeah i think you you you get your mind around the the perfection of this process in a certain

385
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:32,160
way i mean obviously it's um there's much more to be said about that too um it's the amazing thing

386
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,360
is that most of the time we don't have you know seriously harmful cancers of course actually we

387
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,160
all we do have you know incipient cancers all the time um throughout our bodies but most of the time

388
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,920
we manage to suppress these and carry on through the normal life cycle um so cancer we should

389
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,400
assume as we of course now know is multi-causal there is no you know cause of cancer there are

390
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:09,040
countless things that make us more likely to um to to experience cancers um and the way this is

391
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,960
so i'd say the general problem is is to explain why we often don't get cancer rather than why

392
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,920
we sometimes do and how we maintain our developmental process on something i mean i'm

393
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,920
putting quotes because normal is such a terrible word in biology but on something that let's say a

394
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,960
healthy path um so and i think there are conclusions for this that that there is i don't think we're

395
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:43,200
going to find a cure for cancer i mean this seems like um this would just be extraordinarily improbable

396
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,840
because as if somehow after you know evolution has spent all these billions of years refining this

397
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,160
system we're suddenly going to say something okay but it's a bit unreliable here's something that's

398
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,760
going to make it 100 reliable that's not going to happen but um but there may be many cures for

399
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,680
many cancers which of course is rather the way we're going and i think it at least provides a

400
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,920
perspective that could help us think about this question in new ways um and i'm not a cancer

401
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:27,040
scientist so that i need throw that out as um a general optimistic view so um here's another one

402
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:35,760
that i've i've done a little bit more on two um viruses now viruses are for me a kind of paradigm

403
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,280
process if you hear people talking about viruses i think they often imagine that there are these

404
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,920
little things floating around the world that are viruses and you run into one or two or maybe a

405
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,120
bunch of them and um then they do something horrible to you well there's something true about that

406
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:01,440
there is a stage in the viral process which is the very inert stage the virion which is a little

407
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:10,640
thing that gets you know um churned out by a virus um reproducing in a host and can start the

408
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:18,720
process that that process in um some other organism but actually um if you follow the

409
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,600
life cycle of a virus the virion ceases to exist for the active part of the viral life cycle i

410
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:34,400
it goes into the cell all kinds of biochemistry happen you know the the the the the protein

411
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:43,760
manufacturing mechanisms get co-opted they make proteins for new viruses and eventually the cell

412
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,840
typically dissolves and a bunch of new virions comes out so the virions then don't do anything

413
00:48:51,840 --> 00:49:00,320
until they hit another suitable cell that they can they can infect so there is nothing that runs

414
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:07,360
through the life cycle of a virus even actually you know you might think that even the genomes

415
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:16,480
don't always do this they for example switch between dna and rna forms sometimes they sit

416
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,360
inside the host genome for periods when is that a virus if there's a little bit of the host genome

417
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,680
doing nothing that's just sitting there as dna which is waiting to turn into an rna virus at

418
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:38,640
some time in the i mean um at anyway it's um it's extremely um improbable to try and think of

419
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,720
of a thing undergoing changes there's a there's a thing like entity that then initiates a very

420
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,200
un-thing like process at the end of which is a bunch more thing like entities but the virus is

421
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:02,000
surely the whole life cycle not just the inert stage of its operation so i think instead we

422
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,280
should think rather of a flow of dna passing through organisms sometimes sticking um and actually

423
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:17,840
i think since i uh wrote this slide um and this is another one coming which is in which case i'm

424
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:24,240
sorry if i'm anticipating i don't think i um it turns out actually that that some some things that

425
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:33,760
i didn't know make this perspective actually even more appealing which is that it turns out actually

426
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:41,600
that the infecting virus very often isn't a single virion it's actually people talk about viral

427
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:49,760
clouds quasi species and a lot of times it turns out that the infectivity of a virus depends on

428
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:58,800
properties of the population of viruses by which you're infected and actually the variations

429
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:06,640
across the population are what um defeat the immune system in a very complex set of interactions

430
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:15,680
which has a huge evolutionary history um and and so actually i mean and and i guess this this may be

431
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,160
something that's kind of been a little puzzling if you have the sort of simple view of the virus

432
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,120
as you know one particle gets into your cell and then releases all these other virions you think one

433
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,280
one virus would be enough to get you sick one virion now sometimes in some cases that's true in

434
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:41,520
others as as we i think learned in covid um actually it's very important how large a dose you get

435
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:50,160
and that's actually to do with the probably the diversity within the population of viruses that

436
00:51:50,160 --> 00:52:00,320
infects you so actually the process of viruses interacting with hosts can often be a population

437
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,760
level phenomenon rather than an individual level phenomenon again something that's a much more

438
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,800
natural thought in terms of this flow picture i think than in terms of a thing with nasty properties

439
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:21,280
and i guess the final thing that i that i think is um you know it's now becoming increasingly clear

440
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:28,400
and again i think is um within this broader picture should be totally unsurprising

441
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:36,880
is that viruses mostly of course are harmless but actually many of them are probably functional

442
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:45,360
and essential and in fact maybe the outnumbering the cells in your body are the viruses that you

443
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:53,200
require for the function the stability of your system in particular one obvious way in this they

444
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,920
do this is by regulating the bacterial populations most of the viruses in your body are phages that's

445
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:09,040
to say viruses that um that um the hosts of which are bacteria and the numbers of phages in your

446
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,240
body makes it seem very likely that they have important roles in um stabilizing the different

447
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:23,360
the relations between the different sorts of organisms in your body i just lost the okay

448
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:33,120
okay so some conclusions um i think i'm argue that our thinking about life is actually hampered

449
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,960
by is grounding in the world view that since the scientific revolution has driven a great

450
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:49,360
deal of scientific thought basically a picture of things pushing pulling one another stuck together

451
00:53:49,360 --> 00:54:00,480
to form mechanisms machine like connections of these entities so life isn't you know like this

452
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,440
sort of put all the bits together and the machine starts to go it's this really hard one constantly

453
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:15,120
maintained moment of structure and stability that emerges somehow and of course it doesn't emerge

454
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,960
you know the moment you're born it's emerged over billions of years of evolution from this

455
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:30,800
surrounding ocean of broadly directionless activity and i think realizing this should give us a very

456
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:39,600
different view of many aspects of life and even of ourselves and that's what i will hope to convince

457
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:47,120
any of you who come back for more in the course of this week in the next and the rest of this series

458
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:54,800
of lectures but for now i just end with if you are interested in this here's a place to go and

459
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,960
find out more and i'm happy to do this because this is an open access book anybody can read

460
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,760
it and so i'm not trying to make money off royalties or anything that is sad sorry thing

461
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,640
state for an academic to be in if i were but um but this is um uh this is where to look

462
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,000
for more on many of these topics

463
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:32,240
right so i will um take questions i'm i'm i'm instructed to ask if you could make your

464
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:40,080
questions as short as you can because i've been asked to try and summarize them before answering

465
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:49,760
them and um so um yeah i saw you first and then yeah so thank you for the wonderful talk so um

466
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:58,720
i think i'd buy the picture when we're looking at biology and then the question is um how would the

467
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:12,240
dialectic with uh your non-process opponent go concerning other things and um uh and one way

468
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:19,280
to phrase that would be to say whether one could somehow eat some of what you get from process

469
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:28,400
philosophy within a thing ontology but with processes so he would be distorted on on the

470
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:36,080
t-shirt of that view uh so it would be organisms involve processes but they are not processes

471
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,280
as it were so they involve processes but they're not so you have this sort of thing view there

472
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,600
are various processes going on and you say these processes connected with the organisms

473
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,520
which is their thing and the difference between draw view and that view seems to be that you

474
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,800
identify the organism straight forward with the processes whereas this you get acknowledges that

475
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,400
you have multiple processes all these things that you don't talk about just resist the identification

476
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,080
we don't go into the reasons for why there's the resistance but um what would you say to this

477
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:17,440
um okay so i i i um i have some sympathy with that question and i guess the sympathy i have

478
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:27,920
is um that i can see why one might want to just introduce a new term right so so i think there's

479
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:36,240
that you know the things i contrast it with things substances really carry philosophical

480
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:44,640
baggage that has really been unhelpful in thinking about life so i want i want to suggest that

481
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,080
the reason that that that what unites this unhelpful baggage is its kind of statusism

482
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:00,880
the fact that it's it's doesn't adequately involve the fact that the the properties we're interested

483
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:12,160
in are outputs of all kinds of activity now you might say but now we've got um and i think

484
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:20,720
this is earlier today it's somewhat similar it is you might say well okay so so organisms

485
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,560
are very unlike traditional or or or many of don't share many of the properties that have

486
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,760
traditionally been paradigmatic of things substances in the philosophical tradition

487
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:41,280
but on the other hand they're not terribly like what we used to think of as processes i um your

488
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,880
example i showed was that i mentioned was the party or i had a picture of a battle um or when you

489
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:56,240
know or the erosion of a cliff or you know there there are sort of processes that um seem as if

490
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:07,520
they are necessarily happenings that happen to things so maybe we should have uh maybe we

491
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,960
should have the things but then of course if some of the things aren't at all like traditional things

492
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,760
maybe we don't want to say that we don't want to say the organisms are things we don't want to say

493
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,400
their process so maybe we can call them something else you know we can come up with a word for them

494
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:31,120
my personal feeling well for i guess for two reasons one is it's always a kind of uphill struggle

495
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,200
um you know inventing a whole new category and saying that um you know we need to start thinking

496
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,120
in terms of a kind of category of an ontological category that we didn't really know existed

497
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,880
before but the other thing is there is a tradition here i mean i you know i i may have sound as if

498
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:59,120
there was basically hieroclitus whiteheader than me um and i certainly don't mean to say that um i mean

499
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,040
and for example um one of the things my collaborator on this book Dan Nicholson has done a great

500
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:14,320
deal of work on is the um early 20th century biology which was um was inspired actually by

501
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:21,680
whitehead people like waddington um and various actually who i mentioned at that point um was

502
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:30,560
involved with it so a bunch of of um biologists who have tried to articulate a process ontology

503
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,040
and i think there's there's a little historical story that actually if you look at the 20th century

504
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:44,720
up to about let's say 1953 you have um you have a lot of theoretical biology that's process

505
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:54,640
directed and then 1953 as everybody probably knows with the structure of dna was um published

506
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:06,640
and this initiated an extraordinarily productive but in some way misguided um his chapter in the

507
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:14,320
history of biology we found out a huge amount but that also embedded um a lot of really misleading

508
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:21,200
views notably the view that biology was basically just all you know run by these little bits of

509
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:28,640
dna which we now know is completely wrong the wonderful molecules dna but it doesn't it's not a

510
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:36,400
blueprint and it's not a master molecule it's just part of a complex system um and um

511
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,880
and i think so so so i don't think we need to go outside the tradition and invent something new

512
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:52,400
i think we need to you know reclaim a lot of the pre dna biology and then and and and actually

513
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,560
and it's easy to do that in a way because we know much now we know actually lots of things about

514
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:05,520
dna that make us see it's a thoroughly active molecule that's constantly doing things changing

515
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,040
changing its shape changing its chemical structure um you know it's it's as dynamic as i mean

516
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,360
there are aspects of it that are importantly very stable but even them they're not stable

517
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,280
because it's a very stable molecule they're stable also because there's a whole host of systems

518
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:33,520
that stabilize it that repair the sequence when it gets damaged and so on so i think um that picking

519
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:41,680
up this this thread and saying actually you know these these process oriented biologists prior to

520
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:49,200
i say the second half of the 20th century were so right about the basic metaphysics even if you

521
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:56,800
know the quite different view has been very productive we should pick it up and and reassert

522
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:04,080
the processual nature of of of life right uh yeah i i've got lots of questions but

523
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,280
great thanks for a great talk and it's all right if anything might be

524
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,080
having a little bit of fun in some ways so this is a relatively simple thing but um

525
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,120
basically i was wondering why do you think they cancer being more affordable means that they're

526
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:26,400
so let me illustrate what i mean um i use this distinction that you can be quite helpful in

527
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,200
philosophy of medicine so it's something that i call sort of contributing cause of factors and

528
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:39,360
then realizing cause of factors so um namely you may have lots of different not things but lots

529
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:44,560
lots of different causes contributing to the appearance of some sort of phenomenal whatever

530
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,920
but then it could happen this is maybe where this might be used for in some ways you could have a

531
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,720
process that kind of instantiates the thing if you like so it namely realizes it and just in the

532
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:02,720
system um and so uh you know one of the most promising paradigm for something like cancer is

533
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:09,280
this framework that i mentioned earlier briefly um so basic vision and in that kind of framework

534
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:15,920
you may well have various you know a whole range of reasons for this bioelectric communication

535
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,240
to break down right but the ultimate sort of realizing thing that you target would be

536
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:29,120
communication breaking down right and so in that case as long as you manage to kind of

537
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:36,160
re re-establish it you would be getting rid of cancer right so i mean basically i definitely

538
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,240
think that cancer being multi-posal in the sense of contributing cause of factors means that prevention

539
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,160
would have to be multiple multiple in that sense right like you couldn't just

540
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,320
decide on one course of action and prevent that but treatment seems to be rather different

541
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,040
because i think in in most cases it targets something closer to realizing cause of factors

542
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:05,680
so yeah i was wondering oh well i think it probably depends how broadly you interpret

543
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:12,560
communication breaking down um and if you interpret it sufficiently broadly um i mean

544
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,960
this is always the case where you's where with with um sort of pluralistic arguments i mean

545
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:26,000
you could you can make the terminology sufficiently inclusive to include all the things that a

546
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:34,720
pluralist would like to break down but it seems to me that taking as i hear your question that there

547
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:45,200
is one particular kind of relation that um the failure of which is what we call cancer

548
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:53,200
i mean so that that's the the monistic reading of that and if i took it that way i would say

549
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:03,120
that seems really improbable for the reason that i i tried to give that the articulation of all these

550
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:11,440
cellular divisions differentiations and deaths that constitutes a healthy life cycle is not

551
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:22,000
constituted by one single kind of relation it's i i'm i'm pretty sure constituted by or and and

552
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,880
maintained by an awful lot of relations now if you say you know those relations are communications

553
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:37,840
between cells yeah perhaps that's right um i mean messaging between cells determines whether they

554
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:44,640
do these things uh but that seems to me more almost like just describing cancer rather than

555
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:52,080
than providing an etiology for it and that's why i say i mean and that's why i say in a sense

556
01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:01,360
you've avoided the pluralism by taking a sufficiently wide-ranging definition of what's

557
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:08,480
happening that i'm just saying it's this not working anymore i i i did see a lot of hands before

558
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:16,880
so we may have a chance i'm sure to etiology better for prevention okay yeah i mean that that's yeah

559
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:25,200
um yeah so so yeah so i was wondering that um there can be an in-between case which is neither

560
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:34,400
just since or just processes but if the stability which you think can be achieved is

561
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:41,760
achieved in a timescale which is important for humans then i think one might think then in that

562
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:51,200
case we can use substance but when the stability is not achieved in the in a we can't just run

563
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,560
say which is the timescale then there is only processes so there is one option which is

564
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:06,800
not everything is seen but very few things is seen and more things are processed than we

565
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:14,560
thought before and that would be closer to your view but a bit like because the stability for you

566
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:21,440
is very important and if we would say that when the stability is stable we achieve then at least

567
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:29,200
we can call it same then uh the kind of contrast between process and something else still can be

568
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,040
maintained which might be useful yeah no i mean i that that's that's something actually i'm very

569
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,440
happy to do in in many cases i mean i i think again for those of you who were here earlier i mean

570
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:48,160
that's that's how i would explain why mechanism is often a a successful strategy because the

571
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:54,080
things that you identify as the parts of the mechanism are stable over the timescale you're

572
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,120
interested in understanding so i i'm and of course that's just that might be a very short one and

573
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,920
there might be an everyday life you might say you know a certain degree of stability is sufficient

574
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,000
to count as a thing um and of course that wouldn't have any that wouldn't in any way i think fundamentally

575
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,960
contradict anything i'm saying i'm happy with that great what kind of uh mathematics would you

576
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,440
suggest for process based modeling in biology this is a classical question because a in

577
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:32,880
organized tradition in the retinal biology so that question has been discussed since maybe

578
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:42,720
budger, Bergalanti, Waddington, René Tom, Robert Rosen say what would be your answer um my answer

579
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:52,880
would be to i'm afraid to to refuse to try and answer i i mean you know i i'm i'm um i'm not a

580
01:09:52,880 --> 01:10:01,920
mathematician um and you know i i'm um so i'm i'm not going to adjudicate between somebody

581
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,120
um i can't understand at all like Rosen and somebody i can't understand very much like

582
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:14,640
Bergalanti um i i think these the i i have greatest respect for this kind of work but it's not my

583
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:24,160
pathway into the subject i i'm afraid to say so yeah i saw you say yeah um yeah yeah yeah

584
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:31,840
and then what um yeah you then then then okay so what can you tell us about these similarities

585
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,000
or uh difference between your approach and all the biases and the extended cognition

586
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:49,360
um so extended cognition i think is is relative i mean i think it's it's very congenial but i

587
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:55,920
think it's it's in a different um era i mean it's it's debate a different arena i mean it's

588
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:03,120
arguing with different people i say i'm very very sympathetic to it um and i i think i buy a lot of

589
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:12,320
it but um but i don't think it's um it's kind of a competitor i think it's just a an ally

590
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,320
though obviously i don't mean that all people in that line of work would necessarily agree

591
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:27,680
autopoiesis um i have a i mean a lot of similarities i think um the the only

592
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:33,600
trouble with autopoiesis is well the biggest trouble that is the word autopoiesis um i mean

593
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:43,760
the notion that organisms make themselves i find very unfortunate um and i think you know an awful

594
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:51,600
lot of what um you know varela and machirana actually say seems just right and i'm totally

595
01:11:51,600 --> 01:12:00,480
sympathetic to but the framework of um you know things allegedly making themselves seems to be a

596
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,880
pity but but that's that's probably just a little bit of a semantic quibble i think there's a great

597
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:14,640
deal um in common um and i think i would mostly say um i guess again rather like whitehead they're

598
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:21,920
not always the easiest um people to understand and and i mean you know the this is this sounds

599
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:30,160
like laziness on my part and probably is but um i do think that you know there's the you know i mean

600
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:38,160
whitehead i think in all honesty does has done quite a lot of harm to process thinking and not

601
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:45,360
by getting things wrong so much as by making people think oh my god if i if i get interested in

602
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:53,680
process i'll have to read a process in reality and that's um i know nobody wants to do that i mean

603
01:12:53,680 --> 01:13:01,520
i i i obviously exaggerate but but um but i and i and i do think um so so obviously one of the

604
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,880
one of the aims of this project is to try and suggest actually it's i mean and obviously i'd

605
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,600
leave others to judge whether i'm succeeding in this but really one ought to be able to say

606
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,480
this sort of stuff in a perfectly straightforward understandable way it's it's really easy to

607
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:26,400
understand and i think you know um i think i think you know vralla maturana sort of often make it

608
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:32,720
seem harder than it is and come up with and and i guess the production of of of weird and slightly

609
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:40,800
misguided terminology is part of that so i i i so i would say definitely an ally definitely

610
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:49,360
right about lots but also slightly a little bit of the whitehead thing of making people think

611
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,800
it's much harder to understand and probably not worth the trouble

612
01:13:54,320 --> 01:14:00,320
so that's it's not it's not a i'm not very happy with that answer but it'll maybe do for now uh yeah

613
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,160
as i understand the merit of this process is that it's also a family of problems kind of

614
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:19,760
like the shape of these things like where are the boundaries say more good as a master

615
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:29,200
the back of my first day in barba and then a few plus stages okay but um i remember for my studies

616
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:36,160
in my cell biology and molecular biology that needed reading of these subjects are studied

617
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:44,720
quite mechanistically we were interested in like different gates and triggers and the movement of

618
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:51,520
molecules themselves so it seems that this process metaphysics is helpful for framing like when you

619
01:14:51,520 --> 01:15:01,040
talked about cancer and viruses but the integrity of it seems to be the mechanistic view has been

620
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:08,720
very fruitful yeah so do you think that these two kind of somehow like co-exist absolutely and this

621
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:15,280
is comes back to i just alluded to in in in the question i want to go that i don't think it's not

622
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:22,560
that i want to say all this mechanistic explanation is completely misguided at all i think we've

623
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:30,000
we just go and this why i say you know that the the very mechanistic um biology that that followed

624
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:37,280
the kind of analysis of dna and and the processes of of you know of translation and and all i mean

625
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:44,080
that's wonderful biology looks kind of mechanistic and you know the last thing i want to do is to

626
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:51,040
say that's all rubbish right so so absolutely so so the but there's two levels the first is is

627
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,480
there's two two kinds of reply the first is yes i i think it's perfectly intelligible within a

628
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:05,760
process framework simply by just recognizing that when you're talking about a mechanism you're not

629
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:13,600
talking about you know fixed parts you're talking about parts that are sufficiently fixed for the

630
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:20,720
time frame that you're interested in but but there are also other other perspectives in which these

631
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:28,560
parts are changing these parts may be you know uh doing other things um you know there are other

632
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:36,480
perspectives that you might if you if you think too much in terms of biology as being about finding

633
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:43,200
mechanisms there are things that you're not going to notice or you're not going to focus on i'm sorry

634
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:52,000
again to people who who've been here in this morning but i will repeat one one kind of line of

635
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:02,240
examples here i'm fascinated by the parallel histories in some ways of um genomics and proteomics

636
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:10,480
that um you know that that they start out with so here's the genome here are all these genes

637
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,120
lined up what they do here's the gene for this here's the gene for that you know and maybe the

638
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,200
gene for is just the gene for making a particular protein it doesn't have to be the gene for aggression

639
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:28,240
or something really silly but at any rate we've got all this this stuff similar with you know protein

640
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:34,240
studies we used to have the protein that catalyzes this particular reaction the protein that makes

641
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:40,960
muscle fibers you know there we look at this thing we identify them see what kind of mechanism

642
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:49,600
we can fit them into and then we gradually find that this is hugely simplistic that this stretch

643
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:56,480
of DNA not only isn't the gene for aggression or homosexuality or some nonsense that that you know

644
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:02,560
sociopathic might have come up with it's it's actually not even the gene for making a particular

645
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:09,680
protein that it's really just a resource that can be used to make often many different proteins

646
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,840
then i mean and and then of course you know we we also find you know epigenetics and so on that

647
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:23,600
makes um all of this even more complicated same thing with proteins that it's a slightly um you

648
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:30,880
know more you know it's a slightly more complicated actually i think a deeper problem that people you

649
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,880
know would think what's the function of this protein that's a bad question because what we find is

650
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:44,000
of course there is a system which we can call a mechanism in which this protein does something

651
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,320
and helps us to understand but then we find and i say again sorry to repeat myself but one of my

652
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:57,200
favorite bits of giveaway language in biology is we found these things were moonlighting right

653
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,160
this is we have moonlighting proteins that were doing something other than their job in their spare

654
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:09,280
time and you know and then they finally do 10 different jobs and what you what you realize is

655
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:16,720
that the notion that you have this set of parts that fit into a mechanism in some way obscures

656
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:24,720
something really fundamental about how biological systems work that they make multiple use of the

657
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:33,360
parts and and the parts actually become different parts in different uses so having first of all

658
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:40,400
moved on to the moonlighting process proteins we now find at least half of them are the the um the

659
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:46,160
idps the i'd never know what it sounds for the the it that's right the intrinsically disorder

660
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,920
proteins which actually exist in a whole bunch of different structures and only settle on a structure

661
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:59,120
in a particular context so i mean the the diversity of these resources the fact that

662
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:05,920
the system is the system and this is i think is a kind of downward causation is able to use these

663
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:12,560
resources in multiple different ways in different contexts is i think absolutely fundamental thing

664
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:21,520
about how life a is possible and b is very unlike anything we uh or at least any traditional way of

665
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,360
thinking about mechanism and it's not so so we can look at the particular mechanisms and if we if

666
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:33,760
we start with a particular phenomenon there you know how does a particular um you know molecule

667
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:40,080
gets synthesized we can look at a mechanism but if we then start thinking okay so now we've located

668
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:47,120
the function of all the elements involved in that mechanism then we've shut off all kinds of

669
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:54,560
thoughts that we might have about um what these things can do so again it's not it's it's not that

670
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:59,120
there's anything wrong with all the mechanism understanding we have it's just that it can

671
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:07,280
provide a framework which discourages us from looking at at certain things and and pushes

672
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,200
certain directions over others i mean there's an awful lot to find out in biology and and

673
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:19,520
mechanistic thinking has enabled us to find out an awful lot of stuff but but it's also i think

674
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:28,240
comes at a cost in terms of of kind of channeling thought in some directions and tending to channel

675
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:36,960
it away from other directions um sorry you you i have somewhat more big question about the boundaries

676
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:43,920
of an organism the boundaries of an organism okay and if you're deaf you'll be a way to draw the

677
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:50,320
boundaries so so for example if a human rises in thick the human with the bacteria on the screen do

678
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,680
not die at the same instant right and you could say that there's a boundary right here so everything

679
01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:05,920
that died together instantly is within the boundary the bacteria outside um well but why would you say

680
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:13,520
that i mean i i so i guess two reasons i would be skeptical about one is i mean no death is

681
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:21,040
ending is i think is easier than beginning so you've um but but supposing supposing that you

682
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:29,360
putting that on one side why would you why would you i mean so if you have um you know

683
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:41,920
absolutely um required bacterial um symbionts um they don't necessarily die with the i mean

684
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:49,040
they might carry on with you know the next thing that ate you after you died um or they might you

685
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,800
know i mean typically i guess they mostly die but by no means always or necessarily

686
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:05,120
so i'm not sure why you would why you would want that to be a criterion

687
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:20,320
i take it the idea would be you decide of the living organism whether something is part of it

688
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:27,120
on the basis of whether it dies when that organism dies is that is that the so yeah i

689
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:33,280
can i mean i certainly um it's an interesting suggestion um but i i'm not sure i can really

690
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:38,240
i'm not sure i can quite see the motivation for it apart from it being a criterion that you could

691
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:45,360
apply and that would give you some um answers sometimes but but even then does it i mean i i

692
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:50,720
guess i don't actually know the the sort of empirical facts about you know what the probability

693
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:58,480
of of a random part of your you know skin bacteria i guess they've probably got a good chance of living

694
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:04,240
and they tend to be quite transitory so let's say your gut bacteria i don't know what proportion

695
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:09,520
of them die when you die i mean i think a lot of what happens is the proportions of different

696
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:15,600
kinds change dramatically and some kinds um find themselves very happy living on your

697
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:26,480
corpse and become others are not so happy and become less so um so maybe and maybe maybe you

698
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:32,000
want to say i don't if you're going to eat my corpse you're not part of me um but but more

699
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:41,040
seriously i i just i don't really see a motivation for it um i mean am i is the apart from i mean

700
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,760
again depending sort of on the empirical facts it could turn out that there was a really nice

701
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:55,440
cutoff and certain obligate symbionts um did pretty much all go when you went but i'm not sure if

702
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:03,920
that's true and i wouldn't and it wouldn't be very surprising if it were not true right i mean

703
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:10,160
if if if lots of obligate symbionts tended to carry on just fine eating you for a bit and waiting

704
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:16,480
to somebody else at you i mean well i think the kind of these two boundaries is the correct

705
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:23,120
rest of all the things that's the which the sorry having clear boundaries and are supposed to have

706
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:28,800
things and you would say that being able to eliminate the clear boundaries from number of

707
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,400
yeah i mean i i but i guess i suppose it's it's um i don't i suppose you're i think you say i mean

708
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:44,560
temporal boundaries yes i mean you know lots of stuff dies but but why that should

709
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,000
why that should be an answer the question of spatial boundaries when you're not there i guess is

710
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:59,600
is the question that i don't really see a strong motivation for but but it's a um yeah

711
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,240
the the morbid subtlety uh it's wondering uh do you regard death as um as a process or an end

712
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:14,640
of or end of process or without fitting well it's an interesting one i mean i guess something i don't

713
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:21,680
talk about much at all are events um which are in many philosophers ontology is very important

714
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:29,840
i tend to think events are just very short sharp processes uh but but um but i guess you know one

715
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,720
differentiation that a lot of people would make would say death is an event of course but then i

716
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,680
guess i would also say not necessary a slow lingering death if we're going to be morbid

717
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:44,640
is much more like a process you know a bullet in the head pretty much an event

718
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,000
but sorry sorry to get um

719
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:59,120
legally it's still very difficult to say one someone is technically dead because what is there

720
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:04,960
is complicated is that the cardiac arrest we can pinpoint the moment of the cardiac arrest

721
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,960
is that the moment when the brain is too damaged to be started again without the hurt again so even

722
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:17,280
having to pinpoint on that is really really difficult to medicine and especially in the

723
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:24,080
question of organ transplant the moment where we can uh our best i would say organ of someone

724
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:30,320
because this person is dead is still a tricky part because of the absence of brain stem break

725
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:37,520
flexes it's great in fact exactly that's when you go for jobs yeah in the case of the

726
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:44,240
legislation of the country in France you have to be branded with certain measure for at least

727
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:54,320
20 hours and i think that in the UK in fact it's a legal definition more than legal health

728
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,000
like science but more it's more a legal definition and it's probably yeah it is driven more by

729
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:08,640
pragmatics and you know operationalizability i think rather than any deep kind of philosophical

730
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:18,240
insight i mean obviously people would sometimes like that to be a deep philosophical truth but

731
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:25,040
i think for just the sort of reasons you're saying it's kind of hard to locate one

732
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:33,600
and certainly yeah you could be brain dead and um your symbionts would live happily for

733
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,880
years while you were in a permanent vegetative state which some people might say was not was

734
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:51,040
a state post death um so yeah that's actually yeah okay one last question is anybody wanted

735
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,680
hasn't asked a question just just okay so

736
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:05,200
so if you describe yourself as a from viscous uh individualist yeah i mean i i want to just bracket

737
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:17,360
that a little bit

738
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:26,080
so i'm just wondering about the non-promiscuous

739
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:37,760
process here is here because the promiscuity here concerns a kind of of way of different ways

740
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:45,040
of abstracting all movements from this flux so in principle that could be a position which was

741
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:52,000
much like walls in terms of the underlying ontology to some degree except that they were more

742
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:59,280
more verquining or you know more more more sort of of a hardliner about

743
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,160
processes of individuation and abstraction what would the consequences be because it seems to

744
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:14,640
add some onto the logical there is some agreement about underlying flux but then you're abstracting

745
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:21,680
individuals in this promiscuous way which you're aware is about but they want to be deflationary about

746
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:31,840
the abstraction process as it were yeah um i'm not sure what to say about that um

747
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:38,480
i mean what i'll say one thing which may be a bit tangential i mean i think sometimes people get

748
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:46,000
into some of the more bizarre views in philosophy by by feeling the need to assert

749
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:54,000
um you know firm boundaries and one example i think of is um and and you know some some some

750
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:01,760
um kind of analytic metaphysicians that i in many ways would respect um who argue that

751
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:10,720
the human life begins when twinning is no longer possible now i mean basically because

752
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:17,440
if twinning is possible then they they're led into the contradiction that you might become

753
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:25,200
two non-identical people and that would mean a contradiction so so life has to begin

754
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:31,360
at the moment whenever that may be when it is no longer possible in theory so i know i mean

755
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:39,520
that strikes me as um kind of you know a kind of reductioid absurdum of metaphysical argument of

756
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:46,640
the most extreme kind i mean you know that that's their problem not the problem for you know the

757
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:55,600
the perfectly happy um non-twinning embryo that is part of the same process as the you know the

758
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:02,240
non-twin fetus that it becomes um it's just whereas again you know i'd say you know if you're

759
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:09,760
happily kind of promiscuous processualist or say no it's a process that's divided i mean that's

760
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:17,760
we don't we don't you know this is this is um so i don't know if that exactly answers your

761
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,240
question it probably doesn't i'm pretty sure it does because you you're sort of saying that

762
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:29,360
this this kind of abstraction in fact empirically goes with the nature of the phenomena which

763
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:36,720
requires some sort of like a package yeah and i think as i said i think i think the the i mean

764
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:43,600
i think you know if i were looking for um you know a kind of reductio of the assumption that

765
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:49,600
somehow one has to draw the boundaries around an individual that would be um a nice place to go at

766
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:56,560
least because actually you know it's just the process process is split um and and you know all

767
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:05,360
these all the the industry of split brains and all of that is is just um uh a an industry of

768
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:13,360
self-destruction for um substance theorists in my world for which i have no i don't think i have

769
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:26,160
any problems with at all so
