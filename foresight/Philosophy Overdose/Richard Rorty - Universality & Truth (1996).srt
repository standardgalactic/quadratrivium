1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
The question of whether there are any beliefs or desires common to all human beings is a

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,520
little interest apart from the vision of a utopian inclusivist human community, one which

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,200
prides itself on the different sorts of people.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,920
It welcomes rather than on the firmness with which it keeps out the stranger.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,200
Most human communities are exclusivist.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Their sense of identity and the self-images of their members depend on pride in not being

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,680
certain other sorts of people, people who worship the wrong God, eat the wrong foods, or have

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,080
some other perverse, repellent beliefs or desires.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Philosophers would not bother trying to show that certain beliefs and desires are found

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:54,480
in every society or are implicit in some ineliminable human practice, unless they hope to show that

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,160
the existence of these beliefs demonstrates the possibility of or the obligation to construct

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,640
a planet-wide inclusivist community.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,920
In this paper I'll use the term democratic politics as a synonym for the attempt to bring

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,820
such a community into existence.

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,960
One of the desires said to be universal by philosophers interested in democratic politics

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,800
is the desire for truth.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,040
In the past, such philosophers have typically conjoined the claim that there is universal

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,800
human agreement on the supreme desirability of truth with the further premises that truth

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,160
is correspondence to reality and that reality has an intrinsic nature, that there is in

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,200
Nelson Goodman's terms a way the world is.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,560
Given these three premises, they proceed to argue that truth is one and that the universal

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,640
human interest in truth provides motive for creating an inclusivist community.

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,520
For such a community would be best suited to accomplishing our desire of discovering

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,360
the one truth.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,000
The more of that truth we uncover, the more common ground we shall share, and the more

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,320
tolerant and inclusivist we shall therefore become.

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,760
The rise of relatively democratic, relatively tolerant societies in the last few hundred

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,880
years is said to be due to the increased rationality of modern times, where rationality denotes

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,480
the exercise of a truth-oriented faculty.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,240
The three premises I've listed are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason.

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,600
That is, the premises that everybody wants truth, that truth is correspondence to reality

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,680
and that reality has an intrinsic nature.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,480
These three premises are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason, but this claim

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,480
is usually tautologists for philosophers who say that, typically explain their use of the

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:59,160
word reason by listing those same three premises as constitutive of the very idea of rationality.

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,320
They view colleagues who have doubts about one or another of these three premises as irrationalism.

37
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:13,200
I have a footnote about Nietzsche, James, and Habermas as people who are called irrationalists

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,920
for rejecting one or another or more of those premises.

39
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,080
Degrees of irrationality are attributed according to how many of these premises the distrusted

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,280
philosopher denies, and also according to how little interest he or she shows in democratic

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,760
politics.

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,400
In this paper, I'll consider the prospects for defending democratic politics while denying

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,920
all of the three premises I've listed.

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll be arguing that what philosophers have described as the universal desire for truth

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,280
is better described as the universal desire for justification.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,440
The grounding premise of my argument is that you can't aim at something, can't work to

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,920
get it, unless you could recognize it once you got it.

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
One difference between truth and justification is just that between the unrecognizable and

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
the recognizable.

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,240
We shall never know for sure whether a given belief is true, but we can be sure that nobody

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,480
at the moment is able to summon up any residual objections to it that everybody agrees that

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,280
it ought to be held.

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,080
There are to be sure what Lacanians call impossible, indefinable, sublime objects of desire, but

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,800
a desire for such an object cannot be made relevant to democratic politics.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,360
On my view, truth is just that sort of object.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
It's too sublime, so to speak, to be either recognized or aimed at.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,080
Justification is merely beautiful as opposed to sublime, but it is recognizable and therefore

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
capable of being systematically worked for.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
Sometimes with Locke justification is even achieved.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,320
But that achievement is usually only temporary, since sooner or later, with Locke, some dual

61
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,240
objections to the temporarily justified belief will be developed.

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,880
As I see it, the yearning for unconditionality, the yearning which leads philosophers to insist

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,320
that we need to avoid contextualism and relativism, is indeed satisfied by the notion of truth.

64
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,280
But this yearning is unhealthy because the price of unconditionality is irrelevant to

65
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,000
practice.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,320
So I think the topic of truth can't be made relevant to democratic politics and that philosophers

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,080
devoted to such politics should forget about truth and stick to the topic of justification.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
Now I turn to Habermas.

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,600
In order to place my view within the context of contemporary philosophical controversies,

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
I'll begin with some comments on Habermas.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,080
Habermas draws his well-known distinction between subject-centered reason and communicative

72
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,040
reason in connection with his attempt to separate out what's useful to democratic politics

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,920
and the traditional philosophical notion of rationality from what's useless.

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,680
I think that he makes a tactical error when he tries to preserve the notion of unconditionality.

75
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,320
Although I think Habermas is absolutely right that we need to socialize and linguistify

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,040
the notion of reason by viewing it as communicative, I think that we also need to naturalize reason

77
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,600
Habermas, like Putnam, believes that reason cannot be naturalized.

78
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Both philosophers think, and that's a phrase from Putnam endorsed by Habermas, both philosophers

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,320
think it important to insist on this point in order to avoid the relativism which seems

80
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,480
to them to put democratic politics on a par with totalitarian politics.

81
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:54,320
You could say, if there's a moment of unconditionality, then you can't naturalize it.

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:01,680
Both think it important to say that democratic politics is more rational than totalitarian

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
fascist politics.

84
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,120
I don't think we should say that because I don't think the notion of rationality can

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
be stretched that far.

86
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,640
We should admit that we have no neutral ground to stand on when we defend democratic politics

87
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,160
against its opponents.

88
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
If we don't admit this, I think we can rightly be accused of attempting to smuggle our own

89
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,120
social practices into the definition of something universal and ineluctable because presupposed

90
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
by the practices of any and every language user.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,040
It would be franker and therefore better to say that democratic politics can no more appeal

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:46,200
to such presuppositions than can anti-democratic politics, but is none the worse for that.

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:53,000
Habermas agrees with the criticism which post-Nichyan writers have made of what Derrida calls logo-centrism

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,400
and specifically with their denial that, quote, the linguistic function of representing states

95
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,080
of affairs is the so human monopoly.

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,760
So do I, but I would extend this criticism as follows.

97
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that there was an aim of inquiry

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,160
called truth in addition to the aim of justification.

99
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,680
More generally, only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that acclaim to universal

100
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,160
validity is important for democratic politics.

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,760
Still more generally, abetting the logo-centric idea that knowledge is the distinctive human

102
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,360
capacity would leave room for the idea that democratic citizenship is better suited for

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,600
the role of the distinctively human capacity.

104
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,000
The latter is what we human beings should take most pride in and should make central

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to our self-image.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,360
As I see it, Habermas' attempt to redefine the term reason after deciding that, as he

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,280
says, the paradigm of the philosophy of consciousness is exhausted.

108
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,800
His attempt to re-describe reason as communicative through and through is insufficiently radical.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,680
It's a halfway house between thinking in terms of validity claims and thinking in terms of

110
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,280
justificatory practices.

111
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,320
It comes down halfway between the Greek idea that human beings are special because they

112
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,480
can know, whereas other animals can merely cope, and Dewey's idea that we are special

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,920
because we can take charge of our evolution, take ourselves in directions which have neither

114
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,840
precedent nor justification in either biology or history.

115
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,920
The latter idea can be made to sound unattractive by dubbing it Nietzschean and construing it

116
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,600
as one more form of the same will to power which was incarnate in the Nazis.

117
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I'd like to make it sound attractive by calling it American and construing it as the idea

118
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,720
common to Emerson and Whitman, the idea of a new self-creating community united not by

119
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,680
knowledge of the same truths, but by sharing the same generous, inclusivist, democratic

120
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
hopes.

121
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,960
The idea of communal self-creation, of realizing a dream which has no justification in unconditional

122
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,080
claims to universal validity, sounds suspicious to Habermas and Opel because they naturally

123
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,440
associate it with Hitler.

124
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,520
It sounds somewhat better to Americans because they naturally associate it with Jefferson,

125
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,360
Whitman and Dewey.

126
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,920
The moral to be drawn, I think, is that this suggestion is neutral between Hitler and Jefferson.

127
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,680
If one wants neutral principles on the basis of which to decide between Hitler and Jefferson,

128
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,160
one will have to find a way of replacing Jefferson's occasional references to natural law and

129
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,920
self-evident political truths by a more up-to-date version of Enlightenment rationalism.

130
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,320
This is the role in which Habermas and Opel cast what they call discourse ethics.

131
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Only if one has given up hope for discourse ethics and for all other attempts at such

132
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,480
neutrality will the alternative I'm suggesting seem attractive.

133
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Whether one gives up that hope should, I think, be decided, at least in part, on the basis

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,480
of one's view of the sort of argument from performative self-contradiction which is at

135
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,840
the heart of discourse ethics.

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,440
I see that argument as weak and unconvincing, but I have nothing better to put in its place.

137
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,640
Because I have nothing better, I'm inclined to reject the very idea of neutral principles

138
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,960
and ask myself what philosophers might do for democratic politics apart from trying to

139
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,360
ground this politics on principles.

140
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,440
My answer is they can get to work substituting hope for knowledge, substituting the idea

141
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,280
that the ability to be citizens of the full-fledged democracy which is yet to come rather than

142
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,520
the ability to grasp truth is what's important about being human.

143
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,640
This is not a matter of what Opel calls let's be glündung, but of re-describing humanity

144
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,440
and history in terms which make democracy seem desirable.

145
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,360
If doing that is said to be, as Opel calls it, mere rhetoric rather than proper argument,

146
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,200
I should rejoin that it is no more or less rhetorical or argumentative than my opponent's

147
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,640
attempt to make discourse, to describe discourse and communication in terms that make democracy

148
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,960
seem linked to the intrinsic nature of humanity.

149
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,960
New section on truth and justification.

150
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,080
There are many uses for the word true, but the only one which could not be eliminated

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,760
from our linguistic practice with relative ease is the cautionary use.

152
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,400
This is the use we make of the word when we contrast justification and truth and say that

153
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,880
a belief may be justified, but still not true.

154
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,400
Outside of philosophy, this cautionary use is used to contrast less informed with better

155
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,720
informed audiences and more generally past audiences with future audiences.

156
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,760
In nonphilosophical context, the point of contrasting truth and justification is simply

157
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,400
to remind oneself that there may be objections arising from newly discovered data or more

158
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,680
ingenious explanatory hypotheses or a shift in the vocabulary used for describing the

159
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,760
objects under discussion which have not occurred to any of the audiences to whom the belief

160
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,920
in question has so far been justified.

161
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,360
This sort of gesture toward an unpredictable future is made, for example, when we say that

162
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,880
our present moral and scientific beliefs may look as primitive to our remote descendants

163
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,600
as those of the Greeks look to us.

164
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,280
My grounding premise that you can only work for what you could recognize is a corollary

165
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,640
of James's principle that a difference has to make a difference to practice before it's

166
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,040
worth discussing.

167
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,600
The only difference between truth and justification which makes such a difference is, as far as

168
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,480
I can see, the difference between old audiences and new audiences.

169
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,840
So I take the appropriate pragmatist attitude toward truth to be, it's no more necessary

170
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,560
to have a philosophical theory about the nature of truth or the meaning of the word true

171
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,280
than it is to have one about the nature of danger or the meaning of the word danger.

172
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,920
The principle reason we have a word like danger in the language is to caution people,

173
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,560
to warn them that they may not have envisaged all the consequences of their proposed action.

174
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,160
We pragmatists who think that beliefs are habits of action rather than attempts to correspond

175
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:56,120
to reality see the cautionary use of the word true as flagging a special sort of danger.

176
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,840
We use it to remind ourselves that people in different circumstances, people facing

177
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,640
future audiences, may not be able to justify the belief which we have triumphantly justified

178
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,200
to all the audiences we have encountered.

179
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Given this pragmatist view of the function of the word true, what about the claim that

180
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,080
all human beings desire truth?

181
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,920
This claim is ambiguous between the claim that all of them desire to justify their beliefs

182
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,720
to some, though not necessarily all other human beings, and the claim that they all

183
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
want their beliefs to be true.

184
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,960
The first claim seems to me unobjectionable.

185
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,560
The second claim, however, seems dubious unless it's merely an alternative formulation

186
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,400
of the first.

187
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,960
For the only other interpretation which we pragmatists can give to the second claim is

188
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,400
that all human beings are concerned about the danger that someday an audience will

189
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,280
come into being before whom a presently justified belief cannot be justified.

190
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,400
But in the first place, mere fallibilism is not what philosophers who hope to make the

191
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,880
notion of truth relevant to democratic politics want.

192
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,560
In the second place, such fallibilism is not, in fact, a feature of all human beings.

193
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,120
It is much more prevalent among inhabitants of wealthy, secure, tolerant, inclusivist societies

194
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,960
than elsewhere, for these people are brought up to rethink themselves that they might be

195
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,080
mistaken, that there are people out there who might disagree with them and whose disagreement

196
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,920
needs to be taken into account.

197
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,600
If you favor democratic politics, you will want to encourage fallibilism.

198
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
But there are other ways to do so, beside harping on the difference between the conditional

199
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,840
character of justification and the unconditional character of truth.

200
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,080
One might, for example, harp on the sad fact that many previous communities have betrayed

201
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,120
their own interests by being too sure of themselves and so failing to attend to objections raised

202
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
by outsiders.

203
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,360
Furthermore, we should distinguish between fallibilism and philosophical skepticism.

204
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,200
Fallibilism has nothing in particular to do with the quest for universality and unconditionality.

205
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,920
Skepticism does.

206
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,240
Skepticism will usually not go into philosophy, at least in anglophone countries, unless one

207
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,800
is impressed by the sort of skepticism found in Descartes' meditations.

208
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,920
The sort of skepticism which says that the mere possibility of error defeats knowledge

209
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,860
claims.

210
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,680
Not many people find this sort of skepticism interesting, but those who do ask themselves,

211
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,120
is there any way in which we can ensure ourselves against having beliefs which may be unjustifiable

212
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
to some future audience?

213
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
Is there any way in which we can ensure that we have beliefs justifiable to any and every

214
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,040
audience?

215
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,680
The tiny minority which finds this question interesting consists almost entirely of philosophy

216
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,800
professors and divides into three groups.

217
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,160
First, skeptics like Straude, who say that Descartes' argument from dreams is unanswerable.

218
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,040
For the skeptics, there is always an audience, the future self who is awoken from the dream,

219
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,800
which will not be satisfied by any justification offered by our present, possibly, dreaming

220
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
self.

221
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,040
Second, foundationalists like Chisholm, who say that even if we're now dreaming, we

222
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,920
can't be wrong about certain beliefs, certain of our beliefs.

223
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,680
Third, coherentists like Sellers say that, I quote, Sellers, all our beliefs are up for

224
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,200
grabs, though not all at once.

225
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,360
We pragmatists who have been impressed by Perse's criticisms of Descartes think that

226
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,360
both skeptics and foundationalists are led astray by the picture of beliefs as attempts

227
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,040
to represent reality and by the associated idea that truth is a matter of correspondence

228
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,400
to reality.

229
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
So we become coherentists.

230
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But we coherentists remain divided about what, if anything, needs to be said about truth.

231
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,840
I think that once one has explicated the difference between justification and truth by that between

232
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,640
present and future justifiability, there is little more to be said.

233
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,320
Some of my fellow coherentists, Appel, Habermas, and Putnam, think, as Perse also did, that

234
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:23,200
there's a lot more to be said and that saying it is important for democratic politics.

235
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,720
Section four, universal validity and context transcendence, Putnam, Appel, and Habermas

236
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,680
all take over from Perse an idea which I reject, the idea of convergence upon the one truth.

237
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,800
Instead of arguing that because reality is one and truth correspondence to that one reality,

238
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Perseans argue that the idea of convergence is built into the presuppositions of discourse.

239
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,800
They all agree that the principal reason why reason cannot be naturalized is that reason

240
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,000
is normative and norms cannot be naturalized.

241
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,600
But they say we can make room for the normative without going back to the traditional idea

242
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,380
of a duty to correspond to the intrinsic nature of reality.

243
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:14,120
We do this by attending to the universalistic character of the idealizing presuppositions

244
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,000
of discourse.

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,680
This strategy has the advantage of setting aside meta-ethical questions about whether

246
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,600
there is a moral reality to which our moral judgments might hope to correspond as our

247
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,800
physical science supposedly hopes to correspond to physical reality.

248
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Habermas says that every validity claim, quote, has a transcendent moment of universal validity

249
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,440
which bursts every provinciality asunder.

250
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,640
In addition to the validity claim strategic role in some context bound discussion.

251
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,000
As I see it, the only truth in this idea is that many claims to validity are made by people

252
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,680
who would be willing to defend their claims before audiences other than the one which

253
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,680
they are currently addressing.

254
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,200
Not all assertions obviously are of this sort.

255
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,880
Lawyers, for example, are quite aware that they fashion their claims to suit the quaint

256
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,360
context of a highly local jurisprudence.

257
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,920
But willingness to take on new and unfamiliar audiences is one thing, bursting provinciality

258
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,880
asunder is another.

259
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,280
Habermas's doctrine of a transcendent moment seems to me to run together a commendable

260
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,480
willingness to try something new with an empty boast.

261
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,080
To say I'll try to defend this argument, I'll try to defend this belief against all

262
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,160
comers is often depending upon the circumstances a commendable attitude.

263
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,120
But to say I can successfully defend this against all comers is silly.

264
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,800
Maybe you can, but you're in no more opposition to say that than the village champion

265
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,120
is to claim that he can beat the world champion.

266
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,680
The only sort of situation in which you would be in a position to say the latter is one

267
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,120
in which the rules of the argumentative game have been agreed upon in advance, as in normal

268
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,400
as opposed to revolutionary mathematics, for example.

269
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
But in most cases, including the moral and political claims in which Habermas is most

270
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,680
interested, there are no such rules.

271
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,760
The notion of context dependence has a clear sense in the sorts of cases I've just mentioned,

272
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,840
in provincial law courts and in language games such as normal mathematics regulated

273
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,000
by clear and explicit conventions.

274
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,880
For most assertions, however, neither the notion of context dependence nor the notion

275
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,560
of universal validity has such a sense.

276
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,120
For most assertions, such as Clinton is the better candidate, Alexander came before Caesar,

277
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,160
Gold is insoluble in hydrochloric acid and the like, it's hard to see why I should ask

278
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
myself, is my claim context dependent or universal?

279
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,560
No difference to practice is going to be made by coming down in favor of one alternative

280
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,200
rather than the other.

281
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Habermas puts forward an analog of this distinction between the context dependent and the universal,

282
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,120
which might seem more relevant to practice.

283
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,440
This analog is what he calls the tension between facticity and validity.

284
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,800
He views this tension as a central philosophical problem and says that this tension is responsible

285
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,040
for many of the difficulties encountered in theorizing democratic politics.

286
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,080
He thinks it is a distinctive and valuable feature of his theory of communicative action

287
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,120
that, quote, it already absorbs the tension between facticity and validity into its fundamental

288
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,400
concepts.

289
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,720
It does so by distinguishing between the strategic use of discourse and what he calls the use

290
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,720
of language oriented to reaching understanding.

291
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,740
This latter distinction might seem just the one we are looking for, the one which lets

292
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,360
us interpret the distinction between context dependence in universality and universality

293
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,040
in a way which makes a difference to practice.

294
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,160
As I see it, however, the distinction between the strategic and non-strategic use of language

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,040
is just the distinction between cases in which all we care about is convincing others and

296
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,400
cases in which we hope to learn something.

297
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,080
In the latter set of cases, we are quite willing to give up our present views if we hear something

298
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,400
better.

299
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,440
These cases are two ends of a spectrum, at one end of which we shall use any dirty trick

300
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,880
we can, lying, omitting the truth, suggesting the false and so on, to convince.

301
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,560
At the other end, we talk to others as we talk to ourselves when we are most at ease,

302
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,200
most reflective and most curious.

303
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,920
Most of the time, we are somewhere in the middle between these two extremes.

304
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,160
My problem is, I don't see that these two extremes have anything in particular to do

305
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,320
with a distinction between context dependence and universality.

306
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,360
The pure pursuit of truth is the traditional name for the sort of conversation which takes

307
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,680
place at one end of this spectrum.

308
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:13,600
But I don't see what that sort of conversation has to do with universality or with unconditionality.

309
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,720
It is non-strategic in the sense that in such conversations we let the wind blow where

310
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,200
it lists it, but it's hard to see that the assertions we make in such conversations presuppose

311
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,160
something which is not presupposed in the assertions I make when I'm at the other end

312
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,000
of the spectrum, the dirty tricks end of the spectrum.

313
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,240
Habermas, however, thinks that unless we recognize, quote, that the validity claims

314
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,000
raised hiket nunk and aimed at intersubjective recognition or acceptance can at the same

315
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,040
time overshoot local standards for taking yes-no positions, we shall not see that this

316
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,960
transcendent moment alone distinguishes the practices of justification oriented to truth

317
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:06,240
claims from other practices that are regulated merely by social convention.

318
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
This passage is a good example of what seems to me Habermas' undesirable commitment to

319
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,680
the logocentric distinction between opinion and knowledge, a distinction between mere

320
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,920
obedience to the norms of social practices, even the sort of norm which would be found

321
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:29,040
in a utopian democratic society, and the kind of foussé by nature relation to reality which

322
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,280
is provided by the grasp of truth.

323
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,760
Both the opinion knowledge and the normals foussé's distinction appear to delians as

324
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,480
remnants of Plato's obsession with the kind of certainty found in mathematics, and more

325
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,200
generally with the idea that the universal being somehow eternal and unconditional provides

326
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,760
an escape from what is particular, temporal, and conditioned.

327
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,080
In this passage Habermas is, I take it, using the term practices of justification oriented

328
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,120
to truth claims to refer to the nice end of the spectrum I described above.

329
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,760
But from my point of view, truth has nothing to do with it.

330
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Since social convention, rather they're regulated by certain particular social conventions,

331
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,600
those of a society even more democratic, tolerant, leisure, wealthy, and diverse than our own,

332
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,800
one in which inclusivism is built into everyone's sense of moral identity.

333
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:31,600
In this society everybody always welcomes strange opinions on all sorts of topics.

334
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,280
These are also the conventions of certain lucky parts of contemporary society.

335
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,840
For example, university seminars, summer camps for intellectuals, and the like.

336
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Perhaps the most far-reaching difference between Habermas and I is that pragmatists like myself

337
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,000
sympathize with the anti-metaphysical, so-called postmodern thinkers whom Habermas criticizes

338
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,880
when they suggest that the idea of a distinction between social practice and what transcends

339
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,280
such practice is an undesirable remnant of logocentrism.

340
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,560
Foucault and Dewey can agree that whether or not inquiry is always a matter of power,

341
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,880
it never transcends social practice.

342
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,280
So incidentally, can brand them.

343
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:25,600
So this issue comes up in the context of Brandon's work tomorrow.

344
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,840
Both would say that the only thing that can transcend the social practice is another social

345
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,960
practice, just as the only thing that can transcend the present audience is a future

346
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
audience.

347
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,600
Similarly, the only thing that can transcend a discursive strategy is another discursive

348
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,560
strategy, one aimed at other better goals.

349
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,040
But because I don't know how to aim at it, I don't think that truth names such a goal.

350
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,520
I know how to aim at greater honesty, greater charity, greater patience, greater inclusiveness,

351
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,680
and so on.

352
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,320
I see democratic politics as serving such concrete, desirable goals, but I don't see

353
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,440
that it helps things to add truth or universality or unconditionality to the list of goals.

354
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Or I don't see what we will do differently depending on whether or not we make such additions.

355
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,200
It may sound at this point as if the difference between me and Habermas is one that makes

356
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,160
no difference to practice.

357
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,400
We both have the same utopias in mind.

358
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,600
We both engage in the same sort of democratic politics.

359
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,600
So why quibble about the difference between whether to call utopian communication practices

360
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,160
oriented to truth or not?

361
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,040
Why quibble about the whole subject of the relevance of truth to democratic politics?

362
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,400
The answer is that Habermas thinks it does make a difference to practice because he gets

363
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,960
to make an argumentative move which isn't open to me.

364
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,160
He gets to accuse his opponents of performative self-contradiction.

365
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,440
Habermas thinks that, quote, the universal discourse of an unbounded community of interpretation

366
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,760
is unavoidably assumed by anybody, even me, who gets into any argument.

367
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,080
He says, quote, even if these presuppositions have an ideal content that can only be approximately

368
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,660
satisfied, all participants must de facto accept them, accept the presuppositions of

369
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,720
communication, whether they assert or deny the truth of a statement in any way and would

370
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:35,960
like to enter into argumentation aimed at justifying this validity claim.

371
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,120
My experience of speaking in Frankfurt is invariably that, at a certain point, Appel

372
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,680
will accuse me of performative self-contradiction.

373
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:53,400
This is the standard Frankfurt move, sort of the basic strategy of the school.

374
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,680
What about somebody who is outraged as are many trustees of American universities by

375
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,400
the social conventions of the better parts of the better universities, places where

376
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,080
even the most paradoxical and unpromising claims are seriously discussed, and in which

377
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,260
feminists, atheists, homosexuals, blacks, etc. are taken seriously as moral equals and

378
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,760
conversational partners?

379
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,200
I take it that on Habermas's view, such a person will be contradicting himself if he

380
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,160
offers arguments to the effect that these conventions should be replaced by other more

381
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,640
exclusivist conventions.

382
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,720
By contrast, I can't tell the narrow-minded university trustee that he's contradicting

383
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
himself.

384
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,560
I can only try to weedle him into greater tolerance by the usual indirect means, giving

385
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,240
examples of present platitudes which were once paradoxes of the contributions to culture

386
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,440
made by black female homosexual atheists and so on.

387
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:00,800
The big question of whether anybody has ever been convinced by the charge of performative

388
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,360
self-confidiction.

389
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,960
I don't think that there are many clear examples of such a change being taken to heart.

390
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,400
If you tell a bigot of the sort I've sketched that he's committed to making context-surpassing

391
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,880
validity claims to aiming at truth, he'll probably agree that that's exactly what he's

392
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,440
doing.

393
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,480
If you tell him that he can't make such claims and still balk at the paradoxes or the people

394
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,080
at whom he balks, he will probably not get the point.

395
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,240
He will say that people who invent such paradoxes are too crazy to argue with or argue about

396
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,820
that women have a distorted view of reality and the why.

397
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,800
He will think it irrational or immoral or both to take such paradoxes and people seriously.

398
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,720
That's why he doesn't think the university should allow them to teach, speak and so on.

399
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,320
I can't see much difference between the bigot's reaction to me and Habermas and Habermas's

400
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,000
and my reactions to him.

401
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I can't see that anything like communicative reason favors our reactions rather than his.

402
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,400
This is because I don't see why the term reason is not as much up for grabs as the term academic

403
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,160
freedom or morality or pervert, nor how the anti-foundationalist coherentism which Habermas

404
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:26,400
and I share can make room for a non-recontextualizable, non-relativizable conversation stopper called

405
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,380
performative self-contradiction.

406
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,560
What the bigot and I do and I think should do when told that we have violated a presupposition

407
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,320
of communication is to haggle about the meanings of the terms used in stating the purported

408
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:48,000
presupposition, terms like true argument, reason, communication, domination and so on.

409
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,880
This haggling will with luck eventually turn into a mutually profitable conversation about

410
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,000
our respective utopias.

411
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Our respective ideas about what an ideal society or university empowering an ideally competent

412
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,120
audience would look like.

413
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,000
But this conversation is not likely to end with the bigot's rocked and admission that

414
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,600
he has entangled himself in a contradiction.

415
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Even if I should, by a miracle, succeed in convincing him of the worth of my utopia,

416
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,320
his reaction will be to regret his own previous lack of curiosity and imagination rather than

417
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,000
to regret his failure to spot his own presuppositions.

418
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,160
This section is about an argument of Albrecht Velmers who's associated with Habermas but

419
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,640
differs from him in various interesting ways.

420
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,280
I agree with Appel and Habermas that Perse was right in telling us to talk about discourse

421
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,800
rather than about consciousness, but I think that the only ideal presupposed by discourse

422
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,200
is that of being able to justify your beliefs to a competent audience.

423
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,440
As a coherentist, I think that if you can agree with other members of such an audience

424
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,840
about what is to be done, then you don't have to worry about your relationship to reality.

425
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,360
But everything depends upon what constitutes a competent audience.

426
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,400
Unlike Appel and Habermas, the moral I draw from Perse is that we philosophers who are

427
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,560
concerned with democratic politics should leave truth alone as a sublimely undiscussable

428
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,400
topic and instead turn to the question of how to persuade people to broaden the size

429
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,760
of the audience they take to be competent to increase the size of the relevant community

430
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,640
of justification.

431
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,640
The latter project is not only relevant to democratic politics, it pretty much is democratic

432
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,120
politics.

433
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,480
Appel and Habermas think that the demand to maximize the size of this community is already,

434
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,520
so to speak, built into communicative action.

435
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,480
This is the cash value of their claim that every assertion claims universal validity.

436
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,960
Albert Velmer, like me, rejects the convergentism which Habermas and Appel share with Buttman.

437
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,320
But he nevertheless accepts their claim that our truth claims, quote, transcend the context,

438
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,640
the local or cultural context in which they are raised.

439
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,160
My problem with Velmer, Appel and Habermas is that I don't see what the pragmatic force

440
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,800
of saying that an argument which, like all other arguments, convinces certain people and

441
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,780
not others is a good argument.

442
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,480
This seems like saying that a tool which, like all tools, is useful for certain purposes

443
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,120
but not others is a good tool.

444
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,060
Imagine the surgeon who, after unsuccessfully attempting to dig a tunnel out of his prison

445
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,720
cell with his scalpel saying, still, it's a good tool.

446
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,120
Imagine picture him saying, after unsuccessfully trying to convince his guards to let him escape,

447
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,000
so that he may resume his position as leader of the resistance, saying, still, they were

448
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,400
good arguments.

449
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,080
My problem is intensified when I ask myself whether my truth claims transcend my local

450
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,560
cultural context.

451
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,080
I have no clear idea whether they do or not because I can't see what transcendence means

452
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
here.

453
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,240
I can't even see what the point of taking my assertion as making a truth claim is.

454
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,480
When I believe that Pee and express this belief by asserting it in the course of a conversation,

455
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
am I making a claim?

456
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,080
What's the force of saying that?

457
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,480
What to saying that add to saying that I am, to speak with Purse, informing my interlocutor

458
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,280
about my habits of action, giving her hints about how to predict and control my future

459
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,440
conversational and non-conversational behavior.

460
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,920
Depending on the situation at hand, I may also be inviting her to disagree with me by telling

461
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,320
me about her different habits of action, suggesting that I'm prepared to give reasons

462
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,960
from my belief, trying to make a good impression on her and a thousand other things.

463
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,000
As Austin reminded us, there are lots of things I do when I make an assertion which can be

464
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,400
interpreted as part of the give and take between me and my interlocutor.

465
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,600
This give and take is a matter of, roughly, the reciprocal adjustment of our behavior,

466
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,800
the strategic coordination of that behavior in ways which may prove mutually profitable.

467
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,640
Of course, if somebody asks me after I have asserted Pee whether I believe that Pee is

468
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,360
true, I shall say yes.

469
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,120
But I shall wonder, as Wittgenstein did, what the point of that question was.

470
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,680
Is he questioning my sincerity?

471
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,640
Is he expressing incredulity about my ability to offer reasons from my belief?

472
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,080
I can try to straighten things out by asking the question to the spell out why he asks.

473
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,600
But he replies, I just wanted to be sure you are making a context-transcendent truth claim.

474
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,560
I'll be baffled.

475
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,080
What does he want to be reassured about, exactly?

476
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,400
What would it be like for me to make a context-dependent assertion?

477
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,640
Of course, in the trivial sense that an assertion may not always be applicable, all assertions

478
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
are context-dependent.

479
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,880
But what would it mean for the proposition asserted to be context-dependent, as opposed

480
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
to the speech act being context-dependent?

481
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm not sure how people like Habermas and Velmer, who've given up on correspondence

482
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,360
theories of truth and consequently can't distinguish between a claim to report a habit

483
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:29,320
of action and a claim to represent reality, can draw this distinction between context-dependence

484
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,840
and context-independence.

485
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,840
My best guess is that they believe that, in Velmer's words, quote, whenever we raise

486
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,440
a truth claim on the basis of what we take to be good arguments or compelling evidence,

487
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,040
we take the epistemic conditions prevailing here and now to be ideal in the following

488
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,800
sense.

489
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,640
We presuppose that no arguments or evidence will come up in the future which would put

490
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,080
our own truth claims into question.

491
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,640
Whereas Velmer also puts it, quote, relying upon reasons or evidences as compelling means

492
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,520
to exclude the possibility of being proved wrong as time goes on.

493
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,120
If that's what it takes to make a context-transcendent truth claim, then I have never made one.

494
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,960
I would not know how to exclude the possibility that Velmer described, nor would I know how

495
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,880
to presuppose that no arguments or evidence will turn up in the future which will cast

496
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,640
out on my belief.

497
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Relying once again on the fundamental pragmatist principle that any difference has to make

498
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,880
a difference to practice, I want to know whether this excluding or presupposing are things

499
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,080
I can decide to do or not to do.

500
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,360
If they are, I want to know more about how to go about doing them.

501
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,680
If they aren't, they seem to me empty.

502
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,000
I can make my point in another way by asking, what's the difference between a metaphysician

503
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,320
committed to a correspondence theory of truth, telling me that whether I know it or will

504
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,320
admit it or not, my assertions automatically willy-nilly amount to a claim to represent

505
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,680
reality accurately, and my fellow Perseans telling me that they automatically willy-nilly

506
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,800
amount to an exclusion of possibilities or a presupposition about what the future holds.

507
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,000
In both cases, I'm being told that I presuppose something which, even after considerable reflection,

508
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,520
I don't think I believe.

509
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,360
But the notion of presupposition, when it's extended to beliefs which the purported presupposer

510
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,600
astoutly denies, becomes hard to distinguish from the notion of re-description of person

511
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,000
A in person B's language.

512
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,400
If A can explain what I'm doing and why I'm doing it in her own terms, what right has

513
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,560
B got to keep on saying, no, what you, A, are really doing is so-and-so.

514
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,000
In the case at hand, we doians think we have a perfectly good way of describing our own

515
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,280
behavior, behavior of which Habermas approves, in ways which, as true terms, like universal,

516
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,880
unconditional, and transcendence.

517
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,200
It seems to me in the spirit of Perse's criticism of Descartes' make-believe doubt, to raise

518
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,840
the question of whether we are not dealing here with make-believe transcendence, a sort

519
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,720
of make-believe response to a make-believe doubt.

520
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,280
Real doubt, Perse said, comes when some concrete difficulty is envisaged if one acts according

521
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,560
to the habit which is the belief.

522
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,760
Such a difficulty might be, for example, having to seize asserting and believing some relevant

523
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,680
but conflicting proposition.

524
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,400
Real transcendence, I should say, occurs when I say, I am prepared to justify this belief,

525
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,720
not just to people who share the following premises with me, but to lots of other people

526
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,000
who don't share those premises but with whom I share a certain others.

527
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,960
The question whether I am so prepared is a concrete, practical question, whose answer

528
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,560
I determine by, for example, imaginatively previewing various other audience's responses

529
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,680
to my assertion and my subsequent behavior.

530
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,320
But such experiments and imagination obviously have limits.

531
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,960
I can't imagine myself defending my assertion to any possible audience.

532
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,640
In the first place, I can usually dream up audiences to whom it would be pointless to

533
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,080
try to justify my beliefs, try defending beliefs about justice in the antitholes or Nazi prison

534
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,560
guards or about quarks to Aristotle or about trigonometry to three-year-olds.

535
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,440
In the second place, no good pragmatist ever uses the term all possible.

536
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,680
He doesn't know how to imagine or discover the bounds of possibility.

537
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,520
Indeed, he can't figure out what the point of attempting such a feat would be.

538
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,480
Under what concrete circumstances would it be important to consider the difference between

539
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,280
all the x's I can think of and all possible x's?

540
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,760
How could that difference make a difference to practice?

541
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,920
I conclude that Delmer's way of distinguishing between context-dependent and context-independent

542
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,160
claims can't be made plausible, at least to pragmatists.

543
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,560
Since I can think of no better way, I think we should ask why Delmer, Appel and Habermas

544
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,840
think this distinction worth drawing.

545
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,860
The obvious answer is that they want to avoid what they call the relativism, which contextualism

546
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,480
purportedly entails.

547
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,280
So I turn now to what Delmer calls the antinomy of truth, the clash between relativist and

548
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,080
absolutist intuitions.

549
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,960
Over the beginning of his essay, Truth, Contingency and Modernity, Delmer writes his pause.

550
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,440
If there is irresolvable disagreement about the possibility of justifying truth claims,

551
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,280
about standards of argumentation or evidential support, e.g. between members of different

552
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,600
linguistic, scientific or cultural communities, may I still suppose that there are, somewhere,

553
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,880
the correct standards, the right criteria, in short, that there is an objective truth

554
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
of the matter.

555
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,360
Or should I rather think that truth is relative to cultures, languages, communities, or even

556
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,560
persons?

557
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,000
While relativism, the second alternative, appears to be inconsistent, absolutism, the

558
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,920
first alternative seems to imply metaphysical assumptions.

559
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,760
Let's call this the antinomy of truth.

560
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,360
Much important philosophical work has been done in the last decades to resolve this antinomy,

561
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,080
either by trying to show that absolutism need not be metaphysical, or by trying to show

562
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,040
that the critique of absolutism need not lead to relativism.

563
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,480
End of quote.

564
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
My problem with Delmer's antinomy is that I don't think that denying that there are

565
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,040
the correct standards should lead anybody to say that truth, as opposed to justification,

566
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,320
is relative to something.

567
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,360
As far as I can see, nobody would think that the critique of absolutism leads to relativism,

568
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,440
unless you thought that the only reason for justifying our beliefs to each other is that

569
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,040
such justification makes it more likely that our beliefs are true.

570
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,120
I don't think there's any reason to think that such justification makes it more likely

571
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,840
that our beliefs are true.

572
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,600
But I don't think that's a cause for concern, since I don't think that our practice of justifying

573
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,160
our beliefs needs justification.

574
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,920
If I'm right, that the only indispensable function of the word true, or any other indefinable

575
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,880
normative term, such as good or right, is to caution to warn against danger by making

576
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,280
gestures toward unpredictable situations, future audiences, future moral dilemmas, etc.,

577
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,440
then it doesn't make much sense to ask whether or not justification leads to truth.

578
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,600
Justification to more and more audiences leads to less and less danger of rebuttal, and

579
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,600
thus to less and less need for caution.

580
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,840
If I convince them, we often say to ourselves, I should be able to convince anybody.

581
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,480
But one would only say that it leads to truth if one could somehow project from the condition

582
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,840
to the uncondition, from all imaginable to all possible audiences.

583
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,400
Such a prediction makes some sense if one believes in convergence.

584
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,640
For such a belief, seems the space of reasons as finite and structured, so that as more

585
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,120
and more audiences are satisfied, more and more members of a finite set of possible objections

586
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,320
are eliminated.

587
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:38,120
One will be encouraged to see the space of reasons in this way if one is a representationalist,

588
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:42,960
because one will see reality, or at least the spatiotemporal hunk of reality relevant

589
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,800
to human concerns, as finite and as constantly shoving us out of error and toward truth,

590
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,600
discouraging inaccurate representations of itself and thereby producing increasingly

591
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,080
accurate ones.

592
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,120
But if one does not take knowledge to be accurate representation of reality, nor truth to be

593
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,000
correspondence to reality, then it's harder to be a convergentist and harder to think

594
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,520
of the space of reasons as finite and structured.

595
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,760
Filmar, it seems to me, wants to project from the condition our various experiences of success

596
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,720
in justifying our beliefs to the unconditioned truth.

597
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,160
The big difference between me and Velmer is that I think the answer to Velmer's question,

598
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,880
as a quote from Velmer, do our democratic and liberal principles define just one possible

599
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,480
political language game among others, is an unqualified yes.

600
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,600
Velmer, however, thinks, quote, a qualified no can be justified, and by justification

601
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:54,000
I now mean not justification for us, but justification period, end of quote.

602
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,320
As I see it, the very idea of justification period commits Velmer to the thesis that the

603
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,320
logical space of reason giving is finite and structured.

604
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,880
So I would urge him to abandon the latter thesis for the same reasons that he abandoned

605
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,880
Apples and Habermas's convergentism.

606
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,720
But oddly enough, the reasons these reasons are pretty much the reasons he gives for giving

607
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,080
his qualified no.

608
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,040
Velmer's central point in defense of this qualified no answer is one which I wholeheartedly

609
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:33,280
accept, namely that the very idea of incompatible and perhaps reciprocally unintelligible language

610
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,480
games is a pointless fiction, and that in real cases representatives of different traditions

611
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,760
and cultures can always find a way to talk over their differences.

612
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,280
I entirely agree with Velmer when he says, quote, rationality in any relevant sense of

613
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,440
the word cannot end at the borderline of closed language games since there is no such thing

614
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,560
as a closed language game.

615
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,080
My disagreement with Velmer starts when after a semicolon, Velmer finishes that sentence

616
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:10,760
with, but then the ethnocentric contextuality of all argumentation is quite well compatible

617
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,480
with the raising of truth claims which transcend the context, the local or cultural context

618
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,000
in which they are raised and in which they can be justified.

619
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,200
I should have finished that same sentence by saying, but then the ethnocentric contextuality

620
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,880
of all argumentation is quite well compatible with the claim that a liberal and democratic

621
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,040
society can bring together and include all sorts of diverse ethnoi, all sorts of diverse

622
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,360
local, cultural, social practices.

623
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,200
Here's a way of summing up the difference between me and Velmer.

624
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,000
We agree that one reason to prefer democracies is that they enable us to construct ever bigger

625
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,360
and better contexts of discussion, but I stop there and Velmer goes on.

626
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:07,440
He adds that this reason is not just a justification of democracy for us, but a justification period.

627
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,580
He thinks that the democratic and liberal principles of modernity should potcherority

628
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,520
be understood in a universalistic sense.

629
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,520
My problem, of course, is that I don't have the option of understanding them that way.

630
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,880
Pragmatists like me can't figure out how to tell whether we're understanding a justification

631
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,640
as just a justification for us or as a justification period.

632
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,480
This strikes me as like trying to tell whether I think of my scalpel or my computer as a

633
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,840
good tool for the task at hand or a good tool period.

634
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:49,960
At this point, however, one can imagine Velmer rejoining then so much the worse for pragmatism.

635
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Any view which makes you unable to understand a distinction everybody else understands

636
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,880
must have something wrong with it.

637
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,440
My rebuttal would be you're only entitled to that distinction as long as you can back

638
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,040
it up with a distinction between what seemed good reasons to us and what seemed good reasons

639
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,920
to something like an ahistorical Kantian tribunal of reason.

640
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,240
But you deprive yourself of that possibility when you gave up on convergentism and thus

641
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,560
gave up the non-metaphysical Frankfurt substitute for such a tribunal vis the idealization

642
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,680
called the undistorted communication situation.

643
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,640
I agree with Velmer that quote, democratic and liberal institutions are the only ones

644
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,040
which could possibly coexist with a recognition of contingency and still reproduce their own

645
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,160
legitimacy.

646
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,160
At least if one takes the term reproduce their own legitimacy to mean something like make

647
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,560
its view of the situation of human beings in the universe hang together with its political

648
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
practices.

649
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:00,520
But I don't think that the recognition of contingency serves as a justification period

650
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:07,360
for democratic politics because I don't think it does what Velmer says, namely, quote, destroys

651
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:16,320
the intellectual bases of dogmatism, foundationalism, authoritarianism and immoral and legal inequality.

652
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,160
This is because I don't think that dogmatism or moral inequality have intellectual bases.

653
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,440
If I am a bigoted proponent of the inequality of Blacks, women and homosexuals to straight

654
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,360
white males, I need not necessarily appeal to the denial of contingency by invoking a

655
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,640
metaphysical theory about the true nature of human beings.

656
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,000
I could do that, but I might also, when it came to philosophy, be a pragmatist.

657
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,680
A bigot and I can say the same Foucaultian, Nietzschean thing, that the only real question

658
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,520
is one of power.

659
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,280
The question of which community is going to inherit the earth, mine or my opponents?

660
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,200
One's choice of a community for that role is intertwined with one's sense of what counts

661
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,120
as a competent audience.

662
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,520
Do only Aryans count as a competent audience?

663
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,080
Do only Christians count as a competent audience?

664
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,520
Do only liberal democrats count as a competent audience?

665
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,800
The fact that there are no mutually unintelligible language games, the point Velmer insists on

666
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,560
and which Davidson, I think, effectively argues for, the fact that there are no mutually unintelligible

667
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:34,480
language games does not in itself do much to show that disputes between racists and anti-racists,

668
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,560
democrats and fascists, can be decided without resort to foes.

669
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:44,760
Both sides may agree that although they understand what each other says perfectly well and share

670
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,720
common views on most topics, including perhaps the recognition of contingency, the false

671
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,640
pseudo-fellow gocentrism and so on, there seems no prospect of reaching agreement on

672
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,000
the particular issue at hand.

673
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,120
So both sides say as they reach for their guns, it looks as if we'll have to fight it

674
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,880
out.

675
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,320
My answer to Velmer's question about whether our democratic and liberal principles define

676
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,680
just one possible political language game among others is yes.

677
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,240
If the force of the question is to ask whether there is something in the nature of discourse

678
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,360
which singles our game out.

679
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,120
I can't see what other force the question could have and I think so, I think we have

680
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,640
to rest content with saying that no philosophical thesis either about contingency or about truth

681
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,240
does anything decisive for democratic politics.

682
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,760
By decisive, I mean doing what Oppel and Habermas want to do, convicting the anti-democrat

683
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,120
of a performative self-contradiction.

684
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,280
The most that an insistence on contingency can do for democracy is to supply one more

685
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,920
debating point on the democratic side of the argument.

686
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,280
Just as the insistence that, for example, only the Aryan race is in tune with the intrinsic

687
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,840
necessary nature of things can supply one more debating point on the other side.

688
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,880
I can't take the latter point seriously but I don't think that there's anything self-contradictory

689
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:20,640
in the Nazis refusal to take me seriously so we may both have to reach for our guns.

690
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,120
Unlike Habermas, I don't think that disciplines like philosophy, linguistics, and developmental

691
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,760
psychology can do much for democratic politics.

692
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,640
I see the development of the social conventions in which Habermas and I both rejoice as a

693
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,960
lucky accident.

694
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,120
Still, I'd be happy to think I'd be wrong about this, that I'd be happy to think that

695
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,640
I was wrong about this.

696
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,600
Maybe the gradual development of these conventions, that is, the gradual development of the social

697
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:58,240
practices which make up the basis of liberal society, maybe the gradual development of

698
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,280
those conventions does, as Habermas thinks, illustrate a universal pattern of phylo or

699
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,720
ontogenetic development, a pattern captured by the rational reconstruction of competences,

700
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,040
offered by various human sciences, and illustrated by the transition from traditional to modern

701
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,280
rationalized societies.

702
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,440
But unlike Habermas, I should be unperturbed if the offers currently made by the human

703
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,920
sciences were withdrawn.

704
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,240
For example, if Chomsky's universalistic ideas about communicative competence were repudiated

705
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,760
by a connectionist revolution and artificial intelligence, I have a footnote saying that

706
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,280
Davidson's argument in his article, A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs, against the sort of

707
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:56,800
MIT language learning reconstruction of communicative competence in terms of Chomsky and fundamental

708
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:03,840
grammar seems to be, you know, this Davidsonian point that we don't really need the idea

709
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:10,400
of mastering a set of grammatical rules in order to understand language learning seems

710
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:18,000
to be being supported by connectionist programs in artificial intelligence.

711
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,960
I don't know whether this is true or not.

712
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,880
I just put it in as an example of a change in the opinion of linguists of an anti-Chomsky

713
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,400
revolution in linguistics, which it seems to me wouldn't greatly matter to philosophers

714
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:43,920
or political thinkers, but I think Habermas goes out on a limb in, you know, his attachment

715
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:52,280
to Chomsky and his use of Chomsky's notion of competence as a sort of structural device

716
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,960
for his own work.

717
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,640
I should be unreturbed if Chomsky's ideas were repudiated if Piaget's and Colberg's

718
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,240
empirical results proved to be unduplicatable and so on.

719
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,760
I don't see that it matters much whether there are actual patterns here.

720
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,840
I don't much care whether democratic politics is an expression of something deep or whether

721
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,080
it expresses nothing better than some hopes which popped from nowhere into the brains

722
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,600
of a few remarkable people like Socrates, Christ, Jefferson, and so on, and which for

723
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,400
unknown reasons became popular.

724
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,520
Habermas and Oppel think that the way to create a cosmopolitan community is to study the nature

725
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,320
of something called rationality, which all human beings share, something already present

726
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,840
within them but insufficiently acknowledged.

727
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:50,880
That's why they would be depressed if the offers made by Chomsky, Colberg, etc. were

728
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,000
in the course of time withdrawn.

729
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,800
But suppose we say that all that rationality amounts to, all that marks human beings off

730
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,400
from other species of animals, is the ability to use language and thus to have sentential

731
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,640
attitudes like beliefs and desires.

732
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,360
It seems plausible to add that there is no more reason to expect all the organisms which

733
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,640
share this ability to form a single community of justification than to expect such a community

734
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:25,000
to unite all the organisms able to walk long distances or to remain monogamous or to digest

735
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,520
vegetables.

736
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,120
One will not expect such a single community of justification to be created by the ability

737
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:37,280
to communicate if one takes the ability to use language to be, like the prehensile thumb,

738
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,880
just one more gimmick which organisms have developed to increase their chances of survival.

739
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,600
If we combine this Darwinian point of view with the holistic attitude toward intentionality

740
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:55,040
and language use found in Wittgenstein and Davidson, we shall say that there is no language

741
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,880
use without justification, no ability to believe without an ability to argue about what beliefs

742
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,880
to have.

743
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,880
But this is not to say that the ability to use language to have beliefs and desires entails

744
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:14,520
a desire to justify one's beliefs to every language using organism one encounters.

745
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,800
It's not to say that any language user who comes down the road will be treated as a member

746
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,240
of a competent audience.

747
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,160
On the contrary, human beings usually divide up into mutually suspicious, not mutually

748
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,840
unintelligible, communities of justification, mutually exclusive groups depending on the

749
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,920
presence or absence of sufficient overlap in belief and desire.

750
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,560
The principle source of conflict between human communities is the belief that I have no reason

751
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,480
to justify my beliefs to you and none in finding out what alternative beliefs you may have,

752
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:54,360
because you are, for example, an infidel, a foreigner, a woman, a child, a slave, a pervert,

753
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,880
or an untouchable.

754
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,160
In short, you're not one of us, not one of the real human beings, the paradigm human

755
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:09,240
beings, the ones whose persons and opinions are to be treated with respect.

756
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,600
The philosophical tradition has tried to stitch exclusivist communities together by saying

757
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,560
there's more overlap between infidels and true believers, masters and slaves, men and

758
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:24,060
women than you might have thought, for as Aristotle said, all human beings by nature

759
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,240
desire to know.

760
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,680
This desire brings them together in a universal community of justification.

761
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,960
To a pragmatist, however, this Aristotelian dictum seems thoroughly misleading.

762
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,160
It runs together three different things, the need to make one's beliefs coherent, the

763
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,440
need for the respective one's peers, and curiosity.

764
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,360
We pragmatists think that the reason people try to make their beliefs coherent is not

765
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,160
that they love truth, but because they can't help doing so.

766
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,880
Our minds can no more stand in coherence than our brains can stand whatever the neurochemical

767
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,440
substrate of such coherence may be.

768
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,000
Just as our neural networks are presumably both constrained and in part constructed by

769
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,960
something like the algorithms used in parallel distributed processing of information by computer

770
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,280
programmers, so our minds are constrained by the need to tie our beliefs and desires

771
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,160
together into a reasonably perspicuous whole.

772
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,880
That's why we can't, in James' unhappy expression, will to believe, believe what we like regardless

773
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,360
of what else we believe.

774
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,920
It's why, for example, we have such a hard time keeping our religious beliefs in a separate

775
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,680
compartment from our scientific ones and in isolating our respect for democratic institutions

776
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,640
from our contempt for many or most of our fellow voters.

777
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:50,000
The need to make one's beliefs coherent is for reasons familiar from Hagel, Mead and

778
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,720
Davidson not separable from the need for the respective our peers.

779
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,400
We have as hard a time tolerating the thought that everybody but ourselves is out of step

780
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,120
as we do the thought that we believe both P and not P.

781
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,800
We need the respect of our peers because we cannot trust our own beliefs nor maintain

782
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,040
our self-respect unless we're fairly sure that our conversational interlocutors agree

783
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:20,320
among themselves on such propositions as, he's not crazy, he's one of us, he may have

784
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:25,360
strange beliefs on some subjects, but he's basically sound and so on.

785
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,320
This interpenetration of the need to make one's beliefs coherent among themselves and

786
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:34,120
the need to make them coherent with most of those of one's peers results from the fact

787
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,920
that, as Wittgenstein said, to imagine a form of human life we have to imagine agreement

788
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,760
in judgments as well as in meanings.

789
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,120
Davidson brings out the considerations which support Wittgenstein's insight when he says,

790
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:53,880
quote, the ultimate source of both objectivity and communication is the triangle that by

791
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:01,720
relating speaker, interpreter, and the world determines the contents of thought and speech.

792
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,360
You would not know what you believe nor have any beliefs unless your belief had a place

793
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:11,480
in a network of beliefs and desires, but that network would also not exist where you and

794
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,000
others unable to pair off features of your non-human environment with assent to your

795
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,740
utterances by other language users, utterances caused as are yours by those very features.

796
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:27,580
The difference between the use which Davidson and I would like to make of Hegel's and Meade's

797
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:33,060
realization that ourselves are dialogical all the way down, that there is no private

798
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:40,180
core on which to build, and the use which Hoppe and Habermas make of this point can

799
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:45,940
be exhibited by looking at the sentence immediately following the one I just quoted from Davidson.

800
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:51,260
Davidson continues, given the source that is given that the source of both objectivity

801
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:59,460
and communication is this triangle, there is no room for a relativized concept of truth.

802
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,540
Davidson's point is that the only sort of philosopher who would take seriously the idea

803
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:10,060
that truth is relative to a context and particularly to a choice between human communities is one

804
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:16,120
who thinks that he or she can contrast being in touch with a human community with being

805
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,200
in touch with reality. But Davidson's point about there being no language without triangulation

806
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:27,880
means that this contrast can't be drawn. You can't have any language or any beliefs without

807
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:34,400
being in touch with both a human community and non-human reality. There's no possibility

808
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,320
of agreement without truth, nor of truth without agreement. Most of our beliefs must

809
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:45,400
be true, Davidson says, because a description to a person of mostly false beliefs would

810
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,480
mean either that we had mistranslated the person's marks and noises, or that she didn't,

811
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,760
in fact, have any beliefs, was not, in fact, speaking a language. Most of our beliefs must

812
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,280
be justified in the eyes of our peers for a similar reason. If they were not justified,

813
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,840
if our peers could not attribute to us a largely coherent web of beliefs and desires, they

814
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,760
would have to conclude that they had either misunderstood us, sorry, they would have to

815
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:16,680
conclude either that they had misunderstood us, or that we did not speak their language.

816
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,040
Coherence, truth, and community go together, not because truth is to be defined in terms

817
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:27,000
of coherence rather than correspondence, in terms of social practice rather than in terms

818
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,520
of coping with non-human forces, but simply because to ascribe a belief is automatically

819
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:39,760
to ascribe a place in a largely coherence of mostly true belief. But to say that there's

820
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,600
no contact via belief and desire with reality, no truth without community, is as yet to say

821
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:51,200
nothing about what sort of community is in question. A radically exclusivist community

822
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,440
made up of only the priests or the nobles or the males or the whites is quite as good

823
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,800
as any other sort of community for Davidsonian purposes. This is the difference between what

824
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,240
Davidson thinks you can get out of reflection on the nature of discourse and what Oppo and

825
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,840
Habermas think you can get out of it. The latter philosophers think that you can get

826
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,760
something more out of such reflection than the fact that there are neither beliefs nor

827
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,640
persons nor truth without justification in the eyes of a community. They think you can

828
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:25,040
get an argument in favor of the inclusivist project, an argument which says that people

829
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:31,120
who resist this project involve themselves in performative self-contradictions. By contrast,

830
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,800
Davidson thinks that any community of justification will do to make you a language user and a

831
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:41,200
believer, no matter how distorted Oppo and Habermas take communication within that community

832
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:47,200
to be. From Davidson's point of view, philosophy of language runs out before we reach the moral

833
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:55,600
imperatives which make up Oppo's discourse ethics. Oppo and Habermas run together the

834
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,960
need for coherence and for justification, which is required if one is to use language

835
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,240
at all, and a commitment to what they call universal validity, a commitment which can

836
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:11,240
only be consistently acted upon by aiming at the sort of domination-free communication

837
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:17,840
which is impossible as long as there are human communities which remain exclusivist. Davidson

838
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:23,040
and I have no use for the claim that any communicative action contains a claim to universal validity

839
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,400
because this so-called presupposition seems to us to have no role to play in the explanation

840
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:36,040
of linguistic behavior. It does, to be sure, play a part in the explanation of the behavior,

841
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,280
linguistic and other, of a small minority of human beings, those who belong to the liberal

842
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,240
universalistic and classivist tradition of the European Enlightenment. But this tradition,

843
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,160
to which Davidson and I are as much attached as Oppo and Habermas, derives no support from

844
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:56,760
reflection on discourse as such. We language users who belong to this minority tradition are

845
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,280
morally superior to those who don't, but those who don't are no less coherent in their use of

846
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:08,560
language. Oppo and Habermas invoke the presupposition of universal validity to get from a commitment

847
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,160
to justification to a willingness to submit one's beliefs to the inspection of any and every

848
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:20,000
language user, even a slave, even a black, even a woman. They see the desire for truth construed

849
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
as the desire to claim universal validity as the desire for universal justification, but as I see

850
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,720
it there, inferring invalidly from, you can't use language without invoking consensus within a

851
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:37,200
community of other language users to, you can't use language consistently without enlarging that

852
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:43,280
community to include all users of language. Because I see this inference as invalid, I think that

853
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,800
the only thing which can play the role in which Aristotle, Perse, Oppo and Habermas have cast

854
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,680
the desire for knowledge, and thus for truth, is curiosity. I use this term to mean the urge to

855
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:01,040
expand one's horizons of inquiry in all areas, ethical as well as logical and physical, so as

856
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,520
to encompass new data, new hypotheses, new terminologies and the like. This urge brings

857
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:13,440
cosmopolitanism and democratic politics in its train. The more curiosity you have, the more

858
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,240
interest you will have in talking to foreigners, infidels, and anybody else who claims to know

859
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:25,800
something you don't know to have some ideas you have not yet had. Section 6, communicating or

860
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:33,000
educating. If one sees the desire and possession of both truth and justification as inseparable from

861
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,720
using language, while still resisting the thought that this desire can be used to convict members of

862
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:44,920
exclusivist human communities, our performative self-contradiction, then one will see inclusivist

863
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,720
communities as based on contingent human development, such as the twitchy curiosity of the

864
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:55,120
sort of eccentrics we call intellectuals, the desire for intermarriage beyond tribal or caste

865
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:00,480
boundaries produced by erotic obsession, the need to trade across such boundaries produced by lack

866
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,200
of, for example, salt or gold within one's own territory, the possession of enough wealth,

867
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:12,040
security, education, and independence, so that one's self-respect no longer depends upon membership

868
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:19,280
in an exclusivist community, e.g. on not being an infidel or a slave or a woman and the like. The

869
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,440
increased communication between previously exclusivist communities produced by such

870
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:29,600
contingent human developments may gradually create universality, but I can't see any sense in which

871
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:36,680
it recognizes a previously existent universality. Philosophers like Habermas who worry about the

872
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:41,480
anti-enlightenment overtones of the views they call contextualist think that since

873
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:48,280
justification is, and obviously context relative notion, one justifies to a given audience and

874
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:54,480
the same justification won't work for all audiences, it endangers the ideal of human fraternity.

875
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:03,080
Habermas regards contextualism as only the flip side of logocentrism. He sees contextualists as

876
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:10,000
negative metaphysicians infatuated by diversity and says that, quote, the metaphysical priority of

877
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:16,360
unity above plurality and the contextualist priority of plurality above unity are secret

878
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:25,640
accomplices. The idea is that post-moderns in the tradition of Nietzsche, including me,

879
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:34,480
for these purposes, are plurality freaks in the same way that the western metaphysical tradition

880
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,160
condemned by Heidegger and Derrida were unity freaks, whereas Habermas is neither a unity

881
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:47,080
freak nor a plurality freak but just right. I agree with Habermas that it's as pointless to

882
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,600
prize diversity as to prize unity, but I disagree with him that we can use the pragmatics of

883
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:58,400
communication to do the job which metaphysicians hope to achieve by appealing to the Plotinian

884
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,000
one or to the transcendental structure of self-consciousness. My reasons for disagreement

885
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,880
are those offered by Walzer, McCarthy, Ben Hubby, Velmer, and others. Reasons nicely summed up in

886
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,120
an article by Michael Kelly that I cite in the footnote. Habermas argues for the thesis that,

887
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:24,160
quote, the unity of reason only remains perceptible in the plurality of its voices. As the possibility

888
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:30,400
and principle of passing from one language to another, a passage that no matter how occasional is

889
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:36,960
still comprehensible. This possibility of mutual understanding, which is now guaranteed only

890
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,200
procedurally and is realized only transitorally, forms the background for the existing diversity

891
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:50,480
of those who encounter one another even when they fail to understand one another. I agree with Habermas

892
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,560
against Lyotav Foucault and others that there are no incommensurable languages, that any language

893
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,080
can be learned by one who is able to use any other language that Davidson is right in denouncing

894
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:08,000
the very idea of a conceptual scheme. But I disagree with him about the relevance of this point to

895
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:16,240
the utility of the ideas of universal validity and objective truth. Habermas says that, quote,

896
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:23,040
what the speaker here and now in a given context asserts as valid transcends according to the

897
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:31,600
sense of his claim all contexts dependent merely local standards of validity. As I said before,

898
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,600
I can't see what transcends means here. If it means that he's claiming to say something true,

899
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,760
then the question is whether it makes any difference whether you say that a sentence

900
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:47,760
s is true or whether you simply offer a justification for it by saying, here are my reasons for

901
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,440
believing s. Habermas thinks there's a difference because he thinks that when you assert s, you

902
01:15:53,440 --> 01:16:00,880
claim truth, you claim truth, you claim to represent the real and that reality transcends context.

903
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:08,320
I quote, with the concept of reality to which every representation necessarily refers, we

904
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,640
presuppose something transcendent. Here, in my view, is where the notion of representation

905
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:24,320
raises its ugly head in Habermas and offers us a reason for never, never saying that sentences

906
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:31,040
represent reality. Habermas tends to take for granted that truth claims or claims to represent

907
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:36,240
accurately and to be suspicious of those who, like Davidson and myself, give up on the notion

908
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:42,160
of linguistic representation. He follows sellers in being a coherentist rather than a skeptic

909
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,600
or a foundationalist, but he's dubious about the move I want to make from coherentism to

910
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:54,800
anti-representationalism. He commends Purse over Socio because Purse, quote, examines expressions

911
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:01,680
from the point of view of their possible truth and at the same time from that of their communicability.

912
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:09,040
He goes on to say, quote, from the perspective of its capacity for being true, an acertoric

913
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,560
sentence stands in an epistemic relation to something in the world. It represents a state of

914
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:20,000
affairs. At the same time, from the perspective of its employment in a communicative act,

915
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,680
it stands in a relation to a possible interpretation by a language user. It's suitable for the

916
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:31,360
transmission of information. My own view, which I take from Davidson, is that you can give up the

917
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:37,680
notion of an epistemic relation to something in the world and just rely on the ordinary causal

918
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:43,840
relations which bind utterances together with the otterer's environments. The idea of representation

919
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,120
on this view adds nothing to the notion of transmission of information, or more exactly,

920
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:55,280
it adds nothing to the notion of taking part in the discursive practice of justifying one's assertions.

921
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,400
Habermas sees Putnam as, like himself, defending a third position over against the metaphysics of

922
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:08,720
unity on the one hand, and people like me, the enthusiasts for incommensurability on the other.

923
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,080
He thinks I'm an enthusiast for incommensurability. He defines this third position as, quote,

924
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:21,120
the humanism of those who continue the Kantian tradition by seeking to use the philosophy

925
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,520
of language to save a concept of reason that is skeptical and post-metaphysical.

926
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,200
Putnam and Habermas have offered similar criticisms of my attempt to get rid of a

927
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:36,560
specifically epistemic concept of reason, the concept according to which one is rational only

928
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,120
if one tries to represent reality accurately, and to replace it by the purely moral idea of

929
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,880
solidarity. My central disagreement with both Habermas and Putnam is whether,

930
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,000
sorry, is over the question of whether the regulative ideas of undistorted communication

931
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,760
or accurate representation of reality can do any more for the ideals of the French Revolution

932
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:08,320
than the bare context-dependent notion of justification. Some people care about defending

933
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:13,280
their assertions only to a few people, and some care, or say they care, about defending their

934
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,440
assertions to everyone. I'm not thinking here of the distinction between specialized technical

935
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,480
discourse and non-technical discourse. Rather, the distinction I want is the one between people

936
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,840
who want to defend their views to all people who share certain attributes, for example devotion to

937
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,800
the ideals of the French Revolution or membership in the Aryan race, and those who say they want

938
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,560
to justify their view to every actual and possible language user. There are certainly people who say

939
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,760
that the latter is what they want, but I'm not sure they really mean it. Do they want to justify

940
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:51,040
their views to language users who are four years old? Well, perhaps they do in the sense that they

941
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,800
would like to educate four-year-olds to the point at which they could appreciate the arguments for

942
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:03,200
and against views in question. Do they want to justify them to intelligent but convinced Nazis,

943
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,320
people who believe that the first thing to find out is whether the view under discussion is tainted

944
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,800
by the Jewish ancestry of its inventors or propounders? Well, perhaps they do in the sense

945
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,840
that they would like to convert these Nazis into people who have doubts about the advisability

946
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,120
of a Jew-free Europe and the infallibility of Hitler, and therefore are more or less willing

947
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:31,280
to listen to arguments for positions associated with Jewish thinkers. But in both cases, what

948
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:36,560
they want seems to me best described not as wanting to justify their view to everybody,

949
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,160
but as wanting to create an audience to whom they would have a sporting chance of justifying their

950
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:48,880
view. Let me use the distinction between arguing with people and educating people to abbreviate

951
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,240
the distinction I've just drawn. The distinction between proceeding on the assumption that people

952
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:00,240
will follow your arguments and knowing that they cannot but hoping to alter them so that they can.

953
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:08,000
If all education were a matter of argument, this distinction would collapse. But unless one broadens

954
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,560
the term argument beyond recognition, a lot of education is not. In particular, a lot of it is

955
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:20,080
simple appeal to sentiment. The distinction between such appeal and argument is fuzzy,

956
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,680
but I take it nobody would say that making an unregenerate Nazi watch films of the opening

957
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:31,840
of the concentration camps or making her read the diary of Anne Frank counts as arguing with her.

958
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,320
People interested in democratic politics both cherish the ideal of human fraternity

959
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:45,920
and cherish the idea of the universal availability of education. When asked about the education we

960
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:52,560
have in mind, we often say that it is education in critical thinking in the ability to talk over

961
01:21:52,560 --> 01:22:01,280
the pros and cons of any view. We oppose critical thinking to ideology and say that we oppose

962
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:07,840
ideological education of the sort which the Nazis inflicted on German youth. But we thereby

963
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,760
leave ourselves wide open to Nietzsche's scornful suggestion that we are simply inculcating our own

964
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:20,160
ideology, the ideology of what he calls Socrates. The issue between me and Habermas I think boils

965
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:26,160
down to a disagreement about what to say to Nietzsche at this point. I should reply to Nietzsche

966
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:33,040
by conceding that there is no non-local, non-contextual way to draw the distinction between ideological

967
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,920
education and non-ideological education because there's nothing to say to my use of the term reason

968
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,240
that could not be replaced by the way we wet western liberals the heirs of Socrates and the

969
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:52,240
French Revolution conduct ourselves. I agree with McIntyre and Michael Kelly that all reasoning,

970
01:22:52,240 --> 01:23:00,640
both in physics and ethics, is tradition bound. Habermas thinks this an unnecessary concession

971
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:06,240
and more generally thinks that my cheerful ethnocentrism can be avoided by thinking through what

972
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:13,520
he calls the symmetrical structure of perspectives built into every speech situation. The issue

973
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,560
between Habermas and myself thus comes to a head when he takes up my suggestion that we drop the

974
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,680
notions of rationality and objectivity and instead just discuss the kind of community we want to create.

975
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,880
He paraphrases this suggestion by saying that I want to treat the aspiration for objectivity as

976
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:39,520
quote simply the desire for as much intersubjective agreement as possible, namely the desire to expand

977
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:47,520
the referent of for us to the greatest possible extent. Habermas then paraphrases one of Putnam's

978
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,840
objections to me by asking quote, can we explain the possibility of the critique and self critique

979
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:00,880
of established practices of justification if we do not take the idea of the expansion of our

980
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:08,640
interpreted horizon seriously as an idea and if we do not connect this idea with the intersubjectivity

981
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,920
of an agreement that allows precisely for the distinction between what is current for us and

982
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:22,080
what is current for them. Habermas enlarges on this point by saying quote, the merging of interpretive

983
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:29,760
horizons does not signify an assimilation to us, rather it must mean a convergence steered through

984
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:37,680
learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have

985
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:45,120
to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent. For learning itself

986
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:53,680
belongs neither to us or to them, both sides are caught up on it in the same way. Even in the most

987
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,360
difficult processes of reaching understanding all parties appeal to the common reference point

988
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:05,360
of a possible consensus even if this reference point is projected in each case from within

989
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:11,840
their own context. For although they may be interpreted in various ways and applied according

990
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:17,520
to different criteria concepts like truth rationality or justification play the same

991
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:25,280
grammatical role in every linguistic community. End of quote. The note of the argument is I think

992
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:30,720
a disagreement about how much help for democratic politics can be gotten out of what Habermas here

993
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:36,320
calls grammar. As I said earlier I think that all we can get out of the grammar of the words true

994
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:45,360
and rational is the same as what we get out of a rather thin idea of justification. This thin idea

995
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,880
is the one we get when we answer the question where does the line come between causing people to

996
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,120
adjust their behavior by persuasion by working on their beliefs and desires and doing so by other

997
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:03,920
means. Unlike Foucault and some others I think it's both possible and important to draw a line here.

998
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,680
I don't think it helpful to extend the term violence as widely as Foucault extended it.

999
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,920
Whatever we're doing when we make Nazis look at pictures of concentration camp survivors it isn't

1000
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:22,080
violence anymore than it was violence to educate the Hitler youth to believe the Jews were worthless

1001
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:29,040
Berman. The inevitable fuzziness of the line between persuasion and violence causes problems

1002
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:35,120
however when we come to the question of education. We're reluctant to say that the Nazis used

1003
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:42,560
persuasion on the Hitler youth since we have two criteria of persuasion. One is simply using

1004
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:49,200
words rather than blows or other forms of physical pressure. One can imagine with a bit of distortion

1005
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:55,600
of history that in this sense only persuasion was employed on the Hitler youth. The second

1006
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:02,320
criterion of persuasion includes abstention from words like stop asking these stupid questions

1007
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,440
about whether there aren't some good Jews questions which make me doubt your area and

1008
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:13,600
consciousness and ancestry or the Reich will find another use for you. Those are not blows but one

1009
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:20,640
might say it isn't exactly persuasion either it's you know threats or something you know something

1010
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:30,400
that doesn't quite deserve the name persuasion. Another example is abstention from not assigning

1011
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:36,400
their stigma to one student. Unsecretic methods of this latter sort are the kind which Habermas

1012
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,120
would say do not respect the symmetrical relationships of participants in discourse.

1013
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,800
Habermas clearly thinks that there's something in the grammar of concepts like truth rationality

1014
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:52,880
and justification which tell us not to use methods of the latter sort. He would presumably grant

1015
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:58,480
that the use of such words is language use but he needs a category of distorted language use or

1016
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:06,000
distorted communication to explain that it is so to speak ungrammatical language use. Immediately

1017
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:13,760
after the passage I quoted about grammar Habermas says quote all languages offer the possibility

1018
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,760
of distinguishing what is true and what we hold to be true. The supposition of a common objective

1019
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:26,160
world is built into the pragmatics of every single linguistic usage and the dialogue roles of every

1020
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:35,360
speech situation enforce a symmetry in participant perspective. A bit later he says quote from the

1021
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:41,120
possibility of reaching understanding linguistically we can read off a concept of situated reason that

1022
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:47,040
is given voice and validity claims that are both context dependent and transcendent. He then

1023
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:53,440
approvingly quotes Putnam as saying reason is in this sense both imminent not to be found outside

1024
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:59,920
of concrete language games and institutions and transcendent i.e. a regulative idea that we use

1025
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:07,280
to criticize the conduct of all activities and institutions. It seems to me that the regulative

1026
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:13,760
idea that we we wet liberals we heirs of the enlightenment we socrates most frequently used

1027
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:20,960
to criticize the conduct of various conversational partners is the concept of needing education

1028
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:28,160
in order to outgrow their primitive fears hatreds and superstitions. This is the concept the victorious

1029
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:34,000
allied armies used when they said about reeducating the citizens of occupied Germany and Japan.

1030
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:40,000
It's also the one which was used by American school teachers who had read Dewey and were

1031
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,840
concerned to get students to think scientifically and rationally about such matters as the origin

1032
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,920
of the species and sexual behavior that is to get the students to read Darwin and Freud without

1033
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,880
disgust or incredulity. It is a concept which I like most Americans who teach humanities or social

1034
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,080
science in colleges and universities use when we hope that the students who enter as bigoted

1035
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,560
religious fundamentalists will leave college with views more like our own. What's the relation of

1036
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,800
this idea to the regulative idea of reason which Putnam believes to be transcendent and which Habermas

1037
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:22,480
believes to be discoverable within the grammar of concepts in a limitable from our description

1038
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:28,480
of the making of assertions? The answer to that question depends upon how much the reeducation

1039
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:34,400
of Nazis and fundamentalists has to do with merging interpretive horizons and how much with

1040
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,800
replacing such horizons. The fundamentalist parents of my fundamentalist students think that the

1041
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:47,440
entire liberal establishment is engaged in a conspiracy. Had they read Habermas these people

1042
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:52,800
would say that the typical communication situation in American college classrooms or at least my

1043
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:59,040
classroom is no more hair shots fly no more domination free than that in the Hitler Youth Camp.

1044
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,640
These parents have a point. Their point is that we liberal teachers no more feel in a symmetrical

1045
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:12,160
communication situation when we talk with our fundamentalist students than do kindergarten

1046
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:18,560
teachers with their students. In both college classrooms and kindergartens it is equally difficult

1047
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:24,560
for the teachers to feel that what is going on is what Habermas calls a convergence steered through

1048
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:31,360
learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have

1049
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:36,720
to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent.

1050
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,560
When we American college teachers encounter religious fundamentalists we do not consider the

1051
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:48,800
possibility of reformulating our own practices of justification so as to give more authority

1052
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,840
to the weight of the Christian scriptures more weight to the authority of the Christian scriptures.

1053
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:59,120
Instead we do our best to convince these persons of the benefits of secularization.

1054
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:05,360
We assign for example first person accounts of growing up homosexual to our homophobic students

1055
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:10,560
for the same reasons that German school teachers in the post-war period assigned the diary of Anne

1056
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:17,280
Frank. Putnam and Habermas can rejoin that we teachers do our best to be socratic to get our

1057
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:24,320
job of reeducation secularization and liberalization done by conversational exchange. That's true up

1058
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:30,560
to a point but what about assigning books like Black Boy the Diary of Anne Frank and a Boy's Life.

1059
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:37,040
The racist or fundamentalist parents of our students say that in a truly democratic society

1060
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:42,400
the students should not be forced to read books by such people. Black people, Jewish people,

1061
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:47,360
homosexual people and so on. They'll protest that these books are being jammed down their

1062
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:52,960
children's throats. I can't see how to reply to this charge without saying something like

1063
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:59,840
there are credentials for admission to our democratic society. Credentials which we liberals

1064
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:06,400
have been making steadily more stringent by doing our best to excommunicate racist male chauvinist

1065
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:13,760
homophobes and so on. You have to be educated in order to be a citizen of our society, a participant

1066
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:20,160
in our conversation, someone with whom we can envisage merging our horizons. So we're going to go

1067
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:25,360
right on trying to discredit you in the eyes of your children, trying to strip your fundamentalist

1068
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,200
religious community of dignity, trying to make your views seem silly rather than discussable.

1069
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,440
We are not so inclusivist as to tolerate intolerance such as yours.

1070
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:42,400
I have no trouble offering this reply because I don't claim to make the distinction between

1071
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:48,480
education and conversation on the basis of anything except loyalty to a particular community.

1072
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:55,120
A community whose interests required re-educating the Hitler youth in 1945 and re-educating the

1073
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:01,920
children of Southwestern Virginia in 1996. I don't see anything hair-shafts fly about my

1074
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,680
handling of my fundamentalist students. I think those students are lucky to find themselves under

1075
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:14,160
the hair-shaft of people like me and have escaped from their rather frightening and dangerous parents.

1076
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,360
So I think that the handling of such students is a problem for Putnam and Habermals.

1077
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,960
It seems to me that I'm just as provincial and contextualist as the Nazi teachers who made

1078
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:31,120
their students read their stoma. The only difference is that I serve a better cause. I come from a

1079
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:40,560
better province. I recognize, of course, that domination-free communication is only a regulative

1080
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:46,960
ideal never to be attained in practice. But unless a regulative ideal makes a difference to practice,

1081
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:52,480
it isn't good for much. So I ask, is there an ethics of discourse which lets me assign the

1082
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,680
books I want to assign, but makes no reference to the local and ethnocentric considerations

1083
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:03,520
which I should cite to justify my pedagogic practices? Can you get such an ethics out of

1084
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:10,240
the notions of reason, truth, and justification, or do you have to load the dyes? Can I invoke

1085
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:17,120
universalistic notions in defense of my action as well as local ones? Like McIntyre, Ben Habib,

1086
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:22,000
Kelly, and others, I think that you have to smuggle some provinciality into your universals

1087
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,760
before they do you any good. We think this for the same sorts of reasons as Hegel thought

1088
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,360
you had to smuggle in some provinciality, some ethical substance, before you could get any use

1089
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:39,280
out of Kant's notion of unconditional moral obligation. In particular, you have to smuggle

1090
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:46,160
in some rule like no putative contribution to a conversation can be rejected simply because it

1091
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:51,680
comes from somebody who has some attribute which can vary independently of his or her opinions

1092
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:58,800
and attribute like being Jewish or black or homosexual. I call this rule provincial because

1093
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,920
it violates the intuitions of a lot of people outside the province in which we heirs of the

1094
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:10,320
Enlightenment run the educational institutions. It violates what they would describe as their

1095
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:18,160
moral intuitions. I'm reluctant to admit that these are moral intuitions and should prefer to

1096
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:24,000
call them revolting prejudices. But I don't think that any in the grammar of the term moral

1097
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
intuition or revolting prejudice helps us to reach agreement on this point, nor can I see

1098
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,200
that a theory of rationality, abandoning the hopeless quest to talk in philosophy, find

1099
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,640
politically neutral premises, premises which can be justified to anybody from which to infer

1100
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:46,240
an obligation to pursue democratic ethics. Dropping that question would let us admit

1101
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:52,320
in Velmer's formula that democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language

1102
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:58,320
game, among others. Such an admission would be in line with the Darwinian idea that the

1103
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,840
inclusivist project is no more rooted in something larger than itself than, say, the project of

1104
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,840
replacing ideographic by alphabetic writing or representing three spatial dimensions on a two

1105
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:16,560
dimensional surface. All three of these were good, immensely fruitful ideas, but none of them need

1106
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:24,080
universalistic backup. They can stand on their own feet. If we abandon the idea of philosophy

1107
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:29,360
which manages to be both politically neutral and politically relevant, we could start asking the

1108
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:34,160
question, given that we want to be ever more inclusivist, what should the public rhetoric of our

1109
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:40,000
society be like? How different should it be from the public rhetoric of previous societies?

1110
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:46,960
Habermas's implicit answer to this question is that we should hang on to a good many Kantian ideas

1111
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:53,600
about the connection between universality and moral obligation. Dewey, however, was willing to move

1112
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:59,840
much further away from Kant. Though he would have heartily agreed with Habermas that Aristotle's

1113
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:06,240
political vocabulary was unable to capture the spirit of democratic politics, he did not like

1114
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:11,520
the distinction between morality and prudence, which Habermas thinks essential, and on this point

1115
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,520
he would have thought Aristotle preferable. Dewey thought that the Kantian notion of unconditional

1116
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,680
obligation, like the notion of unconditionality itself and of universality and so far as that

1117
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:29,600
idea is implicitly accompanied by that of unconditional necessity, could not survive Darwin.

1118
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,480
Whereas Habermas thinks that we need what he calls the reconstructive sciences designed to grasp

1119
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:42,560
universal competences in order to break out of what he calls the hermeneutic circle in which the

1120
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,720
geist is fissonshaft and as well as the interpretive social sciences are trapped, Dewey did not feel

1121
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:55,040
trapped. This was because he saw no need to resolve attention between facticity and validity.

1122
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:02,320
He saw that tension as a philosopher's fiction, as a result of separating out two

1123
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:08,160
parts of the situation for no good, that is to say no practical reason, and then complaining that

1124
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:14,960
they can't be put back together again. For him, all obligations were situational and conditional.

1125
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,880
This refusal to be unconditional led Dewey to be charged with relativism.

1126
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:28,240
If relativism just means failure to find the use for the notion of context independent validity,

1127
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:36,560
then the charge was entirely justified. But no roads lead from this failure to an inability

1128
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:42,640
to engage in democratic politics unless one thinks that such politics require us to deny

1129
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:49,040
that in Dewey's formula, democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language

1130
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:54,640
game among others. The question about universality is for Dewey just the question of whether

1131
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,920
democratic politics can start from an affirmation rather than a denial of that claim.

1132
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:06,720
I don't think we can get much further in debating that question by talking about either modernity

1133
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:11,760
or reason. The question of whether Hegel should have stuck to the topic of reason

1134
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,360
by developing a theory of communicative reason, or should instead have dropped the topic and

1135
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:23,120
simply politicized philosophy, is not going to be settled by looking more closely at the grammar

1136
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:29,760
of words like true rational and argument. I'm referring here to a passage in Habermas's

1137
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:35,280
Philosophical Discourse of Modernity where he says, Hegel had this great opportunity.

1138
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:41,120
If he had gone on to become, let us say, random and developed a theory of communicative reason,

1139
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,480
he would have had it made. But because he was stuck with the philosophy of consciousness,

1140
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:54,560
he missed the chance and we had to wait for another 150 years before Habermas and random came along

1141
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:02,000
with a theory of communicative reason. Neither is the question of whether philosophers like

1142
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,480
Annette Beyer are right in suggesting that we set Kant aside and go back to Hume's attempt to

1143
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:15,600
describe reason in terms of condition sentiment rather than unconditional obligation. That is,

1144
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:21,840
whether Beyer is right in her view of Kant isn't to be settled by thinking harder about what we

1145
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:29,520
mean by true rational argument. Although we don't, if I'm right, need a theory of rationality,

1146
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:35,600
we do need a narrative of maturation. As I see it, the deepest disagreement between Habermas and

1147
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:40,720
myself is about whether the distinction between the unconditional and the conditional in general

1148
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,680
and the distinction between morality and prudence in particular is a mark of maturity

1149
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:51,360
or a transitional stage on the way to maturity. One of the many points on which Dewey agreed

1150
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:57,840
with Nietzsche was that it was the latter. Dewey thought that the desire for universality,

1151
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:04,000
unconditionality, and necessity was undesirable because it led one away from the practical problems

1152
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,400
of democratic politics into a never-never land of theory. Kant and Habermas think it's a desirable

1153
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:16,080
desire, one which one shares, only when one reaches the highest level of moral development.

1154
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,080
In this paper, I've tried to show how things look when one puts democratic politics in the

1155
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:28,320
context of Dewey's narrative of maturation. I can't offer anything remotely approaching a

1156
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:35,360
knockdown argument based on commonly accepted premises for this narrative. The best I could do

1157
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:42,080
by way of further defense of my view would be to tell a fuller story, encompassing more topics,

1158
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:47,200
in order to show how post-Nichie and European philosophy looks from a Dewey an angle rather

1159
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:53,840
than a universalistic one. This is something I've tried to do in bits and pieces in various

1160
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,520
articles. I think that narratives are a perfectly fair means of persuasion and that Habermas has

1161
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:06,080
blocked the philosophical discourse of modernity and Dewey is the quest for certainty, like,

1162
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:15,200
for example, Kant's What is Enlightenment and Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history

1163
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:21,920
are both admirable illustrations of the power of narratives of maturation. My reasons for

1164
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:27,360
preferring Dewey's to Habermas's narrative are not that I think Dewey got truth and rationality

1165
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:32,960
right and that Habermas gets them wrong. I think that there's nothing to be gotten right or wrong

1166
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:39,600
here. At this level of abstraction concepts like truth, rationality, and maturity are up for grads.

1167
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:45,360
The only thing that matters is which way every shaping them will in the long run make them more

1168
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:52,000
useful for democratic politics. Concepts are, as Wittgenstein taught us, uses of words.

1169
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:57,280
Philosophers have long wanted to understand concepts, but the point is to change them,

1170
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:03,360
so as to make them serve our purposes better. Habermas's, Oppel's, Putnam's, and Velmer's

1171
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:08,480
linguistification of Kantian concepts is one suggestion about how to make these

1172
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:15,600
Kantian concepts more useful. Dewey's and Davidson's thoroughgoing anti-Kantian naturalism is another

1173
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,200
suggestion.
