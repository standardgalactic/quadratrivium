1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
If we took a poll among professional teachers of philosophy on the question, who is the

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,920
most important living philosopher, it's not at all obvious, to me at least, who would

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,520
get the most votes. But we can be fairly sure about some of the names that would be in the

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,120
top half dozen. Quine, Popper, Jean-Paul Sartre, Chomsky probably, though strictly speaking,

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,640
he's not exactly a philosopher. Well, the first of those names, and one on which I'd

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
lay pretty short odds, is that of Willard Van Orman Quine, one of the professors of

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,920
philosophy at Harvard. Quine was born in 1908 and is still highly productive, so he's had

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,000
a long career, and it's by no means over yet. He's published innumerable articles and

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,960
over a dozen books, the best known of which are From a Logical Point of View, published

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:08,120
in 1953, and Word and Object, published in 1960. First and foremost, he's a logician,

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,440
and the original contributions to the subject which made him famous are for the most part

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,280
highly technical and not really accessible to the layman, though they always had their

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,520
ultimate roots in problems fundamental to philosophy. However, in the latter part of

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,360
his career, he's become more overtly interested in philosophy in a more general sense, and

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,720
I thought it would be uniquely valuable in this program to have a philosopher at the

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,560
very summit of world reputation talking about the basics of philosophy and of his own activity.

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,760
Professor Quine, what do you regard as the central task or tasks of philosophy?

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,200
I think a philosophy is concerned with our knowledge of the world and the nature of the

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,200
world. I think a philosophy is attempting to round out the system of the world as Newton

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,880
put it. There have been philosophers who have thought of philosophy as somehow separate

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:16,160
from science and as providing a firm basis on which to build science. But this, I consider

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,920
an empty dream, science, much of science is firmer than philosophy is or can even perhaps

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,720
aspire to be. I think a philosophy is continuous with science even as a part of science.

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,880
Well, if it's continuous with science and even part of science, how does it differ from

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:42,720
the rest of science? It differs in generality and in abstractness. Science is a continuum

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,680
extending from history and engineering and at one end, if we think of science broadly,

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:03:01,760
to such abstract pursuits as philosophy and mathematics at the other. Philosophy considers

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,560
the question of the nature of cause, for instance, where physics contends itself with finding

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,000
causal relations between specific sorts of events, biology between other sorts of events.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,320
Again, whereas the zoologist will tell us that there are wombats and the physicist will

31
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,520
tell us that there are electrons. The mathematician will tell us there are no end of prime numbers.

32
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,320
The philosopher is interested rather in what sorts of things there are altogether. In these

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,720
ways that philosophy is more abstract in general. In other words, the philosopher is investigating

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,760
what constitutes the connective tissue of everyone's thoughts, including other people's

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,760
thoughts, so that the physicist is trying to find out whether or not A causes B, but

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,280
the philosopher is saying, but what does it mean to say that anything causes anything?

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,960
The physicist is trying to find out, say, what particular subatomic particles there are and

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,240
the philosopher says, but what does it mean to say of anything that it exists? It's at this

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,280
level of complete generality that the philosophers' investigations occur. Is that right? Now, do

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,960
you include in this or do you exclude from it the age-old questions of how the world

41
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:25,080
got here in the first place or how life began? I exclude these from philosophy. How the world

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,280
began is a problem for the physicist and astronomer, and of course there have been conjectures from

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,120
that quarter. How life began is a problem for the biologist on which he's made notable progress

44
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,000
in recent years. Why the world began, why life began, on the other hand, I think, are pseudo

45
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,320
questions, because I can't, I can't imagine what an answer would look like.

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,440
And you think that because there is no conceivable answer to these questions, they are meaningless

47
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,480
questions. Yes, yes, yes. So in other words, you regard the central tasks of philosophy as the

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,200
analysis and elucidation of concepts that are central to various fields of human activity,

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,080
and also, in particular, notions like what it is for something to be a cause of something else,

50
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,920
what it is for something to exist, what it is for something to be, shall we say, a scientific law,

51
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,040
the most general notions that are, as it were, the connecting tissue of thought and that we

52
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,800
have to use and have to employ in the specific activities that people like scientists, or I

53
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,920
could even be politicians, lawyers and so on, are engaged in. Is that a correct way of putting

54
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,280
your view? Yes, yes, I would agree with that. Do you think that the main or the most important

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,440
questions that philosophers have to deal with can be grouped under any particular headings?

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,160
There are two headings, which I think provide an important classification to begin with.

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,080
There are the ontological questions, as they might be called. Well, I think you'll need to

58
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,760
explain that term. These would be questions as to what there is, the general questions,

59
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,720
as to what sorts of things there are, as well as the question of what it means to exist,

60
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:21,320
what it means to exist, for there to be something. And the other classification, the other class,

61
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,320
would be, might be called the predicated questions. Questions as to what sorts of things can

62
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,720
meaningfully be asked about what there is. In other words, you've got two enormous spheres

63
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,480
of questioning here, one about what there is, and the other about what we can know about what

64
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,600
there is, or what we can say about what there is. Yes, and epistemology would be included in the letter.

65
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,320
Yes, yes, yes. Now, I think since you've made this distinction, for clarity's sake, in our

66
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,440
discussion, we ought to cling to it a little, and I think we'll take these two areas one at a time,

67
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,480
and we'll take your first one first, the whole group of questions about what there is, what exists,

68
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,800
or as you say, what is called ontology by philosophers. Although there are innumerable

69
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,960
theories about this, I think it's fair to say that throughout the history of the subject,

70
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,720
there have been two broad opposing views in the matter of ontology, between what you might very

71
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,080
roughly call materialists, and what you might call idealists. I mean, although there are innumerable

72
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,240
different versions of both doctrines, you do have on the one hand a view that reality consists of

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:36,440
matter or material objects in space and time, which exist independently of anyone's or anything's

74
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,680
experience of them. And on the other hand, you have a view of reality as consisting ultimately in

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,720
spirits or minds, or is existing in the mind of God, or as being put together in our minds.

76
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Now, can I put very crudely the $64 question to you and ask you which side you're on?

77
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm on the materialist side. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I hold that physical objects are real

78
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,560
and exist externally and independently of us. I don't hold that there are only these physical

79
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,240
objects. There are also abstract objects, objects of mathematics that seem to be needed to fill

80
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:30,760
the system of the world. But I don't recognize the existence of minds of mental entities,

81
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,720
in any sense other than as attributes or activities on the part of physical objects,

82
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:45,720
mainly persons. That must mean then that you not only reject idealism, it must also mean that you

83
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,880
reject dualism. I mean, one might describe dualism as almost the common sense view. I think throughout

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,480
human history, most human beings have taken the view that reality consists ultimately of entities of

85
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:07,000
two categorically different kinds, minds and bodies. And as far as we know, in all civilizations,

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,800
past and present, most people seem to have thought this, that there were bodies and that there were

87
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,000
minds and that these were two fundamentally different kinds of things. Now that's what is

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,400
meant by the term dualismness. Now you must reject this view if you don't believe in the existence

89
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:31,800
of minds. Yes, true. I do reject the view. The dualistic view presents problems, creates problems

90
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:44,520
which are neither soluble nor, it seems to me, necessary. It's clear that an individual's decisions

91
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,240
will affect his movements, will determine his movements in many cases, and his movements in

92
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,440
turn will have consequences in the movements of other physical objects. At the same time, the

93
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:10,360
natural scientists, the physicists, insist on a closed system. There being physical causes,

94
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,760
physical explanations in principle for the physical events. They allow no place for the

95
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,040
incursion of influences from outside the physical world. Given all this, it would seem then that

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,360
a person's decisions must themselves be activity on the part of a physical object.

97
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:40,120
The alternative of rejecting this basic principle of physical science to the effect that

98
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,880
every change is, that there's no change without a change in the distribution of

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,280
micro-physical properties over space-time, over space. That alternative I find

100
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,400
uncongenial because the successes in natural science have been such that we must take their

101
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,680
presuppositions very seriously. In other words, what you are saying is that wishes, emotions,

102
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,240
feelings, decisions, thoughts are all things which take place in physical objects, namely people.

103
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,440
Of course, in a sense, that's an obvious fact. What you're saying is that not only are these

104
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,800
always accompanied by micro-physical changes, changes in our brains and our central nervous

105
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:34,040
systems and so on, but they indeed are those micro-physical changes. Before I go on to raise

106
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,120
with you some of the apparent difficulties inherent in that view, I wonder if you can

107
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,120
explain how it is that almost all of mankind, as I said only a few minutes ago,

108
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,400
has disagreed with you about this. Why people in general take a dualist view of reality?

109
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,600
Let me add this point. If I put that question to almost anyone else, he could say, well,

110
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,960
it's obvious why people think like that. They think like that because dualism corresponds to

111
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,080
directly experienced reality. That is how we experience things, but you can't say that because

112
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,600
you don't think it is how we experience things. What would your answer be?

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:24,760
I recognize certainly a profound difference between so-called mental events and externally

114
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:33,240
observable physical ones in spite of construing these mental events as themselves. Event states

115
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,840
activity on the part of a physical object. As for the traditional dualistic attitude,

116
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:48,120
certainly this goes back to primitive times. I think one cause of it, partial explanation may

117
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:58,440
be the experience of dreams and the seeming separation of the mind from the body. In that state,

118
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:08,760
certainly animism, antedated science, Thales, the first of the Greek philosophers, has said to

119
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:16,280
have said that all things are full of gods. Primitive peoples today are said to be animists

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,640
very largely and to believe that what we call inanimate objects are animated by spirits.

121
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:36,120
One can even imagine traces of animism in the basic concepts of our science itself.

122
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:47,320
The notion of cause, I suspect, began with the feeling of effort, of pushing on the part of

123
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:56,760
the individual, the subjective feeling, as a mental entity, and force surely had that sort of origin.

124
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,760
But as time has gone on and as science has progressed in recent centuries,

125
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:20,200
the dissociation of these concepts from their original mental context seems to have been conducive

126
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:31,560
to great scientific progress. I think of physicalism as a departure, a product of

127
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,960
latter-day science, which of course is a phenomenon that's very

128
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,160
uncharacteristic of the history of mankind. But I don't think that the chief reason why

129
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,960
most people take a dualist view of reality is to do with dreams or the other things that you've

130
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,920
mentioned. I think it's chiefly because we all do have, it seems to me, direct experience of an

131
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,720
internal flow of thoughts and emotions and responses and desires and fantasies and memories

132
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,960
and so on, which is going on all the time that we're awake and which is extremely complex,

133
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,360
not only in the sense that it may be about complicated things, but also in the sense that

134
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,000
there may be several different things going on at once. And I think we're all directly aware of

135
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
something like this going on inside ourselves, and this doesn't manifest itself in any way in

136
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:29,080
observable external behavior. We are aware of these things and I'm not denying their existence,

137
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:39,640
but I'm construing them or reconstruing them as activities on the part of physical objects,

138
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:51,880
namely on our part. And the fact that these are not observable on the whole from the outside

139
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,600
doesn't distinguish them from much that the physicist assumes in the way of internal microscopic

140
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,760
or submicroscopic structure of inanimate objects. A great deal goes on that we don't

141
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,200
observe from the outside and that we have to account for conjecturally the

142
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,120
important reason for construing all this activity as activity on the part of bodies

143
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:24,200
is to preserve the closed character of the system of the physical world.

144
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,920
Does this mean that you deny the real existence of the age-old problem about whether or not we have

145
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:42,680
free will? It doesn't mean that, but because the will would retain its status even though

146
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:55,960
becoming ultimately a neural phenomenon and an aspect of the activity of a physical object.

147
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,080
However, I think the problem of the freedom of the will is an outcome of a confusion.

148
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,920
There's no question in my mind about the freedom of the will that the will is free

149
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:20,280
in the sense that people very often do what they will to do. They are free

150
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,720
to within limits of constraint and within limits of their strength or talent

151
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,200
to do things that they will to do. Freedom of the will does not mean that the will is free

152
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,640
to will as it will. That would be nonsense and it doesn't mean that the will is uncaused. The will

153
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:48,440
is caused and we all are prepared to recognize that the will is caused when we try to train

154
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,520
children in such a way as to influence their behavior or enact laws to discourage criminals

155
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,960
or we try to get votes. People try to sell things. All these are cases of

156
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:15,800
causing people to will, but the freedom of their will remains insofar as their activity

157
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:23,960
is the result of a causal chain, one link of which is the willing and that willing can be

158
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,400
itself caused in this. Given that you hold these views, how do you see the traditional

159
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:38,520
body-mind problem? Let me just remind our viewers of what that is. I've said earlier that most

160
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,720
people seem to take a dualist view of reality, a view that everything in the universe consists

161
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,280
ultimately of either minds or bodies, that there are both kinds of entity. That has given rise to

162
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,440
a traditional problem which no one has ever come up with a thoroughly satisfactory solution to.

163
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:02,200
That is the question, how are these incorporeal, abstract, non-material minds able to actually

164
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,240
move and push about the material bodies? It's clear that since you don't believe in the existence of

165
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,280
minds as independently of bodies, the problem does not present itself to you in that form.

166
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Given your views, do you simply bypass the mind-body problem totally?

167
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,400
No. As you say, the body-mind problem doesn't exist in that form for me. There's no longer

168
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,800
that problem of interaction and in fact it's in order to eliminate the problem in that form

169
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,480
that I opt for physicalism. However, the problem then arises.

170
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,480
How are we to talk about all these ordinarily so-called mental events and mental activity,

171
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,160
this flux of experience if we're not recognizing minds, not recognizing mental entities?

172
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,560
It's no good trying to paraphrase all this into neurological terms because it would take too

173
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,200
much in a way of detailed understanding of the mechanism of the nervous system.

174
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Now, there's a, as a first step, a quick, easy solution to that. One may simply keep the

175
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:31,640
mentalistic terminology, but regard all these terms as terms applicable to bodies

176
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,480
and to the activity of bodies. This is easy. This is too easy in a way because there's another

177
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,520
point about the, in favor of the physicalistic attitude, which I haven't touched on up to now,

178
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:55,960
namely the advantage of intersubjectivity, objectivity. The data are not introspective data,

179
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:05,000
the data are shared, can be shared by other observers. It's because of this, in large part,

180
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,040
at least, that the natural sciences have been so successful. Now, and introspective psychology

181
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:22,280
has not been comparably successful. Well, now, if we simply take over all the conceptual apparatus

182
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,120
of introspective psychology and mentalism, and simply try to excuse it by saying all these

183
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,480
attributes or activities of bodies, we're no longer getting the benefit of the intersubjectivity of

184
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:45,320
natural science. However, there's a, there's a way of coping with this difficulty, and it is

185
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,920
behaviorism, in the sense of which I think behaviorism is important and valuable. I think

186
00:21:51,560 --> 00:22:07,160
the role of behaviorism is the legitimation of mentalistic terms without having to go through the

187
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,320
indirect and, in fact, impracticable channel of neurology.

188
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:22,760
Criteria, observable, intersubjectively observable criteria for mental states,

189
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,360
are found in behavior, in observable behavior.

190
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,040
And that would include verbal behavior.

191
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:38,520
Including verbal behavior, yes. And insofar, as such criteria are available, we do have the

192
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,040
benefits of natural science, after all. And this is without full neurological explanation.

193
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:56,760
So, the extent to which I'm a behaviorist is, in seeing behaviorism as a way of making objective

194
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,960
sense of mentalistic concepts, I don't identify the mental states with the behavior.

195
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,520
I identify the mental states, rather, with neural states, nor do I regard behavioral

196
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:17,720
accounts as, in the last analysis, explanatory of the mental states, mental phenomena.

197
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
I think that the full explanation of these is to be found, rather, at the neurological level.

198
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,960
In other words, if you're saying that behaviorism is not an explanation of the kind of problems

199
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,840
of which the philosopher deals, but a way of formulating them, I mean, it's a kind of language

200
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,400
in which the problems should be couched or formulated before we then go on to try and

201
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,400
provide solutions. Exactly, yes. I think it would be helpful if we paused a moment at this point,

202
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,960
Professor Quine, and if I try to recapitulate the ground that we've covered before we attempt

203
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,520
any forward moves. I started this discussion by asking you what you regarded as the central

204
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,240
tasks of philosophy, and you not only said what you thought philosophers ought to be doing, you

205
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,480
also said what you thought they ought not to be doing, and you ruled out a number of questions,

206
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,360
but you grouped the questions that you thought philosophers ought to concern themselves with,

207
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,480
under two main heads. The first head being questions about what exists, what does reality

208
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,600
consist of, and the second group being what can we know about this, and how can we know,

209
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,160
and what can we say about it, and so on. Now, from that point onwards, we've been pursuing

210
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,360
the first of those two groups of questions, and you've said that in your view, your view of

211
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,200
reality is physicalist. You think all reality consists in physical entities, that there are not

212
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,480
minds separate from physical entities, and that the notion that there are leads us into all sorts

213
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,920
of conceptual confusions, which you think a behaviorist analysis liberates us from. I'd like

214
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,760
us now to start going over to questions of the second kind, because we were beginning to get

215
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,640
into them already, and that's why I thought it time to stop and reassess where we were.

216
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,120
Can we now move into the second area of how we acquire knowledge of this physical world in

217
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,800
which we find ourselves? Good. One correction I would make, though,

218
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,000
my position is not that there are only physical objects, there are also abstract objects.

219
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,080
But these abstract objects are not mental. It's important to make that distinction,

220
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,400
isn't it? You don't believe in the existence of minds separate from physical things,

221
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,400
but you do believe in the existence of certain abstract entities. Yes, numbers, notably.

222
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,920
But I think you need to explain that a bit. If you are a physicalist, how can you justify your

223
00:25:40,920 --> 00:26:00,040
belief in the existence of abstract entities at all? The status of sets or classes and numbers

224
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,840
and functions, I think, again, not from the point of view of the predicate side of philosophy,

225
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:18,120
is not basically different from the status of hypothetical entities such as elementary

226
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,440
particles in physics. In both cases, it's a matter of framing hypotheses

227
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:34,520
of which imply our past observations, of which imply future observations under

228
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:44,360
specifiable conditions, which would then serve to corroborate or refute these hypotheses.

229
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:53,080
And these general hypotheses contain reference not only to the ordinary observable objects,

230
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,000
but also to many auxiliary objects, we might say, in the way of unobservable physical particles,

231
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,080
and also in the way of numbers and functions, because these come into the formulations,

232
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,760
into the hypotheses of a quantitative kind. And even classes or sets, the biologist speaks of

233
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:25,560
genre and species of organisms. And all these entities are furniture of the world,

234
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,160
posited on an equal footing in our system of the world.

235
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,080
Well, you say on an equal footing, but it does seem to me that there is a very important difference

236
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,280
between the sense in which subatomic particles are unobservable and the sense in which they

237
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,360
numbers are unobservable. And subatomic particles are bits of stuff, but it just so happens,

238
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,000
perhaps because of the accident of our optical apparatus, that they're bits of stuff which

239
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,440
are too small for us to see. But if we had microscopic eyes or super microscopic eyes,

240
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,520
perhaps we could see them. And if we had different kinds of fingers, we could pick them up. I mean,

241
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,840
they are bits of material, but numbers aren't bits of material. However small, are they? I mean,

242
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,520
they are, as it were, abstract through and through. There is nothing but abstraction to them.

243
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:18,280
It's true. There's this discontinuity. But the continuity of ordinary observable objects with the

244
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,400
elementary particles is rather more tenuous than had once been supposed. Because

245
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,600
an elementary particle is too small, for instance, even in principle to be

246
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:43,800
detected by light, because it's smaller than any wavelength.

247
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,240
Furthermore, the behavior of the elementary particles is basically unlike that of larger

248
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,360
bodies, so much so that it's, I think, only by courtesy that they're called material.

249
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:09,160
The indeterminacy with respect to whether two segments of the, two segments of paths of an

250
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,160
electron are segments of the path of the same electron or two different ones.

251
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:25,880
Indeterminacies of position, the antithesis between wave and core puzzle in the interpretation of

252
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,240
light, and other anomalies, something called the Bose-Einstein statistic, all suggest that

253
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,120
the analogy of body is an analogy that was useful for extrapolation up to a point. But then the

254
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,160
reshuffling, the evolution of hypotheses in the light of further experimentation and further

255
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,400
refutations, have finally carried us to the point where the continuity is no longer so evident.

256
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,680
I would like to leave at that particular point there, Professor Klein, because I want to step

257
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,840
back three paces in our discussion and take up something which strikes me as being a very

258
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,880
much more general interest, that we were talking about a moment ago, and then we got slightly

259
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,680
sidetracked, and I think it was partly my fault that we did. I want to go back to the point where

260
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,480
you were saying, or suggesting anyway, that the adoption of a physicalist approach to reality,

261
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,600
or a behaviorist analysis of behaviorist where formulating problems, has the effect of liberating

262
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,440
you from the spell of certain entrenched ways of looking at things, which though they may be part

263
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,800
of common sense, are nevertheless mistaken. Now that's the point I want to take you up at.

264
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:48,920
Can you say what some of the entrenched ideas are from which you believe your approach would

265
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:55,960
liberate us? Good. Liberation is one way of looking at it. Stirner discipline is another way of

266
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:03,320
looking at behaviorism. But at any rate, a major example is the notion of meaning.

267
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:15,800
There's the common sense notion that words somehow convey meanings. How do we know that

268
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,040
the same words convey the same meaning to two speakers? We can see that the speakers react

269
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,640
in the same way. All this is describable in behavioral terms, but might the meanings themselves

270
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,960
be different? What behavioral sense can be made of the question? No behavioral sense, no adequate

271
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:43,960
behavioral sense has been made of it. There are other notions that come similarly into question.

272
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:52,440
Translation. Once the notion of meaning is questioned, the notion of translation becomes

273
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,560
more complex. We can no longer say it's simply a matter of producing another sentence. It has

274
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:05,880
the same meaning as the sentence that's being translated. The notion of necessity, again,

275
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:14,680
comes into question. Well, there are two kinds of necessity out there, logical and causal. Yes,

276
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,000
the one commonly understood as necessity by virtue of the meanings of the words.

277
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,240
The sentence is true by virtue of the meanings of the words that it contains.

278
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:33,560
This characterization goes by the board if the notion of meaning does. Then there's the notion

279
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:42,920
of physical necessity, necessity by virtue of physical law. This doesn't depend in the same way

280
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,120
on meaning, but by somewhat the same sort of scruples, it also becomes questionable.

281
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:08,120
It's not clear to me that there's a difference between a general truth in the form of a general

282
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,640
proposition, general statement, which just happens to be true and one that is a law.

283
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:29,880
The term necessary, the adverb necessarily, is in very common use and suggests that perhaps

284
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,480
people have a distinction in mind between two sorts of truth, the necessary and the accidental

285
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,800
or contingent. But I think the use of the ordinary use of that word can be explained otherwise.

286
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:53,560
I think it's dependent on situation, on context. One says necessarily, and follows it with a

287
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:00,360
sentence, when he thinks that the other person is bound to admit it because of what he already

288
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:08,280
has committed himself to or because he may be presumed to believe. This will vary with the context.

289
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,400
So you're calling into question such very fundamental notions of our thinking as

290
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,720
causal necessity, logical necessity, the idea of a law, the notion of meaning.

291
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,000
The ground is beginning to disappear from under our feet. I think what I would like to do at this

292
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
stage, Professor Quine, is ask you to characterize for us as a whole the kind of view of the world

293
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:44,120
that we're coming out with. Can you? Good. Well, let's proceed again in terms of that dichotomy

294
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:53,960
between the ontological and the predicational. On the ontological side of what I am accepting,

295
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:03,480
assuming. The physical objects, the physical object being construed quite generously as

296
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,640
the content of any portion, however scattered and discontinuous of space-time, and all

297
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,720
classes of such things, and all classes of such classes and so on. And mathematicians have

298
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:28,200
known, discovered over the past century, how all talk of numbers and functions and all other

299
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:36,040
mathematical entities can be paraphrased into talk of the pure set theory of classes.

300
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,400
Classes, classes of classes, appropriate ones can be made to do the work of numbers and of

301
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,760
functions and the rest. So we need these. On the other hand, these are abstract objects that I

302
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,320
accept. There are others that I would reject, properties. I would reject because there's the

303
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:04,520
question of, there's the question in what circumstances do two descriptions, two characterizations

304
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,320
determine the same property, and in what circumstances do they determine different

305
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,920
properties which just happen to be properties of all the same things? The problem in short of

306
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:23,320
individuation, identification of properties. And it's ordinarily said that two clauses,

307
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,640
let's say two phrases, determine the same property if they have the same meaning.

308
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,280
But of course, this characterization goes by the board if we don't accept the notion of meaning.

309
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,360
In the case of classes, this problem of identification does not arise because classes are

310
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:45,640
identical simply if they have the same members. Properties I'm persuaded are dispensable in

311
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,360
science. It's not clear how to dispense with the classes. So this would be my tentative ontology

312
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,480
and I would regard it as part of science and subject to the fallibility of the rest of science,

313
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,080
namely the individuals and the hierarchy of classes and classes of classes and so on built

314
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,280
upon them. The individuals being physical objects. On the predicate side,

315
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,800
my view is I think mainly rather negative. It's one of

316
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:30,200
rejecting predicates that have too little in the way of

317
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,160
behavioral or let's say observable criteria for their application or failing that.

318
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,960
I think one must also accept theoretical predicates which don't admit of observational

319
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:57,720
criteria. But there one must insist on there being pretty firmly related to predicates of

320
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:08,760
the observational kind through laws, hypotheses, general physical theory, which makes for

321
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:23,560
a well knit system of the world which expedites prediction. So that I would insist not that

322
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:31,720
predicates have necessary and sufficient conditions in observation but that they have

323
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:40,200
a good share in the way of observable criteria symptoms of application or that they

324
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,160
play a quite a promising role in the theoretical hypotheses.

325
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,440
One thing that pleases me very much about the discussion that we've had is that none of it

326
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,400
so far has been specifically about language or about words and I say that because a lot of

327
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:04,280
intelligent laymen who begin to take an interest in philosophy are sometimes put off by what they

328
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,360
take to be the discovery that modern philosophers are doing nothing but talking about words,

329
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,960
talking about terms, analyzing sentences, statements and so on. And you haven't talked in

330
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,960
that way at all and it's quite clear that the problems with which you are concerned are not

331
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:25,640
problems about language. Nevertheless, someone opening your books or a student coming to study

332
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,920
with you at Harvard for the first time would find that a great deal of your technique of approach

333
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,160
to these problems is via the analysis of concepts and therefore careful attention to words, the

334
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,280
elucidation of sentences and statements and so on. Why is it that you and other contemporary

335
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,960
philosophers adopt this linguistic approach to what are after all essentially non-linguistic

336
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:57,640
problems? One reason is a strategy that I call Semantic Ascent, A-S-C-E-N-T.

337
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:08,200
Philosophical issues are often concerned with very fundamental traits of one's conceptual scheme

338
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,480
and if two philosophers disagree on such points, it's difficult for them to discuss their

339
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,200
disagreement without each of them begging the question because it's hard to reason and argue

340
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,000
without making use of the fundamental principles of one's own conceptual scheme.

341
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:37,480
And a way of avoiding or minimizing this difficulty is the device of

342
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,080
moving up one step semantically and talking about words instead of using the words to talk about

343
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:54,680
the things. And if one makes this move, then one can talk about the rival systems as systems of

344
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:03,480
sentences. One can compare them in point of simplicity and in point of inclusiveness and

345
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:13,080
make a judgment on a shared basis without the circularity, the question begging.

346
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,920
We're coming to the end of our discussion now, Professor crime, but I would like just before we

347
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,320
do literally end, I'd like to ask you if you can say anything at all perhaps in the light of the

348
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,160
discussion we've had up to this point about what you are currently working on. I have to ask you

349
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,080
to be briefer than I would like because we have so little time left, but I would like you before

350
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,840
we end to say something about what you're doing original work on now. Well, at present I've been

351
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,480
writing short things in an effort to elucidate some of the points already in my

352
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,800
other writings or to extend and improve them. But there are several

353
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,200
problems on which I would like to see someone make breakthroughs.

354
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,640
One of them is connected with language, namely the development of some conceptual scheme to take

355
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:09,000
the place of the untenable old-fashioned theory of meaning, something new and something more

356
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,520
acceptable in the way of theory of what goes into good translation, for instance.

357
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,440
This is a job perhaps for linguists, but it's something with a philosophical interest and

358
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,760
it's a job also where someone with a philosophical curiosity is apt to be helpful to the linguists.

359
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:36,280
A second one is related rather to psychology. I should like to see a system of concepts developed

360
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,840
which would do the work of the old mentalistic idioms of propositional attitude, x believes that

361
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,760
p, x regrets that p, x hopes that p, the sort of thing. These idioms are subject to some subtle

362
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,440
logical difficulties and complications and they're very wanting, in large part of their

363
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,360
applications, wanting in adequate behavioral criteria. I should like to see, not for general

364
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:10,600
discourse, but for scientific purposes, some apparatus which would serve the same purposes

365
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,440
as these and be free of those faults. The third is related rather to mathematics.

366
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:28,520
The somewhat begrudgingly one I accept, I accept the apparatus of abstract objects, sets and the

367
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,880
rest, as I'll accelerate to science because it seems to be needed. But I should like to see a

368
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:46,440
minimum basis, an economical basis, and a very clear, clearly intelligible basis

369
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,240
for set theory, which was adequate, just barely adequate, to so much mathematics as is needed

370
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,200
in natural science. And it might be that if this were developed, it would among other things give

371
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:09,800
us a more intuitive understanding of the so-called paradoxes, the antinomies of set theory and their

372
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,080
solution, such things as Russell's paradox, which are familiar to some of our viewers,

373
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm sure, and not to all, so that might be a good place to stop.

374
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,840
Well, we will have to stop. Thank you very much, Professor Kwan.
