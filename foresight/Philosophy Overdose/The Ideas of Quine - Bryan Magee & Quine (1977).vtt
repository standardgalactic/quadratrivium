00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
If we took a poll among professional teachers of philosophy on the question, who is the

00:18.240 --> 00:22.920
most important living philosopher, it's not at all obvious, to me at least, who would

00:22.920 --> 00:27.520
get the most votes. But we can be fairly sure about some of the names that would be in the

00:27.520 --> 00:34.120
top half dozen. Quine, Popper, Jean-Paul Sartre, Chomsky probably, though strictly speaking,

00:34.120 --> 00:38.640
he's not exactly a philosopher. Well, the first of those names, and one on which I'd

00:38.640 --> 00:43.680
lay pretty short odds, is that of Willard Van Orman Quine, one of the professors of

00:43.680 --> 00:49.920
philosophy at Harvard. Quine was born in 1908 and is still highly productive, so he's had

00:49.920 --> 00:55.000
a long career, and it's by no means over yet. He's published innumerable articles and

00:55.000 --> 00:59.960
over a dozen books, the best known of which are From a Logical Point of View, published

00:59.960 --> 01:08.120
in 1953, and Word and Object, published in 1960. First and foremost, he's a logician,

01:08.120 --> 01:12.440
and the original contributions to the subject which made him famous are for the most part

01:12.440 --> 01:17.280
highly technical and not really accessible to the layman, though they always had their

01:17.280 --> 01:22.520
ultimate roots in problems fundamental to philosophy. However, in the latter part of

01:22.520 --> 01:28.360
his career, he's become more overtly interested in philosophy in a more general sense, and

01:28.360 --> 01:32.720
I thought it would be uniquely valuable in this program to have a philosopher at the

01:32.720 --> 01:39.560
very summit of world reputation talking about the basics of philosophy and of his own activity.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.760
Professor Quine, what do you regard as the central task or tasks of philosophy?

01:45.760 --> 01:53.200
I think a philosophy is concerned with our knowledge of the world and the nature of the

01:53.200 --> 02:01.200
world. I think a philosophy is attempting to round out the system of the world as Newton

02:01.200 --> 02:06.880
put it. There have been philosophers who have thought of philosophy as somehow separate

02:06.880 --> 02:16.160
from science and as providing a firm basis on which to build science. But this, I consider

02:16.160 --> 02:22.920
an empty dream, science, much of science is firmer than philosophy is or can even perhaps

02:22.920 --> 02:28.720
aspire to be. I think a philosophy is continuous with science even as a part of science.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.880
Well, if it's continuous with science and even part of science, how does it differ from

02:33.880 --> 02:42.720
the rest of science? It differs in generality and in abstractness. Science is a continuum

02:42.720 --> 02:49.680
extending from history and engineering and at one end, if we think of science broadly,

02:49.680 --> 03:01.760
to such abstract pursuits as philosophy and mathematics at the other. Philosophy considers

03:01.800 --> 03:09.560
the question of the nature of cause, for instance, where physics contends itself with finding

03:09.560 --> 03:16.000
causal relations between specific sorts of events, biology between other sorts of events.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.320
Again, whereas the zoologist will tell us that there are wombats and the physicist will

03:22.320 --> 03:27.520
tell us that there are electrons. The mathematician will tell us there are no end of prime numbers.

03:27.520 --> 03:32.320
The philosopher is interested rather in what sorts of things there are altogether. In these

03:32.320 --> 03:36.720
ways that philosophy is more abstract in general. In other words, the philosopher is investigating

03:36.720 --> 03:41.760
what constitutes the connective tissue of everyone's thoughts, including other people's

03:41.760 --> 03:47.760
thoughts, so that the physicist is trying to find out whether or not A causes B, but

03:47.760 --> 03:53.280
the philosopher is saying, but what does it mean to say that anything causes anything?

03:53.280 --> 03:58.960
The physicist is trying to find out, say, what particular subatomic particles there are and

03:58.960 --> 04:04.240
the philosopher says, but what does it mean to say of anything that it exists? It's at this

04:04.240 --> 04:10.280
level of complete generality that the philosophers' investigations occur. Is that right? Now, do

04:10.280 --> 04:17.960
you include in this or do you exclude from it the age-old questions of how the world

04:17.960 --> 04:25.080
got here in the first place or how life began? I exclude these from philosophy. How the world

04:25.080 --> 04:30.280
began is a problem for the physicist and astronomer, and of course there have been conjectures from

04:30.280 --> 04:36.120
that quarter. How life began is a problem for the biologist on which he's made notable progress

04:36.120 --> 04:45.000
in recent years. Why the world began, why life began, on the other hand, I think, are pseudo

04:45.080 --> 04:51.320
questions, because I can't, I can't imagine what an answer would look like.

04:51.320 --> 04:56.440
And you think that because there is no conceivable answer to these questions, they are meaningless

04:56.440 --> 05:03.480
questions. Yes, yes, yes. So in other words, you regard the central tasks of philosophy as the

05:03.480 --> 05:10.200
analysis and elucidation of concepts that are central to various fields of human activity,

05:10.200 --> 05:17.080
and also, in particular, notions like what it is for something to be a cause of something else,

05:17.080 --> 05:22.920
what it is for something to exist, what it is for something to be, shall we say, a scientific law,

05:22.920 --> 05:28.040
the most general notions that are, as it were, the connecting tissue of thought and that we

05:28.040 --> 05:33.800
have to use and have to employ in the specific activities that people like scientists, or I

05:33.800 --> 05:38.920
could even be politicians, lawyers and so on, are engaged in. Is that a correct way of putting

05:38.920 --> 05:44.280
your view? Yes, yes, I would agree with that. Do you think that the main or the most important

05:44.280 --> 05:50.440
questions that philosophers have to deal with can be grouped under any particular headings?

05:51.320 --> 05:57.160
There are two headings, which I think provide an important classification to begin with.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.080
There are the ontological questions, as they might be called. Well, I think you'll need to

06:01.080 --> 06:06.760
explain that term. These would be questions as to what there is, the general questions,

06:06.760 --> 06:11.720
as to what sorts of things there are, as well as the question of what it means to exist,

06:11.720 --> 06:21.320
what it means to exist, for there to be something. And the other classification, the other class,

06:21.320 --> 06:27.320
would be, might be called the predicated questions. Questions as to what sorts of things can

06:28.120 --> 06:33.720
meaningfully be asked about what there is. In other words, you've got two enormous spheres

06:33.720 --> 06:39.480
of questioning here, one about what there is, and the other about what we can know about what

06:39.480 --> 06:44.600
there is, or what we can say about what there is. Yes, and epistemology would be included in the letter.

06:44.600 --> 06:49.320
Yes, yes, yes. Now, I think since you've made this distinction, for clarity's sake, in our

06:49.320 --> 06:54.440
discussion, we ought to cling to it a little, and I think we'll take these two areas one at a time,

06:54.440 --> 07:01.480
and we'll take your first one first, the whole group of questions about what there is, what exists,

07:01.480 --> 07:07.800
or as you say, what is called ontology by philosophers. Although there are innumerable

07:07.800 --> 07:11.960
theories about this, I think it's fair to say that throughout the history of the subject,

07:11.960 --> 07:17.720
there have been two broad opposing views in the matter of ontology, between what you might very

07:17.720 --> 07:23.080
roughly call materialists, and what you might call idealists. I mean, although there are innumerable

07:23.080 --> 07:29.240
different versions of both doctrines, you do have on the one hand a view that reality consists of

07:29.240 --> 07:36.440
matter or material objects in space and time, which exist independently of anyone's or anything's

07:36.440 --> 07:42.680
experience of them. And on the other hand, you have a view of reality as consisting ultimately in

07:42.680 --> 07:49.720
spirits or minds, or is existing in the mind of God, or as being put together in our minds.

07:50.600 --> 07:56.600
Now, can I put very crudely the $64 question to you and ask you which side you're on?

07:56.600 --> 08:04.600
I'm on the materialist side. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I hold that physical objects are real

08:04.600 --> 08:11.560
and exist externally and independently of us. I don't hold that there are only these physical

08:11.560 --> 08:19.240
objects. There are also abstract objects, objects of mathematics that seem to be needed to fill

08:19.480 --> 08:30.760
the system of the world. But I don't recognize the existence of minds of mental entities,

08:31.480 --> 08:37.720
in any sense other than as attributes or activities on the part of physical objects,

08:37.720 --> 08:45.720
mainly persons. That must mean then that you not only reject idealism, it must also mean that you

08:45.720 --> 08:51.880
reject dualism. I mean, one might describe dualism as almost the common sense view. I think throughout

08:51.880 --> 08:59.480
human history, most human beings have taken the view that reality consists ultimately of entities of

08:59.480 --> 09:07.000
two categorically different kinds, minds and bodies. And as far as we know, in all civilizations,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.800
past and present, most people seem to have thought this, that there were bodies and that there were

09:11.800 --> 09:17.000
minds and that these were two fundamentally different kinds of things. Now that's what is

09:17.000 --> 09:23.400
meant by the term dualismness. Now you must reject this view if you don't believe in the existence

09:23.400 --> 09:31.800
of minds. Yes, true. I do reject the view. The dualistic view presents problems, creates problems

09:31.800 --> 09:44.520
which are neither soluble nor, it seems to me, necessary. It's clear that an individual's decisions

09:45.800 --> 09:51.240
will affect his movements, will determine his movements in many cases, and his movements in

09:51.240 --> 09:58.440
turn will have consequences in the movements of other physical objects. At the same time, the

09:58.840 --> 10:10.360
natural scientists, the physicists, insist on a closed system. There being physical causes,

10:10.360 --> 10:16.760
physical explanations in principle for the physical events. They allow no place for the

10:16.760 --> 10:22.040
incursion of influences from outside the physical world. Given all this, it would seem then that

10:23.000 --> 10:28.360
a person's decisions must themselves be activity on the part of a physical object.

10:30.040 --> 10:40.120
The alternative of rejecting this basic principle of physical science to the effect that

10:40.920 --> 10:47.880
every change is, that there's no change without a change in the distribution of

10:47.880 --> 10:54.280
micro-physical properties over space-time, over space. That alternative I find

10:56.120 --> 11:03.400
uncongenial because the successes in natural science have been such that we must take their

11:03.400 --> 11:08.680
presuppositions very seriously. In other words, what you are saying is that wishes, emotions,

11:08.680 --> 11:15.240
feelings, decisions, thoughts are all things which take place in physical objects, namely people.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.440
Of course, in a sense, that's an obvious fact. What you're saying is that not only are these

11:20.440 --> 11:25.800
always accompanied by micro-physical changes, changes in our brains and our central nervous

11:25.800 --> 11:34.040
systems and so on, but they indeed are those micro-physical changes. Before I go on to raise

11:34.040 --> 11:38.120
with you some of the apparent difficulties inherent in that view, I wonder if you can

11:38.840 --> 11:44.120
explain how it is that almost all of mankind, as I said only a few minutes ago,

11:44.760 --> 11:51.400
has disagreed with you about this. Why people in general take a dualist view of reality?

11:52.840 --> 11:56.600
Let me add this point. If I put that question to almost anyone else, he could say, well,

11:56.600 --> 12:01.960
it's obvious why people think like that. They think like that because dualism corresponds to

12:01.960 --> 12:07.080
directly experienced reality. That is how we experience things, but you can't say that because

12:07.080 --> 12:10.600
you don't think it is how we experience things. What would your answer be?

12:12.200 --> 12:24.760
I recognize certainly a profound difference between so-called mental events and externally

12:24.760 --> 12:33.240
observable physical ones in spite of construing these mental events as themselves. Event states

12:33.320 --> 12:40.840
activity on the part of a physical object. As for the traditional dualistic attitude,

12:40.840 --> 12:48.120
certainly this goes back to primitive times. I think one cause of it, partial explanation may

12:48.120 --> 12:58.440
be the experience of dreams and the seeming separation of the mind from the body. In that state,

12:59.080 --> 13:08.760
certainly animism, antedated science, Thales, the first of the Greek philosophers, has said to

13:08.760 --> 13:16.280
have said that all things are full of gods. Primitive peoples today are said to be animists

13:17.000 --> 13:23.640
very largely and to believe that what we call inanimate objects are animated by spirits.

13:24.040 --> 13:36.120
One can even imagine traces of animism in the basic concepts of our science itself.

13:37.240 --> 13:47.320
The notion of cause, I suspect, began with the feeling of effort, of pushing on the part of

13:47.320 --> 13:56.760
the individual, the subjective feeling, as a mental entity, and force surely had that sort of origin.

13:57.640 --> 14:04.760
But as time has gone on and as science has progressed in recent centuries,

14:05.640 --> 14:20.200
the dissociation of these concepts from their original mental context seems to have been conducive

14:20.200 --> 14:31.560
to great scientific progress. I think of physicalism as a departure, a product of

14:32.520 --> 14:35.960
latter-day science, which of course is a phenomenon that's very

14:37.080 --> 14:43.160
uncharacteristic of the history of mankind. But I don't think that the chief reason why

14:43.160 --> 14:47.960
most people take a dualist view of reality is to do with dreams or the other things that you've

14:47.960 --> 14:54.920
mentioned. I think it's chiefly because we all do have, it seems to me, direct experience of an

14:54.920 --> 15:01.720
internal flow of thoughts and emotions and responses and desires and fantasies and memories

15:01.720 --> 15:05.960
and so on, which is going on all the time that we're awake and which is extremely complex,

15:05.960 --> 15:10.360
not only in the sense that it may be about complicated things, but also in the sense that

15:10.360 --> 15:15.000
there may be several different things going on at once. And I think we're all directly aware of

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
something like this going on inside ourselves, and this doesn't manifest itself in any way in

15:21.720 --> 15:29.080
observable external behavior. We are aware of these things and I'm not denying their existence,

15:29.720 --> 15:39.640
but I'm construing them or reconstruing them as activities on the part of physical objects,

15:40.520 --> 15:51.880
namely on our part. And the fact that these are not observable on the whole from the outside

15:51.880 --> 15:58.600
doesn't distinguish them from much that the physicist assumes in the way of internal microscopic

15:58.600 --> 16:02.760
or submicroscopic structure of inanimate objects. A great deal goes on that we don't

16:03.400 --> 16:08.200
observe from the outside and that we have to account for conjecturally the

16:11.160 --> 16:16.120
important reason for construing all this activity as activity on the part of bodies

16:16.760 --> 16:24.200
is to preserve the closed character of the system of the physical world.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.920
Does this mean that you deny the real existence of the age-old problem about whether or not we have

16:28.920 --> 16:42.680
free will? It doesn't mean that, but because the will would retain its status even though

16:43.880 --> 16:55.960
becoming ultimately a neural phenomenon and an aspect of the activity of a physical object.

16:56.520 --> 17:01.080
However, I think the problem of the freedom of the will is an outcome of a confusion.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.920
There's no question in my mind about the freedom of the will that the will is free

17:10.280 --> 17:20.280
in the sense that people very often do what they will to do. They are free

17:21.160 --> 17:27.720
to within limits of constraint and within limits of their strength or talent

17:28.520 --> 17:34.200
to do things that they will to do. Freedom of the will does not mean that the will is free

17:34.200 --> 17:39.640
to will as it will. That would be nonsense and it doesn't mean that the will is uncaused. The will

17:39.640 --> 17:48.440
is caused and we all are prepared to recognize that the will is caused when we try to train

17:48.440 --> 17:54.520
children in such a way as to influence their behavior or enact laws to discourage criminals

17:55.320 --> 18:01.960
or we try to get votes. People try to sell things. All these are cases of

18:06.120 --> 18:15.800
causing people to will, but the freedom of their will remains insofar as their activity

18:16.680 --> 18:23.960
is the result of a causal chain, one link of which is the willing and that willing can be

18:23.960 --> 18:31.400
itself caused in this. Given that you hold these views, how do you see the traditional

18:31.400 --> 18:38.520
body-mind problem? Let me just remind our viewers of what that is. I've said earlier that most

18:38.520 --> 18:43.720
people seem to take a dualist view of reality, a view that everything in the universe consists

18:43.720 --> 18:50.280
ultimately of either minds or bodies, that there are both kinds of entity. That has given rise to

18:50.280 --> 18:54.440
a traditional problem which no one has ever come up with a thoroughly satisfactory solution to.

18:54.440 --> 19:02.200
That is the question, how are these incorporeal, abstract, non-material minds able to actually

19:02.200 --> 19:09.240
move and push about the material bodies? It's clear that since you don't believe in the existence of

19:09.240 --> 19:14.280
minds as independently of bodies, the problem does not present itself to you in that form.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.560
Given your views, do you simply bypass the mind-body problem totally?

19:20.600 --> 19:27.400
No. As you say, the body-mind problem doesn't exist in that form for me. There's no longer

19:27.400 --> 19:31.800
that problem of interaction and in fact it's in order to eliminate the problem in that form

19:32.440 --> 19:39.480
that I opt for physicalism. However, the problem then arises.

19:41.960 --> 19:47.480
How are we to talk about all these ordinarily so-called mental events and mental activity,

19:48.520 --> 19:55.160
this flux of experience if we're not recognizing minds, not recognizing mental entities?

19:56.120 --> 20:03.560
It's no good trying to paraphrase all this into neurological terms because it would take too

20:03.560 --> 20:08.200
much in a way of detailed understanding of the mechanism of the nervous system.

20:10.600 --> 20:21.800
Now, there's a, as a first step, a quick, easy solution to that. One may simply keep the

20:21.880 --> 20:31.640
mentalistic terminology, but regard all these terms as terms applicable to bodies

20:31.640 --> 20:39.480
and to the activity of bodies. This is easy. This is too easy in a way because there's another

20:39.480 --> 20:46.520
point about the, in favor of the physicalistic attitude, which I haven't touched on up to now,

20:46.520 --> 20:55.960
namely the advantage of intersubjectivity, objectivity. The data are not introspective data,

20:55.960 --> 21:05.000
the data are shared, can be shared by other observers. It's because of this, in large part,

21:05.000 --> 21:14.040
at least, that the natural sciences have been so successful. Now, and introspective psychology

21:14.040 --> 21:22.280
has not been comparably successful. Well, now, if we simply take over all the conceptual apparatus

21:22.280 --> 21:28.120
of introspective psychology and mentalism, and simply try to excuse it by saying all these

21:28.120 --> 21:35.480
attributes or activities of bodies, we're no longer getting the benefit of the intersubjectivity of

21:35.800 --> 21:45.320
natural science. However, there's a, there's a way of coping with this difficulty, and it is

21:45.320 --> 21:50.920
behaviorism, in the sense of which I think behaviorism is important and valuable. I think

21:51.560 --> 22:07.160
the role of behaviorism is the legitimation of mentalistic terms without having to go through the

22:08.760 --> 22:13.320
indirect and, in fact, impracticable channel of neurology.

22:13.720 --> 22:22.760
Criteria, observable, intersubjectively observable criteria for mental states,

22:23.960 --> 22:28.360
are found in behavior, in observable behavior.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.040
And that would include verbal behavior.

22:30.040 --> 22:38.520
Including verbal behavior, yes. And insofar, as such criteria are available, we do have the

22:38.520 --> 22:46.040
benefits of natural science, after all. And this is without full neurological explanation.

22:46.040 --> 22:56.760
So, the extent to which I'm a behaviorist is, in seeing behaviorism as a way of making objective

22:56.760 --> 23:01.960
sense of mentalistic concepts, I don't identify the mental states with the behavior.

23:02.920 --> 23:10.520
I identify the mental states, rather, with neural states, nor do I regard behavioral

23:10.520 --> 23:17.720
accounts as, in the last analysis, explanatory of the mental states, mental phenomena.

23:18.520 --> 23:22.520
I think that the full explanation of these is to be found, rather, at the neurological level.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.960
In other words, if you're saying that behaviorism is not an explanation of the kind of problems

23:28.040 --> 23:32.840
of which the philosopher deals, but a way of formulating them, I mean, it's a kind of language

23:32.840 --> 23:39.400
in which the problems should be couched or formulated before we then go on to try and

23:39.400 --> 23:45.400
provide solutions. Exactly, yes. I think it would be helpful if we paused a moment at this point,

23:45.400 --> 23:51.960
Professor Quine, and if I try to recapitulate the ground that we've covered before we attempt

23:51.960 --> 23:58.520
any forward moves. I started this discussion by asking you what you regarded as the central

23:58.520 --> 24:03.240
tasks of philosophy, and you not only said what you thought philosophers ought to be doing, you

24:03.240 --> 24:07.480
also said what you thought they ought not to be doing, and you ruled out a number of questions,

24:07.480 --> 24:12.360
but you grouped the questions that you thought philosophers ought to concern themselves with,

24:12.360 --> 24:17.480
under two main heads. The first head being questions about what exists, what does reality

24:17.480 --> 24:22.600
consist of, and the second group being what can we know about this, and how can we know,

24:22.600 --> 24:27.160
and what can we say about it, and so on. Now, from that point onwards, we've been pursuing

24:27.160 --> 24:34.360
the first of those two groups of questions, and you've said that in your view, your view of

24:34.360 --> 24:40.200
reality is physicalist. You think all reality consists in physical entities, that there are not

24:40.200 --> 24:45.480
minds separate from physical entities, and that the notion that there are leads us into all sorts

24:45.480 --> 24:52.920
of conceptual confusions, which you think a behaviorist analysis liberates us from. I'd like

24:52.920 --> 24:58.760
us now to start going over to questions of the second kind, because we were beginning to get

24:58.760 --> 25:03.640
into them already, and that's why I thought it time to stop and reassess where we were.

25:04.360 --> 25:10.120
Can we now move into the second area of how we acquire knowledge of this physical world in

25:10.200 --> 25:17.800
which we find ourselves? Good. One correction I would make, though,

25:18.920 --> 25:23.000
my position is not that there are only physical objects, there are also abstract objects.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.080
But these abstract objects are not mental. It's important to make that distinction,

25:27.080 --> 25:31.400
isn't it? You don't believe in the existence of minds separate from physical things,

25:31.400 --> 25:35.400
but you do believe in the existence of certain abstract entities. Yes, numbers, notably.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.920
But I think you need to explain that a bit. If you are a physicalist, how can you justify your

25:40.920 --> 26:00.040
belief in the existence of abstract entities at all? The status of sets or classes and numbers

26:00.120 --> 26:06.840
and functions, I think, again, not from the point of view of the predicate side of philosophy,

26:07.800 --> 26:18.120
is not basically different from the status of hypothetical entities such as elementary

26:18.120 --> 26:24.440
particles in physics. In both cases, it's a matter of framing hypotheses

26:25.080 --> 26:34.520
of which imply our past observations, of which imply future observations under

26:36.600 --> 26:44.360
specifiable conditions, which would then serve to corroborate or refute these hypotheses.

26:44.920 --> 26:53.080
And these general hypotheses contain reference not only to the ordinary observable objects,

26:53.160 --> 26:59.000
but also to many auxiliary objects, we might say, in the way of unobservable physical particles,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.080
and also in the way of numbers and functions, because these come into the formulations,

27:03.080 --> 27:10.760
into the hypotheses of a quantitative kind. And even classes or sets, the biologist speaks of

27:11.720 --> 27:25.560
genre and species of organisms. And all these entities are furniture of the world,

27:26.600 --> 27:29.160
posited on an equal footing in our system of the world.

27:29.160 --> 27:33.080
Well, you say on an equal footing, but it does seem to me that there is a very important difference

27:33.080 --> 27:38.280
between the sense in which subatomic particles are unobservable and the sense in which they

27:38.280 --> 27:44.360
numbers are unobservable. And subatomic particles are bits of stuff, but it just so happens,

27:44.360 --> 27:49.000
perhaps because of the accident of our optical apparatus, that they're bits of stuff which

27:49.000 --> 27:54.440
are too small for us to see. But if we had microscopic eyes or super microscopic eyes,

27:54.440 --> 27:58.520
perhaps we could see them. And if we had different kinds of fingers, we could pick them up. I mean,

27:58.520 --> 28:04.840
they are bits of material, but numbers aren't bits of material. However small, are they? I mean,

28:04.840 --> 28:10.520
they are, as it were, abstract through and through. There is nothing but abstraction to them.

28:11.400 --> 28:18.280
It's true. There's this discontinuity. But the continuity of ordinary observable objects with the

28:20.280 --> 28:27.400
elementary particles is rather more tenuous than had once been supposed. Because

28:29.240 --> 28:32.600
an elementary particle is too small, for instance, even in principle to be

28:33.480 --> 28:43.800
detected by light, because it's smaller than any wavelength.

28:45.800 --> 28:51.240
Furthermore, the behavior of the elementary particles is basically unlike that of larger

28:52.440 --> 28:58.360
bodies, so much so that it's, I think, only by courtesy that they're called material.

28:58.680 --> 29:09.160
The indeterminacy with respect to whether two segments of the, two segments of paths of an

29:09.160 --> 29:13.160
electron are segments of the path of the same electron or two different ones.

29:16.600 --> 29:25.880
Indeterminacies of position, the antithesis between wave and core puzzle in the interpretation of

29:25.880 --> 29:33.240
light, and other anomalies, something called the Bose-Einstein statistic, all suggest that

29:35.080 --> 29:42.120
the analogy of body is an analogy that was useful for extrapolation up to a point. But then the

29:44.120 --> 29:49.160
reshuffling, the evolution of hypotheses in the light of further experimentation and further

29:49.240 --> 29:57.400
refutations, have finally carried us to the point where the continuity is no longer so evident.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.680
I would like to leave at that particular point there, Professor Klein, because I want to step

30:02.680 --> 30:06.840
back three paces in our discussion and take up something which strikes me as being a very

30:06.840 --> 30:11.880
much more general interest, that we were talking about a moment ago, and then we got slightly

30:11.880 --> 30:16.680
sidetracked, and I think it was partly my fault that we did. I want to go back to the point where

30:16.680 --> 30:23.480
you were saying, or suggesting anyway, that the adoption of a physicalist approach to reality,

30:23.480 --> 30:30.600
or a behaviorist analysis of behaviorist where formulating problems, has the effect of liberating

30:30.600 --> 30:36.440
you from the spell of certain entrenched ways of looking at things, which though they may be part

30:36.440 --> 30:41.800
of common sense, are nevertheless mistaken. Now that's the point I want to take you up at.

30:42.520 --> 30:48.920
Can you say what some of the entrenched ideas are from which you believe your approach would

30:48.920 --> 30:55.960
liberate us? Good. Liberation is one way of looking at it. Stirner discipline is another way of

30:55.960 --> 31:03.320
looking at behaviorism. But at any rate, a major example is the notion of meaning.

31:04.280 --> 31:15.800
There's the common sense notion that words somehow convey meanings. How do we know that

31:15.800 --> 31:22.040
the same words convey the same meaning to two speakers? We can see that the speakers react

31:22.040 --> 31:27.640
in the same way. All this is describable in behavioral terms, but might the meanings themselves

31:27.640 --> 31:33.960
be different? What behavioral sense can be made of the question? No behavioral sense, no adequate

31:33.960 --> 31:43.960
behavioral sense has been made of it. There are other notions that come similarly into question.

31:44.840 --> 31:52.440
Translation. Once the notion of meaning is questioned, the notion of translation becomes

31:52.440 --> 31:57.560
more complex. We can no longer say it's simply a matter of producing another sentence. It has

31:57.560 --> 32:05.880
the same meaning as the sentence that's being translated. The notion of necessity, again,

32:06.440 --> 32:14.680
comes into question. Well, there are two kinds of necessity out there, logical and causal. Yes,

32:14.680 --> 32:21.000
the one commonly understood as necessity by virtue of the meanings of the words.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.240
The sentence is true by virtue of the meanings of the words that it contains.

32:26.200 --> 32:33.560
This characterization goes by the board if the notion of meaning does. Then there's the notion

32:33.560 --> 32:42.920
of physical necessity, necessity by virtue of physical law. This doesn't depend in the same way

32:43.000 --> 32:50.120
on meaning, but by somewhat the same sort of scruples, it also becomes questionable.

32:57.000 --> 33:08.120
It's not clear to me that there's a difference between a general truth in the form of a general

33:08.120 --> 33:15.640
proposition, general statement, which just happens to be true and one that is a law.

33:18.600 --> 33:29.880
The term necessary, the adverb necessarily, is in very common use and suggests that perhaps

33:29.880 --> 33:35.480
people have a distinction in mind between two sorts of truth, the necessary and the accidental

33:35.560 --> 33:43.800
or contingent. But I think the use of the ordinary use of that word can be explained otherwise.

33:44.680 --> 33:53.560
I think it's dependent on situation, on context. One says necessarily, and follows it with a

33:53.560 --> 34:00.360
sentence, when he thinks that the other person is bound to admit it because of what he already

34:00.360 --> 34:08.280
has committed himself to or because he may be presumed to believe. This will vary with the context.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.400
So you're calling into question such very fundamental notions of our thinking as

34:14.280 --> 34:21.720
causal necessity, logical necessity, the idea of a law, the notion of meaning.

34:22.600 --> 34:27.000
The ground is beginning to disappear from under our feet. I think what I would like to do at this

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
stage, Professor Quine, is ask you to characterize for us as a whole the kind of view of the world

34:35.000 --> 34:44.120
that we're coming out with. Can you? Good. Well, let's proceed again in terms of that dichotomy

34:44.120 --> 34:53.960
between the ontological and the predicational. On the ontological side of what I am accepting,

34:54.520 --> 35:03.480
assuming. The physical objects, the physical object being construed quite generously as

35:03.480 --> 35:09.640
the content of any portion, however scattered and discontinuous of space-time, and all

35:11.400 --> 35:17.720
classes of such things, and all classes of such classes and so on. And mathematicians have

35:17.800 --> 35:28.200
known, discovered over the past century, how all talk of numbers and functions and all other

35:28.200 --> 35:36.040
mathematical entities can be paraphrased into talk of the pure set theory of classes.

35:38.760 --> 35:43.400
Classes, classes of classes, appropriate ones can be made to do the work of numbers and of

35:43.400 --> 35:48.760
functions and the rest. So we need these. On the other hand, these are abstract objects that I

35:48.760 --> 35:55.320
accept. There are others that I would reject, properties. I would reject because there's the

35:55.320 --> 36:04.520
question of, there's the question in what circumstances do two descriptions, two characterizations

36:04.520 --> 36:09.320
determine the same property, and in what circumstances do they determine different

36:09.320 --> 36:14.920
properties which just happen to be properties of all the same things? The problem in short of

36:14.920 --> 36:23.320
individuation, identification of properties. And it's ordinarily said that two clauses,

36:23.320 --> 36:27.640
let's say two phrases, determine the same property if they have the same meaning.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.280
But of course, this characterization goes by the board if we don't accept the notion of meaning.

36:34.120 --> 36:38.360
In the case of classes, this problem of identification does not arise because classes are

36:38.360 --> 36:45.640
identical simply if they have the same members. Properties I'm persuaded are dispensable in

36:45.640 --> 36:52.360
science. It's not clear how to dispense with the classes. So this would be my tentative ontology

36:52.360 --> 36:57.480
and I would regard it as part of science and subject to the fallibility of the rest of science,

36:57.480 --> 37:01.080
namely the individuals and the hierarchy of classes and classes of classes and so on built

37:01.800 --> 37:08.280
upon them. The individuals being physical objects. On the predicate side,

37:11.320 --> 37:17.800
my view is I think mainly rather negative. It's one of

37:18.120 --> 37:30.200
rejecting predicates that have too little in the way of

37:34.200 --> 37:41.160
behavioral or let's say observable criteria for their application or failing that.

37:42.120 --> 37:47.960
I think one must also accept theoretical predicates which don't admit of observational

37:47.960 --> 37:57.720
criteria. But there one must insist on there being pretty firmly related to predicates of

37:57.720 --> 38:08.760
the observational kind through laws, hypotheses, general physical theory, which makes for

38:12.120 --> 38:23.560
a well knit system of the world which expedites prediction. So that I would insist not that

38:24.600 --> 38:31.720
predicates have necessary and sufficient conditions in observation but that they have

38:31.720 --> 38:40.200
a good share in the way of observable criteria symptoms of application or that they

38:41.320 --> 38:45.160
play a quite a promising role in the theoretical hypotheses.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.440
One thing that pleases me very much about the discussion that we've had is that none of it

38:50.440 --> 38:57.400
so far has been specifically about language or about words and I say that because a lot of

38:57.400 --> 39:04.280
intelligent laymen who begin to take an interest in philosophy are sometimes put off by what they

39:04.280 --> 39:08.360
take to be the discovery that modern philosophers are doing nothing but talking about words,

39:08.360 --> 39:13.960
talking about terms, analyzing sentences, statements and so on. And you haven't talked in

39:13.960 --> 39:17.960
that way at all and it's quite clear that the problems with which you are concerned are not

39:17.960 --> 39:25.640
problems about language. Nevertheless, someone opening your books or a student coming to study

39:25.640 --> 39:30.920
with you at Harvard for the first time would find that a great deal of your technique of approach

39:30.920 --> 39:37.160
to these problems is via the analysis of concepts and therefore careful attention to words, the

39:37.160 --> 39:44.280
elucidation of sentences and statements and so on. Why is it that you and other contemporary

39:44.280 --> 39:49.960
philosophers adopt this linguistic approach to what are after all essentially non-linguistic

39:49.960 --> 39:57.640
problems? One reason is a strategy that I call Semantic Ascent, A-S-C-E-N-T.

39:57.640 --> 40:08.200
Philosophical issues are often concerned with very fundamental traits of one's conceptual scheme

40:09.800 --> 40:15.480
and if two philosophers disagree on such points, it's difficult for them to discuss their

40:15.480 --> 40:20.200
disagreement without each of them begging the question because it's hard to reason and argue

40:20.200 --> 40:25.000
without making use of the fundamental principles of one's own conceptual scheme.

40:26.360 --> 40:37.480
And a way of avoiding or minimizing this difficulty is the device of

40:39.160 --> 40:45.080
moving up one step semantically and talking about words instead of using the words to talk about

40:45.080 --> 40:54.680
the things. And if one makes this move, then one can talk about the rival systems as systems of

40:54.680 --> 41:03.480
sentences. One can compare them in point of simplicity and in point of inclusiveness and

41:04.520 --> 41:13.080
make a judgment on a shared basis without the circularity, the question begging.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.920
We're coming to the end of our discussion now, Professor crime, but I would like just before we

41:16.920 --> 41:23.320
do literally end, I'd like to ask you if you can say anything at all perhaps in the light of the

41:23.320 --> 41:29.160
discussion we've had up to this point about what you are currently working on. I have to ask you

41:29.160 --> 41:33.080
to be briefer than I would like because we have so little time left, but I would like you before

41:33.080 --> 41:38.840
we end to say something about what you're doing original work on now. Well, at present I've been

41:39.800 --> 41:43.480
writing short things in an effort to elucidate some of the points already in my

41:44.840 --> 41:49.800
other writings or to extend and improve them. But there are several

41:51.400 --> 41:54.200
problems on which I would like to see someone make breakthroughs.

41:55.080 --> 42:01.640
One of them is connected with language, namely the development of some conceptual scheme to take

42:01.640 --> 42:09.000
the place of the untenable old-fashioned theory of meaning, something new and something more

42:09.000 --> 42:12.520
acceptable in the way of theory of what goes into good translation, for instance.

42:15.320 --> 42:20.440
This is a job perhaps for linguists, but it's something with a philosophical interest and

42:20.440 --> 42:26.760
it's a job also where someone with a philosophical curiosity is apt to be helpful to the linguists.

42:26.840 --> 42:36.280
A second one is related rather to psychology. I should like to see a system of concepts developed

42:37.000 --> 42:44.840
which would do the work of the old mentalistic idioms of propositional attitude, x believes that

42:44.840 --> 42:50.760
p, x regrets that p, x hopes that p, the sort of thing. These idioms are subject to some subtle

42:50.760 --> 42:56.440
logical difficulties and complications and they're very wanting, in large part of their

42:56.440 --> 43:02.360
applications, wanting in adequate behavioral criteria. I should like to see, not for general

43:02.360 --> 43:10.600
discourse, but for scientific purposes, some apparatus which would serve the same purposes

43:10.600 --> 43:16.440
as these and be free of those faults. The third is related rather to mathematics.

43:17.400 --> 43:28.520
The somewhat begrudgingly one I accept, I accept the apparatus of abstract objects, sets and the

43:28.520 --> 43:33.880
rest, as I'll accelerate to science because it seems to be needed. But I should like to see a

43:34.600 --> 43:46.440
minimum basis, an economical basis, and a very clear, clearly intelligible basis

43:48.440 --> 43:55.240
for set theory, which was adequate, just barely adequate, to so much mathematics as is needed

43:55.240 --> 44:02.200
in natural science. And it might be that if this were developed, it would among other things give

44:02.200 --> 44:09.800
us a more intuitive understanding of the so-called paradoxes, the antinomies of set theory and their

44:09.800 --> 44:15.080
solution, such things as Russell's paradox, which are familiar to some of our viewers,

44:16.280 --> 44:19.400
I'm sure, and not to all, so that might be a good place to stop.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.840
Well, we will have to stop. Thank you very much, Professor Kwan.
