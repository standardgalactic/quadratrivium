0	13760	The
13760	18160	connection between philosophy and the mathematical sciences has always been
18160	23200	very close. Plato had written over the door of his academy the words, let no
23200	28240	one enter here who is ignorant of geometry. It was Aristotle who codified
28240	32600	the basic sciences into the categories and gave them the names that we use to
32600	36520	this day. Some of the greatest philosophers have been themselves great
36520	41680	mathematicians who invented new branches of mathematics. Descartes is an obvious
41680	48000	example and so is Leibniz and Pascal. In fact most of the great philosophers, not
48000	53080	all but most, came to philosophy from mathematics or the sciences and this
53080	57640	tendency has continued into our present century. Bertrand Russell was trained
57640	63680	first as a mathematician. Wittgenstein was trained first as an engineer. The
63680	68200	reason for this persisting connection is I think obvious and that is that the
68200	72640	basic urge which has driven most of the greatest philosophers has been the urge
72640	77560	to deepen our understanding of the world and of its structure and this is also
77560	83240	what creative scientists are doing. For most of the past, too, people thought
83240	87200	that mathematics was the most indubitable knowledge as well as being
87200	92080	utterly precise and clear that human beings possessed. So there have always
92080	97120	been plenty of philosophers examining mathematics to try and find out what was
97120	101200	so special about it and whether this was something that could be applied to the
101200	106520	acquisition of other sorts of knowledge. Ditto with the sciences which were also
106520	112520	thought to yield a very specially safe and certain kind of knowledge. What was
112520	117000	it about science that made its results so reliable? People asked themselves and
117000	121800	could its methods, whatever these were, be used in other fields? These
121800	126740	investigations into the concepts and methods and procedures and models that
126740	130760	are involved in mathematics and in science have come to be known as the
130760	135080	philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science and it's with
135080	138980	these that we're going to be concerned in this program. Chiefly with the
138980	142880	philosophy of science, though in fact we have someone taking part who is
142880	148840	expert in both, Professor Hilary Putnam of Harvard University. Professor Putnam,
148840	152720	I'd like to start our discussion from a standpoint which I think a very large
152720	159140	number of our viewers occupy anyway and it's really this. Since the 17th century
159140	163620	I suppose there's been a spectacular decline in religious belief especially
163620	168740	in the West and especially among educated people and for millions the role
168800	173660	that used to be taken in life by a world view based on religion has been
173660	179180	increasingly supplanted by a world view based on science or at least purporting
179180	184120	to be derived from science anyway and this is still enormously powerful in the
184120	187980	whole that it has on people's minds throughout the West. Probably it affects
187980	192200	all of us. So I think I'd like to start this discussion by getting you to pin
192200	197780	down that scientific world outlook which is so influential in the modern world
197940	201020	which will be underlying a lot of what we're going to have to talk about.
202020	207700	Let me dodge the question a little bit by talking not about what scientists
207740	212860	think now but what many scientists thought a hundred years ago or 75 years
212860	217300	ago. Think of doing a crossword puzzle. You might have to change a few things as
217300	221740	you go along but towards the end everything fits and things get added on
221740	226500	one step at a time. That's the way the progress of science looked for 300 years
227140	233940	in 1900 a famous mathematician David Hilbert gave a list of 50 mathematical
233940	238140	problems to a world congress of mathematicians which are still very famous.
238540	242260	It's very interesting that he included one problem which we would not call a
242260	246980	mathematical problem very early in the list I think problem three which was to
246980	252060	put the foundations of physics on a satisfactory basis. Just a small task
252300	257460	and that was for mathematicians. Not for physicists, right. The idea is to tidy it
257460	265700	up. That's right. The idea is Newton, Maxwell, Dalton and so on had all put in
265700	269340	all the parts of the story and now it was just for mathematicians to basically
269340	273860	clean up the logic as it were. I think in a conversation we had a couple of days
273860	278220	ago you described this as a treasure chest view and I like that picture but
278220	282340	here's this big chest that we're just filling up. It's an accumulation and you
282340	285940	don't have to subtract, you don't have to take out. Occasionally you make a little
285940	289900	mistake but basically the idea is or to shift the metaphor like building a
289900	293140	pyramid. You put down the ground floor then the next floor then the next floor
293140	298100	and it just goes up. That's part of it. This view of knowledge is growing by
298100	304060	accumulation. The other part of it is the idea that the special success of the
304060	308020	sciences and obviously what we're impressed by is success. This culture
308020	312900	value of success and science is a successful institution but there's the
312900	318620	idea that science owes its success to using a special method and that comes
318620	322060	partly from the history of science from the fact that Newton for example lived
322060	327020	after bacon and was influenced by bacon and the idea that empirical science has
327020	331260	grown up together with something called inductive logic and this idea that is a
331300	335900	method, the inductive method and that the sciences can be characterized by the
335900	339900	fact that they use this method and use it explicitly and consciously as it were,
339900	343580	not unconsciously as maybe someone who's learning cooking might be using it but
343580	348340	pretty deliberately and explicitly. So I think that these two things, the idea of knowledge
348340	352900	is growing by accumulation and growing by the use of a special method, the
352900	359100	inductive method, are the key elements of the old view. Yes and if I were going to
359100	362780	put the same thing, I suppose slightly differently, I think I'd say this that
362780	368300	for two or three hundred years educated Western man thought of the universe and
368300	373100	everything in it as consisting of matter in motion and that was all there was
373100	378340	whether from the outermost galaxies of the stars into ourselves and our bodies
378340	382820	and the cells of which we're made up and so on and that science was finding out
382820	388780	more and more about this matter and its structure and its motion by a method
388820	392740	which you just characterized as scientific method and the idea was that if we
392740	397700	went on long enough we'd simply, as you said with your crossword puzzle metaphor,
397700	401980	we'd find out everything there was to find out. We could eventually by
401980	408020	scientific methods completely explain and understand the world. Now that has
408020	412900	been abandoned by scientists, hasn't it? Though in fact this hasn't got
412900	416140	through yet to the non-scientists. There are still large numbers of
416180	420460	non-scientists who go on thinking that that's how scientists think but of
420460	424300	course they no longer do that. I mean this has started a breakdown. I think it
424300	428740	started to break down. I think it started to break down with Einstein. If I can
428740	435140	drag in a bit of history of philosophy, screaming by the hair, Kant did
435140	440060	something in philosophy which I think has begun to happen now in science. He
440060	444460	challenged a certain view of truth. Before Kant, no philosopher really doubted
444460	447700	that truth was simply correspondence to reality. I mean they're different words
447700	451220	some philosophers spoke of agreement but the idea is a mirror theory of
451220	457660	knowledge. Today I think, well Kant said it isn't so simple. There's a
457660	463220	contribution of the thinking mind. Sure it isn't made up by the mind. Kant was
463220	467140	no idealist. It is not a fiction. It isn't something we make up but it isn't
467140	472780	just a copy either. What we call truth depends both on what there is on the way
472780	479460	things are and on the contribution of the thinker, the mind. I think that today
479460	482940	scientists have come to a somewhat similar view that since the beginning of
482940	487820	the 20th century the idea that there's a human contribution, a mental
487820	493100	contribution to what we call truth. The theories aren't simply dictated to us by
493100	497700	the facts as it were. I'd like to ask you to unpack that a little because I think
497700	502460	that some of our viewers will find this idea a little puzzling. How can it be?
502460	507420	Some people will ask themselves that what is and is not true can depend not
507420	512660	only on what the facts are but on the human mind. How can that be? Well let me
512660	517580	use an analogy with vision. We tend to think that what we see just depends on
517580	521860	what's out there but the more one studies vision either as a scientist or as a
521860	525700	painter. One discovers that what's called vision involves an enormous amount of
525700	529780	interpretation. The color we see as red is not the same color in terms of
529780	534740	wavelengths at different times of the day. So even in what we think of as our
534740	540740	simplest transaction with the world just looking at it, we are interpreting, you
540740	545020	know. In other words we bring a whole number of things to the world that we're
545020	549020	not directly conscious of usually unless we turn inwards and start examining
549020	552620	them. That's right. I think the world must have looked different in the Middle
552620	557900	Ages to someone who looked up and thought of the stars as up and us at the
557900	562220	bottom for example. Today when we look out into space I think we have a
562220	566700	different experience than somebody with the medieval worldview. And what you're
566700	570860	saying is that the very categories in which we see the world and interpret
570860	576060	our experience and the the ideas within which we organize our observations and
576060	580820	the facts around us and so on are provided by us so that the world as
580820	585460	conceived by science is partly contributed by external facts but also
585540	590420	partly contributed by categories and ways of seeing things which come from
590420	596220	the human observer. That's right. And an example of that in science I'll
596220	600980	oversimplify but it's not basically falsified is this wave particle business.
600980	606300	It's not that there's something an electron which is some half a wave and
606300	609300	half a particle that would be meaningless but that there are many
609300	614580	experiments which can be described two ways. You can either think of the electron
614660	618300	as a wave or you can think of it as a particle and both descriptions are in
618300	623460	some crazy way true and adequate. Alternative ways of describing the same
623460	627180	facts and both descriptions are accurate. That's right. Philosophies have
627180	630420	started talking of equivalent descriptions. There's a term used in
630420	636780	philosophy of science. Now for a couple of hundred years after Newton educated
636780	640860	Western man thought that what Newton had produced was objective fact that he had
640860	645460	discovered laws which governed the workings of the world and the workings
645460	649540	of the universe and this was just objectively true independently of us
649540	654580	that Newton and other scientists had read these facts off of nature by
654580	659700	observing it and looking at it and so on and these statements which made up
659700	664380	science was simply true. Now there came didn't there a period in the development
664380	668220	of science and beginning in the late 19th century when people began to
668260	672940	realise that these statements were not entirely true that this wasn't just a
672940	677060	body of objective fact which had been read off from the world in other words
677060	683020	that science was courageable scientific theories could be wrong and that raises
683020	687860	some very profound questions. I mean if science isn't just an objectively true
687860	692740	description of the way things are what is it and if we don't get it from
692740	697500	observing the world where do we get it from? Well I don't want to say we don't
697500	704900	get it from observing the world at all obviously part of this Kantian image is
704900	710140	that there is a contribution which is not us there's something out there but
710140	714460	that also there's a contribution from us and even Kant by the way thought that
714460	718060	Newtonian science was indubitable that he thought we contributed its
718060	724020	indubitability. The step beyond Kant is the idea that not only is reality
724060	728980	partly mind-dependent but that there are alternatives and that the concepts we
728980	732540	impose on the world may not be the right ones and we may have to change them
732540	736580	that there's an interaction between what we contribute and what we find out.
736580	742380	Now what was it that made people begin to realise that this basic
742380	747580	conception of science as objective truth was wrong that science was
747620	754700	courageable, that science was fammable? I think it's that the older science turned
754700	760700	out to be wrong where no one expected it to be wrong not in detail but in the big
760700	766100	picture. It's not that we find out that say the Sun isn't 93 million miles from
766100	770060	the earth but only 20 million miles from the earth that's not going to happen.
770060	773820	I mean sometimes it makes blunders even about things like that but that's like
773860	777980	making a blunder about whether there's a chair in the room, wholesale
777980	783180	skepticism about whether numerical values are right in science would be as
783180	788660	unjustified as wholesale skepticism about anything but where the newer theories
788660	793420	don't agree with Newton it's not over the approximate truths of the
793420	797100	mathematical expressions in Newton's theory those are still perfectly good
797100	801940	for calculation. It's over the big picture we've replaced the picture of an
801940	805620	absolute space and an absolute time by the picture of a four-dimensional space
805620	809820	time we replaced the picture of a Euclidean world by a picture of a
809820	814500	world which obeys a geometry Euclid never dreamed of we've replaced we've
814500	818620	swung back to the picture of the world as having a beginning in time which is
818620	823300	really a shocker it's not even the things once refuted stay refuted forever.
823300	828460	Yes so it means really that a whole conception of science has been superseded
828500	833300	instead of thinking of science as a body of knowledge which is being added to all
833300	838300	the time by further scientific work that whole conception of science has been
838300	842500	dispensed with really hasn't it and we now think of it as a set of theories
842500	847140	which are themselves constantly being replaced by better theories by more
847140	851420	accurate theories by richer more explanatory theories and even the
851420	855900	theories we now have like those of Einstein and his successors will
855940	860780	probably be replaced in the course of time by other better theories by
860780	865140	scientists yet unknown isn't that so? That's exactly right in fact scientists
865140	869780	themselves make this prediction that is that the the main theories of the 20th
869780	874220	century relativity and quantum mechanics will give way to some other theory
874220	878780	which will interpret both of them and so on forever. Now this raises a very
878780	882980	fundamental question namely the question what is truth I mean when we say that
883020	887060	this or that scientific statement is true or this or that scientific theory is
887060	892060	true what in these newly understood circumstances of ours can we mean by
892060	898540	truth? There are still two views as there have been since Kant one is this
898540	902540	old correspondence view still has its adherence but I think the view that's
902540	907620	coming in more and more is that one cannot make it a total separation between
907620	912540	what's true and what our standards of assertibility are that the way in which
912580	916180	the what I called using the Kantian picture the mind dependence of truth
916180	920780	comes in is the fact that what's true and what's false is in part a function of
920780	924980	what our standards of truth and falsity are and that depends on our interests
924980	931220	and which again change over time of course. That's right. I'd like you to
931220	934460	say a little more about this question of truth because this again I think is
934460	938100	puzzling to the layman I think that people who are not trained in science
938140	942820	or philosophy are apt to think that there are a certain set of facts and a true
942820	947180	statement is a statement that accurately describes those facts I'd like you to
947180	950100	talk a little about some of the difficulties that are actually involved
950100	958900	in this. I think the the biggest difficulty in science itself comes from
958900	963220	the fact that even within one scientific theory you often find different
963220	966940	accounts can be given of so-called facts this came in with the special theory
966980	970780	of relativity when it turned in turned out that facts about simultaneity
970780	974380	when the two things happen at the same time could be described differently by
974380	978340	different observers one could say Boy Scout A fired a starter's pistol before
978340	982780	Boy Scout B the other could say no Boy Scout B fired a starter's pistol before
982780	987180	Boy Scout A and if the distance is sufficiently large so that a light
987180	990780	signal can't travel from one to the other without exceeding the speed of light
991260	996100	then it may be both descriptions are correct both are admissible. Of course
996980	1002060	this leads to I mean profound conceptual difficulties in understanding some
1002060	1006180	modern scientific theories and this prompts the thought that a scientific
1006180	1011260	theory can be useful and meaningful and can work even if nobody really quite
1011260	1014780	understands what it means this is the case with quantum mechanics isn't it
1014780	1019940	I mean nobody is really sure what quantum mechanics actually means and yet it
1019940	1023900	works. That's right and again there I want to say one shouldn't push that too
1023940	1028700	far because I think we don't want to give up our standards of intelligibility
1028700	1032580	altogether we want to say quantum mechanics works and the very fact that
1032580	1036860	it works means that there's something fundamentally right about it and with
1036860	1040220	respect to its intelligibility we're willing to say in part that may be that
1040220	1043620	we have the wrong standards of intelligibility that we have to change
1043620	1047860	our intuitions but in part there are real paradoxes in the theory and I think
1047860	1052380	that more work has to be done to really get a satisfactory resolution of these
1052420	1057700	paradoxes. Things are very ticklish now. Yes I think somebody hearing our
1057700	1061620	discussion and to whom perhaps some of these ideas are new might find himself
1061620	1066980	thinking well if all this is so how is it that science works if traditional
1066980	1071460	scientific theories are breaking down if science is turning out not to be a body
1071460	1077620	of reliable permanent firm objective knowledge if a significant proportion of
1077620	1081300	every scientific theory is subjective anyway in the sense that it's
1081340	1086380	contributed by the human mind by the observer by the scientist how is it in
1086380	1091260	these circumstances that we can actually build bridges fly airplanes make rockets
1091260	1096380	go to the moon and actually make all this soft fuzzy changing partly
1096380	1102060	subjective body of theory work for us it must fit the world in some very basic
1102060	1107020	way in spite of everything that we've been saying. That's true but I think the
1107020	1110580	contrast between being subjective and fitting the world isn't altogether
1110620	1114220	right. I'm not saying that scientific knowledge is subjective or that anything
1114220	1118620	goes and say when the difficult position that we often are in in life of
1118620	1122020	thinking there is a difference we good and bad reasoning but we don't have a
1122020	1127260	mechanical rule. In everyday life we use interest loaded terms we wouldn't say
1127260	1130820	that there's a policeman on the corner if we didn't have a whole network of
1130820	1135020	social institutions somebody coming from a primitive tribe which didn't have
1135020	1138820	policemen might say there's a man in blue on the corner but the fact that the
1138860	1142580	notion of a policeman is shaped by our interest doesn't mean that it can't be
1142580	1147100	objectively true that there's a policeman on the corner. Also I think
1147100	1151580	science works precisely because of this corrigibility in large part as Professor
1151580	1155660	Poppers pointed out the difference between science and previous ways of
1155660	1159860	trying to find out truth is in large part that scientists are willing to test
1159860	1163860	their ideas because they don't regard them as infallible in a way that was
1163860	1167460	known at the beginning and then in the success of Newtonian science somewhat
1167460	1171700	forgotten and we've had to be reminded again of what Bacon knew that you have
1171700	1174820	to put questions to nature and be willing to change your ideas if they
1174820	1179620	don't work. In some respects the traditional opposition between science
1179620	1184820	and religion has the two parties of cross places haven't they I mean many
1184820	1188780	religious people now believe they have certain knowledge about the world that
1188780	1193460	it was created by a god that he made us in his own image gave us immortal souls
1193620	1198140	which will survive our death and so on certain very fundamental propositions
1198140	1202980	which they hold with absolute certainty and it's the scientist who believes
1202980	1207380	that everything is fallible that the world is a mysterious place that we'll
1207380	1210860	never get to the end of the mystery of and so on and so forth isn't there
1210860	1217780	something in that? It may be. You say it may be. I'm not sure. Well let's not pursue
1217780	1223100	that but one point I do want to take up with you leaving even religion aside is
1223100	1227180	that now that science is seen in this entirely different way that you've been
1227180	1231500	describing by virtually all scientists doesn't it mean that the difference
1231500	1237820	between science and non-science isn't what it was always thought of as being in
1237820	1243060	other words since science is so subjective indefinite changing and so on
1243060	1248060	it's no longer a clearly cut and different kind of human activity or
1248060	1252020	kind of human knowledge from other sorts of human knowledge and other sorts of
1252060	1257380	human activity. I think that's both true and culturally very important. I think
1257380	1263460	the harm that the old picture of science does is that if there is this realm of
1263460	1268540	absolute fact that scientists are gradually accumulating then everything
1268540	1272460	else appears somehow as non-knowledge something to which even words like true
1272460	1278740	and false can't properly apply. I think that the so-called fact value dichotomy
1278780	1283860	is a very good example of this. It's hard to have a discussion on politics for
1283860	1288700	example without someone very quickly saying at least in my country is that a
1288700	1292820	fact or a value judgment as though it can't be a fact that Hitler was a bad
1292820	1298140	man for example or a fact that Farrah Fawcett Major is a beautiful woman. And do
1298140	1305340	you think that it is a fact that Hitler was a bad man? Oh yes I do. I do too. But then if
1305380	1310860	this is so if we are abandoning so many of these comfortable clear-cut
1310860	1314580	distinctions of the past what's the point of continuing to use the category or
1314580	1320700	the notion or the term science anyway? I mean does it any longer clearly demarcate
1320700	1326140	something differentiable from everything else? I don't think it does. I think that
1326140	1330940	you know if you're going to distinguish science from non-science that makes a
1330940	1334940	lot of sense if you still have this old view that there's this inductive method
1335340	1339500	what makes something science is that it uses it and uses it pretty consciously and
1339500	1343500	pretty deliberately and that what makes something known science is either it
1343500	1346620	uses it entirely unconsciously as in learning how to cook you're not
1346620	1351020	consciously thinking about inductive logic or perhaps does use it at all as
1351020	1356060	metaphysics was alleged not to use it at all I think unfairly. But once you say
1356060	1361420	but both say that there's a sharp line between say practical knowledge and
1361420	1367340	science and to say that the method which is supposed to draw this line is rather
1367340	1372460	fuzzy something that we can't state exactly and attempts to state it by the
1372460	1378380	way have been very much a failure still inductive logic cannot be say programmed
1378380	1382700	on a computer the way deductive logic can be programmed on a computer. I think
1382700	1386140	the development of deductive logic in the last hundred years and the development
1386140	1391100	of the computer have really brought home very dramatically just what a different
1391180	1396460	state we are in with respect to proof in the mathematical sciences which we can
1396460	1402300	state rigorous canons for and proof in what used to be called the inductive sciences
1402300	1407500	where we can state general maxims but you really have to use intuition general know how
1408460	1417020	and so on in applying them. One of the two categories that you described the old
1417020	1420860	fashioned we're looking at science in terms of was that there was a particular
1420860	1427020	scientific method if you observed the facts and on the basis of these observed instances
1427020	1432540	you generalized to form scientific theories which you then verified by experiment and so
1432540	1438140	that was the old view wasn't it now that that has been abandoned is there any longer any single
1438140	1443260	method which is thought of as being scientific method. I don't think there should be people
1443740	1448780	talk of scientific method as a sort of fiction but I think that even in physics where you do get
1450380	1455740	experiments and tests which pretty much fit the textbooks there's a great deal that does and
1455740	1460780	then a great deal that shouldn't and I think in fact in the culture I don't really believe
1460780	1465580	there's an agreement on what's a science so what is it any university will tell you in its catalog
1465580	1469980	that there are things called social sciences not sociology of the science so that economics is
1469980	1475420	a science I bet if you ask anyone in the physics department whether sociology is a science you'll
1475420	1481980	say no and why will he say no that's interesting I think the real reason is not that the sociologists
1481980	1487420	don't use the inductive method they probably use it more conscientiously poor things than the
1487420	1491660	physicists do I think it's because they're not as successful so in other words science has become
1491660	1497340	almost a name for successful pursuit of knowledge that's right yeah yeah well now I think you've
1497340	1503100	given a very very good description of the way in which this age-old view of what science was has
1503100	1508300	broken down in our century and been replaced by something much more fluid and perhaps much more
1508300	1513500	difficult to get hold of but you have I think described it very clearly can we now come against
1513500	1519340	this background to what philosophers of science are actually doing you are a philosopher of science
1519340	1526140	what do you and your colleagues do well part of what we do which I won't try to describe on this
1526140	1532140	broadcast is fairly technical investigation of specific scientific theories we look at quantum
1532140	1538940	mechanics very closely we look at both to learn what lessons we can for it from it for philosophy
1538940	1544140	and to see what contributions we can make as philosophers to clarifying its foundations we
1544140	1549580	look at relativity theory very closely we look at Darwinian evolution very closely and so on
1549580	1554460	this is the part of philosophy of science that provides the data for the rest but much philosophy
1554460	1560300	of science is leads shades over into general philosophy and I think it's the best way to
1560300	1564460	describe it is in terms of what we've been talking about that is each of the issues we've been talking
1564460	1569660	about divides philosophers of science the issue there are philosophers of science who have a
1569660	1575340	correspondence view of truth and try to show this can be made precise the answers can the objections
1575340	1581100	can be overcome you can still view science somehow in the old way and there are others who try to
1581180	1586700	sketch what another view of truth would come to there are philosophers who still think there is
1586700	1591580	an inductive method that can be rigorously stated and who work on inductive logic and by the way
1591580	1596220	I think it's important that there should be because we won't make progress to trying to state the
1596220	1601500	inductive method if there aren't and that there are others who view the development of science
1601500	1607260	more culturally more historically and that people like myself who have a sort of in-between
1607260	1612620	position that there's something to the notion of a scientific method there are clear examples
1612620	1616620	but that it's more or less a continuum that you you mustn't think of it as a kind of
1617180	1623100	mechanical rule an algorithm that you can apply to get scientific knowledge so that I'd say each
1623100	1628460	of these issues the nature of truth the nature of the scientific method whether there's any
1628460	1633740	necessary truth in science anything conceptual contribution which is permanent and can't be
1633740	1639260	subject to revision is a big question and who are you plural doing all this work for
1640940	1648140	I asked that I don't ask that in an irreverent way but what I have in mind is this I've myself
1648140	1653500	taken part in attempts to bring scientists and philosophers together for discussions of precisely
1653500	1658940	the issues that you've raised and these attempts have usually failed and failed for the same reason
1658940	1664060	namely that the scientists lose interest they go back to their laboratories and get on with doing
1664060	1669900	more science and the great bulk of working scientists it seems to me don't in fact take very
1669900	1674540	much of an interest in the issues that you've been talking about I think it's conspicuous that
1674540	1679900	the greatest of all scientists are exceptions I mean they they're really blockbusting the path
1679900	1683900	breaking scientists who've actually made the revolution in this century that you've been
1683900	1692540	talking about people like Einstein, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Max Bohr, Schrödinger, De Broglie,
1692540	1697980	these people were enormously interested in the conceptual questions that you've raised but these
1697980	1703580	were the the pioneering geniuses and the great mass of thousands of scientists who follow on
1703580	1709900	behind them and put their work to its practical application they don't seem to care so who is
1709900	1714620	listening to you who is reading the stuff that you publish well I'd say first of all I think we
1714620	1719420	are basically writing for the philosophically interested layman for the reader of philosophy
1720060	1724780	I don't view philosophy of science as giving direct advice to scientists just as I think
1724780	1729180	moral philosophers are ill advised to think that they're giving at least immediately
1729180	1735580	current contemporary advice on how to live your life or what bills to pass in parliament on the
1735580	1739820	other hand I do think that scientists tend to know the philosophy of science of 50 years ago
1740460	1745660	and perhaps this is the bad thing that it's perhaps this time lag this culture lag has some
1745660	1751420	value in weeding out what they shouldn't pay attention to I mean it's a novel philosopher
1751420	1755900	to encounter a scientist who's both sure that he didn't listen to any philosophy of science
1755900	1761900	and then who produces verbatim ideas which you can recognize is coming from what was popular in 1928
1761900	1765740	and is there a direct parallel here between what you're saying about scientists and
1765740	1770620	Cain the the economist Cain's is famous remark that nearly all businessmen who thought that they
1770620	1775900	were indifferent to airy-fairy economic theory were in fact the slaves of the economic theorists of
1775900	1781740	yesterday of a previous generation that's exactly true I suppose another parallel one could make
1781740	1786940	would be to say that the account that ordinary language users give of language and their use
1786940	1791740	of language would be extremely unsophisticated simply because they take it for granted and
1791740	1796780	have never thought about it that too would probably apply to the account that most scientists would
1796780	1801340	give of what they were doing when they were doing their science that's right that is it's a mistake
1801340	1808460	to think that merely because when practices an activity one can give a theory of it one criticism
1808460	1813100	that's often been made about philosophers of science is that although they talk of science in
1813100	1819180	this general way what they're nearly always referring to in fact is is one science namely physics
1819180	1824060	now it's true isn't it that the science in which the most exciting developments have probably taken
1824060	1830780	place in the last 20 years anyway has been not physics but biology our philosophers of science
1830780	1836380	open genuinely to the criticism of being too physics-based in their view of science and having
1836460	1843740	ignored biology too much I think I would defend us against that on the grounds that I don't although
1843740	1850060	the theories in biology are of great scientific importance Darwin's theory of evolution Crick
1850060	1857020	Watson on DNA and so on they don't by and large pose big methodological problems of a kind that
1857020	1863340	don't arise in physical science I'm not sure that you're going to agree with that well I mean
1864220	1869340	you mentioned the word evolution just now and it seems to me that here is a concept
1869980	1875500	which originated in one of the sciences namely biology and which over a comparatively short
1875500	1880620	period of time has spread throughout the whole of our culture so that the way almost everybody
1880620	1887260	thinks is influenced by the notion of evolution not only about the origins of man but about
1887260	1892620	institutions or the arts all kinds of other things I mean evolution has become a dimension
1892620	1898300	of western man's thinking about almost anything is that not so that's right and perhaps there has
1898300	1904460	not been enough attention to this theory though what strikes me as interesting is that the possibility
1904460	1911740	of explanations of what we think of as the biological kind explanations in terms of function
1911740	1918940	rather than in terms of the building physics and chemistry what you're made of have come under
1918940	1924300	more attention recently as a result of computer science now this this is very this does raise
1924300	1929260	something I'm particularly interested in when you talk of computer science and that is the
1929260	1935180	interaction between our technology in the case of computers and philosophy not just science and
1935180	1940060	philosophy but technology and philosophy I mean computers were originally constructed on the
1940060	1945420	basis of a self-conscious analogy with the human mind weren't they but as they became more and more
1945420	1952540	sophisticated we began to learn things from them about the human mind so our construction of computers
1952540	1959500	and what they then tell us about ourselves seems to actually proceed by interactive growth isn't
1959500	1965340	that so that's right and today the this is one area by the way in which philosophers are in close
1965340	1970940	contact with scientists that is the fields of linguistics cognitive psychology computer science
1970940	1977020	philosophy of language today interact constantly people send papers to one another not because
1977020	1981420	someone tells them to there are conferences at which specialists in these field meet together again
1981420	1987020	not because someone decided there should be some cross fertilization the interesting thing about
1987020	1992460	the computer case if I can stick with it for a moment is one might have thought that the computer
1992460	1998460	the rise of the computer would encourage a certain kind of vulgar materialism the idea so after all
1998460	2004860	we are machines so after all everything about us can be explained in terms of physics and chemistry
2005500	2011740	paradoxically the real effect of the computer on psychology and on philosophy of mind has been a
2011740	2018380	decrease in that kind of reductionism see the thing about the computer is that when you work
2018380	2023740	with computers you very rarely have to think about their physics and chemistry there's a
2023740	2028380	distinction that people draw between their software meaning their program their instructions
2028380	2034220	their rules the way they do things and their hardware and generally you ignore their hardware
2034220	2039260	you talk about computers at the software level and you wouldn't really be able to explain
2039980	2045100	what they do in a way that would be of any use to anyone in terms of the hardware level you
2046140	2050300	there is a kind of emergence here although it's not a mystical kind of emergence it's not that
2050300	2058060	they're violating the laws of physics it's just that the the level of work at higher level facts
2058060	2063980	about organization have a kind of autonomy you'd say this the fact that's following this program
2063980	2069340	explains why it does this and I don't need to know how it's built I only need to know it can be built
2069340	2076060	in such a way that it will follow this program this is a return to a view and if you apply this to
2076060	2081020	the mind it suggests a return to a view of the mind that I associate with Aristotle there's the
2081020	2090460	view that we are not ghosts in a machine not spirits which only temporarily embodies but that
2090460	2095580	the relation between the mind and the body is a relation of function to what has that function
2096220	2100060	Aristotle said if you use the word soul in connection with an ax and of course he said you
2100060	2105500	don't you'd say the soul of an ax is cutting and he said the soul of the eye is seeing and he thought
2105500	2113020	of man as a thing that thinks you're talking now of the alternative to materialism and
2114220	2118860	say a religious view that this gives us puts me in mind instantly of the most significant of all
2118860	2123500	the materialist philosophers in the modern world namely Marxism which after all is the
2123500	2129020	official state philosophy of about a third of mankind as we sit here discussing this
2129660	2134780	it Marxism claims to be scientific and this is a very important thing about it
2134780	2140700	is there a significant Marxist contribution to the philosophy of science I don't think there's
2140700	2147580	a significant Marxist contribution but I don't think that the Marxists were all wrong either
2148220	2154220	I think Engels was one of the most scientifically learned men of his century he had a he got a
2154220	2159820	number of things wrong but he had an immense general scientific knowledge and anti-during his
2159820	2165980	big book on philosophy of science although it contains some rather strange ideas some of which
2165980	2172060	he gets from Hegel by the way is on the whole a sensible book on philosophy of science among
2172060	2177260	other things on the other hand it's not specifically Marxist I'd say that Engels views in philosophy
2177260	2184540	of science are in large part influenced by the standard philosophy of science of the time they're
2184540	2191180	fairly sophisticated inductive account and what about subsequent Marxist thinkers who also had
2191180	2195740	some pretension to be philosophers like Lenin for example well I think they're uneven Lenin I think
2195740	2201020	is on the whole one of the worst he says for example the theories are copies of motion I mean
2201020	2205900	there you have the copy theory of science just copying off the reality in its crudest view
2206620	2211340	Mao is more sophisticated and Mao is very influenced by John Dewey who was widely read in
2211340	2217500	China in the 1920s do you think it's actually made a contribution to the subject as it is today or
2217500	2224620	not really I think that it anticipated it perhaps might have made a contribution if
2226460	2231820	people had been less ideologically divided because I think non-Marxists could have learned the Marxists
2231820	2239580	were among the first people to try to somehow combine a realist view with the with a stress on
2239580	2244700	practice with a stress on corrigibility and they were very hostile to the notion of a priori truth
2244700	2250380	and today many mainline philosophers of science are very hostile to a priori truth as it is they
2250380	2254700	play somewhat the role in philosophy of science I think that Cain said they play in economics he
2254700	2260700	described Marx as one of his sort of underground predecessors yes yes when I was introducing
2260700	2265660	this program I mentioned not only the philosophy of science but also the philosophy of mathematics
2265660	2273020	and before we close I would like like us to say something about that anyway I suppose one can
2273020	2277500	really say that the central problem in the philosophy of mathematics is a direct parallel
2277500	2283740	to the central problem in the philosophy of science namely how does it fit the world with science it's
2283740	2290140	how does science fit the world in mathematics it's how does mathematics fit the world is that right
2290140	2297260	that's right and it's even worse because if you're trying to defend a copy view a correspondence
2297260	2302380	view of truth and empirical science you can answer the question well how do we build up this picture
2302380	2307340	in such a way that corresponds by saying we have sense organs as I mentioned before that's not a
2307340	2311900	total answer because there's a tremendous amount of interpretation involved in simple seeing and
2311900	2318300	simple hearing but if you are talking about numbers and sets and somebody says okay if
2318300	2323740	mathematical knowledge is simply some kind of a copy of the way numbers are and the way sets are
2323740	2331100	and the way other abstract objects that mathematician study are the question then what sense enables us
2331100	2337260	to see how they are because what is a number what yes yes a deeply problematic question but
2337260	2341020	still an important one that's right and on the other hand I don't want to say that the anti
2341020	2347020	correspondence view has it very easy either it seems to me that mathematical knowledge is a real
2347020	2351020	puzzle and I think that philosophers should concentrate more on philosophy of mathematics
2351020	2356220	than they do now because it seems to be an area where no theory works very well isn't there another
2356220	2363260	very important parallel between mathematics and science I mean throughout the history of science
2363260	2369260	one of the conflicts has been between one camp who thought that it was all about objects in the
2369260	2375580	world which existed independent of human experience and another camp which thought no it's human beings
2375580	2381260	and observers who actually contribute most of this and as you pointed out much earlier our discussion
2381260	2387820	the truth is almost certainly a combination of both there is a long-standing dispute in mathematics
2387820	2392380	isn't there between one body of people who think that mathematical knowledge is something that so
2392380	2397980	to speak inherent in the structure of the world and we derive it from the world by experience
2397980	2403980	and observation and another body of mathematical thought that says no no no mathematics is a
2403980	2410780	creation of the human mind which we then tries to try to impose on reality like a grid as it were
2410780	2416780	on a landscape isn't that so that's right the latter story is attractive because of the sense
2416780	2422700	organ problem but it doesn't seem to work either because it it seems that we're not free to impose
2422700	2427740	any mathematics or any logic we want almost anyone would admit that at least you have to be
2427740	2433580	consistent and what's consistent what isn't isn't somehow something we can just make up or decide
2434140	2439740	as when we try to stress conventionalist accounts subjective accounts we come up against the
2439740	2444700	objectivity of mathematics we try to stress the objectivity of mathematics we come up against
2444700	2450060	another set of problems I think we can learn a lot more than we now know about human knowledge
2450060	2457260	and about scientific knowledge by going further into this area talking of of where we're going from
2457260	2460540	where we are so to speak I think the most interesting way in which you could end this
2460540	2465660	discussion Professor Putnam would be by talking about what you regard as the most interesting
2465660	2470460	problem areas of the moment and therefore I take it the most likely growth areas for the
2470460	2475580	immediate future in both of the subjects we've been discussing philosophy of science and philosophy
2475580	2481420	of mathematics okay I think that if I'm allowed to confine my prediction of the immediate future
2481420	2486220	because we know that long-run predictions are always false but in the immediate future I would
2486220	2491260	expect philosophy of mathematics to be a growth area and philosophy of logic I would expect
2491260	2496860	philosophy of physics I think to decline somewhat from its central place in philosophy of science
2496860	2502300	although I think they're part of it touches philosophy of logic the question the astounding
2502300	2507180	suggestion has actually come forward in connection with quantum mechanics that we may have to change
2507180	2513340	our logic our view of what the true logical laws are in order to really understand how the world
2513340	2518140	can be quantum mechanical I think this side of philosophy of quantum mechanics that touches
2518140	2524860	philosophy of logic will be a hot discussion area but more generally I think areas which we almost
2524860	2529580	don't think of as philosophy of science that become philosophy of language and philosophy of mind
2529580	2533980	like these questions about computer models of the mind computer models of language
2534780	2541340	and these more general questions about theories of truth the nature of truth the nature of
2541340	2547500	verification how science can be objective even though there's not a rigorous scientific method
2547500	2553260	that I think these questions will continue to be the staples of the field one thing that worries me
2553260	2560700	about this whole area is its relationship to the educated layman I mean which in a sense is the
2560700	2567100	person our discussion has been for after all it's now over 70 years since the 25 year old
2567100	2572140	Einstein published the theorem of relativity and I'm sure you'll agree with me that it's true
2572140	2577420	to say now that the great majority of educated people with higher educations university degrees
2577420	2582860	and so on still have scarcely any idea of what this is all about and it's done very little to
2582860	2587820	actually influence their view of the world isn't there a danger that now science and mathematics
2587820	2595100	are simply racing ahead and the whole new range and world of insight that that is giving us into
2595100	2601180	the universe in which we live simply isn't filtering through to the non-specialist or not
2601180	2605740	filtering through anything like fast enough that is a danger but it's one that something can be done
2605740	2611900	about there's now for example a text of special relativity called spacetime physics which is
2611900	2617900	designed for the first month of the first freshman college physics course and the authors say at the
2617900	2622460	beginning that they look forward to the time when it will be taught in high schools and do you think
2622460	2627100	that time will in fact come and quite soon I'm sure of it as well I I think you're right and
2627100	2632060	indeed I hope you are thank you very much Professor Putnam thank you
