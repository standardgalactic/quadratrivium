0	18240	If we took a poll among professional teachers of philosophy on the question, who is the
18240	22920	most important living philosopher, it's not at all obvious, to me at least, who would
22920	27520	get the most votes. But we can be fairly sure about some of the names that would be in the
27520	34120	top half dozen. Quine, Popper, Jean-Paul Sartre, Chomsky probably, though strictly speaking,
34120	38640	he's not exactly a philosopher. Well, the first of those names, and one on which I'd
38640	43680	lay pretty short odds, is that of Willard Van Orman Quine, one of the professors of
43680	49920	philosophy at Harvard. Quine was born in 1908 and is still highly productive, so he's had
49920	55000	a long career, and it's by no means over yet. He's published innumerable articles and
55000	59960	over a dozen books, the best known of which are From a Logical Point of View, published
59960	68120	in 1953, and Word and Object, published in 1960. First and foremost, he's a logician,
68120	72440	and the original contributions to the subject which made him famous are for the most part
72440	77280	highly technical and not really accessible to the layman, though they always had their
77280	82520	ultimate roots in problems fundamental to philosophy. However, in the latter part of
82520	88360	his career, he's become more overtly interested in philosophy in a more general sense, and
88360	92720	I thought it would be uniquely valuable in this program to have a philosopher at the
92720	99560	very summit of world reputation talking about the basics of philosophy and of his own activity.
99560	105760	Professor Quine, what do you regard as the central task or tasks of philosophy?
105760	113200	I think a philosophy is concerned with our knowledge of the world and the nature of the
113200	121200	world. I think a philosophy is attempting to round out the system of the world as Newton
121200	126880	put it. There have been philosophers who have thought of philosophy as somehow separate
126880	136160	from science and as providing a firm basis on which to build science. But this, I consider
136160	142920	an empty dream, science, much of science is firmer than philosophy is or can even perhaps
142920	148720	aspire to be. I think a philosophy is continuous with science even as a part of science.
148720	153880	Well, if it's continuous with science and even part of science, how does it differ from
153880	162720	the rest of science? It differs in generality and in abstractness. Science is a continuum
162720	169680	extending from history and engineering and at one end, if we think of science broadly,
169680	181760	to such abstract pursuits as philosophy and mathematics at the other. Philosophy considers
181800	189560	the question of the nature of cause, for instance, where physics contends itself with finding
189560	196000	causal relations between specific sorts of events, biology between other sorts of events.
196000	202320	Again, whereas the zoologist will tell us that there are wombats and the physicist will
202320	207520	tell us that there are electrons. The mathematician will tell us there are no end of prime numbers.
207520	212320	The philosopher is interested rather in what sorts of things there are altogether. In these
212320	216720	ways that philosophy is more abstract in general. In other words, the philosopher is investigating
216720	221760	what constitutes the connective tissue of everyone's thoughts, including other people's
221760	227760	thoughts, so that the physicist is trying to find out whether or not A causes B, but
227760	233280	the philosopher is saying, but what does it mean to say that anything causes anything?
233280	238960	The physicist is trying to find out, say, what particular subatomic particles there are and
238960	244240	the philosopher says, but what does it mean to say of anything that it exists? It's at this
244240	250280	level of complete generality that the philosophers' investigations occur. Is that right? Now, do
250280	257960	you include in this or do you exclude from it the age-old questions of how the world
257960	265080	got here in the first place or how life began? I exclude these from philosophy. How the world
265080	270280	began is a problem for the physicist and astronomer, and of course there have been conjectures from
270280	276120	that quarter. How life began is a problem for the biologist on which he's made notable progress
276120	285000	in recent years. Why the world began, why life began, on the other hand, I think, are pseudo
285080	291320	questions, because I can't, I can't imagine what an answer would look like.
291320	296440	And you think that because there is no conceivable answer to these questions, they are meaningless
296440	303480	questions. Yes, yes, yes. So in other words, you regard the central tasks of philosophy as the
303480	310200	analysis and elucidation of concepts that are central to various fields of human activity,
310200	317080	and also, in particular, notions like what it is for something to be a cause of something else,
317080	322920	what it is for something to exist, what it is for something to be, shall we say, a scientific law,
322920	328040	the most general notions that are, as it were, the connecting tissue of thought and that we
328040	333800	have to use and have to employ in the specific activities that people like scientists, or I
333800	338920	could even be politicians, lawyers and so on, are engaged in. Is that a correct way of putting
338920	344280	your view? Yes, yes, I would agree with that. Do you think that the main or the most important
344280	350440	questions that philosophers have to deal with can be grouped under any particular headings?
351320	357160	There are two headings, which I think provide an important classification to begin with.
357960	361080	There are the ontological questions, as they might be called. Well, I think you'll need to
361080	366760	explain that term. These would be questions as to what there is, the general questions,
366760	371720	as to what sorts of things there are, as well as the question of what it means to exist,
371720	381320	what it means to exist, for there to be something. And the other classification, the other class,
381320	387320	would be, might be called the predicated questions. Questions as to what sorts of things can
388120	393720	meaningfully be asked about what there is. In other words, you've got two enormous spheres
393720	399480	of questioning here, one about what there is, and the other about what we can know about what
399480	404600	there is, or what we can say about what there is. Yes, and epistemology would be included in the letter.
404600	409320	Yes, yes, yes. Now, I think since you've made this distinction, for clarity's sake, in our
409320	414440	discussion, we ought to cling to it a little, and I think we'll take these two areas one at a time,
414440	421480	and we'll take your first one first, the whole group of questions about what there is, what exists,
421480	427800	or as you say, what is called ontology by philosophers. Although there are innumerable
427800	431960	theories about this, I think it's fair to say that throughout the history of the subject,
431960	437720	there have been two broad opposing views in the matter of ontology, between what you might very
437720	443080	roughly call materialists, and what you might call idealists. I mean, although there are innumerable
443080	449240	different versions of both doctrines, you do have on the one hand a view that reality consists of
449240	456440	matter or material objects in space and time, which exist independently of anyone's or anything's
456440	462680	experience of them. And on the other hand, you have a view of reality as consisting ultimately in
462680	469720	spirits or minds, or is existing in the mind of God, or as being put together in our minds.
470600	476600	Now, can I put very crudely the $64 question to you and ask you which side you're on?
476600	484600	I'm on the materialist side. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I hold that physical objects are real
484600	491560	and exist externally and independently of us. I don't hold that there are only these physical
491560	499240	objects. There are also abstract objects, objects of mathematics that seem to be needed to fill
499480	510760	the system of the world. But I don't recognize the existence of minds of mental entities,
511480	517720	in any sense other than as attributes or activities on the part of physical objects,
517720	525720	mainly persons. That must mean then that you not only reject idealism, it must also mean that you
525720	531880	reject dualism. I mean, one might describe dualism as almost the common sense view. I think throughout
531880	539480	human history, most human beings have taken the view that reality consists ultimately of entities of
539480	547000	two categorically different kinds, minds and bodies. And as far as we know, in all civilizations,
547000	551800	past and present, most people seem to have thought this, that there were bodies and that there were
551800	557000	minds and that these were two fundamentally different kinds of things. Now that's what is
557000	563400	meant by the term dualismness. Now you must reject this view if you don't believe in the existence
563400	571800	of minds. Yes, true. I do reject the view. The dualistic view presents problems, creates problems
571800	584520	which are neither soluble nor, it seems to me, necessary. It's clear that an individual's decisions
585800	591240	will affect his movements, will determine his movements in many cases, and his movements in
591240	598440	turn will have consequences in the movements of other physical objects. At the same time, the
598840	610360	natural scientists, the physicists, insist on a closed system. There being physical causes,
610360	616760	physical explanations in principle for the physical events. They allow no place for the
616760	622040	incursion of influences from outside the physical world. Given all this, it would seem then that
623000	628360	a person's decisions must themselves be activity on the part of a physical object.
630040	640120	The alternative of rejecting this basic principle of physical science to the effect that
640920	647880	every change is, that there's no change without a change in the distribution of
647880	654280	micro-physical properties over space-time, over space. That alternative I find
656120	663400	uncongenial because the successes in natural science have been such that we must take their
663400	668680	presuppositions very seriously. In other words, what you are saying is that wishes, emotions,
668680	675240	feelings, decisions, thoughts are all things which take place in physical objects, namely people.
675560	680440	Of course, in a sense, that's an obvious fact. What you're saying is that not only are these
680440	685800	always accompanied by micro-physical changes, changes in our brains and our central nervous
685800	694040	systems and so on, but they indeed are those micro-physical changes. Before I go on to raise
694040	698120	with you some of the apparent difficulties inherent in that view, I wonder if you can
698840	704120	explain how it is that almost all of mankind, as I said only a few minutes ago,
704760	711400	has disagreed with you about this. Why people in general take a dualist view of reality?
712840	716600	Let me add this point. If I put that question to almost anyone else, he could say, well,
716600	721960	it's obvious why people think like that. They think like that because dualism corresponds to
721960	727080	directly experienced reality. That is how we experience things, but you can't say that because
727080	730600	you don't think it is how we experience things. What would your answer be?
732200	744760	I recognize certainly a profound difference between so-called mental events and externally
744760	753240	observable physical ones in spite of construing these mental events as themselves. Event states
753320	760840	activity on the part of a physical object. As for the traditional dualistic attitude,
760840	768120	certainly this goes back to primitive times. I think one cause of it, partial explanation may
768120	778440	be the experience of dreams and the seeming separation of the mind from the body. In that state,
779080	788760	certainly animism, antedated science, Thales, the first of the Greek philosophers, has said to
788760	796280	have said that all things are full of gods. Primitive peoples today are said to be animists
797000	803640	very largely and to believe that what we call inanimate objects are animated by spirits.
804040	816120	One can even imagine traces of animism in the basic concepts of our science itself.
817240	827320	The notion of cause, I suspect, began with the feeling of effort, of pushing on the part of
827320	836760	the individual, the subjective feeling, as a mental entity, and force surely had that sort of origin.
837640	844760	But as time has gone on and as science has progressed in recent centuries,
845640	860200	the dissociation of these concepts from their original mental context seems to have been conducive
860200	871560	to great scientific progress. I think of physicalism as a departure, a product of
872520	875960	latter-day science, which of course is a phenomenon that's very
877080	883160	uncharacteristic of the history of mankind. But I don't think that the chief reason why
883160	887960	most people take a dualist view of reality is to do with dreams or the other things that you've
887960	894920	mentioned. I think it's chiefly because we all do have, it seems to me, direct experience of an
894920	901720	internal flow of thoughts and emotions and responses and desires and fantasies and memories
901720	905960	and so on, which is going on all the time that we're awake and which is extremely complex,
905960	910360	not only in the sense that it may be about complicated things, but also in the sense that
910360	915000	there may be several different things going on at once. And I think we're all directly aware of
915000	921000	something like this going on inside ourselves, and this doesn't manifest itself in any way in
921720	929080	observable external behavior. We are aware of these things and I'm not denying their existence,
929720	939640	but I'm construing them or reconstruing them as activities on the part of physical objects,
940520	951880	namely on our part. And the fact that these are not observable on the whole from the outside
951880	958600	doesn't distinguish them from much that the physicist assumes in the way of internal microscopic
958600	962760	or submicroscopic structure of inanimate objects. A great deal goes on that we don't
963400	968200	observe from the outside and that we have to account for conjecturally the
971160	976120	important reason for construing all this activity as activity on the part of bodies
976760	984200	is to preserve the closed character of the system of the physical world.
984200	988920	Does this mean that you deny the real existence of the age-old problem about whether or not we have
988920	1002680	free will? It doesn't mean that, but because the will would retain its status even though
1003880	1015960	becoming ultimately a neural phenomenon and an aspect of the activity of a physical object.
1016520	1021080	However, I think the problem of the freedom of the will is an outcome of a confusion.
1023720	1028920	There's no question in my mind about the freedom of the will that the will is free
1030280	1040280	in the sense that people very often do what they will to do. They are free
1041160	1047720	to within limits of constraint and within limits of their strength or talent
1048520	1054200	to do things that they will to do. Freedom of the will does not mean that the will is free
1054200	1059640	to will as it will. That would be nonsense and it doesn't mean that the will is uncaused. The will
1059640	1068440	is caused and we all are prepared to recognize that the will is caused when we try to train
1068440	1074520	children in such a way as to influence their behavior or enact laws to discourage criminals
1075320	1081960	or we try to get votes. People try to sell things. All these are cases of
1086120	1095800	causing people to will, but the freedom of their will remains insofar as their activity
1096680	1103960	is the result of a causal chain, one link of which is the willing and that willing can be
1103960	1111400	itself caused in this. Given that you hold these views, how do you see the traditional
1111400	1118520	body-mind problem? Let me just remind our viewers of what that is. I've said earlier that most
1118520	1123720	people seem to take a dualist view of reality, a view that everything in the universe consists
1123720	1130280	ultimately of either minds or bodies, that there are both kinds of entity. That has given rise to
1130280	1134440	a traditional problem which no one has ever come up with a thoroughly satisfactory solution to.
1134440	1142200	That is the question, how are these incorporeal, abstract, non-material minds able to actually
1142200	1149240	move and push about the material bodies? It's clear that since you don't believe in the existence of
1149240	1154280	minds as independently of bodies, the problem does not present itself to you in that form.
1155720	1159560	Given your views, do you simply bypass the mind-body problem totally?
1160600	1167400	No. As you say, the body-mind problem doesn't exist in that form for me. There's no longer
1167400	1171800	that problem of interaction and in fact it's in order to eliminate the problem in that form
1172440	1179480	that I opt for physicalism. However, the problem then arises.
1181960	1187480	How are we to talk about all these ordinarily so-called mental events and mental activity,
1188520	1195160	this flux of experience if we're not recognizing minds, not recognizing mental entities?
1196120	1203560	It's no good trying to paraphrase all this into neurological terms because it would take too
1203560	1208200	much in a way of detailed understanding of the mechanism of the nervous system.
1210600	1221800	Now, there's a, as a first step, a quick, easy solution to that. One may simply keep the
1221880	1231640	mentalistic terminology, but regard all these terms as terms applicable to bodies
1231640	1239480	and to the activity of bodies. This is easy. This is too easy in a way because there's another
1239480	1246520	point about the, in favor of the physicalistic attitude, which I haven't touched on up to now,
1246520	1255960	namely the advantage of intersubjectivity, objectivity. The data are not introspective data,
1255960	1265000	the data are shared, can be shared by other observers. It's because of this, in large part,
1265000	1274040	at least, that the natural sciences have been so successful. Now, and introspective psychology
1274040	1282280	has not been comparably successful. Well, now, if we simply take over all the conceptual apparatus
1282280	1288120	of introspective psychology and mentalism, and simply try to excuse it by saying all these
1288120	1295480	attributes or activities of bodies, we're no longer getting the benefit of the intersubjectivity of
1295800	1305320	natural science. However, there's a, there's a way of coping with this difficulty, and it is
1305320	1310920	behaviorism, in the sense of which I think behaviorism is important and valuable. I think
1311560	1327160	the role of behaviorism is the legitimation of mentalistic terms without having to go through the
1328760	1333320	indirect and, in fact, impracticable channel of neurology.
1333720	1342760	Criteria, observable, intersubjectively observable criteria for mental states,
1343960	1348360	are found in behavior, in observable behavior.
1348360	1350040	And that would include verbal behavior.
1350040	1358520	Including verbal behavior, yes. And insofar, as such criteria are available, we do have the
1358520	1366040	benefits of natural science, after all. And this is without full neurological explanation.
1366040	1376760	So, the extent to which I'm a behaviorist is, in seeing behaviorism as a way of making objective
1376760	1381960	sense of mentalistic concepts, I don't identify the mental states with the behavior.
1382920	1390520	I identify the mental states, rather, with neural states, nor do I regard behavioral
1390520	1397720	accounts as, in the last analysis, explanatory of the mental states, mental phenomena.
1398520	1402520	I think that the full explanation of these is to be found, rather, at the neurological level.
1403000	1407960	In other words, if you're saying that behaviorism is not an explanation of the kind of problems
1408040	1412840	of which the philosopher deals, but a way of formulating them, I mean, it's a kind of language
1412840	1419400	in which the problems should be couched or formulated before we then go on to try and
1419400	1425400	provide solutions. Exactly, yes. I think it would be helpful if we paused a moment at this point,
1425400	1431960	Professor Quine, and if I try to recapitulate the ground that we've covered before we attempt
1431960	1438520	any forward moves. I started this discussion by asking you what you regarded as the central
1438520	1443240	tasks of philosophy, and you not only said what you thought philosophers ought to be doing, you
1443240	1447480	also said what you thought they ought not to be doing, and you ruled out a number of questions,
1447480	1452360	but you grouped the questions that you thought philosophers ought to concern themselves with,
1452360	1457480	under two main heads. The first head being questions about what exists, what does reality
1457480	1462600	consist of, and the second group being what can we know about this, and how can we know,
1462600	1467160	and what can we say about it, and so on. Now, from that point onwards, we've been pursuing
1467160	1474360	the first of those two groups of questions, and you've said that in your view, your view of
1474360	1480200	reality is physicalist. You think all reality consists in physical entities, that there are not
1480200	1485480	minds separate from physical entities, and that the notion that there are leads us into all sorts
1485480	1492920	of conceptual confusions, which you think a behaviorist analysis liberates us from. I'd like
1492920	1498760	us now to start going over to questions of the second kind, because we were beginning to get
1498760	1503640	into them already, and that's why I thought it time to stop and reassess where we were.
1504360	1510120	Can we now move into the second area of how we acquire knowledge of this physical world in
1510200	1517800	which we find ourselves? Good. One correction I would make, though,
1518920	1523000	my position is not that there are only physical objects, there are also abstract objects.
1523720	1527080	But these abstract objects are not mental. It's important to make that distinction,
1527080	1531400	isn't it? You don't believe in the existence of minds separate from physical things,
1531400	1535400	but you do believe in the existence of certain abstract entities. Yes, numbers, notably.
1536200	1540920	But I think you need to explain that a bit. If you are a physicalist, how can you justify your
1540920	1560040	belief in the existence of abstract entities at all? The status of sets or classes and numbers
1560120	1566840	and functions, I think, again, not from the point of view of the predicate side of philosophy,
1567800	1578120	is not basically different from the status of hypothetical entities such as elementary
1578120	1584440	particles in physics. In both cases, it's a matter of framing hypotheses
1585080	1594520	of which imply our past observations, of which imply future observations under
1596600	1604360	specifiable conditions, which would then serve to corroborate or refute these hypotheses.
1604920	1613080	And these general hypotheses contain reference not only to the ordinary observable objects,
1613160	1619000	but also to many auxiliary objects, we might say, in the way of unobservable physical particles,
1619000	1623080	and also in the way of numbers and functions, because these come into the formulations,
1623080	1630760	into the hypotheses of a quantitative kind. And even classes or sets, the biologist speaks of
1631720	1645560	genre and species of organisms. And all these entities are furniture of the world,
1646600	1649160	posited on an equal footing in our system of the world.
1649160	1653080	Well, you say on an equal footing, but it does seem to me that there is a very important difference
1653080	1658280	between the sense in which subatomic particles are unobservable and the sense in which they
1658280	1664360	numbers are unobservable. And subatomic particles are bits of stuff, but it just so happens,
1664360	1669000	perhaps because of the accident of our optical apparatus, that they're bits of stuff which
1669000	1674440	are too small for us to see. But if we had microscopic eyes or super microscopic eyes,
1674440	1678520	perhaps we could see them. And if we had different kinds of fingers, we could pick them up. I mean,
1678520	1684840	they are bits of material, but numbers aren't bits of material. However small, are they? I mean,
1684840	1690520	they are, as it were, abstract through and through. There is nothing but abstraction to them.
1691400	1698280	It's true. There's this discontinuity. But the continuity of ordinary observable objects with the
1700280	1707400	elementary particles is rather more tenuous than had once been supposed. Because
1709240	1712600	an elementary particle is too small, for instance, even in principle to be
1713480	1723800	detected by light, because it's smaller than any wavelength.
1725800	1731240	Furthermore, the behavior of the elementary particles is basically unlike that of larger
1732440	1738360	bodies, so much so that it's, I think, only by courtesy that they're called material.
1738680	1749160	The indeterminacy with respect to whether two segments of the, two segments of paths of an
1749160	1753160	electron are segments of the path of the same electron or two different ones.
1756600	1765880	Indeterminacies of position, the antithesis between wave and core puzzle in the interpretation of
1765880	1773240	light, and other anomalies, something called the Bose-Einstein statistic, all suggest that
1775080	1782120	the analogy of body is an analogy that was useful for extrapolation up to a point. But then the
1784120	1789160	reshuffling, the evolution of hypotheses in the light of further experimentation and further
1789240	1797400	refutations, have finally carried us to the point where the continuity is no longer so evident.
1798600	1802680	I would like to leave at that particular point there, Professor Klein, because I want to step
1802680	1806840	back three paces in our discussion and take up something which strikes me as being a very
1806840	1811880	much more general interest, that we were talking about a moment ago, and then we got slightly
1811880	1816680	sidetracked, and I think it was partly my fault that we did. I want to go back to the point where
1816680	1823480	you were saying, or suggesting anyway, that the adoption of a physicalist approach to reality,
1823480	1830600	or a behaviorist analysis of behaviorist where formulating problems, has the effect of liberating
1830600	1836440	you from the spell of certain entrenched ways of looking at things, which though they may be part
1836440	1841800	of common sense, are nevertheless mistaken. Now that's the point I want to take you up at.
1842520	1848920	Can you say what some of the entrenched ideas are from which you believe your approach would
1848920	1855960	liberate us? Good. Liberation is one way of looking at it. Stirner discipline is another way of
1855960	1863320	looking at behaviorism. But at any rate, a major example is the notion of meaning.
1864280	1875800	There's the common sense notion that words somehow convey meanings. How do we know that
1875800	1882040	the same words convey the same meaning to two speakers? We can see that the speakers react
1882040	1887640	in the same way. All this is describable in behavioral terms, but might the meanings themselves
1887640	1893960	be different? What behavioral sense can be made of the question? No behavioral sense, no adequate
1893960	1903960	behavioral sense has been made of it. There are other notions that come similarly into question.
1904840	1912440	Translation. Once the notion of meaning is questioned, the notion of translation becomes
1912440	1917560	more complex. We can no longer say it's simply a matter of producing another sentence. It has
1917560	1925880	the same meaning as the sentence that's being translated. The notion of necessity, again,
1926440	1934680	comes into question. Well, there are two kinds of necessity out there, logical and causal. Yes,
1934680	1941000	the one commonly understood as necessity by virtue of the meanings of the words.
1942440	1945240	The sentence is true by virtue of the meanings of the words that it contains.
1946200	1953560	This characterization goes by the board if the notion of meaning does. Then there's the notion
1953560	1962920	of physical necessity, necessity by virtue of physical law. This doesn't depend in the same way
1963000	1970120	on meaning, but by somewhat the same sort of scruples, it also becomes questionable.
1977000	1988120	It's not clear to me that there's a difference between a general truth in the form of a general
1988120	1995640	proposition, general statement, which just happens to be true and one that is a law.
1998600	2009880	The term necessary, the adverb necessarily, is in very common use and suggests that perhaps
2009880	2015480	people have a distinction in mind between two sorts of truth, the necessary and the accidental
2015560	2023800	or contingent. But I think the use of the ordinary use of that word can be explained otherwise.
2024680	2033560	I think it's dependent on situation, on context. One says necessarily, and follows it with a
2033560	2040360	sentence, when he thinks that the other person is bound to admit it because of what he already
2040360	2048280	has committed himself to or because he may be presumed to believe. This will vary with the context.
2049000	2053400	So you're calling into question such very fundamental notions of our thinking as
2054280	2061720	causal necessity, logical necessity, the idea of a law, the notion of meaning.
2062600	2067000	The ground is beginning to disappear from under our feet. I think what I would like to do at this
2067000	2075000	stage, Professor Quine, is ask you to characterize for us as a whole the kind of view of the world
2075000	2084120	that we're coming out with. Can you? Good. Well, let's proceed again in terms of that dichotomy
2084120	2093960	between the ontological and the predicational. On the ontological side of what I am accepting,
2094520	2103480	assuming. The physical objects, the physical object being construed quite generously as
2103480	2109640	the content of any portion, however scattered and discontinuous of space-time, and all
2111400	2117720	classes of such things, and all classes of such classes and so on. And mathematicians have
2117800	2128200	known, discovered over the past century, how all talk of numbers and functions and all other
2128200	2136040	mathematical entities can be paraphrased into talk of the pure set theory of classes.
2138760	2143400	Classes, classes of classes, appropriate ones can be made to do the work of numbers and of
2143400	2148760	functions and the rest. So we need these. On the other hand, these are abstract objects that I
2148760	2155320	accept. There are others that I would reject, properties. I would reject because there's the
2155320	2164520	question of, there's the question in what circumstances do two descriptions, two characterizations
2164520	2169320	determine the same property, and in what circumstances do they determine different
2169320	2174920	properties which just happen to be properties of all the same things? The problem in short of
2174920	2183320	individuation, identification of properties. And it's ordinarily said that two clauses,
2183320	2187640	let's say two phrases, determine the same property if they have the same meaning.
2188600	2192280	But of course, this characterization goes by the board if we don't accept the notion of meaning.
2194120	2198360	In the case of classes, this problem of identification does not arise because classes are
2198360	2205640	identical simply if they have the same members. Properties I'm persuaded are dispensable in
2205640	2212360	science. It's not clear how to dispense with the classes. So this would be my tentative ontology
2212360	2217480	and I would regard it as part of science and subject to the fallibility of the rest of science,
2217480	2221080	namely the individuals and the hierarchy of classes and classes of classes and so on built
2221800	2228280	upon them. The individuals being physical objects. On the predicate side,
2231320	2237800	my view is I think mainly rather negative. It's one of
2238120	2250200	rejecting predicates that have too little in the way of
2254200	2261160	behavioral or let's say observable criteria for their application or failing that.
2262120	2267960	I think one must also accept theoretical predicates which don't admit of observational
2267960	2277720	criteria. But there one must insist on there being pretty firmly related to predicates of
2277720	2288760	the observational kind through laws, hypotheses, general physical theory, which makes for
2292120	2303560	a well knit system of the world which expedites prediction. So that I would insist not that
2304600	2311720	predicates have necessary and sufficient conditions in observation but that they have
2311720	2320200	a good share in the way of observable criteria symptoms of application or that they
2321320	2325160	play a quite a promising role in the theoretical hypotheses.
2325880	2330440	One thing that pleases me very much about the discussion that we've had is that none of it
2330440	2337400	so far has been specifically about language or about words and I say that because a lot of
2337400	2344280	intelligent laymen who begin to take an interest in philosophy are sometimes put off by what they
2344280	2348360	take to be the discovery that modern philosophers are doing nothing but talking about words,
2348360	2353960	talking about terms, analyzing sentences, statements and so on. And you haven't talked in
2353960	2357960	that way at all and it's quite clear that the problems with which you are concerned are not
2357960	2365640	problems about language. Nevertheless, someone opening your books or a student coming to study
2365640	2370920	with you at Harvard for the first time would find that a great deal of your technique of approach
2370920	2377160	to these problems is via the analysis of concepts and therefore careful attention to words, the
2377160	2384280	elucidation of sentences and statements and so on. Why is it that you and other contemporary
2384280	2389960	philosophers adopt this linguistic approach to what are after all essentially non-linguistic
2389960	2397640	problems? One reason is a strategy that I call Semantic Ascent, A-S-C-E-N-T.
2397640	2408200	Philosophical issues are often concerned with very fundamental traits of one's conceptual scheme
2409800	2415480	and if two philosophers disagree on such points, it's difficult for them to discuss their
2415480	2420200	disagreement without each of them begging the question because it's hard to reason and argue
2420200	2425000	without making use of the fundamental principles of one's own conceptual scheme.
2426360	2437480	And a way of avoiding or minimizing this difficulty is the device of
2439160	2445080	moving up one step semantically and talking about words instead of using the words to talk about
2445080	2454680	the things. And if one makes this move, then one can talk about the rival systems as systems of
2454680	2463480	sentences. One can compare them in point of simplicity and in point of inclusiveness and
2464520	2473080	make a judgment on a shared basis without the circularity, the question begging.
2473160	2476920	We're coming to the end of our discussion now, Professor crime, but I would like just before we
2476920	2483320	do literally end, I'd like to ask you if you can say anything at all perhaps in the light of the
2483320	2489160	discussion we've had up to this point about what you are currently working on. I have to ask you
2489160	2493080	to be briefer than I would like because we have so little time left, but I would like you before
2493080	2498840	we end to say something about what you're doing original work on now. Well, at present I've been
2499800	2503480	writing short things in an effort to elucidate some of the points already in my
2504840	2509800	other writings or to extend and improve them. But there are several
2511400	2514200	problems on which I would like to see someone make breakthroughs.
2515080	2521640	One of them is connected with language, namely the development of some conceptual scheme to take
2521640	2529000	the place of the untenable old-fashioned theory of meaning, something new and something more
2529000	2532520	acceptable in the way of theory of what goes into good translation, for instance.
2535320	2540440	This is a job perhaps for linguists, but it's something with a philosophical interest and
2540440	2546760	it's a job also where someone with a philosophical curiosity is apt to be helpful to the linguists.
2546840	2556280	A second one is related rather to psychology. I should like to see a system of concepts developed
2557000	2564840	which would do the work of the old mentalistic idioms of propositional attitude, x believes that
2564840	2570760	p, x regrets that p, x hopes that p, the sort of thing. These idioms are subject to some subtle
2570760	2576440	logical difficulties and complications and they're very wanting, in large part of their
2576440	2582360	applications, wanting in adequate behavioral criteria. I should like to see, not for general
2582360	2590600	discourse, but for scientific purposes, some apparatus which would serve the same purposes
2590600	2596440	as these and be free of those faults. The third is related rather to mathematics.
2597400	2608520	The somewhat begrudgingly one I accept, I accept the apparatus of abstract objects, sets and the
2608520	2613880	rest, as I'll accelerate to science because it seems to be needed. But I should like to see a
2614600	2626440	minimum basis, an economical basis, and a very clear, clearly intelligible basis
2628440	2635240	for set theory, which was adequate, just barely adequate, to so much mathematics as is needed
2635240	2642200	in natural science. And it might be that if this were developed, it would among other things give
2642200	2649800	us a more intuitive understanding of the so-called paradoxes, the antinomies of set theory and their
2649800	2655080	solution, such things as Russell's paradox, which are familiar to some of our viewers,
2656280	2659400	I'm sure, and not to all, so that might be a good place to stop.
2659400	2662840	Well, we will have to stop. Thank you very much, Professor Kwan.
