1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right, the question that I'm going to talk about is, I think, the largest question in contemporary philosophy today.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And in a way, it's the largest question in intellectual life.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And the question is, how do we give an account of ourselves that is consistent with what we know about how the world is anyhow?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You see, the central fact about knowledge is it grows.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we know a lot more than we did 100 or 300 years ago.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And we have a pretty good idea about the basic structure of the universe.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Roughly speaking, it's a matter of physical particles in fields of force.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Particles, probably the wrong word, maybe they're strings or points of mass energy.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But anyway, I leave that, I'm paying the physicist to sort that out.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But now, if the, that's how what the universe consists in, is physical particles.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Those physical particles are mindless and meaningless.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And yet we think that we have lives that are full of consciousness, rationality, intelligence, language, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and all sorts of other things.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, how do we reconcile the basic physical structure of the universe with our conception of ourselves as conscious, rational, free agents?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, maybe we won't succeed in reconciling it.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Maybe we'll have to give up on certain things like free will.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But at any rate, we should start out assuming that our self-conception is more or less accurate and that what we've learned from the natural sciences is accurate.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How do we reconcile the two?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And it's not enough that they should be consistent.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You've got to show how the human reality is a natural outcome of the more basic reality.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You've got to show how, once you've got protons, you're going to get presidents.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And once you've got electrons, you're going to get elections.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The one has to be a natural consequence of the other.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now, last time I talked about one aspect of that problem and that was consciousness.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I think that the big mistake in our history is one I pointed out last time.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And that is the effort to deny that we live in one world.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The effort to say, well, really there are two worlds that we live in.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A physical world as described by science and a spiritual world.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I think that is a deep mistake.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going to resist that.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to say we live in one world and I now have to show you how the things that we think are distinctive of human civilization are part of that one world.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And they're a natural consequence of the more basic reality.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I'm going to be talking about what you could call, to use a fancy jargon, social ontology.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The mode of existence of social phenomena as money and property and government and marriage and universities and income tax deductions and so on.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's a huge range of the social ontology.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now philosophers like paradoxes.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now I'm going to start with a paradox.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All of this human reality is created by human consciousness by created by subjective consciousness.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And yet it's an objective fact.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's an objective fact that I'm a citizen in the United States at the piece of paper in my wallet is a $20 bill and so on.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can there be an objective reality created by human subjectivity?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now those of you who came Tuesday know the answer to that.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The ontological subjectivity, the domain, does not prevent us from having an epistemically objective account of that domain.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's true, human consciousness has to create institutional reality.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But once created, we can then state objective facts about it.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's an objective fact that I'm a professor in Berkeley, a citizen in the United States.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That I owe a lot of credit card debts and all this kind of nonsense that we all live with.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right, now how does it actually work?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What is the nature of the existence of this reality?

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And how do the, here we are, you see I like to think of our history.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We are, as far as we can tell, Darwinian natural selection has suited us just fine

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for a hunter-gatherer existence.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And we apparently haven't had much change in our gene pool in the past 30,000 years.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But we've had an enormous difference in the mode of existence of human life in those 30,000 years.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I want to talk about what the structure of that is.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I'm going to begin by contrasting us with other animals.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a good idea and a good beginning point to think that we are continuous with other animals.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We know enough about biology to see the commonality between us and other animals, especially us and the primates.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All the same, with all the commonality, there is a whole range of terrific differences

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
between us and any other animals known to me.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My dog, my favorite example here, is very intelligent, but he's not worried about what he's going to do for Christmas vacation

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or how he's going to handle the income tax this year.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He just does not have that kind of worry.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, what's the matter with him?

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Is he being irresponsible?

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, no, I think we have an apparatus that gives us a kind of power that he doesn't have.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And the first notion I want to introduce is the notion of an institutional fact.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We have the capacity to create institutional facts, facts that presuppose human institutions,

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
facts like the fact that you are students and faculty members of the University of Indiana

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
or that you're citizens of the United States.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And we need to contrast institutional facts with brute facts.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And the question is, how do you get from a world of brute facts, facts that don't presuppose any institutions,

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
facts like the fact that hydrogen atoms have one electron and the earth is 93 million miles from the sun?

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How do you get from those brute facts to facts about money and citizenship and property and marriage?

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And it seemed to me there was a rather simple answer to that question, and I'm going to give you that answer.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It doesn't quite work, but it's pretty good, and then I'm going to improve on it.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It seemed to me it's rather simple. You need just three things to get from brute reality to institutional reality.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
First of all, you need this remarkable capacity that humans and many other species have to cooperate.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's a piece of jargon that we used to describe this.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You need a capacity for collective intentionality, for the ability to cooperate with other people.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, so you got now these beasts running around the woods and they're able to cooperate with each other.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What else do you need?

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, humans have a remarkable capacity that some animals have, but not all animals,

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and that is they can impose functions on objects.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They can take an object and give it a function, so I'm sorry to give these sorted examples,

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but my pockets are full of objects that will perform various sorted functions like combing my hair

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
or writing on paper or things that are too unmentionable to describe.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But all of these are functional objects.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now notice an interesting thing.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They perform their functions in virtue of their physical structure.

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I can write with this damn thing, but I can't comb my hair with it,

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and I'll show you a thing that I can comb my hair with, but I can't write with it.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Alright, so far so good.

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But then humans in their ingenuity have invented a great idea,

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and it is really the origin of civilization.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Here it is.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can assign functions to objects and people where the function is not performed

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in virtue of the physical structure, or not solely in virtue of the physical structure,

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but in virtue of the fact that we have assigned a status to the person or the object.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And with that status, a function that can only be performed in virtue of the collective acceptance

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
of that status by the community, or at least a sizable number of the members of the community.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And that's the first basic idea I want to introduce is the notion of a status function.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All functions are observer relative.

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It only has the function because we have assigned it the function.

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But status functions are remarkable because the status function doesn't perform the function

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
in virtue of its physical structure, but in virtue of what?

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, in virtue of the beginning we can say the fact that people accept it as having a certain status,

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and now show off even more sorted objects I carry around with me.

110
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Here is another object that performs a function.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a $5 bill.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But unlike that other stuff I showed you, it doesn't perform the function in virtue of its physical structure.

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It performs the function in virtue of the fact that we accept, or recognize, or agree

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
in virtue of our attitudes that it performs the function of the $5 bill, not in virtue of its physical structure.

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So the question we have to ask is, how does that work?

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's an amazing phenomenon.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And for a long time it seemed to me that the key to understanding this was that there are certain kind of rules,

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which I call constitutive rules to distinguish them from regulative rules.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Regulative rules regulate previously existing or independently existing forms of behavior.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Drive on the right-hand side of the road.

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's a regulative rule.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But not all rules are like that.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Some rules constitute the very behavior that they regulate,

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
because performing the behavior consists in acting in accordance with the rules,

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
or at least with a big enough subset of the rules.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The philosopher's favorite example is always chess.

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not the case that a whole lot of people were pushing bits of wood around on boards,

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and some genius said, fellas, we've got to get some rules,

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
because you're always banging into my bishop with your knight.

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, it's not like that.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Rather, playing chess consists in acting in accordance with these rules,

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and typically these rules come in system, the rules of chess or the rules of football.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Or a much more powerful example, the United States Constitution.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a set of constitutive rules.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Now, what do they look like, these constitutive rules?

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, they have a peculiar structure.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They have the structure where something counts as something that, so to speak, isn't intrinsically.

138
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
X counts as Y in context C.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So to take our chess example, such and such a position counts as a legal knight move.

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Such and such a position counts as you being in check.

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Such and such a form of check counts as you being in checkmate.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Getting a majority of votes in the electoral college counts as being president-elect,

143
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court counts as becoming president of the United States.

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You build this structure up where you count something as something else.

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And it seemed to me, that's how we do it.

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We build civilization by repeated application of constitutive rules.

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Now, you might think, well, that's too pathetic an apparatus.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't build civilization with that.

149
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It looks too fragile, but it has two formal properties that are remarkable.

150
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
One formal property is it iterates upward indefinitely.

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So watch, I make noises through my mouth.

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They count as sentences of English.

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Some of those utterances of sentences count as the making of promises.

154
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Some promises count as undertaking a legal contract.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now, watch what's happening in this case.

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We have X1 counts as Y1, but Y1 equals X2,

157
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and that counts as Y2, and we keep going up.

158
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So in the case of a marriage, in the case of the contract,

159
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
making the noise counts as making a promise, making that promise,

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
counts as creating a certain kind of contract,

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and certain kinds of contract count as getting married.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Now, in the state of California, when you get married, all hell breaks loose from an institutional point of view.

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're entitled to spousal benefits and pregnancy leaves.

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Even if you're a male, you can get a pregnancy leave, and I don't know what theory they have.

165
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But in any case, there are all these things that go on when you get this institutional status.

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So you have the status whereby you are married.

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's an institutional fact, and that gives you a set of status functions.

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You have certain rights, duties, and obligations.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, another remarkable feature of this apparatus, this X counts as Y and C,

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
is it interlocks with other status functions.

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I don't just have money, but I have money in my bank account at the Bank of America

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California.

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's put there by my employers, the regents of the university,

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and I use it to pay my state and federal income tax, my credit card debts, and a whole lot of other things.

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now notice, just about every noun I use there, with a possible exception of Telegraph Avenue,

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
named a status function. It named some institutional thing, the Bank of America,

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
my employers, the University of California.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So one institution functions only by locking into a whole lot of other institutions.

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So it looks like a pretty good beginning to a theory.

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We're able to account for status functions by saying they arise as a result of application of constitutive rules,

181
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and the constitutive rules look more powerful than they look on the surface,

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
because they keep going up indefinitely, you can keep creating new institutional facts,

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and they interlock with each other.

184
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Nice theory, but philosophers will give you some counter examples,

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and I want to tell you what's wrong with it, and then I'm going to improve on it.

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, so how are we doing? I hope I'm not going too fast,

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
because my natural temptation is I want to get to the part that most interests me,

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but in any case, I think everybody looks like they're following me so far.

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
All right, here are some interesting problems with this.

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Some I thought of myself, but some my friendly colleagues in philosophy thought of,

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
they're called counter examples.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Here's a difficulty I thought of myself.

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Often you don't need a rule to create an institutional fact.

194
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
A bunch of kids can just decide that somebody's going to be the captain of the softball team.

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They don't have to have a constitution to appeal to that,

196
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they just do it, they just haul off and count this guy as the captain of the softball team.

197
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But furthermore, and this is more troublesome,

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
sometimes you don't even need an X term.

199
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You can create an institutional fact out of thin air.

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And my favorite example was always money, and I like to haul out a $20 bill and show it off.

201
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But the fact is, most money has no physical existence at all.

202
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There is no X that counts as a $20 bill in my bank account.

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You see, I'm very naive, and I think if I give these guys the money, and it's my bank account,

204
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
there ought to be a drawer with my name on it where they keep my money,

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and I want to go and see my money in the bank.

206
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, that's not how it works.

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's very disconcerting.

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Your money has no physical existence at all.

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There are magnetic traces on computer disks in the bowels of the bank,

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
but those magnetic traces haven't got any money glued to them.

211
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
They are representations of money.

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Now, here's a remarkable fact.

213
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In the case of money, which after all is very powerful,

214
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
you don't need any actual object to bear the status function.

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Just the representation will do.

216
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And we could buy and sell just by exchanging representations,

217
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and that's what we're moving toward with a debit card.

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
With a debit card, you don't actually have any cash,

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
any currency that backs up the exchange.

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You just exchange the numerical value in your account

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
for a numerical value in somebody else's account.

222
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is mind-boggling for philosophers.

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
As I told you last time, to be a philosopher,

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you've got to allow yourself to be astounded

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
by what any sane person takes for granted.

226
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Now, I am astounded by this fact about money,

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that there is no actual currency.

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Here's an even more astounding fact,

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and that is, in their ingenuity,

230
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
humans have invented whole institutions

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that do not require any physical reality at all.

232
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And the most famous example is the Limited Liability Corporation.

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now, there's a wonderful research assistant I have called Google.

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And if I look up on Google,

235
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the law for creating corporations in the state of California,

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
it just says, you create a corporation

237
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
by saying you're creating a corporation.

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's all I have to do.

239
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
As it says, you file articles of incorporation.

240
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What's going on in these cases?

241
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
How can there be a powerful institution,

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
corporations that have no physical existence at all?

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
See, that corporation may have a building,

244
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which is its office, but that's not the corporation.

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's just the building.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The actual corporation is purely abstract.

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So what's going on?

248
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay, now I want to start the second part of the lecture

249
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
where I'm going to try to show how to assimilate this account

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
that I gave you into a much more general account.

251
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And to do that, I need to tell you a little bit about how language works

252
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because my essential message is going to be

253
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that human civilization is created by a certain very specific type of speech act,

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
by a very specific type of language act.

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And we're not all that smart that we can do new and original things every time.

256
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We apply the same thing over and over again.

257
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's what I'm going to, that's the bottom line of my discussion,

258
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but I want to have to work up to that.

259
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay, so how are we doing?

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going to take a drink of water and catch my breath

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and go into the next part.

262
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Now, human beings have another remarkable trait, language.

263
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Now, we're familiar with the idea that there are signaling systems among animals

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and some of them are rich enough, I think, to be called a language.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think the B language probably qualifies as a language.

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
There's not going to be any proofs among the B's,

267
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but it's clearly a signaling system that represents information in a complex fashion.

268
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And one of the things I like about it, it's clear that it's not just a matter of stimulus and response.

269
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
My favorite experiment was this one.

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They took a boatload of flowers and carted it out in the middle of a lake.

271
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And then the B went out in the middle of the lake, found this boatload of flowers,

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and she went back to the hive and told all her sisters,

273
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
they're all females in the society, told her sisters,

274
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
there are all these great flowers out there in the middle of the lake.

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They didn't show any interest at all.

276
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They just didn't believe it that there were all these flowers to be found in the middle of the lake.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now, I think that's very human of them. I like that.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, so now I don't know what you're going to do with a B language,

279
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but I know there are things you can do with human language that you cannot do with any others,

280
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and I want to tell you about how that works.

281
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Human speech acts typically have this kind of structure.

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You have a certain force, what Austin called illocutionary force, and a propositional content.

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I can predict that you will leave the room.

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I can order that you will leave the room.

285
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can ask whether you will leave the room.

286
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In each case, the same proposition as a different kind of speech act,

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
a different kind of what Austin called illocutionary acts.

288
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Now, if you look at that, you wonder how many of those kinds of things are there.

289
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And one of the ways of distinguishing among them is distinguish ways they relate to reality.

290
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So the philosopher's favorite, the statement, is supposed to be true or false.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And it's true whether or not, if the statement up here matches the reality down here,

292
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and I think in simple metaphors, think of that as having a fit where the word is supposed to fit the world.

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's the word to world direction of fit.

294
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And the simplest mark for whether a speech act has that direction of fit

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
is can you literally say that it's true or false?

296
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
These are true or false.

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But of course, not all speech acts are like that.

298
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Sometimes you give somebody an order, or you make a promise,

299
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and there you're supposed to change reality if it's a promise,

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
or the person given the order is supposed to change reality to match the content of the speech act

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
is supposed to change the world to match the words.

302
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So this kind over here has the world to word direction of fit.

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The world is supposed to change to match the world,

304
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and you don't call those true or false.

305
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The order is said to be obeyed or disobeyed.

306
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The promise is said to be kept or broken.

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So you've got these two basic ways that language has of relating to reality.

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You represent how things are, that's the word to world true false direction of fit,

309
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
or you try to change reality so it matches how things are in the representation,

310
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and that's orders and promises.

311
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Now sometimes you get cases where the fit is taken for granted,

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
for when I apologize for stepping on your foot,

313
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm not trying to get your foot stepped on, and I'm not claiming that I stepped on it,

314
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm just expressing my regret.

315
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So there we just take the fit for granted.

316
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So we've got different classes of speech acts, though corresponding to these.

317
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We have an assertive class, the aim of which is to tell us how things are in reality,

318
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and that includes statements and descriptions, all the philosophers' favorites are in these assertives.

319
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Then you have the directive class, and that includes orders and commands.

320
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
These have this direction of fit, the directives have this direction of fit.

321
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Directives are orders and commands as well as suggestions and requirements.

322
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay, but now there's another class where you commit yourself to doing something,

323
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and those I call commissives, the commissive class, and the philosophers' favorite is the promise,

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
where you promise, vow, threat, pledge, and thus create reasons for doing something.

325
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going through this fast, but I want you to get the basic idea.

326
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Language has different ways of relating to reality,

327
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and the two favorite ways are this way where you try to say how things are in the world,

328
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and this way, which breaks into two kinds, hearer-based, the directive and speaker-based, the commissive,

329
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
the directive you're trying to get somebody to do something,

330
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and the commissive you're committing yourself to doing something.

331
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Now there is this weird class, the expressives, where you apologize, thank, congratulate,

332
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and those I just call expressives, where the aim is not to fit reality, but to express an attitude.

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But now, here is the amazing thing.

334
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
There is an amazing group of speech acts that I call declarations,

335
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and those are the cases where you make something in a case by just saying that it's the case.

336
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The chairman can adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,

337
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and you can fire an employee just by saying you're fired,

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
or you can hire somebody just by saying you're hired,

339
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
or you can pronounce a couple husband and wife if you're duly authorized by saying I pronounce you husband and wife.

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Now what's going on in these cases?

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What I'm going on, what is going on, I'm going to put very simply by saying,

342
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in these cases, you get a double direction of fit.

343
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You get a world to word direction of fit when you say the meeting is adjourned,

344
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because the world changes, it's now adjourned, the meeting is now adjourned.

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But the way it became adjourned is you represented it as being adjourned.

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That is to say, you achieved the world to word direction of fit by way of the word to world direction of fit.

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You performed not two speech acts, you didn't make a statement that the meeting is adjourned,

348
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and then given order that it be adjourned, you made one speech act that included both.

349
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's a stunning fact.

350
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Now how do those work?

351
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Well, the favorite examples are Austin's examples of performatives,

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
where you make an order by saying I already had to leave the room,

353
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you make a promise by saying I promise to come and see you,

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
you adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you give and bequeath your watch to your nephew by saying I give and bequeath my watch to my nephew.

356
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In all of those cases, you have a verb or verb phrase such as promise or order or adjourn.

357
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But you don't always need a special sentence to do that.

358
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You can do it a special kind of sentence.

359
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You can do it with any sentence provided it's understood in the right way.

360
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And again, my favorite example is in my wallet.

361
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And again, it's another case of being astounded by the obvious.

362
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
There are stunning philosophical claims made on this sheet of paper.

363
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It says, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.

364
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Now, we're all epistemologists and our natural inclination is to say,

365
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
how the hell do they know?

366
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Has there been a study?

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Has there been a survey?

368
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They say, arrogantly, it's legal tender for all debts, public and private.

369
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What's the evidence that it's legal tender?

370
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And the answer, of course, is they don't discover that it's legal tender.

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They make it legal tender by declaring it to be legal tender.

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's a declaration.

373
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So the declaration there, this note is legal tender, looks like an ordinary statement of fact.

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But it's not.

375
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It isn't that they did a serious survey and discovered, yep, really is legal tender.

376
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No, they made it legal tender by declaration.

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Now, this is a remarkable fact that human beings have the capacity to create a reality simply by declaring it to exist.

378
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Performatives to repeat are the favorite example, but it needn't be a performative verb.

379
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There needn't be a special verb that you use.

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I hear by adjourn the meeting, or I hear by order you to leave the room.

381
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You can just make a statement, and if it's accepted as generally creating the reality that it describes,

382
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
then you have successfully performed a declaration.

383
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Now I want to make the strongest claim of the whole lecture, and that's this.

384
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
All of human institutional reality, money, property, government, marriage, universities, cocktail parties, summer vacations,

385
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and all the rest of it, that is created by, I have to put this carefully,

386
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
representations that have the logical form of the Speech Act of Declaration.

387
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It needn't be explicit.

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You don't have to come out and say explicitly, you're the boss.

389
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Or we hereby make you the boss.

390
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That would be an explicit declaration.

391
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But you can make somebody the boss just by treating her as the boss, just by always referring to her as the boss.

392
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
By representing her as being the boss, you can make it the case that she is the boss.

393
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So what happens in all of these phenomena is that you create an institutional fact

394
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
by representing that institutional fact as existing, and that has the logical form of the declaration.

395
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So the shorthand is simply to say, all of human institutional reality,

396
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and that's all of what is distinctive about human societies, how we differ from other animal societies,

397
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
is created by repeated applications of the same type of Speech Act, the declaration.

398
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Now just to have a name for those, I want to tie that into what I said earlier about how we have the capacity

399
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
to assign functions through collective intentionality, and some of these functions are status functions.

400
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And the thesis that I'm now advancing is this.

401
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
All status functions are created by declaration.

402
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
They're all created by the same type of Speech Act.

403
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I have to qualify that and say by representations that have the logical form of the declaration,

404
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
because you needn't do it explicitly.

405
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You can do it just by accepting something or recognizing it, but there has to be a representation

406
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that enables you to do that, to create the institutional fact.

407
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay, but now you've got a whole lot of interesting questions.

408
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If I'm right so far that this is the distinctive feature of human civilization, it looks like

409
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we get an interesting set of equations, and the equations come out as this.

410
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Status functions, where you have a function that is performed in virtue of the collective acceptance of a status,

411
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
status functions are co-extensive with institutional facts.

412
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Institutional facts are created for the purpose of creating these status functions.

413
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What's the point? Why do we create all these status functions?

414
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why do we make somebody chairman of the department, pronounce somebody husband and wife,

415
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
make somebody president of the United States, create money and private property and government and marriage?

416
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And the answer is all of those are status functions.

417
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes, but what's the function? What's the point of the function?

418
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And the answer to that is we do it for power.

419
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
All of those create power structures.

420
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
All institutional reality is a matter of creating power structures.

421
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So if you have a $5 bill, you have a power that you don't have if you don't have that money.

422
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If you're a chairman of the philosophy department, you have power that you don't have if you're not chairman.

423
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
A lot of the powers are negative powers.

424
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
As a professor in Berkeley, I have a positive power to get a parking permit.

425
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That won't give me a parking space, but at least I have a permit.

426
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It gives me a right to look for a parking space.

427
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But I also have negative powers.

428
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm under an obligation to show up and teach my students on such and such a day.

429
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So status functions are institutional facts.

430
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
These institutional facts, without exception, create powers,

431
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
but the powers are of a very peculiar kind.

432
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
They're what I call deontic powers.

433
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I call on that because the names of these types of powers

434
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:21,000
would include rights, duties, obligations, authorizations, permissions, requirements, and others in that family.

435
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
This again is a remarkable fact about human beings.

436
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:36,000
As far as I know, a pack of dogs does not create a system of obligations and rights and duties within the pack.

437
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They may create a hierarchy where there's an alpha male and an alpha female,

438
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but they do not create deontic powers with institutional facts and status functions.

439
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The reason that it's such a big deal, that status functions create our institutional facts,

440
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
they're created by this constitutive operation, they're all created by status function declarations.

441
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And the reason that's such a big deal is that these,

442
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I put in here status function declarations because the speech acts in question

443
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that create the status functions have the logical form of the declarations,

444
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and so I call them status function declarations.

445
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And they create, in creating institutional reality, they create a system of deontic powers,

446
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and deontic powers are remarkable in this respect.

447
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They lock into human rationality.

448
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They lock into human rationality in such a way that they give you reasons for acting

449
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that are independent of your inclinations.

450
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So if you recognize an obligation as a binding obligation,

451
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
you recognize that you have a desire independent reason for acting on that obligation.

452
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll give you a real-life example.

453
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
A nice guy invited me to go to Bloomington, Indiana, and give some lectures.

454
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It seemed like a great idea, many months away.

455
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But then a day comes when you got to get up early in the morning

456
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and make your way to San Francisco Airport, and then it's just, well, you know what it's like.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You got to stand in line, you got to take your shoes off,

458
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you got to eat airplane food, and you don't even get much of that anymore.

459
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And then, worst of all, you got to try to put your elbow where some other guy's trying to put his elbow, and so on.

460
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So nobody does it for fun.

461
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
On the other hand, there was no question.

462
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I had made a promise.

463
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I had created an institutional fact, and my promising, that institutional fact,

464
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
had created a reason for acting that was independent of my inclination.

465
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I had a reason for coming, and here I am.

466
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I gave this example once in Chicago to a famous seminar

467
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
occupied by a very conservative economist, to put it charitably.

468
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And they don't think anybody ever did anything for a desire-independent reason.

469
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And they said, you just came to Chicago because you were worried about what we would think of you

470
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
if you didn't come to Chicago.

471
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And I didn't have the heart to tell them, I don't give a damn what you guys think of me.

472
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I didn't have the heart to tell them that.

473
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Anyway, I made it there.

474
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I got out of there alive.

475
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Anyway, so here is the thesis that I am advancing.

476
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We live in a sea of status functions.

477
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The marvelous thing is they're almost totally invisible because you take them for granted.

478
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The clothes on my back are my private property.

479
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I am a citizen of the United States, a possessor of a valid California driver's license,

480
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the owe of money on my various credit cards, and so on.

481
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The list is huge.

482
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Many status functions of the kind that I described to you are codified.

483
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's easy to make a law about these, and laws naturally tend to proliferate.

484
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Why?

485
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because the status function only exists if it's represented as existing,

486
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and if you've got the representation, then it's relatively easy to codify the representation.

487
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There are some status functions that are not codified and would suffer if they were codified.

488
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Think of cocktail parties, love affairs, and friendship.

489
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Now all of those are status functions.

490
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The test is, is there a set of obligations and other deontic powers

491
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that go with inviting people to a cocktail party or having other obligations of friendship

492
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
or obligations of a love affair?

493
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And the answer seems to me in every case, yes.

494
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But you don't want to try to codify it because partly you're inventing it as you go along.

495
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You're inventing the structure of the institutional effect.

496
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
If it's a friendship or a love affair, and if it gets codified, you get serious,

497
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
then it becomes much more flexible.

498
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Now you will suffer from problems when you go to other countries

499
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
where they have maybe a different conception of a love affair,

500
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
a different conception of friendship, and you can get in a lot of trouble.

501
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I won't even go through into the details about that, about the different conceptions.

502
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, but now another result that comes out of this, out of this discussion,

503
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is that language, unlike my earlier view, is not just one system of status functions,

504
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
among others, it's the basic human institution in this sense.

505
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
All other human institutions that I mentioned, like a government and private property and universities,

506
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
all of them presuppose language.

507
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You can have a society that has a language but doesn't have money or private property or government,

508
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
but you can't have a converse.

509
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
If an anthropologist comes back from the Amazon Basin and says her tribe has language

510
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
but they don't have private property and they don't have a government, that makes sense.

511
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But if she comes back and says they have private property, government, marriage, and money,

512
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but they do not have a language, we know that couldn't be right,

513
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because language is the fundamental human institution in that all others presuppose language.

514
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But then now there's an interesting asymmetry.

515
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I originally got this idea of the constitutive rule X counts as Y,

516
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
as a way of describing the operation of language, the performance of the speech act.

517
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Uttering the sentence, snow is white, in English counts as making the statement that snow is white.

518
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But now it turns out there's a big asymmetry between the operation of the constitutive rules with language

519
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and their operation with, so to speak, non-linguistic institutional facts like money and private property.

520
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The asymmetry is this.

521
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
In the case of the status functions and the deonic powers that are non-linguistic,

522
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
for example, when we make somebody president of the United States,

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
we use language to create power that goes beyond the power of language.

524
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So we use language to say, by the authority vested in my, I hereby pronounce you president of the United States,

525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the guy then has powers that go beyond the powers of language,

526
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but when we just use a sentence to make a statement, there are no powers that go beyond the powers of language.

527
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So the way, as a speaker of English, my knowledge of English enables me to have the power to make the statement that snow is white

528
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
by uttering the sentence, snow is white.

529
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's a case where the semantics is all the power there is.

530
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The powers are just the semantic powers.

531
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But when you make somebody chairman of the philosophy department,

532
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
or you admit them to graduate school, or you award somebody a prize,

533
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
or you pronounce somebody husband and wife, or you borrow money from the bank,

534
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or you buy a house in Bloomington,

535
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
all of those are cases where you create institutional facts

536
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and thus create deontic powers, and you use language to do that.

537
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But the powers that you create go beyond semantic powers.

538
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So all of Barack Obama's powers derive from semantics.

539
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
He has to be created as president and treated as president, represented as president,

540
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
but the powers go beyond semantics.

541
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The power to command American troops in battle goes far beyond the semantics,

542
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
even though the initial origin of the power is on the basis of the semantics.

543
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The semantics creates powers that are not semantic.

544
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So it turns out that language is not only the fundamental human social institution,

545
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
the one that all others derive from, all others depend on,

546
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
but it's fundamentally different in its operation,

547
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
because just as far as the meanings of the sentences are concerned,

548
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
all you have when you know the language is the power to perform speech acts with those sentences.

549
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But when you're locked into a system of institutional facts and status functions and deontic powers,

550
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
when you're buying and selling stocks on the stock market,

551
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
or you're passing legislation in Congress, or you're adjudicating cases,

552
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
all of those cases involve the use of language,

553
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
but they use language to create powers that go beyond language.

554
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay, how am I doing for time?

555
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, maybe I'll try and summarize, so we'll have plenty of time for discussion.

556
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Now, there are a few things I want to say of a theoretical kind before I throw it open for discussion.

557
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
One is, it seems to me, if you think along these lines, as I'm suggesting,

558
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
you get a different conception of many traditional questions in the social science,

559
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
in the social sciences, and in political philosophy.

560
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If you look at our tradition in political and social theory,

561
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
there is an endemic flaw that goes back to the Greeks,

562
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and that is, roughly speaking, they had an impoverished theory of language.

563
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They took language for granted.

564
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Social contract theorists are the worst because they assume

565
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that we're running around the woods speaking a language,

566
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and then some genius says, let's make a social contract,

567
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and then you get together and have a society.

568
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
But the implication of what I'm saying is, if you've got a language,

569
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
you've already got an implicit social contract

570
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
because you have the possibility of creating status functions.

571
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Now, how do we get away with it?

572
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You see, what's amazing is we get away with it.

573
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And the short answer to that is, you get away with it if people accept it.

574
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And the most amazing creation of a status function by declaration

575
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
were by guys who wrote as if they had read my book.

576
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They used the very terminology.

577
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They call it the Declaration of Independence.

578
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Now, there's nothing in their status functions

579
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
prior to that moment that gives them the power to do this.

580
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
These are, let us not forget, British subjects.

581
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
They're not citizens of anything.

582
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They're subjects of King George III,

583
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
where in a British crown colony, Philadelphia, it's a crown colony.

584
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's got a status function.

585
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's entirely under the government of the royal family in London,

586
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and they just got together and performed a collective speech act.

587
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They said we declare ourselves to be an independent nation.

588
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now, they got away with it.

589
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
How did they get away with it?

590
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Well, the short answer is they got people to accept it.

591
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And we're here because people accepted and we accepted.

592
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The long answer is they had to fight a war to get the acceptance.

593
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And it wasn't really until Cornwallis was defeated at Yorktown

594
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
that they were free and clear.

595
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And by the way, something Americans tend to forget,

596
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
we couldn't have won the war without the help of the French.

597
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The French were essential in the creation of our country.

598
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So remember that when the French complained about us

599
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and we complained about them, which is a common domestic conversation.

600
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So here are these guys who created an institutional reality of enormous power.

601
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
However, it doesn't always work.

602
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A bunch of people, I guess, in Richmond, tried to do the same stunt.

603
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You know, they had a good model.

604
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
They created the Confederate States of America and it didn't work.

605
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
They did not, again, it took a war to settle the issue, but the issue was settled.

606
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But the remarkable thing is that your life is entirely structured

607
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
within a series of complex families of status functions.

608
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
They're all created by the same simple, logical, linguistic operation

609
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
applied over and over, the status function declaration.

610
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
See, we're not smart enough to do something new and original every time.

611
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We have this device for creating status functions.

612
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's the status function declaration and we apply it over and over.

613
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Now, I think, as I said, a lot of traditional issues are clarified

614
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
if you adopt the approach that's implicit in what I've been saying.

615
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Let me conclude with one thought.

616
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
There are huge debates that go on in this country and internationally

617
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
about human rights, about universal human rights.

618
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And the question is, what is the ontology of the human rights?

619
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And there are a class of philosophers who are very skeptical,

620
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
like Jeremy Bentham and Alistair McIntyre.

621
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They think talk of human rights is nonsense.

622
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
What are you talking about?

623
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But I think, in fact, that the talk can be made legitimate

624
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
once you recognize what's actually going on.

625
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
You don't have human rights the way you have thumbs.

626
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The human right is a status function.

627
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What's different about human rights and other rights

628
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
is that other rights typically arise within a preexisting institution.

629
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
As a citizen, I have certain rights.

630
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
As a husband, I have certain rights.

631
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
As a professor, I have certain rights.

632
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But somebody in the 18th century, I don't know who it was.

633
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Maybe it was 17th century, but it's in the Enlightenment.

634
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Somebody or some group of people got an idea of genius.

635
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Just being a human being is a why status function.

636
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
They didn't have the right terminology for saying that.

637
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But that's what they were trying to say.

638
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Just being a human being is a why status function.

639
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And as such, it carries deontic powers.

640
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It carries universal human rights.

641
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And I think that can be made intellectually legitimate

642
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
once you recognize that human rights are universal status functions

643
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
created and maintained by a certain type of speech act.

644
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And that speech act is the status function declaration.

645
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Now, another claim I haven't really had time to develop

646
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
is that the institutional facts are not only created

647
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
in their initial form by the status function declaration,

648
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
but that's how they maintain over a period of time.

649
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You maintain the system in power by constantly representing it

650
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
as the power structure that it is.

651
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So one of the ways to see this is to see the way

652
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
that revolutionary movements want to change the vocabulary.

653
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
At the time of the Russian Revolution,

654
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the revolutionaries were very anxious

655
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
that people not use the traditional forms of address

656
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
of traditional Russia.

657
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
They wanted everybody to be called comrade.

658
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Why?

659
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because that marked an equality of status function

660
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
which calling somebody a lord or a duke or whatever

661
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
would not accept.

662
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So they were insistent on changing the vocabulary.

663
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And more recently, the feminists in the early days of feminism

664
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
were anxious that we not use the traditional vocabulary

665
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
of ladies and gentlemen,

666
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
because that marked status functions that they were anxious to overcome.

667
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Now, I don't know how these things develop.

668
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's quite interesting.

669
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
If you, in somebody in Moscow today,

670
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think if you address them as comrade, it'll be a joke.

671
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I mean, because the system that was created that

672
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
has become undermined.

673
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But even this is going on as we speak.

674
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
If you look at older American laws,

675
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
the word spinster occurs commonly.

676
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Now, I once asked my class,

677
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
how many of you are spinsters?

678
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Please raise your hand.

679
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
One middle-aged woman had a courage to raise her hand.

680
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I wanted to give her an A on the spot.

681
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Because this is a term that is becoming obsolete.

682
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It did mark a status function.

683
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And I think bachelor may be becoming obsolete

684
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
with a change in what, with hesitation,

685
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I call it marital practices.

686
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But with the relation of the sexes,

687
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
we may be going for all sorts of new vocabularies.

688
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But the vocabulary is crucial,

689
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
because the vocabulary is the articulation

690
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
of the assignment of a status function.

691
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So I think that I have only really begun a subject.

692
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But what I want to suggest, and I'll conclude with this,

693
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
is that when I use this somewhat provocative title,

694
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
the logical structure of human civilization.

695
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Unfortunately, most people think,

696
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean logical as opposed to illogical.

697
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's not the point.

698
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The point is that it has a propositional structure.

699
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
The propositional structure is the assignment

700
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
of a status function according to the Speech Act

701
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
of Declaration that makes something the case

702
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
by representing it as being the case.

703
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And wherever you have propositional structures,

704
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
you have logical relations.

705
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That's why I call it the logical structure

706
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
of human civilization.

707
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But this, I think, is how we differ from other social animals.

708
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There are lots of social animals.

709
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Lots of them have power structures and hierarchies

710
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
with their alpha males and alpha females.

711
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But they do not have this remarkably rich,

712
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
stable system of status functions that we have.

713
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I visited Mike Tomasello at his primate lab in Leipzig.

714
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And he's got all these primates

715
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
that are busy fighting it out every day.

716
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Who's going to be the alpha male today?

717
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And the alpha male has to find allies,

718
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
among other males, to fight off other alpha males.

719
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Now, that's not how it works in the White House.

720
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Barack Obama does not get up and think,

721
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
today I got to beat everybody in arm wrestling

722
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
or whatever it might be.

723
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No, he's got an accepted system of status functions

724
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and that persists through time.

725
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And this is a feature both of good institutions

726
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and bad institutions.

727
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I'm convinced that it is that key

728
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
to understanding the ontology of human civilization.

729
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Thank you.

730
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Thank you.

731
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Thank you.

732
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Thank you.

733
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Thank you.

734
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Thank you.

735
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Thank you.

736
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Thank you.

737
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Thank you.

738
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Thank you.

739
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
John will take questions now.

740
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The microphones over here.

741
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
The end of the line up.

742
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Okay, Guy on the left.

743
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I have a question.

744
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Does that question be in one of those categories

745
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
or questions?

746
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Questions.

747
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I didn't give you an electron speech ask.

748
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Questions are species of directive.

749
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Every question is a request.

750
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's a request for an answer.

751
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And indeed, there's a remarkable thing about questions

752
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
in English that the form of the question

753
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
determines the form of the answer.

754
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So if I answer, do you have any bananas

755
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and you say yes, that doesn't mean

756
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
yes, it's going to rain tomorrow.

757
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It means yes, we have bananas.

758
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And the one exception to this

759
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
is the peculiar English modal auxiliary verb.

760
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So if I ask you, shall I marry a Republican?

761
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The correct answer is not yes, you shall

762
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
or no, you shall not,

763
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
but rather yes, do or no, don't.

764
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It asks for advice.

765
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But that modal auxiliaries are hard to think about anyway.

766
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But go ahead.

767
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Questions are directives. Yes.

768
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That sort of was my question.

769
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Okay.

770
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah.

771
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Okay.

772
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
All right.

773
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, I was kind of thinking in the sense

774
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
of anything from satisfying curiosity

775
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
to questioning authority, like,

776
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
who do you think you are?

777
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
What do you think you're doing?

778
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Okay.

779
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Now, I resist the temptation of electron questions.

780
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
They're a fascinating subject.

781
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And one interesting class are rhetorical questions.

782
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
When the guy in the Republican National Convention

783
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
says, do we want four more years

784
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
of incompetent government?

785
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
He doesn't want people to think about it.

786
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I don't know.

787
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Do we or don't we?

788
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I guess we do.

789
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
No, it's not the form of the question.

790
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So rhetorical questions are interesting

791
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
in that the rhetorical question makes a statement

792
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
by assuming that the answer to the question is known.

793
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's assumed the answer is known

794
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
consequently you use the rhetorical question

795
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
to make a statement.

796
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So questions are fascinating, a lot to be said.

797
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But in any case, the short answer is real honest

798
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and John questions like, how do I find my way to Bloomington?

799
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That is a directive where you're asking for information.

800
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yes.

801
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Oh, no.

802
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Let's go over here first and then we'll come back to you.

803
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah.

804
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I agree with most of what you say, but I want to draw.

805
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Watch out when somebody says that

806
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
because he's now going to tell us what he disagrees with.

807
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I want to draw attention to an important fact,

808
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
namely you, for example, have a California driving license.

809
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah.

810
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Now, suppose I were visiting California.

811
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I didn't bring my driver's license.

812
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You couldn't say, Roy, that's all right.

813
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Just take mine.

814
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah.

815
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
On the other hand, I have also a lunch coupon

816
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
for lunch tomorrow.

817
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah.

818
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I could give that coupon to somebody else.

819
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

820
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And that person could eat lunch instead of me.

821
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So it's important that the driver's license is unique to you.

822
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah.

823
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And when a policeman stops you,

824
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
he wants to know that it's John Sir who was speeding

825
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and not Kirk Ludwig.

826
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Whereas on the other hand, when it comes to lunch,

827
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
it doesn't matter who is eating the lunch

828
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
because they want to make sure that the number of coupons

829
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
equals the number of people who pay.

830
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yes.

831
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
No.

832
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So there are some important properties

833
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
about these certificates of power.

834
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No, that's absolutely right.

835
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And I'm grateful for the contribution.

836
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I want to say a little bit more about it.

837
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Many status function attached to specific individuals,

838
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
named individuals.

839
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So you're named in the driver's license

840
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
or on the marriage license.

841
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You can't prove you're married by borrowing my marriage license.

842
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
OK.

843
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I mean, it is specific.

844
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The beauty of money is it's fungible.

845
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Anybody with the money can use it to buy something with.

846
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But all sorts of other things are not in that way exchangeable.

847
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Now, there's another topic.

848
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I didn't have a chance to go into it,

849
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
but I want to use this occasion to mention it.

850
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And that is that often we need indicators.

851
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You need status function indicators.

852
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So the policeman wears a uniform.

853
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And the actual license that I have is not the status function.

854
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's an indicator that I am able to drive.

855
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's a state, what I call a status function indicator.

856
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And these wedding rings, uniforms, driver's licenses,

857
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
all of these are status function indicators.

858
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And their primary function is epistemic.

859
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
They prove that I have the status that I claim to have.

860
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Now, they can acquire a kind of life of their own.

861
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So the driver's license in California

862
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
is used for all kinds of things that have nothing to do with driving.

863
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You can't buy a beer if you haven't got a driver's license

864
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
because you can't prove that you're over 21.

865
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And so sometimes the status indicators

866
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
will acquire a kind of separate life of their own.

867
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But the basic idea is that for many status functions,

868
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
you need to indicate that you have the status function

869
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
by some epistemic device.

870
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
When I first got to Berkeley,

871
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
you could tell who the professors were.

872
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They were the guys with ties on, ties and jackets.

873
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Then in the 60s, you could tell the professors

874
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
they were the ones with shoes on

875
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
because dressing habits had changed by then.

876
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So you get these.

877
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And part of the problem in my old university, Oxford,

878
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
is that when I was a student there,

879
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
you could identify who was a member of the university

880
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
by their clothing.

881
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They wore, well, the kind of stuff I got on, roughly speaking.

882
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
They had on worsted flannel slacks and usually tweed jackets.

883
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This wouldn't qualify.

884
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
But in any case, there was no question

885
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
about improper people wandering in the university.

886
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
They would be immediately identified by their style of dress.

887
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Now everybody wears blue jeans.

888
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
They imitate the Americans.

889
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So you can't do that anymore.

890
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And people have now started locking their doors.

891
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You have to lock your door in Oxford the way you didn't used to

892
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
because it was all members of the upper class

893
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and they were readily identifiable by their dress.

894
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Okay, did you finish?

895
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

896
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Thanks for the question.

897
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Okay, you're on.

898
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
In the beginning of your talk,

899
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
you talked about physical particles like protons and electrons.

900
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Yeah.

901
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But you haven't said a word about how you get from protons

902
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and electrons to human beings or to civilization.

903
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Okay, let me answer that question.

904
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Unfortunately, I only had two lectures to give here.

905
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
One was about consciousness.

906
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So let me give you the short answer.

907
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
To begin with, I'm not sure there are particles,

908
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
maybe points of mass energy or strings.

909
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But that's not what I'm paying the physicists to do,

910
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
to settle on the basic, the ontology of the basic entities.

911
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Okay, those are organized into systems.

912
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Now, on our little Earth, some of those particles are organized

913
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
into large molecules containing lots of carbon with hydrogen,

914
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
nitrogen and oxygen.

915
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And some of those systems of carbon-based molecules became alive.

916
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Now, to this day, we don't know when and how and where that happened,

917
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
but it did happen.

918
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's an amazing fact.

919
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And some of those living organic systems,

920
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
some of those living organic systems continued to evolve

921
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and they were now talking about millions of years,

922
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
continued to evolve until they became animals.

923
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And some animals evolved consciousness.

924
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And now, that's what I talked about last time,

925
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
is how the brain creates consciousness.

926
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And we still don't understand that.

927
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
We don't know how exactly the brain creates consciousness

928
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
or how exactly it functions in the brain,

929
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
but we know that it does.

930
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Now, this lecture was the next step,

931
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
where once you've got consciousness,

932
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
then you can get language.

933
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And I didn't discuss the structures of language.

934
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I just talked about some of the uses.

935
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And now, once you have language,

936
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
you have the possibility of creating society,

937
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
human society and human civilization.

938
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So the pattern goes from the basic physical reality

939
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
of physical particles to the beginnings of life

940
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
in carbon-based molecules,

941
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and then the development of life through evolution,

942
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and then the development of evolutionary mechanisms

943
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
through the development of animals and conscious animals,

944
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and then the development of language,

945
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and then us and then all the stuff we got.

946
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That's the picture.

947
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I should have spelled that out,

948
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
but that's how you get from protons to presidents.

949
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You get from having the basic system of the physical particles.

950
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Some of those become alive.

951
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
A stunning fact.

952
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And some of those living systems

953
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
evolve over long periods of evolutionary time,

954
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and then over that long period of time,

955
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you eventually reach folks like us.

956
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Now, we ought not to be arrogant about our special situation.

957
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
As I mentioned before,

958
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,000
we are a very small solar system in a big galaxy,

959
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy.

960
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't know how many of them can support life

961
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
or planets like as ours do.

962
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But our galaxy with its 100 billion stars,

963
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
it's one of 100 billion galaxies.

964
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So it seems to me,

965
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
unlikely that we're the only conscious beasts in the universe.

966
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I don't suppose that other beasts in the universe look like us.

967
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Why should they?

968
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I mean, we're freaks of a certain kind of evolution.

969
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And if they could see us,

970
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
no reason why they have the ability to see,

971
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
but if they could see us,

972
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
we probably look as freakish to them as they do to us.

973
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So we can't assume that we're the only possible reasonable way

974
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
for life to come about.

975
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But it's what we got.

976
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's what we have to live with.

977
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Now, that's the good news.

978
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
There are only 100 billion stars in our galaxy,

979
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and only 100 billion galaxies.

980
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I've been telling my students this for years.

981
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Here's the bad news.

982
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I only discovered this in my physics fan frequently.

983
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
The story I told you only covers 4% of the universe.

984
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, yeah?

985
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
What about the other 96%?

986
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I paid to hear about that.

987
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Well, the other 96% is dark matter and dark energy.

988
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And what's dark about it is epistemic darkness

989
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that damn physicists haven't figured it out.

990
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
They have pretty good reasons for believing in it.

991
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I mean, here's the thing they say that always drives me crazy.

992
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
The universe is expanding.

993
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
What's it expanding in?

994
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You know, if I say,

995
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
we've decided to expand the kitchen.

996
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
OK, well, then it's got to expand into the backyard.

997
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But if we say, oh, yeah, and by the way,

998
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
we're going to expand the kitchen and expand the universe.

999
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
What do I expand the universe in?

1000
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, there is an answer to that,

1001
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
but they've been misleading us.

1002
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And the answer is to say the universe is expanding

1003
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
is to say the galaxies are getting farther apart.

1004
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And they are.

1005
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
What's the force that's driving them farther apart?

1006
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Well, there's dark energy as well as dark matter.

1007
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So we're, I mean, we really are very ignorant of all

1008
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
some of the most fundamental facts about the nature of ourselves

1009
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
and the nature of the universe.

1010
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
We really don't know much about how the universe works.

1011
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And in a way worse yet, we don't know much about how we work.

1012
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
We don't know how our brain creates consciousness.

1013
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We don't know how life began.

1014
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We do know that it did begin and it did evolve.

1015
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And we have some conception of those mechanisms,

1016
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
but we're still ignorant of a whole lot of areas.

1017
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Well, as what makes philosophy fun is we got a lot to work on.

1018
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Okay, who's next?

1019
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I think you're, this guy's next.

1020
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Okay, you're on.

1021
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You've been talking about some of the implications

1022
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
of the performative for social power and even social change.

1023
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The subtitle of Jared Diamond's book, Collapse,

1024
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
is How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail.

1025
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Would you give us some hints about how we might avoid

1026
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
catastrophic collapse and whether, whether,

1027
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
exactly, whether, whether there might be any

1028
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
any performative incantation that would help in that task?

1029
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Well, that's why I love easy questions.

1030
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You know, I don't have a general theory of society

1031
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
or social collapse, so I really am the wrong guy

1032
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
to ask this question of.

1033
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
If I got a good characterization of social ontology,

1034
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the mode of existence, then I, you can go on from there,

1035
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
but I haven't gone on from there.

1036
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Well, what makes a good institution is a bad institution.

1037
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And there, it seems to me, you have to ask questions about,

1038
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
well, what constitutes human flourishing and what sorts

1039
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
of healthy societies will facilitate human flourishing?

1040
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And it seems to me, there are lots of them in the world today

1041
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that are not very healthy, but Americans love to criticize themselves.

1042
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I think we're pretty well off compared with, let's say,

1043
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
what's happening in Syria.

1044
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm sure there are lots of joys to be had in Syria,

1045
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
but right now I'd rather be in Indiana and a whole lot

1046
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
of other areas of the world that that's true.

1047
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So I don't have an answer to your question,

1048
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
but what I provide, I hope, is a framework for ontology

1049
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
for posing the questions.

1050
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Okay, you're on.

1051
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Okay, this one's a doozy, all right.

1052
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And it's been bothering me for a while.

1053
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
What the hell is an institution and what the hell is a society?

1054
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I mean, the institution is more important

1055
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
because you've been using the word a lot.

1056
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
An institution, what is that?

1057
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah, as I've told you, an institution is a system of constitutive rules.

1058
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Within those systems of constitutive rules,

1059
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
you create institutional facts.

1060
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
All institutional facts are created by the application

1061
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
of a same type of speech act or the same type of linguistic representation,

1062
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
a status function declaration.

1063
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Now, there are immediate objections to that

1064
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
because some of the things we think of as institutions

1065
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
are not institutional facts on my account.

1066
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So the Christian calendar is not an institution

1067
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
because being such and such a date doesn't carry a deontology.

1068
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The test is, does it carry a deontology?

1069
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Christmas Day is an institutional fact

1070
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
because I have obligations and rights on Christmas Day.

1071
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I am obligated to give my children presents

1072
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and I have a right to a day off.

1073
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It marks it as an institutional fact.

1074
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That's a status function.

1075
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So there are tests for status functions.

1076
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Does it carry a deontology?

1077
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But the short answer is institutions are systems of constitutive rules.

1078
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
They enable the creation of institutional facts

1079
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
by status function declarations.

1080
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Status function declarations without exception create deontic powers

1081
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and deontic powers are the glue that holds human civilization together

1082
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
because they give us reason for acting

1083
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
that are independent of our immediate inclinations.

1084
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's a summary of the lecture.

1085
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You brought this up towards the end concerning conflict

1086
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
and the degree to which declarations must be accepted on mass

1087
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
for them to have causative effect.

1088
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But then it seems that this propositional logical structure

1089
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
doesn't have very much prescriptive power.

1090
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Most of the things you can prove from this logical structure

1091
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
are actually descriptive.

1092
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I look at my set of axioms which are the result of having already fought wars

1093
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
and then I draw the facts from there.

1094
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So my predecessor on this side asked for could you avert society

1095
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
simply by describing society as an iterative process of declarations.

1096
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
But I have a more basic question.

1097
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Does this actually give you any prescriptive, proof-based power at all

1098
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
or do you throw it out there and then see who wins might make right style?

1099
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah.

1100
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Well, okay, that's a larger question than I'll really be able to answer

1101
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but I would say there are lots of institutions

1102
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that are so obviously useful to all of us

1103
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
that they really are not subject to challenge as institutions.

1104
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Most obvious is language.

1105
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
If you think that private property is a bad idea,

1106
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
okay, you can argue against private property.

1107
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But how would you argue against language?

1108
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You'd have to use language to argue against language

1109
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and I don't, I mean it's just pretty hard to see language being challenged

1110
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
as an institution.

1111
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Now some institutions are inherently evil.

1112
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Slavery seems to me, a slavery of human being seems to me inherently evil.

1113
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
But then that's something you can argue for.

1114
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That's something you can, within institutional structures,

1115
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
you can make that out.

1116
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
There are some, as I said, institutions that are so obviously beneficial to everybody

1117
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
that it's very hard to see how anybody could argue against them

1118
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and language is the most obvious case.

1119
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
But there are others.

1120
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
How about money?

1121
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Money is an institution.

1122
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Is it beneficial?

1123
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I think on balance it is.

1124
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It's famously the root of all evil,

1125
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but it's the root of an awful lot of good too.

1126
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I try to imagine what your life would be like

1127
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
if you had no possibility of buying and selling or being paid

1128
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
or being paid for your work or anything like that.

1129
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It's very hard to imagine how you would organize a decent life.

1130
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So there are lots of institutions that are very pervasive

1131
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
that are effectively harmless.

1132
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Now how about private property?

1133
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Well I think private property, again, benefits just about everybody.

1134
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
But we now have in the United States such a disproportionate

1135
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
concentration of private property, the famous 1%.

1136
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The wealth is so disproportionately concentrated

1137
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
that it seems to me very unhealthy.

1138
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
It's just not a healthy way to run a society

1139
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
to have so much power, so much deontic power

1140
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
in the hands of so few people.

1141
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
For one thing, it gives them a disproportionate amount of political power.

1142
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And these are real problems that we're going to have to face.

1143
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So I think if you want to ask about a given institution,

1144
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
is this institution a good one or a bad one,

1145
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
you have to tell me more about the institution

1146
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and what it does, how it functions in human life.

1147
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah.

1148
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'd like to follow up on a question that was asked on this side a little earlier

1149
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
when you were asked to spell out a little bit more about the way

1150
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
that you get from molecules to presidents and so forth.

1151
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And what I'm going to ask you, some people would object to the treatment

1152
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
of things like presidents and elections on the same ontological plane

1153
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
as molecules and particles.

1154
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I wonder if you could say a little bit more about the logic

1155
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
that allows from a materialist conception of the world

1156
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
is reducible to material, how things emerge from that

1157
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and can exist in any way on a different level.

1158
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
No, that's a very good question.

1159
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
One of the things I hope is implicit in what I've said

1160
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
is that there are additional distinctions between the material

1161
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and the mental or the material and the ideal.

1162
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I think those are all obsolete.

1163
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I mean, we live in one world.

1164
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's basic structure is that of physical particles.

1165
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Among the physical features of the world is consciousness,

1166
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
but I mean real honest to John consciousness,

1167
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
with all its subjectivity touchy-feely features,

1168
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and then organized systems of consciousness through collective intentionality

1169
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
to create human civilization.

1170
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's the story about how you get from the protons to the presidents.

1171
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Of course, there are several steps in that story

1172
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
we just don't understand.

1173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
We don't understand how life got started.

1174
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It did.

1175
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
We don't understand how consciousness got started.

1176
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And we really don't understand how human languages took off,

1177
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and we may never really understand that because there's no fossil evidence.

1178
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We need to look at the fossils and see whether or not these guys had a subject verb language

1179
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
or a language where the verb came first.

1180
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
You can't look at that.

1181
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Look at the skull and discover that.

1182
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So we may never have a full understanding of how these things developed,

1183
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
but they did develop.

1184
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,000
We did evolve from a solar system at least in which there were no living beings.

1185
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
We evolved into us, and we did evolve culturally

1186
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
into something that's far more complicated

1187
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and far more interesting, I think, than a hunter-gatherer existence

1188
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
where no longer just running around the woods

1189
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
trying to find enough food to get through the rest of the day.

1190
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Any other questions?

1191
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I've answered every question.

1192
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yeah.

1193
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Thank you.
