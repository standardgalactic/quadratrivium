0	8000	All right, the question that I'm going to talk about is, I think, the largest question in contemporary philosophy today.
8000	12000	And in a way, it's the largest question in intellectual life.
12000	21000	And the question is, how do we give an account of ourselves that is consistent with what we know about how the world is anyhow?
21000	25000	You see, the central fact about knowledge is it grows.
25000	29000	And we know a lot more than we did 100 or 300 years ago.
29000	33000	And we have a pretty good idea about the basic structure of the universe.
33000	37000	Roughly speaking, it's a matter of physical particles in fields of force.
37000	41000	Particles, probably the wrong word, maybe they're strings or points of mass energy.
41000	44000	But anyway, I leave that, I'm paying the physicist to sort that out.
44000	45000	Okay.
45000	50000	But now, if the, that's how what the universe consists in, is physical particles.
50000	54000	Those physical particles are mindless and meaningless.
54000	66000	And yet we think that we have lives that are full of consciousness, rationality, intelligence, language, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and all sorts of other things.
66000	77000	Now, how do we reconcile the basic physical structure of the universe with our conception of ourselves as conscious, rational, free agents?
77000	80000	Now, maybe we won't succeed in reconciling it.
80000	83000	Maybe we'll have to give up on certain things like free will.
83000	93000	But at any rate, we should start out assuming that our self-conception is more or less accurate and that what we've learned from the natural sciences is accurate.
93000	95000	How do we reconcile the two?
95000	97000	And it's not enough that they should be consistent.
97000	104000	You've got to show how the human reality is a natural outcome of the more basic reality.
104000	108000	You've got to show how, once you've got protons, you're going to get presidents.
108000	110000	And once you've got electrons, you're going to get elections.
110000	114000	The one has to be a natural consequence of the other.
114000	116000	Okay.
116000	121000	Now, last time I talked about one aspect of that problem and that was consciousness.
121000	127000	And I think that the big mistake in our history is one I pointed out last time.
127000	131000	And that is the effort to deny that we live in one world.
131000	134000	The effort to say, well, really there are two worlds that we live in.
134000	138000	A physical world as described by science and a spiritual world.
138000	140000	And I think that is a deep mistake.
140000	141000	I'm going to resist that.
141000	151000	I'm going to say we live in one world and I now have to show you how the things that we think are distinctive of human civilization are part of that one world.
151000	156000	And they're a natural consequence of the more basic reality.
156000	164000	So I'm going to be talking about what you could call, to use a fancy jargon, social ontology.
164000	177000	The mode of existence of social phenomena as money and property and government and marriage and universities and income tax deductions and so on.
177000	181000	There's a huge range of the social ontology.
181000	183000	Now philosophers like paradoxes.
183000	185000	Now I'm going to start with a paradox.
185000	193000	All of this human reality is created by human consciousness by created by subjective consciousness.
193000	196000	And yet it's an objective fact.
196000	203000	It's an objective fact that I'm a citizen in the United States at the piece of paper in my wallet is a $20 bill and so on.
203000	209000	How can there be an objective reality created by human subjectivity?
209000	212000	Now those of you who came Tuesday know the answer to that.
212000	220000	The ontological subjectivity, the domain, does not prevent us from having an epistemically objective account of that domain.
220000	225000	It's true, human consciousness has to create institutional reality.
225000	230000	But once created, we can then state objective facts about it.
230000	234000	It's an objective fact that I'm a professor in Berkeley, a citizen in the United States.
235000	241000	That I owe a lot of credit card debts and all this kind of nonsense that we all live with.
241000	244000	All right, now how does it actually work?
244000	249000	What is the nature of the existence of this reality?
249000	254000	And how do the, here we are, you see I like to think of our history.
254000	262000	We are, as far as we can tell, Darwinian natural selection has suited us just fine
262000	265000	for a hunter-gatherer existence.
265000	271000	And we apparently haven't had much change in our gene pool in the past 30,000 years.
271000	278000	But we've had an enormous difference in the mode of existence of human life in those 30,000 years.
278000	283000	And I want to talk about what the structure of that is.
283000	288000	And I'm going to begin by contrasting us with other animals.
288000	295000	It's a good idea and a good beginning point to think that we are continuous with other animals.
295000	303000	We know enough about biology to see the commonality between us and other animals, especially us and the primates.
303000	310000	All the same, with all the commonality, there is a whole range of terrific differences
310000	314000	between us and any other animals known to me.
314000	322000	My dog, my favorite example here, is very intelligent, but he's not worried about what he's going to do for Christmas vacation
322000	326000	or how he's going to handle the income tax this year.
326000	328000	He just does not have that kind of worry.
328000	330000	Now, what's the matter with him?
330000	333000	Is he being irresponsible?
333000	340000	Well, no, I think we have an apparatus that gives us a kind of power that he doesn't have.
340000	345000	And the first notion I want to introduce is the notion of an institutional fact.
345000	351000	We have the capacity to create institutional facts, facts that presuppose human institutions,
351000	358000	facts like the fact that you are students and faculty members of the University of Indiana
358000	361000	or that you're citizens of the United States.
361000	365000	And we need to contrast institutional facts with brute facts.
365000	371000	And the question is, how do you get from a world of brute facts, facts that don't presuppose any institutions,
371000	377000	facts like the fact that hydrogen atoms have one electron and the earth is 93 million miles from the sun?
377000	385000	How do you get from those brute facts to facts about money and citizenship and property and marriage?
385000	391000	And it seemed to me there was a rather simple answer to that question, and I'm going to give you that answer.
391000	394000	It doesn't quite work, but it's pretty good, and then I'm going to improve on it.
394000	403000	It seemed to me it's rather simple. You need just three things to get from brute reality to institutional reality.
403000	413000	First of all, you need this remarkable capacity that humans and many other species have to cooperate.
413000	417000	There's a piece of jargon that we used to describe this.
417000	426000	You need a capacity for collective intentionality, for the ability to cooperate with other people.
426000	432000	Okay, so you got now these beasts running around the woods and they're able to cooperate with each other.
432000	434000	What else do you need?
434000	440000	Well, humans have a remarkable capacity that some animals have, but not all animals,
440000	445000	and that is they can impose functions on objects.
445000	451000	They can take an object and give it a function, so I'm sorry to give these sorted examples,
451000	457000	but my pockets are full of objects that will perform various sorted functions like combing my hair
457000	463000	or writing on paper or things that are too unmentionable to describe.
463000	466000	But all of these are functional objects.
466000	468000	Now notice an interesting thing.
468000	474000	They perform their functions in virtue of their physical structure.
474000	478000	So I can write with this damn thing, but I can't comb my hair with it,
478000	482000	and I'll show you a thing that I can comb my hair with, but I can't write with it.
482000	484000	Alright, so far so good.
484000	490000	But then humans in their ingenuity have invented a great idea,
490000	493000	and it is really the origin of civilization.
493000	494000	Here it is.
494000	501000	You can assign functions to objects and people where the function is not performed
501000	506000	in virtue of the physical structure, or not solely in virtue of the physical structure,
506000	513000	but in virtue of the fact that we have assigned a status to the person or the object.
513000	521000	And with that status, a function that can only be performed in virtue of the collective acceptance
521000	528000	of that status by the community, or at least a sizable number of the members of the community.
528000	534000	And that's the first basic idea I want to introduce is the notion of a status function.
534000	537000	All functions are observer relative.
537000	542000	It only has the function because we have assigned it the function.
542000	549000	But status functions are remarkable because the status function doesn't perform the function
549000	554000	in virtue of its physical structure, but in virtue of what?
554000	561000	Well, in virtue of the beginning we can say the fact that people accept it as having a certain status,
561000	565000	and now show off even more sorted objects I carry around with me.
565000	568000	Here is another object that performs a function.
568000	570000	It's a $5 bill.
570000	576000	But unlike that other stuff I showed you, it doesn't perform the function in virtue of its physical structure.
576000	583000	It performs the function in virtue of the fact that we accept, or recognize, or agree
583000	591000	in virtue of our attitudes that it performs the function of the $5 bill, not in virtue of its physical structure.
591000	594000	So the question we have to ask is, how does that work?
594000	596000	That's an amazing phenomenon.
596000	604000	And for a long time it seemed to me that the key to understanding this was that there are certain kind of rules,
604000	610000	which I call constitutive rules to distinguish them from regulative rules.
610000	617000	Regulative rules regulate previously existing or independently existing forms of behavior.
617000	619000	Drive on the right-hand side of the road.
619000	621000	That's a regulative rule.
621000	623000	But not all rules are like that.
623000	628000	Some rules constitute the very behavior that they regulate,
628000	633000	because performing the behavior consists in acting in accordance with the rules,
633000	636000	or at least with a big enough subset of the rules.
636000	639000	The philosopher's favorite example is always chess.
639000	644000	It's not the case that a whole lot of people were pushing bits of wood around on boards,
644000	648000	and some genius said, fellas, we've got to get some rules,
648000	651000	because you're always banging into my bishop with your knight.
651000	653000	No, it's not like that.
653000	658000	Rather, playing chess consists in acting in accordance with these rules,
658000	663000	and typically these rules come in system, the rules of chess or the rules of football.
663000	667000	Or a much more powerful example, the United States Constitution.
667000	669000	It's a set of constitutive rules.
669000	672000	Now, what do they look like, these constitutive rules?
672000	674000	Well, they have a peculiar structure.
674000	681000	They have the structure where something counts as something that, so to speak, isn't intrinsically.
681000	686000	X counts as Y in context C.
686000	692000	So to take our chess example, such and such a position counts as a legal knight move.
692000	696000	Such and such a position counts as you being in check.
696000	700000	Such and such a form of check counts as you being in checkmate.
700000	706000	Getting a majority of votes in the electoral college counts as being president-elect,
706000	712000	and being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court counts as becoming president of the United States.
712000	717000	You build this structure up where you count something as something else.
717000	719000	And it seemed to me, that's how we do it.
719000	725000	We build civilization by repeated application of constitutive rules.
725000	729000	Now, you might think, well, that's too pathetic an apparatus.
729000	732000	You can't build civilization with that.
732000	738000	It looks too fragile, but it has two formal properties that are remarkable.
738000	744000	One formal property is it iterates upward indefinitely.
744000	747000	So watch, I make noises through my mouth.
747000	750000	They count as sentences of English.
750000	755000	Some of those utterances of sentences count as the making of promises.
755000	760000	Some promises count as undertaking a legal contract.
760000	762000	Now, watch what's happening in this case.
762000	770000	We have X1 counts as Y1, but Y1 equals X2,
770000	776000	and that counts as Y2, and we keep going up.
776000	781000	So in the case of a marriage, in the case of the contract,
781000	785000	making the noise counts as making a promise, making that promise,
785000	789000	counts as creating a certain kind of contract,
789000	793000	and certain kinds of contract count as getting married.
793000	799000	Now, in the state of California, when you get married, all hell breaks loose from an institutional point of view.
799000	803000	You're entitled to spousal benefits and pregnancy leaves.
803000	807000	Even if you're a male, you can get a pregnancy leave, and I don't know what theory they have.
807000	814000	But in any case, there are all these things that go on when you get this institutional status.
814000	819000	So you have the status whereby you are married.
819000	824000	That's an institutional fact, and that gives you a set of status functions.
824000	827000	You have certain rights, duties, and obligations.
827000	833000	Okay, another remarkable feature of this apparatus, this X counts as Y and C,
833000	837000	is it interlocks with other status functions.
837000	842000	So I don't just have money, but I have money in my bank account at the Bank of America
842000	845000	on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California.
845000	848000	It's put there by my employers, the regents of the university,
848000	854000	and I use it to pay my state and federal income tax, my credit card debts, and a whole lot of other things.
854000	860000	Now notice, just about every noun I use there, with a possible exception of Telegraph Avenue,
860000	865000	named a status function. It named some institutional thing, the Bank of America,
865000	868000	my employers, the University of California.
868000	875000	So one institution functions only by locking into a whole lot of other institutions.
875000	878000	So it looks like a pretty good beginning to a theory.
878000	886000	We're able to account for status functions by saying they arise as a result of application of constitutive rules,
886000	891000	and the constitutive rules look more powerful than they look on the surface,
891000	897000	because they keep going up indefinitely, you can keep creating new institutional facts,
897000	900000	and they interlock with each other.
900000	903000	Nice theory, but philosophers will give you some counter examples,
903000	907000	and I want to tell you what's wrong with it, and then I'm going to improve on it.
907000	910000	Okay, so how are we doing? I hope I'm not going too fast,
910000	914000	because my natural temptation is I want to get to the part that most interests me,
914000	918000	but in any case, I think everybody looks like they're following me so far.
918000	922000	All right, here are some interesting problems with this.
922000	927000	Some I thought of myself, but some my friendly colleagues in philosophy thought of,
927000	930000	they're called counter examples.
930000	933000	Here's a difficulty I thought of myself.
933000	938000	Often you don't need a rule to create an institutional fact.
938000	943000	A bunch of kids can just decide that somebody's going to be the captain of the softball team.
943000	946000	They don't have to have a constitution to appeal to that,
946000	952000	they just do it, they just haul off and count this guy as the captain of the softball team.
952000	955000	But furthermore, and this is more troublesome,
955000	960000	sometimes you don't even need an X term.
960000	965000	You can create an institutional fact out of thin air.
965000	972000	And my favorite example was always money, and I like to haul out a $20 bill and show it off.
972000	977000	But the fact is, most money has no physical existence at all.
977000	983000	There is no X that counts as a $20 bill in my bank account.
983000	989000	You see, I'm very naive, and I think if I give these guys the money, and it's my bank account,
989000	993000	there ought to be a drawer with my name on it where they keep my money,
993000	997000	and I want to go and see my money in the bank.
997000	999000	Well, that's not how it works.
999000	1002000	It's very disconcerting.
1002000	1007000	Your money has no physical existence at all.
1007000	1012000	There are magnetic traces on computer disks in the bowels of the bank,
1012000	1016000	but those magnetic traces haven't got any money glued to them.
1016000	1019000	They are representations of money.
1019000	1021000	Now, here's a remarkable fact.
1021000	1024000	In the case of money, which after all is very powerful,
1024000	1029000	you don't need any actual object to bear the status function.
1029000	1032000	Just the representation will do.
1032000	1036000	And we could buy and sell just by exchanging representations,
1036000	1039000	and that's what we're moving toward with a debit card.
1039000	1043000	With a debit card, you don't actually have any cash,
1043000	1046000	any currency that backs up the exchange.
1046000	1051000	You just exchange the numerical value in your account
1051000	1054000	for a numerical value in somebody else's account.
1054000	1057000	This is mind-boggling for philosophers.
1057000	1059000	As I told you last time, to be a philosopher,
1059000	1062000	you've got to allow yourself to be astounded
1062000	1065000	by what any sane person takes for granted.
1065000	1069000	Now, I am astounded by this fact about money,
1069000	1071000	that there is no actual currency.
1071000	1073000	Here's an even more astounding fact,
1073000	1077000	and that is, in their ingenuity,
1077000	1080000	humans have invented whole institutions
1080000	1084000	that do not require any physical reality at all.
1084000	1089000	And the most famous example is the Limited Liability Corporation.
1089000	1094000	Now, there's a wonderful research assistant I have called Google.
1094000	1096000	And if I look up on Google,
1096000	1099000	the law for creating corporations in the state of California,
1099000	1102000	it just says, you create a corporation
1102000	1105000	by saying you're creating a corporation.
1105000	1106000	That's all I have to do.
1106000	1109000	As it says, you file articles of incorporation.
1109000	1111000	What's going on in these cases?
1111000	1114000	How can there be a powerful institution,
1114000	1118000	corporations that have no physical existence at all?
1118000	1120000	See, that corporation may have a building,
1120000	1123000	which is its office, but that's not the corporation.
1123000	1124000	That's just the building.
1124000	1127000	The actual corporation is purely abstract.
1127000	1128000	So what's going on?
1128000	1131000	Okay, now I want to start the second part of the lecture
1131000	1135000	where I'm going to try to show how to assimilate this account
1135000	1138000	that I gave you into a much more general account.
1138000	1143000	And to do that, I need to tell you a little bit about how language works
1143000	1146000	because my essential message is going to be
1146000	1152000	that human civilization is created by a certain very specific type of speech act,
1152000	1155000	by a very specific type of language act.
1155000	1159000	And we're not all that smart that we can do new and original things every time.
1159000	1162000	We apply the same thing over and over again.
1162000	1166000	That's what I'm going to, that's the bottom line of my discussion,
1166000	1168000	but I want to have to work up to that.
1168000	1169000	Okay, so how are we doing?
1169000	1174000	I'm going to take a drink of water and catch my breath
1174000	1176000	and go into the next part.
1176000	1183000	Now, human beings have another remarkable trait, language.
1183000	1189000	Now, we're familiar with the idea that there are signaling systems among animals
1189000	1193000	and some of them are rich enough, I think, to be called a language.
1193000	1198000	I think the B language probably qualifies as a language.
1198000	1203000	There's not going to be any proofs among the B's,
1203000	1209000	but it's clearly a signaling system that represents information in a complex fashion.
1209000	1215000	And one of the things I like about it, it's clear that it's not just a matter of stimulus and response.
1215000	1218000	My favorite experiment was this one.
1218000	1224000	They took a boatload of flowers and carted it out in the middle of a lake.
1224000	1228000	And then the B went out in the middle of the lake, found this boatload of flowers,
1228000	1232000	and she went back to the hive and told all her sisters,
1232000	1235000	they're all females in the society, told her sisters,
1235000	1238000	there are all these great flowers out there in the middle of the lake.
1238000	1241000	They didn't show any interest at all.
1241000	1246000	They just didn't believe it that there were all these flowers to be found in the middle of the lake.
1246000	1251000	Now, I think that's very human of them. I like that.
1251000	1254000	Okay, so now I don't know what you're going to do with a B language,
1254000	1258000	but I know there are things you can do with human language that you cannot do with any others,
1258000	1261000	and I want to tell you about how that works.
1261000	1264000	Human speech acts typically have this kind of structure.
1264000	1269000	You have a certain force, what Austin called illocutionary force, and a propositional content.
1269000	1272000	So I can predict that you will leave the room.
1272000	1274000	I can order that you will leave the room.
1274000	1276000	I can ask whether you will leave the room.
1276000	1281000	In each case, the same proposition as a different kind of speech act,
1281000	1285000	a different kind of what Austin called illocutionary acts.
1285000	1290000	Now, if you look at that, you wonder how many of those kinds of things are there.
1290000	1297000	And one of the ways of distinguishing among them is distinguish ways they relate to reality.
1297000	1302000	So the philosopher's favorite, the statement, is supposed to be true or false.
1302000	1309000	And it's true whether or not, if the statement up here matches the reality down here,
1309000	1317000	and I think in simple metaphors, think of that as having a fit where the word is supposed to fit the world.
1317000	1321000	That's the word to world direction of fit.
1321000	1325000	And the simplest mark for whether a speech act has that direction of fit
1325000	1328000	is can you literally say that it's true or false?
1328000	1330000	These are true or false.
1330000	1333000	But of course, not all speech acts are like that.
1333000	1337000	Sometimes you give somebody an order, or you make a promise,
1337000	1341000	and there you're supposed to change reality if it's a promise,
1341000	1347000	or the person given the order is supposed to change reality to match the content of the speech act
1347000	1351000	is supposed to change the world to match the words.
1351000	1358000	So this kind over here has the world to word direction of fit.
1358000	1362000	The world is supposed to change to match the world,
1362000	1367000	and you don't call those true or false.
1367000	1370000	The order is said to be obeyed or disobeyed.
1370000	1373000	The promise is said to be kept or broken.
1373000	1378000	So you've got these two basic ways that language has of relating to reality.
1378000	1384000	You represent how things are, that's the word to world true false direction of fit,
1384000	1391000	or you try to change reality so it matches how things are in the representation,
1391000	1393000	and that's orders and promises.
1393000	1396000	Now sometimes you get cases where the fit is taken for granted,
1396000	1399000	for when I apologize for stepping on your foot,
1399000	1403000	I'm not trying to get your foot stepped on, and I'm not claiming that I stepped on it,
1403000	1405000	I'm just expressing my regret.
1405000	1408000	So there we just take the fit for granted.
1408000	1412000	So we've got different classes of speech acts, though corresponding to these.
1412000	1418000	We have an assertive class, the aim of which is to tell us how things are in reality,
1418000	1423000	and that includes statements and descriptions, all the philosophers' favorites are in these assertives.
1423000	1429000	Then you have the directive class, and that includes orders and commands.
1429000	1434000	These have this direction of fit, the directives have this direction of fit.
1434000	1441000	Directives are orders and commands as well as suggestions and requirements.
1441000	1448000	Okay, but now there's another class where you commit yourself to doing something,
1448000	1454000	and those I call commissives, the commissive class, and the philosophers' favorite is the promise,
1454000	1459000	where you promise, vow, threat, pledge, and thus create reasons for doing something.
1459000	1462000	I'm going through this fast, but I want you to get the basic idea.
1462000	1466000	Language has different ways of relating to reality,
1466000	1472000	and the two favorite ways are this way where you try to say how things are in the world,
1472000	1479000	and this way, which breaks into two kinds, hearer-based, the directive and speaker-based, the commissive,
1479000	1482000	the directive you're trying to get somebody to do something,
1482000	1485000	and the commissive you're committing yourself to doing something.
1485000	1491000	Now there is this weird class, the expressives, where you apologize, thank, congratulate,
1491000	1498000	and those I just call expressives, where the aim is not to fit reality, but to express an attitude.
1498000	1501000	But now, here is the amazing thing.
1501000	1507000	There is an amazing group of speech acts that I call declarations,
1507000	1515000	and those are the cases where you make something in a case by just saying that it's the case.
1515000	1521000	The chairman can adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,
1521000	1526000	and you can fire an employee just by saying you're fired,
1526000	1530000	or you can hire somebody just by saying you're hired,
1530000	1538000	or you can pronounce a couple husband and wife if you're duly authorized by saying I pronounce you husband and wife.
1538000	1542000	Now what's going on in these cases?
1542000	1546000	What I'm going on, what is going on, I'm going to put very simply by saying,
1546000	1551000	in these cases, you get a double direction of fit.
1551000	1556000	You get a world to word direction of fit when you say the meeting is adjourned,
1556000	1560000	because the world changes, it's now adjourned, the meeting is now adjourned.
1560000	1566000	But the way it became adjourned is you represented it as being adjourned.
1566000	1574000	That is to say, you achieved the world to word direction of fit by way of the word to world direction of fit.
1574000	1578000	You performed not two speech acts, you didn't make a statement that the meeting is adjourned,
1578000	1584000	and then given order that it be adjourned, you made one speech act that included both.
1584000	1586000	That's a stunning fact.
1586000	1587000	Now how do those work?
1587000	1592000	Well, the favorite examples are Austin's examples of performatives,
1592000	1596000	where you make an order by saying I already had to leave the room,
1596000	1599000	you make a promise by saying I promise to come and see you,
1599000	1602000	you adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,
1602000	1607000	you give and bequeath your watch to your nephew by saying I give and bequeath my watch to my nephew.
1607000	1613000	In all of those cases, you have a verb or verb phrase such as promise or order or adjourn.
1613000	1617000	But you don't always need a special sentence to do that.
1617000	1619000	You can do it a special kind of sentence.
1619000	1623000	You can do it with any sentence provided it's understood in the right way.
1623000	1627000	And again, my favorite example is in my wallet.
1627000	1632000	And again, it's another case of being astounded by the obvious.
1632000	1637000	There are stunning philosophical claims made on this sheet of paper.
1637000	1645000	It says, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.
1645000	1650000	Now, we're all epistemologists and our natural inclination is to say,
1650000	1653000	how the hell do they know?
1653000	1655000	Has there been a study?
1655000	1657000	Has there been a survey?
1657000	1661000	They say, arrogantly, it's legal tender for all debts, public and private.
1661000	1664000	What's the evidence that it's legal tender?
1664000	1668000	And the answer, of course, is they don't discover that it's legal tender.
1668000	1673000	They make it legal tender by declaring it to be legal tender.
1673000	1675000	That's a declaration.
1675000	1680000	So the declaration there, this note is legal tender, looks like an ordinary statement of fact.
1680000	1681000	But it's not.
1681000	1687000	It isn't that they did a serious survey and discovered, yep, really is legal tender.
1687000	1691000	No, they made it legal tender by declaration.
1691000	1701000	Now, this is a remarkable fact that human beings have the capacity to create a reality simply by declaring it to exist.
1701000	1709000	Performatives to repeat are the favorite example, but it needn't be a performative verb.
1709000	1712000	There needn't be a special verb that you use.
1712000	1717000	I hear by adjourn the meeting, or I hear by order you to leave the room.
1717000	1727000	You can just make a statement, and if it's accepted as generally creating the reality that it describes,
1727000	1731000	then you have successfully performed a declaration.
1731000	1736000	Now I want to make the strongest claim of the whole lecture, and that's this.
1736000	1746000	All of human institutional reality, money, property, government, marriage, universities, cocktail parties, summer vacations,
1746000	1753000	and all the rest of it, that is created by, I have to put this carefully,
1753000	1758000	representations that have the logical form of the Speech Act of Declaration.
1758000	1760000	It needn't be explicit.
1760000	1764000	You don't have to come out and say explicitly, you're the boss.
1764000	1766000	Or we hereby make you the boss.
1766000	1768000	That would be an explicit declaration.
1768000	1774000	But you can make somebody the boss just by treating her as the boss, just by always referring to her as the boss.
1774000	1779000	By representing her as being the boss, you can make it the case that she is the boss.
1779000	1787000	So what happens in all of these phenomena is that you create an institutional fact
1787000	1793000	by representing that institutional fact as existing, and that has the logical form of the declaration.
1793000	1798000	So the shorthand is simply to say, all of human institutional reality,
1798000	1805000	and that's all of what is distinctive about human societies, how we differ from other animal societies,
1805000	1812000	is created by repeated applications of the same type of Speech Act, the declaration.
1812000	1820000	Now just to have a name for those, I want to tie that into what I said earlier about how we have the capacity
1820000	1829000	to assign functions through collective intentionality, and some of these functions are status functions.
1829000	1832000	And the thesis that I'm now advancing is this.
1832000	1835000	All status functions are created by declaration.
1835000	1838000	They're all created by the same type of Speech Act.
1838000	1844000	I have to qualify that and say by representations that have the logical form of the declaration,
1844000	1847000	because you needn't do it explicitly.
1847000	1853000	You can do it just by accepting something or recognizing it, but there has to be a representation
1853000	1859000	that enables you to do that, to create the institutional fact.
1859000	1863000	Okay, but now you've got a whole lot of interesting questions.
1863000	1872000	If I'm right so far that this is the distinctive feature of human civilization, it looks like
1872000	1881000	we get an interesting set of equations, and the equations come out as this.
1881000	1890000	Status functions, where you have a function that is performed in virtue of the collective acceptance of a status,
1890000	1896000	status functions are co-extensive with institutional facts.
1896000	1903000	Institutional facts are created for the purpose of creating these status functions.
1903000	1906000	What's the point? Why do we create all these status functions?
1906000	1910000	Why do we make somebody chairman of the department, pronounce somebody husband and wife,
1910000	1916000	make somebody president of the United States, create money and private property and government and marriage?
1916000	1919000	And the answer is all of those are status functions.
1919000	1922000	Yes, but what's the function? What's the point of the function?
1922000	1926000	And the answer to that is we do it for power.
1926000	1930000	All of those create power structures.
1930000	1935000	All institutional reality is a matter of creating power structures.
1935000	1941000	So if you have a $5 bill, you have a power that you don't have if you don't have that money.
1941000	1946000	If you're a chairman of the philosophy department, you have power that you don't have if you're not chairman.
1946000	1949000	A lot of the powers are negative powers.
1949000	1955000	As a professor in Berkeley, I have a positive power to get a parking permit.
1955000	1958000	That won't give me a parking space, but at least I have a permit.
1958000	1961000	It gives me a right to look for a parking space.
1961000	1964000	But I also have negative powers.
1964000	1969000	I'm under an obligation to show up and teach my students on such and such a day.
1969000	1972000	So status functions are institutional facts.
1972000	1977000	These institutional facts, without exception, create powers,
1977000	1981000	but the powers are of a very peculiar kind.
1981000	1986000	They're what I call deontic powers.
1986000	1992000	And I call on that because the names of these types of powers
1992000	2001000	would include rights, duties, obligations, authorizations, permissions, requirements, and others in that family.
2001000	2005000	This again is a remarkable fact about human beings.
2005000	2016000	As far as I know, a pack of dogs does not create a system of obligations and rights and duties within the pack.
2016000	2021000	They may create a hierarchy where there's an alpha male and an alpha female,
2021000	2028000	but they do not create deontic powers with institutional facts and status functions.
2028000	2035000	The reason that it's such a big deal, that status functions create our institutional facts,
2035000	2044000	they're created by this constitutive operation, they're all created by status function declarations.
2044000	2049000	And the reason that's such a big deal is that these,
2049000	2055000	I put in here status function declarations because the speech acts in question
2055000	2060000	that create the status functions have the logical form of the declarations,
2060000	2064000	and so I call them status function declarations.
2064000	2070000	And they create, in creating institutional reality, they create a system of deontic powers,
2070000	2074000	and deontic powers are remarkable in this respect.
2074000	2077000	They lock into human rationality.
2077000	2085000	They lock into human rationality in such a way that they give you reasons for acting
2085000	2088000	that are independent of your inclinations.
2088000	2093000	So if you recognize an obligation as a binding obligation,
2093000	2101000	you recognize that you have a desire independent reason for acting on that obligation.
2101000	2103000	I'll give you a real-life example.
2103000	2108000	A nice guy invited me to go to Bloomington, Indiana, and give some lectures.
2108000	2111000	It seemed like a great idea, many months away.
2111000	2115000	But then a day comes when you got to get up early in the morning
2115000	2120000	and make your way to San Francisco Airport, and then it's just, well, you know what it's like.
2120000	2124000	You got to stand in line, you got to take your shoes off,
2124000	2128000	you got to eat airplane food, and you don't even get much of that anymore.
2128000	2135000	And then, worst of all, you got to try to put your elbow where some other guy's trying to put his elbow, and so on.
2135000	2138000	So nobody does it for fun.
2138000	2140000	On the other hand, there was no question.
2140000	2142000	I had made a promise.
2142000	2149000	I had created an institutional fact, and my promising, that institutional fact,
2149000	2153000	had created a reason for acting that was independent of my inclination.
2153000	2159000	I had a reason for coming, and here I am.
2159000	2164000	I gave this example once in Chicago to a famous seminar
2164000	2170000	occupied by a very conservative economist, to put it charitably.
2170000	2175000	And they don't think anybody ever did anything for a desire-independent reason.
2175000	2182000	And they said, you just came to Chicago because you were worried about what we would think of you
2182000	2186000	if you didn't come to Chicago.
2186000	2191000	And I didn't have the heart to tell them, I don't give a damn what you guys think of me.
2191000	2193000	I didn't have the heart to tell them that.
2193000	2195000	Anyway, I made it there.
2195000	2199000	I got out of there alive.
2199000	2203000	Anyway, so here is the thesis that I am advancing.
2203000	2207000	We live in a sea of status functions.
2207000	2212000	The marvelous thing is they're almost totally invisible because you take them for granted.
2212000	2216000	The clothes on my back are my private property.
2216000	2222000	I am a citizen of the United States, a possessor of a valid California driver's license,
2222000	2227000	the owe of money on my various credit cards, and so on.
2227000	2229000	The list is huge.
2229000	2234000	Many status functions of the kind that I described to you are codified.
2234000	2239000	It's easy to make a law about these, and laws naturally tend to proliferate.
2239000	2240000	Why?
2240000	2245000	Because the status function only exists if it's represented as existing,
2245000	2252000	and if you've got the representation, then it's relatively easy to codify the representation.
2252000	2258000	There are some status functions that are not codified and would suffer if they were codified.
2258000	2261000	Think of cocktail parties, love affairs, and friendship.
2261000	2263000	Now all of those are status functions.
2263000	2268000	The test is, is there a set of obligations and other deontic powers
2268000	2273000	that go with inviting people to a cocktail party or having other obligations of friendship
2273000	2275000	or obligations of a love affair?
2275000	2278000	And the answer seems to me in every case, yes.
2278000	2284000	But you don't want to try to codify it because partly you're inventing it as you go along.
2284000	2286000	You're inventing the structure of the institutional effect.
2286000	2291000	If it's a friendship or a love affair, and if it gets codified, you get serious,
2291000	2294000	then it becomes much more flexible.
2294000	2298000	Now you will suffer from problems when you go to other countries
2298000	2301000	where they have maybe a different conception of a love affair,
2301000	2304000	a different conception of friendship, and you can get in a lot of trouble.
2304000	2309000	I won't even go through into the details about that, about the different conceptions.
2309000	2314000	Okay, but now another result that comes out of this, out of this discussion,
2314000	2321000	is that language, unlike my earlier view, is not just one system of status functions,
2321000	2326000	among others, it's the basic human institution in this sense.
2326000	2333000	All other human institutions that I mentioned, like a government and private property and universities,
2333000	2335000	all of them presuppose language.
2335000	2341000	You can have a society that has a language but doesn't have money or private property or government,
2341000	2344000	but you can't have a converse.
2344000	2352000	If an anthropologist comes back from the Amazon Basin and says her tribe has language
2352000	2356000	but they don't have private property and they don't have a government, that makes sense.
2356000	2361000	But if she comes back and says they have private property, government, marriage, and money,
2361000	2365000	but they do not have a language, we know that couldn't be right,
2365000	2370000	because language is the fundamental human institution in that all others presuppose language.
2370000	2374000	But then now there's an interesting asymmetry.
2374000	2380000	I originally got this idea of the constitutive rule X counts as Y,
2380000	2386000	as a way of describing the operation of language, the performance of the speech act.
2386000	2392000	Uttering the sentence, snow is white, in English counts as making the statement that snow is white.
2392000	2399000	But now it turns out there's a big asymmetry between the operation of the constitutive rules with language
2399000	2406000	and their operation with, so to speak, non-linguistic institutional facts like money and private property.
2406000	2408000	The asymmetry is this.
2408000	2415000	In the case of the status functions and the deonic powers that are non-linguistic,
2415000	2419000	for example, when we make somebody president of the United States,
2419000	2426000	we use language to create power that goes beyond the power of language.
2426000	2433000	So we use language to say, by the authority vested in my, I hereby pronounce you president of the United States,
2433000	2438000	the guy then has powers that go beyond the powers of language,
2438000	2444000	but when we just use a sentence to make a statement, there are no powers that go beyond the powers of language.
2444000	2452000	So the way, as a speaker of English, my knowledge of English enables me to have the power to make the statement that snow is white
2452000	2455000	by uttering the sentence, snow is white.
2455000	2458000	That's a case where the semantics is all the power there is.
2458000	2461000	The powers are just the semantic powers.
2461000	2464000	But when you make somebody chairman of the philosophy department,
2464000	2469000	or you admit them to graduate school, or you award somebody a prize,
2469000	2473000	or you pronounce somebody husband and wife, or you borrow money from the bank,
2473000	2476000	or you buy a house in Bloomington,
2476000	2480000	all of those are cases where you create institutional facts
2480000	2485000	and thus create deontic powers, and you use language to do that.
2485000	2489000	But the powers that you create go beyond semantic powers.
2489000	2495000	So all of Barack Obama's powers derive from semantics.
2495000	2500000	He has to be created as president and treated as president, represented as president,
2500000	2502000	but the powers go beyond semantics.
2502000	2507000	The power to command American troops in battle goes far beyond the semantics,
2507000	2511000	even though the initial origin of the power is on the basis of the semantics.
2511000	2514000	The semantics creates powers that are not semantic.
2514000	2520000	So it turns out that language is not only the fundamental human social institution,
2520000	2526000	the one that all others derive from, all others depend on,
2526000	2529000	but it's fundamentally different in its operation,
2529000	2533000	because just as far as the meanings of the sentences are concerned,
2533000	2538000	all you have when you know the language is the power to perform speech acts with those sentences.
2538000	2544000	But when you're locked into a system of institutional facts and status functions and deontic powers,
2544000	2547000	when you're buying and selling stocks on the stock market,
2547000	2553000	or you're passing legislation in Congress, or you're adjudicating cases,
2553000	2556000	all of those cases involve the use of language,
2556000	2561000	but they use language to create powers that go beyond language.
2561000	2563000	Okay, how am I doing for time?
2563000	2567000	Well, maybe I'll try and summarize, so we'll have plenty of time for discussion.
2567000	2573000	Now, there are a few things I want to say of a theoretical kind before I throw it open for discussion.
2573000	2582000	One is, it seems to me, if you think along these lines, as I'm suggesting,
2582000	2588000	you get a different conception of many traditional questions in the social science,
2588000	2592000	in the social sciences, and in political philosophy.
2592000	2597000	If you look at our tradition in political and social theory,
2597000	2603000	there is an endemic flaw that goes back to the Greeks,
2603000	2607000	and that is, roughly speaking, they had an impoverished theory of language.
2607000	2610000	They took language for granted.
2610000	2614000	Social contract theorists are the worst because they assume
2614000	2617000	that we're running around the woods speaking a language,
2617000	2621000	and then some genius says, let's make a social contract,
2621000	2624000	and then you get together and have a society.
2624000	2628000	But the implication of what I'm saying is, if you've got a language,
2628000	2631000	you've already got an implicit social contract
2631000	2635000	because you have the possibility of creating status functions.
2635000	2637000	Now, how do we get away with it?
2637000	2642000	You see, what's amazing is we get away with it.
2642000	2647000	And the short answer to that is, you get away with it if people accept it.
2647000	2652000	And the most amazing creation of a status function by declaration
2652000	2656000	were by guys who wrote as if they had read my book.
2656000	2658000	They used the very terminology.
2658000	2661000	They call it the Declaration of Independence.
2661000	2667000	Now, there's nothing in their status functions
2667000	2671000	prior to that moment that gives them the power to do this.
2671000	2675000	These are, let us not forget, British subjects.
2675000	2677000	They're not citizens of anything.
2677000	2680000	They're subjects of King George III,
2680000	2685000	where in a British crown colony, Philadelphia, it's a crown colony.
2685000	2687000	It's got a status function.
2687000	2695000	It's entirely under the government of the royal family in London,
2695000	2698000	and they just got together and performed a collective speech act.
2698000	2703000	They said we declare ourselves to be an independent nation.
2703000	2705000	Now, they got away with it.
2705000	2707000	How did they get away with it?
2707000	2710000	Well, the short answer is they got people to accept it.
2710000	2714000	And we're here because people accepted and we accepted.
2714000	2718000	The long answer is they had to fight a war to get the acceptance.
2718000	2722000	And it wasn't really until Cornwallis was defeated at Yorktown
2722000	2725000	that they were free and clear.
2725000	2727000	And by the way, something Americans tend to forget,
2727000	2730000	we couldn't have won the war without the help of the French.
2730000	2735000	The French were essential in the creation of our country.
2735000	2738000	So remember that when the French complained about us
2738000	2743000	and we complained about them, which is a common domestic conversation.
2743000	2748000	So here are these guys who created an institutional reality of enormous power.
2748000	2751000	However, it doesn't always work.
2751000	2754000	A bunch of people, I guess, in Richmond, tried to do the same stunt.
2754000	2756000	You know, they had a good model.
2756000	2760000	They created the Confederate States of America and it didn't work.
2760000	2766000	They did not, again, it took a war to settle the issue, but the issue was settled.
2766000	2773000	But the remarkable thing is that your life is entirely structured
2773000	2778000	within a series of complex families of status functions.
2778000	2784000	They're all created by the same simple, logical, linguistic operation
2784000	2788000	applied over and over, the status function declaration.
2788000	2791000	See, we're not smart enough to do something new and original every time.
2791000	2795000	We have this device for creating status functions.
2795000	2800000	It's the status function declaration and we apply it over and over.
2800000	2805000	Now, I think, as I said, a lot of traditional issues are clarified
2805000	2809000	if you adopt the approach that's implicit in what I've been saying.
2809000	2811000	Let me conclude with one thought.
2811000	2817000	There are huge debates that go on in this country and internationally
2817000	2822000	about human rights, about universal human rights.
2822000	2829000	And the question is, what is the ontology of the human rights?
2829000	2833000	And there are a class of philosophers who are very skeptical,
2833000	2836000	like Jeremy Bentham and Alistair McIntyre.
2836000	2839000	They think talk of human rights is nonsense.
2839000	2841000	What are you talking about?
2841000	2844000	But I think, in fact, that the talk can be made legitimate
2844000	2846000	once you recognize what's actually going on.
2846000	2849000	You don't have human rights the way you have thumbs.
2849000	2852000	The human right is a status function.
2852000	2856000	What's different about human rights and other rights
2856000	2861000	is that other rights typically arise within a preexisting institution.
2861000	2863000	As a citizen, I have certain rights.
2863000	2865000	As a husband, I have certain rights.
2865000	2868000	As a professor, I have certain rights.
2868000	2871000	But somebody in the 18th century, I don't know who it was.
2871000	2874000	Maybe it was 17th century, but it's in the Enlightenment.
2874000	2879000	Somebody or some group of people got an idea of genius.
2879000	2884000	Just being a human being is a why status function.
2884000	2886000	They didn't have the right terminology for saying that.
2886000	2889000	But that's what they were trying to say.
2889000	2892000	Just being a human being is a why status function.
2892000	2894000	And as such, it carries deontic powers.
2894000	2897000	It carries universal human rights.
2897000	2901000	And I think that can be made intellectually legitimate
2901000	2907000	once you recognize that human rights are universal status functions
2907000	2910000	created and maintained by a certain type of speech act.
2910000	2913000	And that speech act is the status function declaration.
2913000	2916000	Now, another claim I haven't really had time to develop
2916000	2921000	is that the institutional facts are not only created
2921000	2925000	in their initial form by the status function declaration,
2925000	2929000	but that's how they maintain over a period of time.
2929000	2935000	You maintain the system in power by constantly representing it
2935000	2939000	as the power structure that it is.
2939000	2942000	So one of the ways to see this is to see the way
2942000	2946000	that revolutionary movements want to change the vocabulary.
2946000	2949000	At the time of the Russian Revolution,
2949000	2952000	the revolutionaries were very anxious
2952000	2956000	that people not use the traditional forms of address
2956000	2958000	of traditional Russia.
2958000	2960000	They wanted everybody to be called comrade.
2960000	2961000	Why?
2961000	2964000	Because that marked an equality of status function
2964000	2967000	which calling somebody a lord or a duke or whatever
2967000	2970000	would not accept.
2970000	2973000	So they were insistent on changing the vocabulary.
2973000	2977000	And more recently, the feminists in the early days of feminism
2977000	2981000	were anxious that we not use the traditional vocabulary
2981000	2983000	of ladies and gentlemen,
2983000	2988000	because that marked status functions that they were anxious to overcome.
2988000	2990000	Now, I don't know how these things develop.
2990000	2991000	It's quite interesting.
2991000	2993000	If you, in somebody in Moscow today,
2993000	2996000	I think if you address them as comrade, it'll be a joke.
2996000	3000000	I mean, because the system that was created that
3000000	3002000	has become undermined.
3002000	3005000	But even this is going on as we speak.
3005000	3008000	If you look at older American laws,
3008000	3012000	the word spinster occurs commonly.
3012000	3014000	Now, I once asked my class,
3014000	3016000	how many of you are spinsters?
3016000	3017000	Please raise your hand.
3017000	3020000	One middle-aged woman had a courage to raise her hand.
3020000	3022000	I wanted to give her an A on the spot.
3023000	3028000	Because this is a term that is becoming obsolete.
3028000	3029000	It did mark a status function.
3029000	3032000	And I think bachelor may be becoming obsolete
3032000	3036000	with a change in what, with hesitation,
3036000	3038000	I call it marital practices.
3038000	3040000	But with the relation of the sexes,
3040000	3043000	we may be going for all sorts of new vocabularies.
3043000	3045000	But the vocabulary is crucial,
3045000	3049000	because the vocabulary is the articulation
3049000	3052000	of the assignment of a status function.
3052000	3058000	So I think that I have only really begun a subject.
3058000	3060000	But what I want to suggest, and I'll conclude with this,
3060000	3064000	is that when I use this somewhat provocative title,
3064000	3067000	the logical structure of human civilization.
3067000	3069000	Unfortunately, most people think,
3069000	3071000	I mean logical as opposed to illogical.
3071000	3072000	That's not the point.
3072000	3076000	The point is that it has a propositional structure.
3076000	3079000	The propositional structure is the assignment
3079000	3083000	of a status function according to the Speech Act
3083000	3085000	of Declaration that makes something the case
3085000	3087000	by representing it as being the case.
3087000	3090000	And wherever you have propositional structures,
3090000	3092000	you have logical relations.
3092000	3094000	That's why I call it the logical structure
3094000	3096000	of human civilization.
3096000	3101000	But this, I think, is how we differ from other social animals.
3101000	3102000	There are lots of social animals.
3102000	3106000	Lots of them have power structures and hierarchies
3106000	3108000	with their alpha males and alpha females.
3108000	3112000	But they do not have this remarkably rich,
3112000	3115000	stable system of status functions that we have.
3115000	3120000	I visited Mike Tomasello at his primate lab in Leipzig.
3120000	3122000	And he's got all these primates
3122000	3124000	that are busy fighting it out every day.
3124000	3125000	Who's going to be the alpha male today?
3125000	3127000	And the alpha male has to find allies,
3127000	3130000	among other males, to fight off other alpha males.
3130000	3134000	Now, that's not how it works in the White House.
3134000	3137000	Barack Obama does not get up and think,
3137000	3140000	today I got to beat everybody in arm wrestling
3140000	3141000	or whatever it might be.
3141000	3144000	No, he's got an accepted system of status functions
3144000	3146000	and that persists through time.
3146000	3148000	And this is a feature both of good institutions
3148000	3150000	and bad institutions.
3150000	3152000	But I'm convinced that it is that key
3152000	3156000	to understanding the ontology of human civilization.
3156000	3157000	Thank you.
3157000	3159000	Thank you.
3159000	3161000	Thank you.
3161000	3163000	Thank you.
3163000	3165000	Thank you.
3165000	3167000	Thank you.
3167000	3169000	Thank you.
3169000	3171000	Thank you.
3171000	3173000	Thank you.
3173000	3175000	Thank you.
3175000	3177000	John will take questions now.
3177000	3179000	The microphones over here.
3179000	3181000	The end of the line up.
3181000	3183000	Okay, Guy on the left.
3183000	3185000	I have a question.
3185000	3188000	Does that question be in one of those categories
3188000	3189000	or questions?
3189000	3190000	Questions.
3190000	3192000	I didn't give you an electron speech ask.
3192000	3195000	Questions are species of directive.
3195000	3197000	Every question is a request.
3197000	3200000	It's a request for an answer.
3200000	3203000	And indeed, there's a remarkable thing about questions
3203000	3207000	in English that the form of the question
3207000	3209000	determines the form of the answer.
3209000	3212000	So if I answer, do you have any bananas
3212000	3214000	and you say yes, that doesn't mean
3214000	3216000	yes, it's going to rain tomorrow.
3216000	3218000	It means yes, we have bananas.
3218000	3221000	And the one exception to this
3221000	3224000	is the peculiar English modal auxiliary verb.
3224000	3227000	So if I ask you, shall I marry a Republican?
3227000	3230000	The correct answer is not yes, you shall
3230000	3232000	or no, you shall not,
3232000	3234000	but rather yes, do or no, don't.
3234000	3236000	It asks for advice.
3236000	3238000	But that modal auxiliaries are hard to think about anyway.
3238000	3239000	But go ahead.
3239000	3241000	Questions are directives. Yes.
3241000	3243000	That sort of was my question.
3243000	3244000	Okay.
3244000	3245000	Yeah.
3245000	3246000	Okay.
3246000	3247000	All right.
3247000	3249000	Well, I was kind of thinking in the sense
3249000	3252000	of anything from satisfying curiosity
3252000	3254000	to questioning authority, like,
3254000	3255000	who do you think you are?
3255000	3257000	What do you think you're doing?
3257000	3258000	Okay.
3258000	3260000	Now, I resist the temptation of electron questions.
3260000	3262000	They're a fascinating subject.
3262000	3266000	And one interesting class are rhetorical questions.
3266000	3269000	When the guy in the Republican National Convention
3269000	3273000	says, do we want four more years
3273000	3275000	of incompetent government?
3275000	3277000	He doesn't want people to think about it.
3277000	3278000	I don't know.
3278000	3280000	Do we or don't we?
3280000	3282000	I guess we do.
3282000	3285000	No, it's not the form of the question.
3285000	3288000	So rhetorical questions are interesting
3288000	3290000	in that the rhetorical question makes a statement
3290000	3293000	by assuming that the answer to the question is known.
3293000	3295000	It's assumed the answer is known
3295000	3298000	consequently you use the rhetorical question
3298000	3299000	to make a statement.
3299000	3301000	So questions are fascinating, a lot to be said.
3301000	3304000	But in any case, the short answer is real honest
3304000	3307000	and John questions like, how do I find my way to Bloomington?
3307000	3312000	That is a directive where you're asking for information.
3312000	3313000	Yes.
3313000	3314000	Oh, no.
3314000	3316000	Let's go over here first and then we'll come back to you.
3316000	3317000	Yeah.
3317000	3320000	I agree with most of what you say, but I want to draw.
3320000	3321000	Watch out when somebody says that
3321000	3324000	because he's now going to tell us what he disagrees with.
3324000	3327000	I want to draw attention to an important fact,
3327000	3330000	namely you, for example, have a California driving license.
3330000	3331000	Yeah.
3331000	3333000	Now, suppose I were visiting California.
3333000	3335000	I didn't bring my driver's license.
3335000	3337000	You couldn't say, Roy, that's all right.
3337000	3338000	Just take mine.
3338000	3339000	Yeah.
3339000	3342000	On the other hand, I have also a lunch coupon
3342000	3343000	for lunch tomorrow.
3343000	3344000	Yeah.
3344000	3346000	I could give that coupon to somebody else.
3346000	3347000	Yeah.
3347000	3349000	And that person could eat lunch instead of me.
3349000	3353000	So it's important that the driver's license is unique to you.
3353000	3354000	Yeah.
3354000	3356000	And when a policeman stops you,
3356000	3359000	he wants to know that it's John Sir who was speeding
3359000	3362000	and not Kirk Ludwig.
3362000	3365000	Whereas on the other hand, when it comes to lunch,
3365000	3367000	it doesn't matter who is eating the lunch
3367000	3369000	because they want to make sure that the number of coupons
3369000	3371000	equals the number of people who pay.
3371000	3372000	Yes.
3372000	3373000	No.
3373000	3375000	So there are some important properties
3375000	3378000	about these certificates of power.
3378000	3379000	No, that's absolutely right.
3379000	3381000	And I'm grateful for the contribution.
3381000	3383000	I want to say a little bit more about it.
3383000	3386000	Many status function attached to specific individuals,
3386000	3388000	named individuals.
3388000	3390000	So you're named in the driver's license
3390000	3392000	or on the marriage license.
3392000	3395000	You can't prove you're married by borrowing my marriage license.
3395000	3396000	OK.
3396000	3398000	I mean, it is specific.
3398000	3401000	The beauty of money is it's fungible.
3401000	3405000	Anybody with the money can use it to buy something with.
3405000	3409000	But all sorts of other things are not in that way exchangeable.
3409000	3410000	Now, there's another topic.
3410000	3412000	I didn't have a chance to go into it,
3412000	3414000	but I want to use this occasion to mention it.
3414000	3417000	And that is that often we need indicators.
3417000	3419000	You need status function indicators.
3419000	3422000	So the policeman wears a uniform.
3422000	3426000	And the actual license that I have is not the status function.
3426000	3429000	It's an indicator that I am able to drive.
3429000	3432000	It's a state, what I call a status function indicator.
3432000	3438000	And these wedding rings, uniforms, driver's licenses,
3438000	3441000	all of these are status function indicators.
3441000	3443000	And their primary function is epistemic.
3443000	3447000	They prove that I have the status that I claim to have.
3447000	3450000	Now, they can acquire a kind of life of their own.
3450000	3452000	So the driver's license in California
3452000	3455000	is used for all kinds of things that have nothing to do with driving.
3455000	3458000	You can't buy a beer if you haven't got a driver's license
3458000	3461000	because you can't prove that you're over 21.
3461000	3466000	And so sometimes the status indicators
3466000	3468000	will acquire a kind of separate life of their own.
3468000	3473000	But the basic idea is that for many status functions,
3473000	3478000	you need to indicate that you have the status function
3478000	3480000	by some epistemic device.
3480000	3482000	When I first got to Berkeley,
3482000	3484000	you could tell who the professors were.
3484000	3488000	They were the guys with ties on, ties and jackets.
3488000	3490000	Then in the 60s, you could tell the professors
3490000	3492000	they were the ones with shoes on
3492000	3496000	because dressing habits had changed by then.
3497000	3498000	So you get these.
3498000	3500000	And part of the problem in my old university, Oxford,
3500000	3502000	is that when I was a student there,
3502000	3504000	you could identify who was a member of the university
3504000	3505000	by their clothing.
3505000	3509000	They wore, well, the kind of stuff I got on, roughly speaking.
3509000	3515000	They had on worsted flannel slacks and usually tweed jackets.
3515000	3516000	This wouldn't qualify.
3516000	3519000	But in any case, there was no question
3519000	3522000	about improper people wandering in the university.
3522000	3525000	They would be immediately identified by their style of dress.
3525000	3527000	Now everybody wears blue jeans.
3527000	3528000	They imitate the Americans.
3528000	3530000	So you can't do that anymore.
3530000	3532000	And people have now started locking their doors.
3532000	3535000	You have to lock your door in Oxford the way you didn't used to
3535000	3537000	because it was all members of the upper class
3537000	3541000	and they were readily identifiable by their dress.
3541000	3543000	Okay, did you finish?
3543000	3544000	Yeah, I'm sorry.
3544000	3545000	Thanks for the question.
3545000	3546000	Okay, you're on.
3546000	3548000	In the beginning of your talk,
3548000	3552000	you talked about physical particles like protons and electrons.
3552000	3553000	Yeah.
3553000	3557000	But you haven't said a word about how you get from protons
3557000	3560000	and electrons to human beings or to civilization.
3560000	3562000	Okay, let me answer that question.
3562000	3564000	Unfortunately, I only had two lectures to give here.
3564000	3566000	One was about consciousness.
3566000	3568000	So let me give you the short answer.
3568000	3571000	To begin with, I'm not sure there are particles,
3571000	3575000	maybe points of mass energy or strings.
3575000	3578000	But that's not what I'm paying the physicists to do,
3578000	3582000	to settle on the basic, the ontology of the basic entities.
3582000	3585000	Okay, those are organized into systems.
3585000	3592000	Now, on our little Earth, some of those particles are organized
3592000	3597000	into large molecules containing lots of carbon with hydrogen,
3597000	3599000	nitrogen and oxygen.
3599000	3605000	And some of those systems of carbon-based molecules became alive.
3605000	3609000	Now, to this day, we don't know when and how and where that happened,
3609000	3610000	but it did happen.
3610000	3612000	It's an amazing fact.
3612000	3616000	And some of those living organic systems,
3616000	3620000	some of those living organic systems continued to evolve
3620000	3622000	and they were now talking about millions of years,
3622000	3627000	continued to evolve until they became animals.
3627000	3631000	And some animals evolved consciousness.
3631000	3634000	And now, that's what I talked about last time,
3634000	3637000	is how the brain creates consciousness.
3637000	3639000	And we still don't understand that.
3639000	3641000	We don't know how exactly the brain creates consciousness
3641000	3643000	or how exactly it functions in the brain,
3643000	3645000	but we know that it does.
3645000	3648000	Now, this lecture was the next step,
3648000	3652000	where once you've got consciousness,
3652000	3655000	then you can get language.
3655000	3657000	And I didn't discuss the structures of language.
3657000	3659000	I just talked about some of the uses.
3659000	3661000	And now, once you have language,
3661000	3665000	you have the possibility of creating society,
3665000	3667000	human society and human civilization.
3667000	3671000	So the pattern goes from the basic physical reality
3671000	3675000	of physical particles to the beginnings of life
3675000	3677000	in carbon-based molecules,
3677000	3681000	and then the development of life through evolution,
3681000	3684000	and then the development of evolutionary mechanisms
3684000	3688000	through the development of animals and conscious animals,
3688000	3690000	and then the development of language,
3690000	3692000	and then us and then all the stuff we got.
3692000	3693000	That's the picture.
3693000	3695000	I should have spelled that out,
3695000	3698000	but that's how you get from protons to presidents.
3698000	3702000	You get from having the basic system of the physical particles.
3702000	3704000	Some of those become alive.
3704000	3706000	A stunning fact.
3706000	3708000	And some of those living systems
3708000	3712000	evolve over long periods of evolutionary time,
3712000	3714000	and then over that long period of time,
3714000	3718000	you eventually reach folks like us.
3718000	3724000	Now, we ought not to be arrogant about our special situation.
3724000	3726000	As I mentioned before,
3726000	3733000	we are a very small solar system in a big galaxy,
3733000	3737000	and there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy.
3737000	3740000	I don't know how many of them can support life
3740000	3743000	or planets like as ours do.
3743000	3747000	But our galaxy with its 100 billion stars,
3747000	3750000	it's one of 100 billion galaxies.
3750000	3752000	So it seems to me,
3752000	3757000	unlikely that we're the only conscious beasts in the universe.
3757000	3761000	I don't suppose that other beasts in the universe look like us.
3761000	3762000	Why should they?
3762000	3765000	I mean, we're freaks of a certain kind of evolution.
3765000	3769000	And if they could see us,
3769000	3771000	no reason why they have the ability to see,
3771000	3772000	but if they could see us,
3772000	3775000	we probably look as freakish to them as they do to us.
3775000	3779000	So we can't assume that we're the only possible reasonable way
3779000	3780000	for life to come about.
3780000	3781000	But it's what we got.
3781000	3783000	It's what we have to live with.
3783000	3785000	Now, that's the good news.
3785000	3789000	There are only 100 billion stars in our galaxy,
3789000	3791000	and only 100 billion galaxies.
3791000	3794000	I've been telling my students this for years.
3794000	3795000	Here's the bad news.
3795000	3798000	I only discovered this in my physics fan frequently.
3798000	3803000	The story I told you only covers 4% of the universe.
3803000	3804000	Oh, yeah?
3804000	3806000	What about the other 96%?
3806000	3808000	I paid to hear about that.
3808000	3813000	Well, the other 96% is dark matter and dark energy.
3813000	3817000	And what's dark about it is epistemic darkness
3817000	3820000	that damn physicists haven't figured it out.
3820000	3825000	They have pretty good reasons for believing in it.
3825000	3829000	I mean, here's the thing they say that always drives me crazy.
3829000	3831000	The universe is expanding.
3831000	3833000	What's it expanding in?
3833000	3834000	You know, if I say,
3834000	3836000	we've decided to expand the kitchen.
3836000	3840000	OK, well, then it's got to expand into the backyard.
3840000	3842000	But if we say, oh, yeah, and by the way,
3842000	3844000	we're going to expand the kitchen and expand the universe.
3844000	3846000	What do I expand the universe in?
3846000	3848000	Well, there is an answer to that,
3848000	3850000	but they've been misleading us.
3850000	3853000	And the answer is to say the universe is expanding
3853000	3857000	is to say the galaxies are getting farther apart.
3857000	3859000	And they are.
3859000	3862000	What's the force that's driving them farther apart?
3862000	3866000	Well, there's dark energy as well as dark matter.
3866000	3870000	So we're, I mean, we really are very ignorant of all
3870000	3874000	some of the most fundamental facts about the nature of ourselves
3874000	3876000	and the nature of the universe.
3876000	3880000	We really don't know much about how the universe works.
3880000	3883000	And in a way worse yet, we don't know much about how we work.
3883000	3885000	We don't know how our brain creates consciousness.
3885000	3887000	We don't know how life began.
3887000	3889000	We do know that it did begin and it did evolve.
3889000	3892000	And we have some conception of those mechanisms,
3892000	3895000	but we're still ignorant of a whole lot of areas.
3895000	3899000	Well, as what makes philosophy fun is we got a lot to work on.
3899000	3901000	Okay, who's next?
3901000	3903000	I think you're, this guy's next.
3903000	3905000	Okay, you're on.
3905000	3909000	You've been talking about some of the implications
3909000	3915000	of the performative for social power and even social change.
3915000	3918000	The subtitle of Jared Diamond's book, Collapse,
3918000	3923000	is How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail.
3923000	3927000	Would you give us some hints about how we might avoid
3927000	3932000	catastrophic collapse and whether, whether,
3932000	3935000	exactly, whether, whether there might be any
3935000	3940000	any performative incantation that would help in that task?
3940000	3943000	Well, that's why I love easy questions.
3943000	3949000	You know, I don't have a general theory of society
3949000	3953000	or social collapse, so I really am the wrong guy
3953000	3955000	to ask this question of.
3955000	3960000	If I got a good characterization of social ontology,
3960000	3966000	the mode of existence, then I, you can go on from there,
3966000	3968000	but I haven't gone on from there.
3968000	3971000	Well, what makes a good institution is a bad institution.
3971000	3974000	And there, it seems to me, you have to ask questions about,
3974000	3977000	well, what constitutes human flourishing and what sorts
3977000	3982000	of healthy societies will facilitate human flourishing?
3982000	3985000	And it seems to me, there are lots of them in the world today
3985000	3989000	that are not very healthy, but Americans love to criticize themselves.
3989000	3992000	I think we're pretty well off compared with, let's say,
3992000	3994000	what's happening in Syria.
3994000	3996000	I'm sure there are lots of joys to be had in Syria,
3996000	4000000	but right now I'd rather be in Indiana and a whole lot
4000000	4002000	of other areas of the world that that's true.
4002000	4004000	So I don't have an answer to your question,
4004000	4008000	but what I provide, I hope, is a framework for ontology
4008000	4011000	for posing the questions.
4011000	4013000	Okay, you're on.
4013000	4016000	Okay, this one's a doozy, all right.
4016000	4019000	And it's been bothering me for a while.
4019000	4023000	What the hell is an institution and what the hell is a society?
4023000	4025000	I mean, the institution is more important
4025000	4027000	because you've been using the word a lot.
4027000	4029000	An institution, what is that?
4029000	4033000	Yeah, as I've told you, an institution is a system of constitutive rules.
4033000	4035000	Within those systems of constitutive rules,
4035000	4038000	you create institutional facts.
4038000	4041000	All institutional facts are created by the application
4041000	4045000	of a same type of speech act or the same type of linguistic representation,
4045000	4048000	a status function declaration.
4048000	4050000	Now, there are immediate objections to that
4050000	4053000	because some of the things we think of as institutions
4053000	4057000	are not institutional facts on my account.
4057000	4060000	So the Christian calendar is not an institution
4060000	4065000	because being such and such a date doesn't carry a deontology.
4065000	4068000	The test is, does it carry a deontology?
4068000	4070000	Christmas Day is an institutional fact
4070000	4075000	because I have obligations and rights on Christmas Day.
4075000	4078000	I am obligated to give my children presents
4078000	4080000	and I have a right to a day off.
4080000	4083000	It marks it as an institutional fact.
4083000	4085000	That's a status function.
4085000	4087000	So there are tests for status functions.
4087000	4089000	Does it carry a deontology?
4089000	4093000	But the short answer is institutions are systems of constitutive rules.
4093000	4096000	They enable the creation of institutional facts
4096000	4098000	by status function declarations.
4098000	4103000	Status function declarations without exception create deontic powers
4103000	4107000	and deontic powers are the glue that holds human civilization together
4107000	4109000	because they give us reason for acting
4109000	4113000	that are independent of our immediate inclinations.
4113000	4116000	That's a summary of the lecture.
4120000	4123000	You brought this up towards the end concerning conflict
4123000	4128000	and the degree to which declarations must be accepted on mass
4128000	4130000	for them to have causative effect.
4130000	4133000	But then it seems that this propositional logical structure
4133000	4136000	doesn't have very much prescriptive power.
4136000	4139000	Most of the things you can prove from this logical structure
4139000	4141000	are actually descriptive.
4141000	4146000	I look at my set of axioms which are the result of having already fought wars
4146000	4149000	and then I draw the facts from there.
4149000	4154000	So my predecessor on this side asked for could you avert society
4154000	4159000	simply by describing society as an iterative process of declarations.
4159000	4161000	But I have a more basic question.
4161000	4167000	Does this actually give you any prescriptive, proof-based power at all
4167000	4171000	or do you throw it out there and then see who wins might make right style?
4171000	4172000	Yeah.
4172000	4176000	Well, okay, that's a larger question than I'll really be able to answer
4176000	4179000	but I would say there are lots of institutions
4179000	4183000	that are so obviously useful to all of us
4183000	4187000	that they really are not subject to challenge as institutions.
4187000	4189000	Most obvious is language.
4189000	4192000	If you think that private property is a bad idea,
4192000	4195000	okay, you can argue against private property.
4195000	4197000	But how would you argue against language?
4197000	4200000	You'd have to use language to argue against language
4200000	4204000	and I don't, I mean it's just pretty hard to see language being challenged
4204000	4205000	as an institution.
4205000	4208000	Now some institutions are inherently evil.
4208000	4212000	Slavery seems to me, a slavery of human being seems to me inherently evil.
4212000	4216000	But then that's something you can argue for.
4216000	4219000	That's something you can, within institutional structures,
4219000	4220000	you can make that out.
4220000	4226000	There are some, as I said, institutions that are so obviously beneficial to everybody
4226000	4230000	that it's very hard to see how anybody could argue against them
4230000	4232000	and language is the most obvious case.
4232000	4233000	But there are others.
4233000	4234000	How about money?
4234000	4236000	Money is an institution.
4236000	4237000	Is it beneficial?
4237000	4239000	I think on balance it is.
4239000	4241000	It's famously the root of all evil,
4241000	4243000	but it's the root of an awful lot of good too.
4243000	4246000	I try to imagine what your life would be like
4246000	4250000	if you had no possibility of buying and selling or being paid
4250000	4253000	or being paid for your work or anything like that.
4253000	4257000	It's very hard to imagine how you would organize a decent life.
4257000	4260000	So there are lots of institutions that are very pervasive
4260000	4264000	that are effectively harmless.
4264000	4266000	Now how about private property?
4266000	4271000	Well I think private property, again, benefits just about everybody.
4271000	4275000	But we now have in the United States such a disproportionate
4275000	4279000	concentration of private property, the famous 1%.
4279000	4282000	The wealth is so disproportionately concentrated
4282000	4285000	that it seems to me very unhealthy.
4285000	4288000	It's just not a healthy way to run a society
4288000	4291000	to have so much power, so much deontic power
4291000	4294000	in the hands of so few people.
4294000	4297000	For one thing, it gives them a disproportionate amount of political power.
4297000	4301000	And these are real problems that we're going to have to face.
4301000	4304000	So I think if you want to ask about a given institution,
4304000	4306000	is this institution a good one or a bad one,
4306000	4309000	you have to tell me more about the institution
4309000	4312000	and what it does, how it functions in human life.
4312000	4314000	Yeah.
4314000	4318000	I'd like to follow up on a question that was asked on this side a little earlier
4318000	4321000	when you were asked to spell out a little bit more about the way
4321000	4324000	that you get from molecules to presidents and so forth.
4324000	4327000	And what I'm going to ask you, some people would object to the treatment
4327000	4330000	of things like presidents and elections on the same ontological plane
4330000	4333000	as molecules and particles.
4333000	4336000	I wonder if you could say a little bit more about the logic
4336000	4339000	that allows from a materialist conception of the world
4339000	4342000	is reducible to material, how things emerge from that
4342000	4345000	and can exist in any way on a different level.
4345000	4347000	No, that's a very good question.
4347000	4350000	One of the things I hope is implicit in what I've said
4350000	4354000	is that there are additional distinctions between the material
4354000	4357000	and the mental or the material and the ideal.
4357000	4359000	I think those are all obsolete.
4359000	4361000	I mean, we live in one world.
4361000	4364000	It's basic structure is that of physical particles.
4364000	4367000	Among the physical features of the world is consciousness,
4367000	4370000	but I mean real honest to John consciousness,
4370000	4373000	with all its subjectivity touchy-feely features,
4373000	4377000	and then organized systems of consciousness through collective intentionality
4377000	4379000	to create human civilization.
4379000	4383000	That's the story about how you get from the protons to the presidents.
4383000	4386000	Of course, there are several steps in that story
4386000	4388000	we just don't understand.
4388000	4391000	We don't understand how life got started.
4391000	4393000	It did.
4393000	4396000	We don't understand how consciousness got started.
4396000	4400000	And we really don't understand how human languages took off,
4400000	4404000	and we may never really understand that because there's no fossil evidence.
4404000	4411000	We need to look at the fossils and see whether or not these guys had a subject verb language
4411000	4413000	or a language where the verb came first.
4413000	4414000	You can't look at that.
4414000	4416000	Look at the skull and discover that.
4416000	4420000	So we may never have a full understanding of how these things developed,
4420000	4421000	but they did develop.
4421000	4427000	We did evolve from a solar system at least in which there were no living beings.
4427000	4432000	We evolved into us, and we did evolve culturally
4432000	4436000	into something that's far more complicated
4436000	4440000	and far more interesting, I think, than a hunter-gatherer existence
4440000	4444000	where no longer just running around the woods
4444000	4450000	trying to find enough food to get through the rest of the day.
4450000	4452000	Any other questions?
4452000	4456000	I've answered every question.
4456000	4459000	Yeah.
4459000	4461000	Thank you.
