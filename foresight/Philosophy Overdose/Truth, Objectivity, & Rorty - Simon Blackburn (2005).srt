1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to talk a little bit about the nature of truth and some of its enemies, and by the end of the talk I'm going to talk a little bit about the philosophy of Richard Rorty, who is famous amongst other things, for saying that only a metaphysical prig believes in truth anymore.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, I find myself a kind of prig, I suppose, in spite of having written a book about lust, and what I want to urge is that you can believe in truth without being a metaphysical prig.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You just have to be a prig. So that's going to be the plot. The setting against which I'm going to talk, I'm not going to read out all this material, partly because it makes up a book on truth,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but I'm going to summarize the plot as it leads up to the discussion of Richard Rorty.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, the setting is a very old one. It's one that you meet, for example, in the dialogue with Theotitus, in which we imagine a confrontation between relativists and absolutists.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The relativist is the kind of sneery person that you meet in the marketplace who thinks that a lot of our talk, talk about truth, objectivity, knowledge, talk about scientific rationality, perhaps,

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a lot of such discourse is, in fact, to be seen simply as the putting on of masks of theatrical guises or of the adoption of a rhetorical pose.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a vocabulary to be used to persuade others of our opinion. In other words, the primary usage of those terms is in connection with power and persuasion.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll sometimes talk of that as a postmodernist view. I take it that's a harmless enough label, although, of course, you could dispute whether particular postmodernists like Foucault or Derrida or Leotard actually conform exactly to the description.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Against the relativist, you become the absolutists who think that truth, on the contrary, is a deity worth worshiping. Truth is real. Truth is absolute. Truth is something that you must worship.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A falling away from truth is a failure. Truth exerts a demand upon us, and so on. In the dialogue in the Theotetus, of course, Socrates is the champion of truth, the absolutist position, and he confronts Theodorus and disciple of Protagoras who takes the other view.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So you've got in a nutshell, on the one hand, philosophers believing that truth deserves, as it were, dignities and robes of state. Those are the absolutists. And on the other hand, you've got relativists who think that when we talk about truth, we're basically putting on something more like a theatrical costume, a set of masks.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I believe that the sides in this dispute tend to talk past each other, and a lot of the argument that is adduced on one side or the other therefore misses its target. I've got a story. I have put this story in print in my little book, Being Good.

14
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I'm afraid the happy few of you in the audience who may have read that book will have to bear with me for a moment, and I'll be telling you a story you know. But I've got a story which illustrates the way the two sides talk past each other, which I very much like, and it's a true story.

15
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It happened to a friend of mine, the distinguished philosopher of Lord Jeremy Waldron actually, who was at a think tank in Princeton on ethics, and it was a condition of his fellowship at this institute that he attend all the talks or all the particular talks that the institute put on.

16
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And one night they put on for the rest of the university, or perhaps the general public, a dialogue between proponents of the world's great religions. Jeremy had no particular interest in this topic, but he had to go along as a condition of his fellowship.

17
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So he went along, and sure enough there was a little line up, and they let everybody have their go. And so as it were, first off the, let's say the Hindu went and he talked about karma and the reincarnation of the spirit and the number of lives you had to live and how you could eventually free yourself from the cycle and so on.

18
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And everybody gave tremendous round of applause and said, you know, if that works for you, that's great. And then the Buddhist went and he talked about the, you know, the corruption of life by desire and the way to release yourself from that by the noble truths and the eightfold way and so on.

19
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At the end of that, everybody said, wow, you know, tremendous applause. If that works for you, that's great. And so it went on and eventually the Catholic priest had his say and he talked about the fall of mankind, the Garden of Eden, the expulsion from the garden, the serpent, the redemption of the world through Jesus Christ and so forth.

20
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And they all said, oh, wow, terrific, you know, if that works for you, that's great. And he thumped the table and said, no, it's not a question of if it works for me. It's the true word of the living God. And if you don't believe it, you're all damned to hell.

21
00:05:33,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And they all said, wow, terrific, if that works for you. Well, that's what I mean by the two sides talking past each other. The ancient Greeks had a nice motto saying that you can give something with the right hand and yet it is received with the left.

22
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I think that's what the story illustrates. So how do we get past the opposition? How do we argue about it? How do we argue ourselves out of it? Well, I think that in recent philosophy of truth, far and away, the most promising suggestion has been to go minimalist.

23
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I'll explain a little bit what I mean by that, or deflationist. Some of you will have read the writings of people like Stephen Leeds or Paul Horwich, and you'll know what I'm talking about. But in a nutshell, it goes something like this. Along comes someone like Pilate, a Pontius Pilate, and says, what is truth? And everybody goes sort of dizzy. And you look to the philosopher to provide a suitably abstract and high-faluting answer.

24
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The minimalist says you shouldn't answer Pilate. Or rather, if you answer Pilate, your answer should take the form of a question, which is, what are you interested in? So basically, you throw the question, what is truth back? Until a person who's interlocuting you, who's asking the question, gives you an example. He says, well, I'm interested in the question of whether penguins fly.

25
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's okay. Well, the truth there, the truth would consist in penguins flying. See, in other words, you just repeat the issue. That's very disappointing, of course. But the point of deflationism or minimalism is that that disappointing answer is all you should get. It's all you should expect, and it's all you're going to get.

26
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It has a number of consequences. One of which is that when we talk in terms of truth, we're not elevating ourselves at all. We're not taking up, as it were, a God's eye viewpoint or an Archimedean viewpoint outside an issue.

27
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I say I really want to know whether it's true that penguins fly, I'm saying no more than I really want to know whether penguins fly. And that's a perfectly straightforward empirical question.

28
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If I've defined a good issue, then the issue is the issue. And there's no question of I trying to adopt a stance, which is the peculiar privilege of the philosopher.

29
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There may be something priggish, this is where priggishness comes back, in being particularly interested in a particular issue. But there's nothing metaphysically necessarily priggish about it.

30
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you're interested in whether penguins fly, good for you. And if you've got the money, you can go to the Antarctic and conduct some observations, or you can look it up in encyclopedias or do whatever appears appropriate.

31
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So the minimalist says there's no general problem about truth. Of course, there may be problems that arise in connection with particular sentences. There might be sentences that don't define an issue, in which case you can't play the game I just played.

32
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't deflate it and say, I know what the issue of truth is, it's that P, because you haven't got a proposition to wheel up about which you're inquiring.

33
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But when you do, the minimalist says the issue is the issue, and anything else is a distraction. So you're neither putting on robes of state, nor are you adopting a rhetorical posture or putting on a theatrical mask.

34
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Both the absolutist and the relativist thought there was a space for theory when there's none, and that is the minimalist or deflationist point.

35
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's sometimes thought that minimalism and deflationism take away a certain kind of ambitions that we might have, and this is, I think, possibly the only point of contact I've got with this conference, at least in its connection with value.

36
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's sometimes thought that minimalism and deflationism take away any idea that truth is intrinsically valuable, or that you can care about truth.

37
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, for example, if you think of Winston in George Orwell's 1984, or you think of the kind of morality exhibited by Primo Levi, then these people care about truth and they go to the stake for truth.

38
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And it's thought that the minimalist somehow doesn't allow that. How can truth remain an ideal if there's no such robust, abstract property?

39
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That, I think, is a natural question, but I don't think the challenge is unanswerable. In fact, I think the challenge can fairly easily be answered.

40
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What the minimalist says is, as usual, will you tell me the issue?

41
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I suppose the issue is whether penguins waddle. Then you care about the truth if you care about whether penguins waddle.

42
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And you care, for example, about ancillary things like only saying that penguins waddle if penguins do waddle, or believing that penguins waddle if and only if penguins waddle.

43
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In other words, you've got a way of saying for each sentence what caring about its truth amounts to.

44
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And you can then turn that into a schema. Somebody can be said in general to care about truth.

45
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If he cares about satisfying the schema, I believe that P, if and only if P, to the maximum number of times.

46
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or if he feels guilty when he turns out to have satisfied an instance of the schema, I believe P, although not P.

47
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Or if he's prepared to put a lot of effort into maximizing either the proportion of times or the number of times that he satisfies that schema.

48
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And since the schema, none of its instances mentions truth, you don't need a robust metaphysical property of truth to give sense to Winston's concern or to Premier Levy's concern.

49
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So I don't think it's true that minimalism takes away your right to care about truth as you should.

50
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well now, is it then the case that the relativist, for example, has to slink back into silence?

51
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Does this kind of thought, the minimalist thought, defeat any relativist leanings anyone might have?

52
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think it's true that it defeats, for instance, the moral relativist, at least what's sometimes called the sophomore moral relativist that you meet on the street, as it were, or in the freshman seminar room.

53
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Suppose you've got a moral issue. I'll take the example of whether fox hunting should be banned, because this was a big issue in Britain quite recently, whether hunting with foxes should be disallowed.

54
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And you can imagine a proponent of one side or the other. Somebody says that it should be allowed and somebody else says that it shouldn't.

55
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I suppose I'm arguing with somebody we'll call him Gengis, who Gengis thinks that fox hunting is a jolly good thing and I think it should be banned.

56
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And now imagine the relativist Rosie coming along, and Rosie says something like, you two, you're always banging on about this issue as if there's a truth about it.

57
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You ought to realize that it's true for you, Simon, that fox hunting ought to be banned, but it's true for Gengis that it ought not to be banned.

58
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You relativize truth and just stop bickering, shut up about it. Something like that for the relativist is my truth, your truth is truth.

59
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Minimalism, I think, stops that and stops it properly. It stops it properly because it gives no meaning to my truth, your truth.

60
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Except, of course, I believe that fox hunting ought to be banned and Gengis believes that it ought not to be banned, but we already knew that.

61
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's why we've got an opposition, a debate on.

62
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think in silencing Rosie and giving her nothing to say, minimalism has a, it's a plus, it's an advantage to minimalism that it does that, because I think you can see that she is just actually a distraction.

63
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because what goes on after she's had her say, after she said, oh, look, it's true for Gengis that fox hunting ought to be banned, but it's true for you that it ought not to be banned and it's true for you that it ought to be banned.

64
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's supposed to go on? Are we supposed to just fall over and say, fine, we'll agree to differ? But of course we don't.

65
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If I agree to differ with Gengis, that's functionally equivalent to tolerating as fox hunting, which is what I was against.

66
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But why should I change my mind? Why should I cease from being against it and start tolerating it because of anything Rosie has said?

67
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:02,000
She hasn't said anything that makes fox hunting a jot more permissible or she hasn't changed the colors in which it might appear to me.

68
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,000
She hasn't, in other words, she hasn't engaged with any reasons I might have for thinking that fox hunting ought to be banned, nor has she engaged with any reasons Gengis might have for thinking it ought not to.

69
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In other words, her contribution seems to be just a distraction.

70
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't think that's always so. I think a contribution of that kind might not be a distraction if, for example, is not a real issue or if the two protagonists ought to stop bickering for some other reason.

71
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Most likely that they haven't framed an issue properly and I think many issues about values are not framed properly.

72
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
For example, if you and I go to the art gallery and I say Rembrandt is a greater painter than Vermeer and you say no, Vermeer is a greater painter than Rembrandt,

73
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
there may be a point in somebody who comes along to, as it were, try to stop us from bickering because very probably put in those terms the issue is not worth discussing.

74
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can discuss all sorts of issues about the relationship between Rembrandt and Vermeer, but if you put it in terms of which is the greater painter,

75
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't think you'll get anywhere and I don't think that without a lot of clarification you'll be defining an issue worth talking about and therefore not an issue worth bickering about.

76
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So I don't think relativism is always a distraction or merely a distraction, but I think in cases where we have an issue which we have to sort out,

77
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
then the motto is the issue is the issue and these remarks purporting to be remarks about the nature of truth are irrelevant and distractions.

78
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay, what about though the movement of modern thought, the movement I vaguely pointed to as postmodernism, which you may think is unlikely to be silenced by the kinds of remarks I've made so far.

79
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Minimalism about truth gets us so far, but the postmodernist climate, as it were, I think is not one that we're going to change simply by insisting upon it.

80
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think the postmodernist climate can best be summarized, I quite like a few years ago there was a very indiscreet and talkative butler,

81
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:37,000
man called Paul Burrell, who had been Princess Diana's butler and he spilled the beans to all the newspapers for considerable sums of money.

82
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And he said apropos of Diana's death that the Queen had said to him, there are dark forces at work of which we know nothing.

83
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, I rather doubt whether the Queen said any such thing, but if she did that she's in effect giving us a motto of postmodernism,

84
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:15,000
because I think the motivation, as it were, the steam behind a lot of what you read about the decline of truth or the absence of objectivity and so on.

85
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The steam is given, I think, by the thought, voiced in different ways, of course, at the beginning of modernism by people like Freud or Nietzsche,

86
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and then carried on through into almost everything in the 20th century, that our sayings and our perceptions of the world will inevitably be the result of a process of acculturation,

87
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
about which we know very little, and whose effects upon us we cannot discount for.

88
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We in some sense cannot step outside our own skins and get rid of the bias that would be brought with our interests, our vocabularies, our saliences, our ways of looking at things.

89
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Looked at like that, it's not true that postmodernism is the private property of weird continental philosophers of the kind that some of the graduate students in this room may suffer from.

90
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's also there very, very firmly in the Anglo-American culture.

91
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If we think of a garden of Eden, a golden age, for example, sometimes perhaps of the heyday of positivism, although actually this is historically too simple,

92
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but a golden age would be one way you've got, as it were, a determined experience.

93
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You've got a determined way of taking experience to build theory, if not necessarily an algorithm for creating theory, at least a set of rational procedures for assessing theory,

94
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and you've got determinate meaning so that you can pass on the results of any theorizing you've done and expect them to transmit without distortion.

95
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you think about a picture something like that, and perhaps with other components as well, for example, reliable logic, a priori certitude in various ways,

96
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:29,000
then I think you can see that everything that happened in post-war, analytical, Anglo-American philosophy, everything that, as it were, got brand names attached to it,

97
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
was in effect a dissolution of that sunny picture.

98
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
In other words, our expulsion from paradise was complete.

99
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You think of sellers as attacking the myth of the given, undermining the sense that observations somehow unproblematically or directly plugged you into the fact observed.

100
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You think of quine as undermining the determinacy of meaning, so that the idea that your words bore certain meaning which you could rely upon transmitting to other people.

101
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That idea became attacked, quine also, of course, attacking the notion of the a priori.

102
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You've got Wittgenstein stressing the role of human nature, human and perhaps a cultured nature, in determining what counted for us as going on the same way.

103
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's a very abstract way of putting what Wittgenstein was aiming at in the rule following considerations that chimes in with the way Goodman thought,

104
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
but I think it's accurate enough.

105
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And, of course, eventually you've got Thomas Coon telling us that science itself is not so much a matter of rationality,

106
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but a matter of putting on a particular set of spectacles or seeing a natural phenomena through a certain set of paradigms which could shift,

107
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and the shift would be, as it were, a question of dark forces.

108
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It'd be a question of social, political, other needs coming to mind, other forces coming to mind.

109
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And that would change the concepts with which we thought about nature.

110
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, I think all those are ways, if you see them together, the similarity I want to point out is that they're ways of undermining the sunny epistemological picture,

111
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
which perhaps the positivists were the last people to express.

112
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think against that background, it's possible to make good sense of some of the wilder sounding things that, for example, Richard Rorty,

113
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
who is, of course, I think a spokesman for a postmodernist climate, tries to present in his work.

114
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Rorty is fond of saying that truth is a matter, well, he's not really fond of truth at all, but insofar as he'll use a notion,

115
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,000
he wants to say that proper discourse, something like true success in discourse, is a matter of coping, not copying.

116
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The idea is going to be that the notion of representation is somehow transcendental.

117
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The idea of language as representing the facts is somehow beyond our reach.

118
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He often says that the question, does he love truth, is equivalent to the question, does he love God with all his heart and soul,

119
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and that's a question which you can't know the answer to.

120
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's not a good question.

121
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And this is part of his attempt, his campaign to replace the concept of representation or the concept of truth with a concept,

122
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
a more Darwinian concept like that of being adapted.

123
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So discourse becomes not susceptible to much of truth and falsity as useful or not useful.

124
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Also politically it becomes a question of whether a discourse is on the side of solidarity,

125
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
whether it's as it were politically on the side of getting consensus and getting agreement with other people as opposed to something else.

126
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Now, Rorty obviously is coming at the end of the kind of pressures I've just been mentioning.

127
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is a philosophy you'd only get if you'd started to despair about any project of epistemology.

128
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And what Quine, Sellers, Wittgenstein and Kuhn, amongst many others of course, were doing in my brief account,

129
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
was making us despair of any project of justificatory epistemology.

130
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What I want to do in the rest of the talk is try to bring together what I said about minimalism

131
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
with what I've just done sympathetically, I hope, to place Rorty in a kind of post-epistemological climate

132
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and one where he is responding to real problems, to real difficulties brought out by those great figures that I have mentioned.

133
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Because on the one hand you've got sympathy I think, I've got sympathy with Rorty,

134
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
taking the problematic left us by people like Quine, Sellers, Wittgenstein and Kuhn,

135
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
taking that very seriously and trying to break out of the epistemological impasse that they leave

136
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
by in effect denying the subject of epistemology and doing that by denying the notion of representation.

137
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That sounds sympathetic enough, it sounds like a good move.

138
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:50,000
On the other hand you get invoicing himself by denying truth, by saying that truth only belongs to metaphysical prigs,

139
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
by denying that we can make sense of Winston's predicament in 1984.

140
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is denying that Winston had a sensible thing to worry about when he worried about whether the party was in effect veiling

141
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
his capacity or undermining his capacity to get at the truth about anything.

142
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And minimalism it seems ought to stop Rorty talking like that.

143
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because as I tried to explain earlier on, minimalism enables us to make perfect sense of Winston.

144
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It makes perfect sense of the question, does he love truth?

145
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And so it's very unclear why you should go Rorty's way, even as a way of expressing sympathy with the anti-epistemological

146
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
writings which undoubtedly form a large part of his background.

147
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well let me quote for you something, the kind of thing that Rorty likes to say and then I'll say how I want to resolve this apparent tension.

148
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The apparent tension between sympathizing with Rorty, admiring him on the one hand for being a sensitive interpreter

149
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
of the epistemological condition we got into as a result of those writings,

150
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:23,000
versus thinking that he's just wrong about truth, that he's aligning himself with the old absolutist relativist kind of polarity

151
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and that can be undermined by minimalism.

152
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So what are we going to say about this?

153
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well here's Rorty talking about coping but not copying.

154
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He says, there is no way in which tools can take one out of touch with reality.

155
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No matter whether the tool is a hammer or a gun or a belief or a statement,

156
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
tool using is part of the interaction of an organism with its environment.

157
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
To see the employment of words as the use of tools to deal with the environment,

158
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
rather than as an attempt to represent the intrinsic nature of that environment,

159
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
is to repudiate the question of whether human minds are in touch with reality.

160
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The question asked by the epistemological skeptic.

161
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No organism, human or non-human, is ever more or less in touch with reality than any other organism.

162
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Well that's obviously a pretty provocative thing to say because as we look round the coffee house,

163
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
we're able to see a lot of organisms which seem to be pretty out of touch with reality.

164
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But you can see how Rorty gets to say it.

165
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That is, epistemology leads us into the Quine cellars, Wittgenstein-Kloon impasse.

166
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's a no-no, it's a non-starter, we can't do anything with it.

167
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Let's get rid of the notion of representation which the epistemologist is desperately trying to certify

168
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and see words in a more Darwinian sense as tools we have for coping,

169
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and then we leap free of the old problematic.

170
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We change the subject as Rorty likes to put it.

171
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So Rorty walks away from the traditional problems as he sees it.

172
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And the walk away takes the form of junking a lot of the vocabulary, including the vocabulary of truth.

173
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Here he is on the replacement of representation with a vocabulary of solidarity.

174
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We understand knowledge best when we understand the social justification of belief

175
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and thus have no need to view it as accuracy of representations.

176
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Instead of seeking vertical relationships between language or ourselves as language users and the world,

177
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
we must concentrate upon horizontal or inferential processes whereby we advance and accept reasons from each other.

178
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Justification becomes a social phenomenon rather than a transaction between an inverted commas knowing subject and, again, inverted commas reality.

179
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Well, now that substitution, of course, coincides with realising that contingently and historically situated as we are,

180
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,000
any of the norms that govern the inferential relations that our peers will let us get away with are our norms.

181
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So the inferences that we produce are our inferences, neither they nor anything else,

182
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
answers to the external world except in the most general sense that they enable us to cope.

183
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And it's a foregone conclusion that a language will enable you to cope because if it doesn't enable you to cope,

184
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you'll go to the wall and you won't be using it anymore.

185
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And that's basically the line of thought that leads Rorty to his rather more flamboyant kind of assertion,

186
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
such as the one that truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with.

187
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A remark that excited Putnam's particular anger because, as Putnam rightly pointed out,

188
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
there's more than a whiff of self-refutation in the air since the remark that truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with

189
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
wasn't one that Rorty's contemporaries let him get away with.

190
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, of course, to many of us, this solution looks worse than the problem.

191
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Whatever upper ear people like Wittgenstein left us in, it looks as though the cure is worse than the disease

192
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
if you get rid of the idea of languages, at least in part, there for representing the way of things.

193
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So Rorty, of course, will say that shows a naive attachment to an old vocabulary

194
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and it's part of his enterprise is to shake us up and to get us to abandon those thoughts.

195
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But as I say, I'm more of a prig and more conservative and I want to keep hold of them.

196
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Rorty has, I think, two devices for sort of softening you up to his point of view.

197
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
One is to insist that if you're still bothered about truth and objectivity,

198
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and this is, of course, a line of thought familiar, at least since Barclay,

199
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and always used by anti-realists or idealists against people with realist leanings,

200
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
that they're the charge that they're attempting to stand on their own shoulder

201
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
or adopt an Archimedean point outside their own best theory, outside their own world

202
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to discover how well their theory is relating to reality

203
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and pointing out that that point of view is mythical, is one of Rorty's prime weapons

204
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and, of course, he's quite right about it.

205
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The other, which is, I think, more interesting, though, is the idea that you'd only be a realist.

206
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You'd only want to come back against his proposal to substitute talk of solidarity for talk of truth.

207
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You'd only want to resist it.

208
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If you had a fantastical idea of the world as itself demanding to be talked about

209
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
in one set of terms or another, as if the realist is involved in the very strange idea,

210
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
a naive idea, of the speaking world, the world which, as it were,

211
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
has its own privileged vocabulary or privileged discourse,

212
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
obviously here the concern ties in with the dislike of scientism

213
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
because people who perhaps think of the world as having a privileged voice

214
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
probably thinks that it's the voice of mathematics and the voice of physics.

215
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And one of the things that Rorty might be doing is plugging into a sense

216
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that at least other discourses have their own propriety.

217
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But on the face of it, it's very strange.

218
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It sounds as though you could be a card-carrying, paid-up believer in the notion of truth

219
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
without thinking any such thing.

220
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
If I'm interested in truth, as the minimalist construes it,

221
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
then I'm interested in the schema, I believe P if and only of P,

222
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in maximizing the number of times that schema is satisfied

223
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and minimizing the number of times that I flouted.

224
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And it doesn't seem as though I'm interested in a talking world.

225
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm interested in a whole succession of things, like whether penguins fly

226
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
or whether geese lay eggs or whether platypuses are mammals or whatever it might be.

227
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And that doesn't require believing that the world talks.

228
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It just requires the capacity to make judgments about particular issues

229
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
on particular occasions.

230
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Well, I think that's fair enough.

231
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There are other currents leading to Rorty,

232
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
some of which I don't have time to go into this afternoon.

233
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
One of them, of course, is the Salazian separation

234
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of the space of causes from the space of reasons.

235
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Rorty, the motivation behind thinking that believers in truth,

236
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
believers in epistemology, believers in objectivity,

237
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
are stuck in some kind of naive conception of a talking world.

238
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think the motivation behind believing that

239
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is the Salazian separation of the space of causes from the space of reasons.

240
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Rorty, like others like Brandon and McDowell, take that very seriously.

241
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And they think that therefore all your transactions with the world are purely causal.

242
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What enters your mind are just, as it were, energies from the flux.

243
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What your mind then does with that includes the making of experience itself

244
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and, of course, the making of perception and the making of judgment and so on.

245
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But that takes us into the space of reasons

246
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and the space of reasons is not to be confused

247
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
or even related to this space of causes.

248
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The idea would be that if you have the old epistemology,

249
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
the old view of these things which Rorty is trying to get us away from,

250
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
it would be as if you thought that photons or other energies from the world

251
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
came bearing messages.

252
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
They came actually saying that there's a cat on the mat

253
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
or there's a cliff in front of you or whatever it is.

254
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And the Salazian point is that they don't do that.

255
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This is a very impressive philosophy

256
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and I think Rorty has pursued it with considerable skill

257
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and it has, of course, relationships with similar philosophies found

258
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in writers like Robert Brandon, John McDowell,

259
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
although McDowell is, I think, a more awkward case to place,

260
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and Donald Davidson.

261
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
When Davidson says that only a belief can justify another belief,

262
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
he's basically in exactly the same space as Rorty,

263
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,000
although, of course, Davidson doesn't draw the radical consequences from it.

264
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How can we relate to this?

265
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
How can we get a better view of it in such a way that the tension I talked about disappears,

266
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the tension being, remember, that we'll sympathise with Rorty

267
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
if we remember the difficulties of epistemology,

268
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the difficulties heralded by Krine, Wittgenstein, Goodman, Kuhn, so on.

269
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Whereas we won't sympathise with him if we remember minimalism,

270
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
because minimalism is going to keep us on all fours,

271
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
it's going to keep our feet on the ground,

272
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and it's going to enable us to interpret things like he loves truth with all his heart and soul.

273
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's not going to be a transcendental remark,

274
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
which you get to by jumping outside your own skin,

275
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
it's going to be a perfectly ordinary, verifiable, empirical remark

276
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
about the person's concern for satisfying that schema

277
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
as often as possible.

278
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well, I think there are ways of attacking Rorty,

279
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
which I think don't meet their mark,

280
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and it's very difficult to find one that does,

281
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
partly because, as it were, as a dialectical posture,

282
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
he's put himself in a rather enviable position.

283
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I've been able to say that almost anything you say against him

284
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
just shows an attachment to a naive old vocabulary,

285
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
whereas his whole point is to get you to stop thinking in those terms.

286
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And rather like David Lewis once said that he can't refute an incredulous stare,

287
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think one can't refute somebody walking away with his back to you.

288
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So it is quite difficult,

289
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but I think we can see reasons for thinking that Rorty has got something wrong.

290
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Let me talk a little bit, then, about the Davidsonian side of it,

291
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the thought that only a belief justifies another belief,

292
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the thought that you need a total separation between the space of causes

293
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and the space of reasons.

294
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It seems to me that what's wrong with that,

295
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Davidsonian slogan, and I'll bring this back to Rorty,

296
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
is that it's not, I mean, it's obviously not true that only a belief justifies another belief.

297
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If you ask me why I'm justified in believing that there's butter in the fridge,

298
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the kind of answer you're going to get will probably include something like,

299
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I went and looked, or I listened to somebody who had gone and looked,

300
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
or I got this webcam trailed or trained on the fridge,

301
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and look, you can see the butter for yourself, or something like that.

302
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You won't hear me saying, oh, my justification for believing that there's butter in the fridge

303
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
is that I believe that there's butter and cheese in the fridge,

304
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and a licensed influence in my society is from the presence of butter and cheese

305
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to the presence of butter.

306
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's not the way it goes.

307
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This justification, as it's bandied about in the marketplace,

308
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
is not a matter of what else you believe.

309
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If you imagine a mind which had the, as it were,

310
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
a self-fertilizing property of just beliefs bubbled up within it,

311
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
although it was in no causal contact with an external world,

312
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
well, actually, those wouldn't be beliefs.

313
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
They wouldn't be concepts without intuitions in Kantian terms.

314
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But playing along with the fantasy, that would be a self-contained mind,

315
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
a mind which was just the gifted with a surprising fertility in producing beliefs.

316
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But it wouldn't be a mind that was justified in believing anything,

317
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
at least anything empirical, anything about the surrounding world,

318
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
precisely because it wouldn't be the subject of a set of procedures

319
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
which could be seen as making a belief more likely to be true than false,

320
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
making it more likely that you believe P if and only of P than the reverse.

321
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What I think the Davidsonian slogan which he takes from Sellers,

322
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
he believes to be a kind of beefing up of something implicit in Sellers,

323
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
what I think it forgets is that the causal flux,

324
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
the things that cause you to believe things are not themselves transcendental,

325
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
they're not themselves outside the range of your beliefs.

326
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's part of your everyday belief system that you're caused to believe

327
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
that there's butter in the fridge, by the presence of butter in the fridge.

328
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And furthermore, you can use that causal knowledge to put yourself in the way of causation,

329
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
which in turn brings it about that your beliefs are indeed genuinely responsive

330
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
to an external world.

331
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And with the idea of responsiveness comes at least part of the idea of representation.

332
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So I think what's happened here is that Rorty, Sellers, Davidson, people who think like that

333
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
have got themselves fundamentally into a position very like that which Barkley got into

334
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
when he was dissenting from Locke's epistemology.

335
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That is a thinking that the only alternative to the Lockean idea of resemblance,

336
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the transcendental possibility that your ideas resemble the external world,

337
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
the only decent alternative was to Locke yourself in the world of your ideas altogether

338
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and let external reality disappear.

339
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I want to argue for a much more human scale down, not transcendental,

340
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,000
re-injection of causation and responsiveness into the formation of beliefs in the first place.

341
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And I believe this is true to count.

342
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If we think about the speaking world element, I think we'll also see that Rorty has overplayed his hand.

343
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Those of us who believe in truth and believe in representation don't, I think typically,

344
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
regard the world as demanding to be described in a certain way.

345
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We may have reasons for privileging physics,

346
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
but those will be reasons that are simply derived from things like physics utility

347
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
or its fundamental place in explaining other things.

348
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It won't derive from the thought that physics is God's language or the world's language.

349
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You might have that thought, but you don't have to.

350
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Suppose I want to convince you of the representational credentials of a map, of a landscape.

351
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'll say, look, here is the sign representing cliffs.

352
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And you better jolly well play attention to that,

353
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
because, for example, if you don't, you'll fall over the cliffs.

354
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
If you're setting your compass bearing along there and you walk along there,

355
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
look out, you're going to come to cliffs.

356
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Rorty will say that's an exercise of coping, of course.

357
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The map has a use, it's got a utility, and he's all in favor of utility.

358
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But then where's the contrast between coping and copying?

359
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Where's the contrast between the map enabling you to cope

360
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and the map representing the landscape?

361
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
There's no contrast at all, the map does both things

362
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and furthermore, common sense, human common sense, not anything transcendental.

363
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Nothing about standing on your own shoulders.

364
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Human common sense enables you to relate them.

365
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The map enables you to cope because it represents the lie of the land.

366
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
If it didn't represent the lie of the land, it would be a miracle that it's enabled you to cope.

367
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The map says the way it represents it is, again, given by minimalism.

368
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
There'll be cliffs at point X if and only if the map says that they're cliffs at point X.

369
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's what it is for it to be a good map.

370
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And you'll cope by expecting cliffs at point X better if you use the map

371
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
than if, for example, you form the belief that there are or are not cliffs there

372
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
in some random way.

373
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The map increases your chance of getting that sort of thing right.

374
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, those are very harmless platitudes about the representational properties of a map.

375
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But I think they can actually be generalized to the representational properties of language in general.

376
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What they do is tie the notion of representation to that of explanation,

377
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
partly to that of response, as in causal cases, but partly to that of representation.

378
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
My own favorite way, or it's only one way, I think, amongst many of cementing that relationship,

379
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,000
would be to give something like what Frank Ramsey, the great early 20th century Cambridge philosopher,

380
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
presented as a success semantics. That's a later title.

381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
He didn't call it success semantics.

382
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But the idea is that you can certify the representational power of a piece of vocabulary

383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
or a symbol on a map or anything else.

384
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If you can say that there's a convention or habit of acting upon it,

385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
either in a single person or in a society,

386
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and the explanation of the success of people who so act upon it is,

387
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and then you'd discote and point to whatever is represented.

388
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Let me give an example.

389
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Suppose the map has a little symbol of a church at a certain point on the map,

390
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and I say that symbol represents there being a church in little gidding, let's say, a village or something.

391
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The idea behind a success semantics is that the representational property of that symbol on the map

392
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
is, as it were certified, or perhaps it could be analyzed, if you like, analysis,

393
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
into the idea that people acting upon that representation,

394
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
people acting upon the fact of that symbol being at that place on that map,

395
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
are typically successful in their actions when they are,

396
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
because of something about the place of the church.

397
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That is, I go to the world and say that's why people who so act are successful.

398
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And that's what it is for the symbol on the map to express the place of the church.

399
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Now, I think such thoughts have a lot of steam in them and they've got a long way to go.

400
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You can tie them to adaptationist evolutionary explanations of the arrival of symbolism,

401
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
or you can keep them free of that, they don't have to be tied into a teliosemantics,

402
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
but they can fit in well with it.

403
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
My point this afternoon isn't to try and defend such a semantics,

404
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
but it actually has quite interesting repercussions for issues about debates

405
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
about normativity and the reality of moral properties,

406
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
but I'll leave those and go into them in the discussion period.

407
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
My point this afternoon isn't to defend such a view.

408
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
My point is to say that it's a perfectly naturalized, non-transcendental way

409
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
of trying to bring together the space of causes and the space of reasons.

410
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
We're just trying to see concepts and reasoning as integrated

411
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
with the idea of ourselves as embodied creatures,

412
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
whose essential way of being is acting in a physical space which surrounds us.

413
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And that, I think, is what a lot of postmodernism forgets.

414
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Davidson, I think, went wrong by wondering what justifies a belief.

415
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Now, first of all, he asked it as a very abstract question,

416
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
what justifies a belief?

417
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Then you get an answer, another belief or something like that.

418
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think that's as bad as Pilate's question, what is truth?

419
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
If you want to know what justifies a belief, the right answer is which belief?

420
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You tell me which belief you have, I'll tell you what I can about what would justify it

421
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
or what does justify it.

422
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What I tell you may not be sufficient, but then we'll have to argue it case by case.

423
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
There's no general solution to the question of what justifies a belief.

424
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And eventually, given the way we are, what justifies our beliefs is going to have to be,

425
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
have to relate to our embodiment in the world.

426
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
In saying that, incidentally, I find myself very close to some of the things

427
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
that John McDowell says in his book, Mind and World.

428
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's just that I think that the way that John works them out

429
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
is not actually correct in detail.

430
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So we're not going to agree with the great postmodernist slogan

431
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
made famous by Jacques Derrida in the Apadao text.

432
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
There is plenty outside the text.

433
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And I think learning that there's plenty outside the text

434
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
is actually a lesson we could have derived from Wittgenstein.

435
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I think if you remember Wittgenstein, the emphasis throughout the later philosophy

436
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
is on our activities in the world.

437
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And it's precisely our activities in the world,

438
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
which I think enable us to get away from the separation of mind from world,

439
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
which gave us the Rortian difficulties.

440
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So none of that makes epistemology a walkover.

441
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It doesn't enable us to turn the clock back to undo everything in cellars,

442
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
to undo everything in crime, to undo everything in Wittgenstein,

443
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to undo everything in Kuhn.

444
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It doesn't stop you, if you want to be paranoid,

445
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
from agreeing with the royal butler that there are dark forces at work

446
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
of which we know nothing.

447
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And of course often, especially in moral and social and political contexts,

448
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
that's not a bad thing to worry about.

449
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So I'm not being a Pollyanna here.

450
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm not more optimistic about what James called the human serpent

451
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
than I think it deserves.

452
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But what I am optimistic about is the possibility of a philosophy

453
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
which reintegrates truth and mind and world,

454
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and which enables us to take off the postmodernist inverted commas

455
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
so we can talk without blushing of truth, reality, objectivity, reason, experience.

456
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
We might even talk about foundations,

457
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
although that I think would be the topic for another talk.

458
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Well, thank you very much.
