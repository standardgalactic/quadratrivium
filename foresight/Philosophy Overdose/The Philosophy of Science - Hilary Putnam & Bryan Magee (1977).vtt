00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
The

00:13.760 --> 00:18.160
connection between philosophy and the mathematical sciences has always been

00:18.160 --> 00:23.200
very close. Plato had written over the door of his academy the words, let no

00:23.200 --> 00:28.240
one enter here who is ignorant of geometry. It was Aristotle who codified

00:28.240 --> 00:32.600
the basic sciences into the categories and gave them the names that we use to

00:32.600 --> 00:36.520
this day. Some of the greatest philosophers have been themselves great

00:36.520 --> 00:41.680
mathematicians who invented new branches of mathematics. Descartes is an obvious

00:41.680 --> 00:48.000
example and so is Leibniz and Pascal. In fact most of the great philosophers, not

00:48.000 --> 00:53.080
all but most, came to philosophy from mathematics or the sciences and this

00:53.080 --> 00:57.640
tendency has continued into our present century. Bertrand Russell was trained

00:57.640 --> 01:03.680
first as a mathematician. Wittgenstein was trained first as an engineer. The

01:03.680 --> 01:08.200
reason for this persisting connection is I think obvious and that is that the

01:08.200 --> 01:12.640
basic urge which has driven most of the greatest philosophers has been the urge

01:12.640 --> 01:17.560
to deepen our understanding of the world and of its structure and this is also

01:17.560 --> 01:23.240
what creative scientists are doing. For most of the past, too, people thought

01:23.240 --> 01:27.200
that mathematics was the most indubitable knowledge as well as being

01:27.200 --> 01:32.080
utterly precise and clear that human beings possessed. So there have always

01:32.080 --> 01:37.120
been plenty of philosophers examining mathematics to try and find out what was

01:37.120 --> 01:41.200
so special about it and whether this was something that could be applied to the

01:41.200 --> 01:46.520
acquisition of other sorts of knowledge. Ditto with the sciences which were also

01:46.520 --> 01:52.520
thought to yield a very specially safe and certain kind of knowledge. What was

01:52.520 --> 01:57.000
it about science that made its results so reliable? People asked themselves and

01:57.000 --> 02:01.800
could its methods, whatever these were, be used in other fields? These

02:01.800 --> 02:06.740
investigations into the concepts and methods and procedures and models that

02:06.740 --> 02:10.760
are involved in mathematics and in science have come to be known as the

02:10.760 --> 02:15.080
philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science and it's with

02:15.080 --> 02:18.980
these that we're going to be concerned in this program. Chiefly with the

02:18.980 --> 02:22.880
philosophy of science, though in fact we have someone taking part who is

02:22.880 --> 02:28.840
expert in both, Professor Hilary Putnam of Harvard University. Professor Putnam,

02:28.840 --> 02:32.720
I'd like to start our discussion from a standpoint which I think a very large

02:32.720 --> 02:39.140
number of our viewers occupy anyway and it's really this. Since the 17th century

02:39.140 --> 02:43.620
I suppose there's been a spectacular decline in religious belief especially

02:43.620 --> 02:48.740
in the West and especially among educated people and for millions the role

02:48.800 --> 02:53.660
that used to be taken in life by a world view based on religion has been

02:53.660 --> 02:59.180
increasingly supplanted by a world view based on science or at least purporting

02:59.180 --> 03:04.120
to be derived from science anyway and this is still enormously powerful in the

03:04.120 --> 03:07.980
whole that it has on people's minds throughout the West. Probably it affects

03:07.980 --> 03:12.200
all of us. So I think I'd like to start this discussion by getting you to pin

03:12.200 --> 03:17.780
down that scientific world outlook which is so influential in the modern world

03:17.940 --> 03:21.020
which will be underlying a lot of what we're going to have to talk about.

03:22.020 --> 03:27.700
Let me dodge the question a little bit by talking not about what scientists

03:27.740 --> 03:32.860
think now but what many scientists thought a hundred years ago or 75 years

03:32.860 --> 03:37.300
ago. Think of doing a crossword puzzle. You might have to change a few things as

03:37.300 --> 03:41.740
you go along but towards the end everything fits and things get added on

03:41.740 --> 03:46.500
one step at a time. That's the way the progress of science looked for 300 years

03:47.140 --> 03:53.940
in 1900 a famous mathematician David Hilbert gave a list of 50 mathematical

03:53.940 --> 03:58.140
problems to a world congress of mathematicians which are still very famous.

03:58.540 --> 04:02.260
It's very interesting that he included one problem which we would not call a

04:02.260 --> 04:06.980
mathematical problem very early in the list I think problem three which was to

04:06.980 --> 04:12.060
put the foundations of physics on a satisfactory basis. Just a small task

04:12.300 --> 04:17.460
and that was for mathematicians. Not for physicists, right. The idea is to tidy it

04:17.460 --> 04:25.700
up. That's right. The idea is Newton, Maxwell, Dalton and so on had all put in

04:25.700 --> 04:29.340
all the parts of the story and now it was just for mathematicians to basically

04:29.340 --> 04:33.860
clean up the logic as it were. I think in a conversation we had a couple of days

04:33.860 --> 04:38.220
ago you described this as a treasure chest view and I like that picture but

04:38.220 --> 04:42.340
here's this big chest that we're just filling up. It's an accumulation and you

04:42.340 --> 04:45.940
don't have to subtract, you don't have to take out. Occasionally you make a little

04:45.940 --> 04:49.900
mistake but basically the idea is or to shift the metaphor like building a

04:49.900 --> 04:53.140
pyramid. You put down the ground floor then the next floor then the next floor

04:53.140 --> 04:58.100
and it just goes up. That's part of it. This view of knowledge is growing by

04:58.100 --> 05:04.060
accumulation. The other part of it is the idea that the special success of the

05:04.060 --> 05:08.020
sciences and obviously what we're impressed by is success. This culture

05:08.020 --> 05:12.900
value of success and science is a successful institution but there's the

05:12.900 --> 05:18.620
idea that science owes its success to using a special method and that comes

05:18.620 --> 05:22.060
partly from the history of science from the fact that Newton for example lived

05:22.060 --> 05:27.020
after bacon and was influenced by bacon and the idea that empirical science has

05:27.020 --> 05:31.260
grown up together with something called inductive logic and this idea that is a

05:31.300 --> 05:35.900
method, the inductive method and that the sciences can be characterized by the

05:35.900 --> 05:39.900
fact that they use this method and use it explicitly and consciously as it were,

05:39.900 --> 05:43.580
not unconsciously as maybe someone who's learning cooking might be using it but

05:43.580 --> 05:48.340
pretty deliberately and explicitly. So I think that these two things, the idea of knowledge

05:48.340 --> 05:52.900
is growing by accumulation and growing by the use of a special method, the

05:52.900 --> 05:59.100
inductive method, are the key elements of the old view. Yes and if I were going to

05:59.100 --> 06:02.780
put the same thing, I suppose slightly differently, I think I'd say this that

06:02.780 --> 06:08.300
for two or three hundred years educated Western man thought of the universe and

06:08.300 --> 06:13.100
everything in it as consisting of matter in motion and that was all there was

06:13.100 --> 06:18.340
whether from the outermost galaxies of the stars into ourselves and our bodies

06:18.340 --> 06:22.820
and the cells of which we're made up and so on and that science was finding out

06:22.820 --> 06:28.780
more and more about this matter and its structure and its motion by a method

06:28.820 --> 06:32.740
which you just characterized as scientific method and the idea was that if we

06:32.740 --> 06:37.700
went on long enough we'd simply, as you said with your crossword puzzle metaphor,

06:37.700 --> 06:41.980
we'd find out everything there was to find out. We could eventually by

06:41.980 --> 06:48.020
scientific methods completely explain and understand the world. Now that has

06:48.020 --> 06:52.900
been abandoned by scientists, hasn't it? Though in fact this hasn't got

06:52.900 --> 06:56.140
through yet to the non-scientists. There are still large numbers of

06:56.180 --> 07:00.460
non-scientists who go on thinking that that's how scientists think but of

07:00.460 --> 07:04.300
course they no longer do that. I mean this has started a breakdown. I think it

07:04.300 --> 07:08.740
started to break down. I think it started to break down with Einstein. If I can

07:08.740 --> 07:15.140
drag in a bit of history of philosophy, screaming by the hair, Kant did

07:15.140 --> 07:20.060
something in philosophy which I think has begun to happen now in science. He

07:20.060 --> 07:24.460
challenged a certain view of truth. Before Kant, no philosopher really doubted

07:24.460 --> 07:27.700
that truth was simply correspondence to reality. I mean they're different words

07:27.700 --> 07:31.220
some philosophers spoke of agreement but the idea is a mirror theory of

07:31.220 --> 07:37.660
knowledge. Today I think, well Kant said it isn't so simple. There's a

07:37.660 --> 07:43.220
contribution of the thinking mind. Sure it isn't made up by the mind. Kant was

07:43.220 --> 07:47.140
no idealist. It is not a fiction. It isn't something we make up but it isn't

07:47.140 --> 07:52.780
just a copy either. What we call truth depends both on what there is on the way

07:52.780 --> 07:59.460
things are and on the contribution of the thinker, the mind. I think that today

07:59.460 --> 08:02.940
scientists have come to a somewhat similar view that since the beginning of

08:02.940 --> 08:07.820
the 20th century the idea that there's a human contribution, a mental

08:07.820 --> 08:13.100
contribution to what we call truth. The theories aren't simply dictated to us by

08:13.100 --> 08:17.700
the facts as it were. I'd like to ask you to unpack that a little because I think

08:17.700 --> 08:22.460
that some of our viewers will find this idea a little puzzling. How can it be?

08:22.460 --> 08:27.420
Some people will ask themselves that what is and is not true can depend not

08:27.420 --> 08:32.660
only on what the facts are but on the human mind. How can that be? Well let me

08:32.660 --> 08:37.580
use an analogy with vision. We tend to think that what we see just depends on

08:37.580 --> 08:41.860
what's out there but the more one studies vision either as a scientist or as a

08:41.860 --> 08:45.700
painter. One discovers that what's called vision involves an enormous amount of

08:45.700 --> 08:49.780
interpretation. The color we see as red is not the same color in terms of

08:49.780 --> 08:54.740
wavelengths at different times of the day. So even in what we think of as our

08:54.740 --> 09:00.740
simplest transaction with the world just looking at it, we are interpreting, you

09:00.740 --> 09:05.020
know. In other words we bring a whole number of things to the world that we're

09:05.020 --> 09:09.020
not directly conscious of usually unless we turn inwards and start examining

09:09.020 --> 09:12.620
them. That's right. I think the world must have looked different in the Middle

09:12.620 --> 09:17.900
Ages to someone who looked up and thought of the stars as up and us at the

09:17.900 --> 09:22.220
bottom for example. Today when we look out into space I think we have a

09:22.220 --> 09:26.700
different experience than somebody with the medieval worldview. And what you're

09:26.700 --> 09:30.860
saying is that the very categories in which we see the world and interpret

09:30.860 --> 09:36.060
our experience and the the ideas within which we organize our observations and

09:36.060 --> 09:40.820
the facts around us and so on are provided by us so that the world as

09:40.820 --> 09:45.460
conceived by science is partly contributed by external facts but also

09:45.540 --> 09:50.420
partly contributed by categories and ways of seeing things which come from

09:50.420 --> 09:56.220
the human observer. That's right. And an example of that in science I'll

09:56.220 --> 10:00.980
oversimplify but it's not basically falsified is this wave particle business.

10:00.980 --> 10:06.300
It's not that there's something an electron which is some half a wave and

10:06.300 --> 10:09.300
half a particle that would be meaningless but that there are many

10:09.300 --> 10:14.580
experiments which can be described two ways. You can either think of the electron

10:14.660 --> 10:18.300
as a wave or you can think of it as a particle and both descriptions are in

10:18.300 --> 10:23.460
some crazy way true and adequate. Alternative ways of describing the same

10:23.460 --> 10:27.180
facts and both descriptions are accurate. That's right. Philosophies have

10:27.180 --> 10:30.420
started talking of equivalent descriptions. There's a term used in

10:30.420 --> 10:36.780
philosophy of science. Now for a couple of hundred years after Newton educated

10:36.780 --> 10:40.860
Western man thought that what Newton had produced was objective fact that he had

10:40.860 --> 10:45.460
discovered laws which governed the workings of the world and the workings

10:45.460 --> 10:49.540
of the universe and this was just objectively true independently of us

10:49.540 --> 10:54.580
that Newton and other scientists had read these facts off of nature by

10:54.580 --> 10:59.700
observing it and looking at it and so on and these statements which made up

10:59.700 --> 11:04.380
science was simply true. Now there came didn't there a period in the development

11:04.380 --> 11:08.220
of science and beginning in the late 19th century when people began to

11:08.260 --> 11:12.940
realise that these statements were not entirely true that this wasn't just a

11:12.940 --> 11:17.060
body of objective fact which had been read off from the world in other words

11:17.060 --> 11:23.020
that science was courageable scientific theories could be wrong and that raises

11:23.020 --> 11:27.860
some very profound questions. I mean if science isn't just an objectively true

11:27.860 --> 11:32.740
description of the way things are what is it and if we don't get it from

11:32.740 --> 11:37.500
observing the world where do we get it from? Well I don't want to say we don't

11:37.500 --> 11:44.900
get it from observing the world at all obviously part of this Kantian image is

11:44.900 --> 11:50.140
that there is a contribution which is not us there's something out there but

11:50.140 --> 11:54.460
that also there's a contribution from us and even Kant by the way thought that

11:54.460 --> 11:58.060
Newtonian science was indubitable that he thought we contributed its

11:58.060 --> 12:04.020
indubitability. The step beyond Kant is the idea that not only is reality

12:04.060 --> 12:08.980
partly mind-dependent but that there are alternatives and that the concepts we

12:08.980 --> 12:12.540
impose on the world may not be the right ones and we may have to change them

12:12.540 --> 12:16.580
that there's an interaction between what we contribute and what we find out.

12:16.580 --> 12:22.380
Now what was it that made people begin to realise that this basic

12:22.380 --> 12:27.580
conception of science as objective truth was wrong that science was

12:27.620 --> 12:34.700
courageable, that science was fammable? I think it's that the older science turned

12:34.700 --> 12:40.700
out to be wrong where no one expected it to be wrong not in detail but in the big

12:40.700 --> 12:46.100
picture. It's not that we find out that say the Sun isn't 93 million miles from

12:46.100 --> 12:50.060
the earth but only 20 million miles from the earth that's not going to happen.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.820
I mean sometimes it makes blunders even about things like that but that's like

12:53.860 --> 12:57.980
making a blunder about whether there's a chair in the room, wholesale

12:57.980 --> 13:03.180
skepticism about whether numerical values are right in science would be as

13:03.180 --> 13:08.660
unjustified as wholesale skepticism about anything but where the newer theories

13:08.660 --> 13:13.420
don't agree with Newton it's not over the approximate truths of the

13:13.420 --> 13:17.100
mathematical expressions in Newton's theory those are still perfectly good

13:17.100 --> 13:21.940
for calculation. It's over the big picture we've replaced the picture of an

13:21.940 --> 13:25.620
absolute space and an absolute time by the picture of a four-dimensional space

13:25.620 --> 13:29.820
time we replaced the picture of a Euclidean world by a picture of a

13:29.820 --> 13:34.500
world which obeys a geometry Euclid never dreamed of we've replaced we've

13:34.500 --> 13:38.620
swung back to the picture of the world as having a beginning in time which is

13:38.620 --> 13:43.300
really a shocker it's not even the things once refuted stay refuted forever.

13:43.300 --> 13:48.460
Yes so it means really that a whole conception of science has been superseded

13:48.500 --> 13:53.300
instead of thinking of science as a body of knowledge which is being added to all

13:53.300 --> 13:58.300
the time by further scientific work that whole conception of science has been

13:58.300 --> 14:02.500
dispensed with really hasn't it and we now think of it as a set of theories

14:02.500 --> 14:07.140
which are themselves constantly being replaced by better theories by more

14:07.140 --> 14:11.420
accurate theories by richer more explanatory theories and even the

14:11.420 --> 14:15.900
theories we now have like those of Einstein and his successors will

14:15.940 --> 14:20.780
probably be replaced in the course of time by other better theories by

14:20.780 --> 14:25.140
scientists yet unknown isn't that so? That's exactly right in fact scientists

14:25.140 --> 14:29.780
themselves make this prediction that is that the the main theories of the 20th

14:29.780 --> 14:34.220
century relativity and quantum mechanics will give way to some other theory

14:34.220 --> 14:38.780
which will interpret both of them and so on forever. Now this raises a very

14:38.780 --> 14:42.980
fundamental question namely the question what is truth I mean when we say that

14:43.020 --> 14:47.060
this or that scientific statement is true or this or that scientific theory is

14:47.060 --> 14:52.060
true what in these newly understood circumstances of ours can we mean by

14:52.060 --> 14:58.540
truth? There are still two views as there have been since Kant one is this

14:58.540 --> 15:02.540
old correspondence view still has its adherence but I think the view that's

15:02.540 --> 15:07.620
coming in more and more is that one cannot make it a total separation between

15:07.620 --> 15:12.540
what's true and what our standards of assertibility are that the way in which

15:12.580 --> 15:16.180
the what I called using the Kantian picture the mind dependence of truth

15:16.180 --> 15:20.780
comes in is the fact that what's true and what's false is in part a function of

15:20.780 --> 15:24.980
what our standards of truth and falsity are and that depends on our interests

15:24.980 --> 15:31.220
and which again change over time of course. That's right. I'd like you to

15:31.220 --> 15:34.460
say a little more about this question of truth because this again I think is

15:34.460 --> 15:38.100
puzzling to the layman I think that people who are not trained in science

15:38.140 --> 15:42.820
or philosophy are apt to think that there are a certain set of facts and a true

15:42.820 --> 15:47.180
statement is a statement that accurately describes those facts I'd like you to

15:47.180 --> 15:50.100
talk a little about some of the difficulties that are actually involved

15:50.100 --> 15:58.900
in this. I think the the biggest difficulty in science itself comes from

15:58.900 --> 16:03.220
the fact that even within one scientific theory you often find different

16:03.220 --> 16:06.940
accounts can be given of so-called facts this came in with the special theory

16:06.980 --> 16:10.780
of relativity when it turned in turned out that facts about simultaneity

16:10.780 --> 16:14.380
when the two things happen at the same time could be described differently by

16:14.380 --> 16:18.340
different observers one could say Boy Scout A fired a starter's pistol before

16:18.340 --> 16:22.780
Boy Scout B the other could say no Boy Scout B fired a starter's pistol before

16:22.780 --> 16:27.180
Boy Scout A and if the distance is sufficiently large so that a light

16:27.180 --> 16:30.780
signal can't travel from one to the other without exceeding the speed of light

16:31.260 --> 16:36.100
then it may be both descriptions are correct both are admissible. Of course

16:36.980 --> 16:42.060
this leads to I mean profound conceptual difficulties in understanding some

16:42.060 --> 16:46.180
modern scientific theories and this prompts the thought that a scientific

16:46.180 --> 16:51.260
theory can be useful and meaningful and can work even if nobody really quite

16:51.260 --> 16:54.780
understands what it means this is the case with quantum mechanics isn't it

16:54.780 --> 16:59.940
I mean nobody is really sure what quantum mechanics actually means and yet it

16:59.940 --> 17:03.900
works. That's right and again there I want to say one shouldn't push that too

17:03.940 --> 17:08.700
far because I think we don't want to give up our standards of intelligibility

17:08.700 --> 17:12.580
altogether we want to say quantum mechanics works and the very fact that

17:12.580 --> 17:16.860
it works means that there's something fundamentally right about it and with

17:16.860 --> 17:20.220
respect to its intelligibility we're willing to say in part that may be that

17:20.220 --> 17:23.620
we have the wrong standards of intelligibility that we have to change

17:23.620 --> 17:27.860
our intuitions but in part there are real paradoxes in the theory and I think

17:27.860 --> 17:32.380
that more work has to be done to really get a satisfactory resolution of these

17:32.420 --> 17:37.700
paradoxes. Things are very ticklish now. Yes I think somebody hearing our

17:37.700 --> 17:41.620
discussion and to whom perhaps some of these ideas are new might find himself

17:41.620 --> 17:46.980
thinking well if all this is so how is it that science works if traditional

17:46.980 --> 17:51.460
scientific theories are breaking down if science is turning out not to be a body

17:51.460 --> 17:57.620
of reliable permanent firm objective knowledge if a significant proportion of

17:57.620 --> 18:01.300
every scientific theory is subjective anyway in the sense that it's

18:01.340 --> 18:06.380
contributed by the human mind by the observer by the scientist how is it in

18:06.380 --> 18:11.260
these circumstances that we can actually build bridges fly airplanes make rockets

18:11.260 --> 18:16.380
go to the moon and actually make all this soft fuzzy changing partly

18:16.380 --> 18:22.060
subjective body of theory work for us it must fit the world in some very basic

18:22.060 --> 18:27.020
way in spite of everything that we've been saying. That's true but I think the

18:27.020 --> 18:30.580
contrast between being subjective and fitting the world isn't altogether

18:30.620 --> 18:34.220
right. I'm not saying that scientific knowledge is subjective or that anything

18:34.220 --> 18:38.620
goes and say when the difficult position that we often are in in life of

18:38.620 --> 18:42.020
thinking there is a difference we good and bad reasoning but we don't have a

18:42.020 --> 18:47.260
mechanical rule. In everyday life we use interest loaded terms we wouldn't say

18:47.260 --> 18:50.820
that there's a policeman on the corner if we didn't have a whole network of

18:50.820 --> 18:55.020
social institutions somebody coming from a primitive tribe which didn't have

18:55.020 --> 18:58.820
policemen might say there's a man in blue on the corner but the fact that the

18:58.860 --> 19:02.580
notion of a policeman is shaped by our interest doesn't mean that it can't be

19:02.580 --> 19:07.100
objectively true that there's a policeman on the corner. Also I think

19:07.100 --> 19:11.580
science works precisely because of this corrigibility in large part as Professor

19:11.580 --> 19:15.660
Poppers pointed out the difference between science and previous ways of

19:15.660 --> 19:19.860
trying to find out truth is in large part that scientists are willing to test

19:19.860 --> 19:23.860
their ideas because they don't regard them as infallible in a way that was

19:23.860 --> 19:27.460
known at the beginning and then in the success of Newtonian science somewhat

19:27.460 --> 19:31.700
forgotten and we've had to be reminded again of what Bacon knew that you have

19:31.700 --> 19:34.820
to put questions to nature and be willing to change your ideas if they

19:34.820 --> 19:39.620
don't work. In some respects the traditional opposition between science

19:39.620 --> 19:44.820
and religion has the two parties of cross places haven't they I mean many

19:44.820 --> 19:48.780
religious people now believe they have certain knowledge about the world that

19:48.780 --> 19:53.460
it was created by a god that he made us in his own image gave us immortal souls

19:53.620 --> 19:58.140
which will survive our death and so on certain very fundamental propositions

19:58.140 --> 20:02.980
which they hold with absolute certainty and it's the scientist who believes

20:02.980 --> 20:07.380
that everything is fallible that the world is a mysterious place that we'll

20:07.380 --> 20:10.860
never get to the end of the mystery of and so on and so forth isn't there

20:10.860 --> 20:17.780
something in that? It may be. You say it may be. I'm not sure. Well let's not pursue

20:17.780 --> 20:23.100
that but one point I do want to take up with you leaving even religion aside is

20:23.100 --> 20:27.180
that now that science is seen in this entirely different way that you've been

20:27.180 --> 20:31.500
describing by virtually all scientists doesn't it mean that the difference

20:31.500 --> 20:37.820
between science and non-science isn't what it was always thought of as being in

20:37.820 --> 20:43.060
other words since science is so subjective indefinite changing and so on

20:43.060 --> 20:48.060
it's no longer a clearly cut and different kind of human activity or

20:48.060 --> 20:52.020
kind of human knowledge from other sorts of human knowledge and other sorts of

20:52.060 --> 20:57.380
human activity. I think that's both true and culturally very important. I think

20:57.380 --> 21:03.460
the harm that the old picture of science does is that if there is this realm of

21:03.460 --> 21:08.540
absolute fact that scientists are gradually accumulating then everything

21:08.540 --> 21:12.460
else appears somehow as non-knowledge something to which even words like true

21:12.460 --> 21:18.740
and false can't properly apply. I think that the so-called fact value dichotomy

21:18.780 --> 21:23.860
is a very good example of this. It's hard to have a discussion on politics for

21:23.860 --> 21:28.700
example without someone very quickly saying at least in my country is that a

21:28.700 --> 21:32.820
fact or a value judgment as though it can't be a fact that Hitler was a bad

21:32.820 --> 21:38.140
man for example or a fact that Farrah Fawcett Major is a beautiful woman. And do

21:38.140 --> 21:45.340
you think that it is a fact that Hitler was a bad man? Oh yes I do. I do too. But then if

21:45.380 --> 21:50.860
this is so if we are abandoning so many of these comfortable clear-cut

21:50.860 --> 21:54.580
distinctions of the past what's the point of continuing to use the category or

21:54.580 --> 22:00.700
the notion or the term science anyway? I mean does it any longer clearly demarcate

22:00.700 --> 22:06.140
something differentiable from everything else? I don't think it does. I think that

22:06.140 --> 22:10.940
you know if you're going to distinguish science from non-science that makes a

22:10.940 --> 22:14.940
lot of sense if you still have this old view that there's this inductive method

22:15.340 --> 22:19.500
what makes something science is that it uses it and uses it pretty consciously and

22:19.500 --> 22:23.500
pretty deliberately and that what makes something known science is either it

22:23.500 --> 22:26.620
uses it entirely unconsciously as in learning how to cook you're not

22:26.620 --> 22:31.020
consciously thinking about inductive logic or perhaps does use it at all as

22:31.020 --> 22:36.060
metaphysics was alleged not to use it at all I think unfairly. But once you say

22:36.060 --> 22:41.420
but both say that there's a sharp line between say practical knowledge and

22:41.420 --> 22:47.340
science and to say that the method which is supposed to draw this line is rather

22:47.340 --> 22:52.460
fuzzy something that we can't state exactly and attempts to state it by the

22:52.460 --> 22:58.380
way have been very much a failure still inductive logic cannot be say programmed

22:58.380 --> 23:02.700
on a computer the way deductive logic can be programmed on a computer. I think

23:02.700 --> 23:06.140
the development of deductive logic in the last hundred years and the development

23:06.140 --> 23:11.100
of the computer have really brought home very dramatically just what a different

23:11.180 --> 23:16.460
state we are in with respect to proof in the mathematical sciences which we can

23:16.460 --> 23:22.300
state rigorous canons for and proof in what used to be called the inductive sciences

23:22.300 --> 23:27.500
where we can state general maxims but you really have to use intuition general know how

23:28.460 --> 23:37.020
and so on in applying them. One of the two categories that you described the old

23:37.020 --> 23:40.860
fashioned we're looking at science in terms of was that there was a particular

23:40.860 --> 23:47.020
scientific method if you observed the facts and on the basis of these observed instances

23:47.020 --> 23:52.540
you generalized to form scientific theories which you then verified by experiment and so

23:52.540 --> 23:58.140
that was the old view wasn't it now that that has been abandoned is there any longer any single

23:58.140 --> 24:03.260
method which is thought of as being scientific method. I don't think there should be people

24:03.740 --> 24:08.780
talk of scientific method as a sort of fiction but I think that even in physics where you do get

24:10.380 --> 24:15.740
experiments and tests which pretty much fit the textbooks there's a great deal that does and

24:15.740 --> 24:20.780
then a great deal that shouldn't and I think in fact in the culture I don't really believe

24:20.780 --> 24:25.580
there's an agreement on what's a science so what is it any university will tell you in its catalog

24:25.580 --> 24:29.980
that there are things called social sciences not sociology of the science so that economics is

24:29.980 --> 24:35.420
a science I bet if you ask anyone in the physics department whether sociology is a science you'll

24:35.420 --> 24:41.980
say no and why will he say no that's interesting I think the real reason is not that the sociologists

24:41.980 --> 24:47.420
don't use the inductive method they probably use it more conscientiously poor things than the

24:47.420 --> 24:51.660
physicists do I think it's because they're not as successful so in other words science has become

24:51.660 --> 24:57.340
almost a name for successful pursuit of knowledge that's right yeah yeah well now I think you've

24:57.340 --> 25:03.100
given a very very good description of the way in which this age-old view of what science was has

25:03.100 --> 25:08.300
broken down in our century and been replaced by something much more fluid and perhaps much more

25:08.300 --> 25:13.500
difficult to get hold of but you have I think described it very clearly can we now come against

25:13.500 --> 25:19.340
this background to what philosophers of science are actually doing you are a philosopher of science

25:19.340 --> 25:26.140
what do you and your colleagues do well part of what we do which I won't try to describe on this

25:26.140 --> 25:32.140
broadcast is fairly technical investigation of specific scientific theories we look at quantum

25:32.140 --> 25:38.940
mechanics very closely we look at both to learn what lessons we can for it from it for philosophy

25:38.940 --> 25:44.140
and to see what contributions we can make as philosophers to clarifying its foundations we

25:44.140 --> 25:49.580
look at relativity theory very closely we look at Darwinian evolution very closely and so on

25:49.580 --> 25:54.460
this is the part of philosophy of science that provides the data for the rest but much philosophy

25:54.460 --> 26:00.300
of science is leads shades over into general philosophy and I think it's the best way to

26:00.300 --> 26:04.460
describe it is in terms of what we've been talking about that is each of the issues we've been talking

26:04.460 --> 26:09.660
about divides philosophers of science the issue there are philosophers of science who have a

26:09.660 --> 26:15.340
correspondence view of truth and try to show this can be made precise the answers can the objections

26:15.340 --> 26:21.100
can be overcome you can still view science somehow in the old way and there are others who try to

26:21.180 --> 26:26.700
sketch what another view of truth would come to there are philosophers who still think there is

26:26.700 --> 26:31.580
an inductive method that can be rigorously stated and who work on inductive logic and by the way

26:31.580 --> 26:36.220
I think it's important that there should be because we won't make progress to trying to state the

26:36.220 --> 26:41.500
inductive method if there aren't and that there are others who view the development of science

26:41.500 --> 26:47.260
more culturally more historically and that people like myself who have a sort of in-between

26:47.260 --> 26:52.620
position that there's something to the notion of a scientific method there are clear examples

26:52.620 --> 26:56.620
but that it's more or less a continuum that you you mustn't think of it as a kind of

26:57.180 --> 27:03.100
mechanical rule an algorithm that you can apply to get scientific knowledge so that I'd say each

27:03.100 --> 27:08.460
of these issues the nature of truth the nature of the scientific method whether there's any

27:08.460 --> 27:13.740
necessary truth in science anything conceptual contribution which is permanent and can't be

27:13.740 --> 27:19.260
subject to revision is a big question and who are you plural doing all this work for

27:20.940 --> 27:28.140
I asked that I don't ask that in an irreverent way but what I have in mind is this I've myself

27:28.140 --> 27:33.500
taken part in attempts to bring scientists and philosophers together for discussions of precisely

27:33.500 --> 27:38.940
the issues that you've raised and these attempts have usually failed and failed for the same reason

27:38.940 --> 27:44.060
namely that the scientists lose interest they go back to their laboratories and get on with doing

27:44.060 --> 27:49.900
more science and the great bulk of working scientists it seems to me don't in fact take very

27:49.900 --> 27:54.540
much of an interest in the issues that you've been talking about I think it's conspicuous that

27:54.540 --> 27:59.900
the greatest of all scientists are exceptions I mean they they're really blockbusting the path

27:59.900 --> 28:03.900
breaking scientists who've actually made the revolution in this century that you've been

28:03.900 --> 28:12.540
talking about people like Einstein, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Max Bohr, Schrödinger, De Broglie,

28:12.540 --> 28:17.980
these people were enormously interested in the conceptual questions that you've raised but these

28:17.980 --> 28:23.580
were the the pioneering geniuses and the great mass of thousands of scientists who follow on

28:23.580 --> 28:29.900
behind them and put their work to its practical application they don't seem to care so who is

28:29.900 --> 28:34.620
listening to you who is reading the stuff that you publish well I'd say first of all I think we

28:34.620 --> 28:39.420
are basically writing for the philosophically interested layman for the reader of philosophy

28:40.060 --> 28:44.780
I don't view philosophy of science as giving direct advice to scientists just as I think

28:44.780 --> 28:49.180
moral philosophers are ill advised to think that they're giving at least immediately

28:49.180 --> 28:55.580
current contemporary advice on how to live your life or what bills to pass in parliament on the

28:55.580 --> 28:59.820
other hand I do think that scientists tend to know the philosophy of science of 50 years ago

29:00.460 --> 29:05.660
and perhaps this is the bad thing that it's perhaps this time lag this culture lag has some

29:05.660 --> 29:11.420
value in weeding out what they shouldn't pay attention to I mean it's a novel philosopher

29:11.420 --> 29:15.900
to encounter a scientist who's both sure that he didn't listen to any philosophy of science

29:15.900 --> 29:21.900
and then who produces verbatim ideas which you can recognize is coming from what was popular in 1928

29:21.900 --> 29:25.740
and is there a direct parallel here between what you're saying about scientists and

29:25.740 --> 29:30.620
Cain the the economist Cain's is famous remark that nearly all businessmen who thought that they

29:30.620 --> 29:35.900
were indifferent to airy-fairy economic theory were in fact the slaves of the economic theorists of

29:35.900 --> 29:41.740
yesterday of a previous generation that's exactly true I suppose another parallel one could make

29:41.740 --> 29:46.940
would be to say that the account that ordinary language users give of language and their use

29:46.940 --> 29:51.740
of language would be extremely unsophisticated simply because they take it for granted and

29:51.740 --> 29:56.780
have never thought about it that too would probably apply to the account that most scientists would

29:56.780 --> 30:01.340
give of what they were doing when they were doing their science that's right that is it's a mistake

30:01.340 --> 30:08.460
to think that merely because when practices an activity one can give a theory of it one criticism

30:08.460 --> 30:13.100
that's often been made about philosophers of science is that although they talk of science in

30:13.100 --> 30:19.180
this general way what they're nearly always referring to in fact is is one science namely physics

30:19.180 --> 30:24.060
now it's true isn't it that the science in which the most exciting developments have probably taken

30:24.060 --> 30:30.780
place in the last 20 years anyway has been not physics but biology our philosophers of science

30:30.780 --> 30:36.380
open genuinely to the criticism of being too physics-based in their view of science and having

30:36.460 --> 30:43.740
ignored biology too much I think I would defend us against that on the grounds that I don't although

30:43.740 --> 30:50.060
the theories in biology are of great scientific importance Darwin's theory of evolution Crick

30:50.060 --> 30:57.020
Watson on DNA and so on they don't by and large pose big methodological problems of a kind that

30:57.020 --> 31:03.340
don't arise in physical science I'm not sure that you're going to agree with that well I mean

31:04.220 --> 31:09.340
you mentioned the word evolution just now and it seems to me that here is a concept

31:09.980 --> 31:15.500
which originated in one of the sciences namely biology and which over a comparatively short

31:15.500 --> 31:20.620
period of time has spread throughout the whole of our culture so that the way almost everybody

31:20.620 --> 31:27.260
thinks is influenced by the notion of evolution not only about the origins of man but about

31:27.260 --> 31:32.620
institutions or the arts all kinds of other things I mean evolution has become a dimension

31:32.620 --> 31:38.300
of western man's thinking about almost anything is that not so that's right and perhaps there has

31:38.300 --> 31:44.460
not been enough attention to this theory though what strikes me as interesting is that the possibility

31:44.460 --> 31:51.740
of explanations of what we think of as the biological kind explanations in terms of function

31:51.740 --> 31:58.940
rather than in terms of the building physics and chemistry what you're made of have come under

31:58.940 --> 32:04.300
more attention recently as a result of computer science now this this is very this does raise

32:04.300 --> 32:09.260
something I'm particularly interested in when you talk of computer science and that is the

32:09.260 --> 32:15.180
interaction between our technology in the case of computers and philosophy not just science and

32:15.180 --> 32:20.060
philosophy but technology and philosophy I mean computers were originally constructed on the

32:20.060 --> 32:25.420
basis of a self-conscious analogy with the human mind weren't they but as they became more and more

32:25.420 --> 32:32.540
sophisticated we began to learn things from them about the human mind so our construction of computers

32:32.540 --> 32:39.500
and what they then tell us about ourselves seems to actually proceed by interactive growth isn't

32:39.500 --> 32:45.340
that so that's right and today the this is one area by the way in which philosophers are in close

32:45.340 --> 32:50.940
contact with scientists that is the fields of linguistics cognitive psychology computer science

32:50.940 --> 32:57.020
philosophy of language today interact constantly people send papers to one another not because

32:57.020 --> 33:01.420
someone tells them to there are conferences at which specialists in these field meet together again

33:01.420 --> 33:07.020
not because someone decided there should be some cross fertilization the interesting thing about

33:07.020 --> 33:12.460
the computer case if I can stick with it for a moment is one might have thought that the computer

33:12.460 --> 33:18.460
the rise of the computer would encourage a certain kind of vulgar materialism the idea so after all

33:18.460 --> 33:24.860
we are machines so after all everything about us can be explained in terms of physics and chemistry

33:25.500 --> 33:31.740
paradoxically the real effect of the computer on psychology and on philosophy of mind has been a

33:31.740 --> 33:38.380
decrease in that kind of reductionism see the thing about the computer is that when you work

33:38.380 --> 33:43.740
with computers you very rarely have to think about their physics and chemistry there's a

33:43.740 --> 33:48.380
distinction that people draw between their software meaning their program their instructions

33:48.380 --> 33:54.220
their rules the way they do things and their hardware and generally you ignore their hardware

33:54.220 --> 33:59.260
you talk about computers at the software level and you wouldn't really be able to explain

33:59.980 --> 34:05.100
what they do in a way that would be of any use to anyone in terms of the hardware level you

34:06.140 --> 34:10.300
there is a kind of emergence here although it's not a mystical kind of emergence it's not that

34:10.300 --> 34:18.060
they're violating the laws of physics it's just that the the level of work at higher level facts

34:18.060 --> 34:23.980
about organization have a kind of autonomy you'd say this the fact that's following this program

34:23.980 --> 34:29.340
explains why it does this and I don't need to know how it's built I only need to know it can be built

34:29.340 --> 34:36.060
in such a way that it will follow this program this is a return to a view and if you apply this to

34:36.060 --> 34:41.020
the mind it suggests a return to a view of the mind that I associate with Aristotle there's the

34:41.020 --> 34:50.460
view that we are not ghosts in a machine not spirits which only temporarily embodies but that

34:50.460 --> 34:55.580
the relation between the mind and the body is a relation of function to what has that function

34:56.220 --> 35:00.060
Aristotle said if you use the word soul in connection with an ax and of course he said you

35:00.060 --> 35:05.500
don't you'd say the soul of an ax is cutting and he said the soul of the eye is seeing and he thought

35:05.500 --> 35:13.020
of man as a thing that thinks you're talking now of the alternative to materialism and

35:14.220 --> 35:18.860
say a religious view that this gives us puts me in mind instantly of the most significant of all

35:18.860 --> 35:23.500
the materialist philosophers in the modern world namely Marxism which after all is the

35:23.500 --> 35:29.020
official state philosophy of about a third of mankind as we sit here discussing this

35:29.660 --> 35:34.780
it Marxism claims to be scientific and this is a very important thing about it

35:34.780 --> 35:40.700
is there a significant Marxist contribution to the philosophy of science I don't think there's

35:40.700 --> 35:47.580
a significant Marxist contribution but I don't think that the Marxists were all wrong either

35:48.220 --> 35:54.220
I think Engels was one of the most scientifically learned men of his century he had a he got a

35:54.220 --> 35:59.820
number of things wrong but he had an immense general scientific knowledge and anti-during his

35:59.820 --> 36:05.980
big book on philosophy of science although it contains some rather strange ideas some of which

36:05.980 --> 36:12.060
he gets from Hegel by the way is on the whole a sensible book on philosophy of science among

36:12.060 --> 36:17.260
other things on the other hand it's not specifically Marxist I'd say that Engels views in philosophy

36:17.260 --> 36:24.540
of science are in large part influenced by the standard philosophy of science of the time they're

36:24.540 --> 36:31.180
fairly sophisticated inductive account and what about subsequent Marxist thinkers who also had

36:31.180 --> 36:35.740
some pretension to be philosophers like Lenin for example well I think they're uneven Lenin I think

36:35.740 --> 36:41.020
is on the whole one of the worst he says for example the theories are copies of motion I mean

36:41.020 --> 36:45.900
there you have the copy theory of science just copying off the reality in its crudest view

36:46.620 --> 36:51.340
Mao is more sophisticated and Mao is very influenced by John Dewey who was widely read in

36:51.340 --> 36:57.500
China in the 1920s do you think it's actually made a contribution to the subject as it is today or

36:57.500 --> 37:04.620
not really I think that it anticipated it perhaps might have made a contribution if

37:06.460 --> 37:11.820
people had been less ideologically divided because I think non-Marxists could have learned the Marxists

37:11.820 --> 37:19.580
were among the first people to try to somehow combine a realist view with the with a stress on

37:19.580 --> 37:24.700
practice with a stress on corrigibility and they were very hostile to the notion of a priori truth

37:24.700 --> 37:30.380
and today many mainline philosophers of science are very hostile to a priori truth as it is they

37:30.380 --> 37:34.700
play somewhat the role in philosophy of science I think that Cain said they play in economics he

37:34.700 --> 37:40.700
described Marx as one of his sort of underground predecessors yes yes when I was introducing

37:40.700 --> 37:45.660
this program I mentioned not only the philosophy of science but also the philosophy of mathematics

37:45.660 --> 37:53.020
and before we close I would like like us to say something about that anyway I suppose one can

37:53.020 --> 37:57.500
really say that the central problem in the philosophy of mathematics is a direct parallel

37:57.500 --> 38:03.740
to the central problem in the philosophy of science namely how does it fit the world with science it's

38:03.740 --> 38:10.140
how does science fit the world in mathematics it's how does mathematics fit the world is that right

38:10.140 --> 38:17.260
that's right and it's even worse because if you're trying to defend a copy view a correspondence

38:17.260 --> 38:22.380
view of truth and empirical science you can answer the question well how do we build up this picture

38:22.380 --> 38:27.340
in such a way that corresponds by saying we have sense organs as I mentioned before that's not a

38:27.340 --> 38:31.900
total answer because there's a tremendous amount of interpretation involved in simple seeing and

38:31.900 --> 38:38.300
simple hearing but if you are talking about numbers and sets and somebody says okay if

38:38.300 --> 38:43.740
mathematical knowledge is simply some kind of a copy of the way numbers are and the way sets are

38:43.740 --> 38:51.100
and the way other abstract objects that mathematician study are the question then what sense enables us

38:51.100 --> 38:57.260
to see how they are because what is a number what yes yes a deeply problematic question but

38:57.260 --> 39:01.020
still an important one that's right and on the other hand I don't want to say that the anti

39:01.020 --> 39:07.020
correspondence view has it very easy either it seems to me that mathematical knowledge is a real

39:07.020 --> 39:11.020
puzzle and I think that philosophers should concentrate more on philosophy of mathematics

39:11.020 --> 39:16.220
than they do now because it seems to be an area where no theory works very well isn't there another

39:16.220 --> 39:23.260
very important parallel between mathematics and science I mean throughout the history of science

39:23.260 --> 39:29.260
one of the conflicts has been between one camp who thought that it was all about objects in the

39:29.260 --> 39:35.580
world which existed independent of human experience and another camp which thought no it's human beings

39:35.580 --> 39:41.260
and observers who actually contribute most of this and as you pointed out much earlier our discussion

39:41.260 --> 39:47.820
the truth is almost certainly a combination of both there is a long-standing dispute in mathematics

39:47.820 --> 39:52.380
isn't there between one body of people who think that mathematical knowledge is something that so

39:52.380 --> 39:57.980
to speak inherent in the structure of the world and we derive it from the world by experience

39:57.980 --> 40:03.980
and observation and another body of mathematical thought that says no no no mathematics is a

40:03.980 --> 40:10.780
creation of the human mind which we then tries to try to impose on reality like a grid as it were

40:10.780 --> 40:16.780
on a landscape isn't that so that's right the latter story is attractive because of the sense

40:16.780 --> 40:22.700
organ problem but it doesn't seem to work either because it it seems that we're not free to impose

40:22.700 --> 40:27.740
any mathematics or any logic we want almost anyone would admit that at least you have to be

40:27.740 --> 40:33.580
consistent and what's consistent what isn't isn't somehow something we can just make up or decide

40:34.140 --> 40:39.740
as when we try to stress conventionalist accounts subjective accounts we come up against the

40:39.740 --> 40:44.700
objectivity of mathematics we try to stress the objectivity of mathematics we come up against

40:44.700 --> 40:50.060
another set of problems I think we can learn a lot more than we now know about human knowledge

40:50.060 --> 40:57.260
and about scientific knowledge by going further into this area talking of of where we're going from

40:57.260 --> 41:00.540
where we are so to speak I think the most interesting way in which you could end this

41:00.540 --> 41:05.660
discussion Professor Putnam would be by talking about what you regard as the most interesting

41:05.660 --> 41:10.460
problem areas of the moment and therefore I take it the most likely growth areas for the

41:10.460 --> 41:15.580
immediate future in both of the subjects we've been discussing philosophy of science and philosophy

41:15.580 --> 41:21.420
of mathematics okay I think that if I'm allowed to confine my prediction of the immediate future

41:21.420 --> 41:26.220
because we know that long-run predictions are always false but in the immediate future I would

41:26.220 --> 41:31.260
expect philosophy of mathematics to be a growth area and philosophy of logic I would expect

41:31.260 --> 41:36.860
philosophy of physics I think to decline somewhat from its central place in philosophy of science

41:36.860 --> 41:42.300
although I think they're part of it touches philosophy of logic the question the astounding

41:42.300 --> 41:47.180
suggestion has actually come forward in connection with quantum mechanics that we may have to change

41:47.180 --> 41:53.340
our logic our view of what the true logical laws are in order to really understand how the world

41:53.340 --> 41:58.140
can be quantum mechanical I think this side of philosophy of quantum mechanics that touches

41:58.140 --> 42:04.860
philosophy of logic will be a hot discussion area but more generally I think areas which we almost

42:04.860 --> 42:09.580
don't think of as philosophy of science that become philosophy of language and philosophy of mind

42:09.580 --> 42:13.980
like these questions about computer models of the mind computer models of language

42:14.780 --> 42:21.340
and these more general questions about theories of truth the nature of truth the nature of

42:21.340 --> 42:27.500
verification how science can be objective even though there's not a rigorous scientific method

42:27.500 --> 42:33.260
that I think these questions will continue to be the staples of the field one thing that worries me

42:33.260 --> 42:40.700
about this whole area is its relationship to the educated layman I mean which in a sense is the

42:40.700 --> 42:47.100
person our discussion has been for after all it's now over 70 years since the 25 year old

42:47.100 --> 42:52.140
Einstein published the theorem of relativity and I'm sure you'll agree with me that it's true

42:52.140 --> 42:57.420
to say now that the great majority of educated people with higher educations university degrees

42:57.420 --> 43:02.860
and so on still have scarcely any idea of what this is all about and it's done very little to

43:02.860 --> 43:07.820
actually influence their view of the world isn't there a danger that now science and mathematics

43:07.820 --> 43:15.100
are simply racing ahead and the whole new range and world of insight that that is giving us into

43:15.100 --> 43:21.180
the universe in which we live simply isn't filtering through to the non-specialist or not

43:21.180 --> 43:25.740
filtering through anything like fast enough that is a danger but it's one that something can be done

43:25.740 --> 43:31.900
about there's now for example a text of special relativity called spacetime physics which is

43:31.900 --> 43:37.900
designed for the first month of the first freshman college physics course and the authors say at the

43:37.900 --> 43:42.460
beginning that they look forward to the time when it will be taught in high schools and do you think

43:42.460 --> 43:47.100
that time will in fact come and quite soon I'm sure of it as well I I think you're right and

43:47.100 --> 43:52.060
indeed I hope you are thank you very much Professor Putnam thank you
