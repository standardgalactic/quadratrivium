0	7200	The question of whether there are any beliefs or desires common to all human beings is a
7200	14520	little interest apart from the vision of a utopian inclusivist human community, one which
14520	17200	prides itself on the different sorts of people.
17200	22920	It welcomes rather than on the firmness with which it keeps out the stranger.
22920	26200	Most human communities are exclusivist.
26200	31600	Their sense of identity and the self-images of their members depend on pride in not being
31600	37680	certain other sorts of people, people who worship the wrong God, eat the wrong foods, or have
37680	42080	some other perverse, repellent beliefs or desires.
42080	47080	Philosophers would not bother trying to show that certain beliefs and desires are found
47080	54480	in every society or are implicit in some ineliminable human practice, unless they hope to show that
54480	61160	the existence of these beliefs demonstrates the possibility of or the obligation to construct
61160	64640	a planet-wide inclusivist community.
64640	69920	In this paper I'll use the term democratic politics as a synonym for the attempt to bring
69920	73820	such a community into existence.
73820	78960	One of the desires said to be universal by philosophers interested in democratic politics
78960	81800	is the desire for truth.
81800	86040	In the past, such philosophers have typically conjoined the claim that there is universal
86040	91800	human agreement on the supreme desirability of truth with the further premises that truth
91800	98160	is correspondence to reality and that reality has an intrinsic nature, that there is in
98160	102200	Nelson Goodman's terms a way the world is.
102200	107560	Given these three premises, they proceed to argue that truth is one and that the universal
107560	113640	human interest in truth provides motive for creating an inclusivist community.
113640	118520	For such a community would be best suited to accomplishing our desire of discovering
118520	120360	the one truth.
120360	125000	The more of that truth we uncover, the more common ground we shall share, and the more
125000	129320	tolerant and inclusivist we shall therefore become.
129320	133760	The rise of relatively democratic, relatively tolerant societies in the last few hundred
133760	139880	years is said to be due to the increased rationality of modern times, where rationality denotes
139880	144480	the exercise of a truth-oriented faculty.
144480	150240	The three premises I've listed are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason.
150240	157600	That is, the premises that everybody wants truth, that truth is correspondence to reality
157600	160680	and that reality has an intrinsic nature.
160680	165480	These three premises are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason, but this claim
165480	170480	is usually tautologists for philosophers who say that, typically explain their use of the
170480	179160	word reason by listing those same three premises as constitutive of the very idea of rationality.
179160	185320	They view colleagues who have doubts about one or another of these three premises as irrationalism.
185320	193200	I have a footnote about Nietzsche, James, and Habermas as people who are called irrationalists
193200	198920	for rejecting one or another or more of those premises.
198920	205080	Degrees of irrationality are attributed according to how many of these premises the distrusted
205080	210280	philosopher denies, and also according to how little interest he or she shows in democratic
210280	212760	politics.
212760	217400	In this paper, I'll consider the prospects for defending democratic politics while denying
217400	220920	all of the three premises I've listed.
220920	226240	I'll be arguing that what philosophers have described as the universal desire for truth
226240	231280	is better described as the universal desire for justification.
231280	235440	The grounding premise of my argument is that you can't aim at something, can't work to
235440	239920	get it, unless you could recognize it once you got it.
239920	245840	One difference between truth and justification is just that between the unrecognizable and
245840	247840	the recognizable.
247840	253240	We shall never know for sure whether a given belief is true, but we can be sure that nobody
253240	258480	at the moment is able to summon up any residual objections to it that everybody agrees that
258480	261280	it ought to be held.
261280	268080	There are to be sure what Lacanians call impossible, indefinable, sublime objects of desire, but
268080	273800	a desire for such an object cannot be made relevant to democratic politics.
273800	277360	On my view, truth is just that sort of object.
277360	282720	It's too sublime, so to speak, to be either recognized or aimed at.
282720	288080	Justification is merely beautiful as opposed to sublime, but it is recognizable and therefore
288080	292000	capable of being systematically worked for.
292000	295360	Sometimes with Locke justification is even achieved.
295360	300320	But that achievement is usually only temporary, since sooner or later, with Locke, some dual
300320	305240	objections to the temporarily justified belief will be developed.
305240	309880	As I see it, the yearning for unconditionality, the yearning which leads philosophers to insist
309880	317320	that we need to avoid contextualism and relativism, is indeed satisfied by the notion of truth.
317320	322280	But this yearning is unhealthy because the price of unconditionality is irrelevant to
322280	324000	practice.
324000	329320	So I think the topic of truth can't be made relevant to democratic politics and that philosophers
329320	336080	devoted to such politics should forget about truth and stick to the topic of justification.
336080	338800	Now I turn to Habermas.
338800	343600	In order to place my view within the context of contemporary philosophical controversies,
343600	347120	I'll begin with some comments on Habermas.
347120	352080	Habermas draws his well-known distinction between subject-centered reason and communicative
352080	357040	reason in connection with his attempt to separate out what's useful to democratic politics
357040	362920	and the traditional philosophical notion of rationality from what's useless.
362920	369680	I think that he makes a tactical error when he tries to preserve the notion of unconditionality.
369680	374320	Although I think Habermas is absolutely right that we need to socialize and linguistify
374320	381040	the notion of reason by viewing it as communicative, I think that we also need to naturalize reason
382040	388600	Habermas, like Putnam, believes that reason cannot be naturalized.
388600	394440	Both philosophers think, and that's a phrase from Putnam endorsed by Habermas, both philosophers
394440	399320	think it important to insist on this point in order to avoid the relativism which seems
399320	406480	to them to put democratic politics on a par with totalitarian politics.
406480	414320	You could say, if there's a moment of unconditionality, then you can't naturalize it.
414320	421680	Both think it important to say that democratic politics is more rational than totalitarian
421680	423600	fascist politics.
423600	428120	I don't think we should say that because I don't think the notion of rationality can
428120	430680	be stretched that far.
430680	435640	We should admit that we have no neutral ground to stand on when we defend democratic politics
435640	438160	against its opponents.
438160	442560	If we don't admit this, I think we can rightly be accused of attempting to smuggle our own
442560	449120	social practices into the definition of something universal and ineluctable because presupposed
449120	453360	by the practices of any and every language user.
453360	458040	It would be franker and therefore better to say that democratic politics can no more appeal
458040	466200	to such presuppositions than can anti-democratic politics, but is none the worse for that.
466200	473000	Habermas agrees with the criticism which post-Nichyan writers have made of what Derrida calls logo-centrism
473000	478400	and specifically with their denial that, quote, the linguistic function of representing states
478400	483080	of affairs is the so human monopoly.
483080	487760	So do I, but I would extend this criticism as follows.
487760	492600	Only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that there was an aim of inquiry
492600	498160	called truth in addition to the aim of justification.
498160	504680	More generally, only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that acclaim to universal
504680	509160	validity is important for democratic politics.
509160	514760	Still more generally, abetting the logo-centric idea that knowledge is the distinctive human
514760	520360	capacity would leave room for the idea that democratic citizenship is better suited for
520360	524600	the role of the distinctively human capacity.
524600	529000	The latter is what we human beings should take most pride in and should make central
529000	532000	to our self-image.
532000	537360	As I see it, Habermas' attempt to redefine the term reason after deciding that, as he
537360	542280	says, the paradigm of the philosophy of consciousness is exhausted.
542280	548800	His attempt to re-describe reason as communicative through and through is insufficiently radical.
548800	553680	It's a halfway house between thinking in terms of validity claims and thinking in terms of
553680	556280	justificatory practices.
556280	561320	It comes down halfway between the Greek idea that human beings are special because they
561320	567480	can know, whereas other animals can merely cope, and Dewey's idea that we are special
567840	572920	because we can take charge of our evolution, take ourselves in directions which have neither
572920	578840	precedent nor justification in either biology or history.
578840	583920	The latter idea can be made to sound unattractive by dubbing it Nietzschean and construing it
583920	589600	as one more form of the same will to power which was incarnate in the Nazis.
589600	595200	I'd like to make it sound attractive by calling it American and construing it as the idea
595200	601720	common to Emerson and Whitman, the idea of a new self-creating community united not by
601720	607680	knowledge of the same truths, but by sharing the same generous, inclusivist, democratic
607680	609600	hopes.
609600	615960	The idea of communal self-creation, of realizing a dream which has no justification in unconditional
615960	622080	claims to universal validity, sounds suspicious to Habermas and Opel because they naturally
622080	624440	associate it with Hitler.
624440	629520	It sounds somewhat better to Americans because they naturally associate it with Jefferson,
629520	631360	Whitman and Dewey.
631360	637920	The moral to be drawn, I think, is that this suggestion is neutral between Hitler and Jefferson.
637920	643680	If one wants neutral principles on the basis of which to decide between Hitler and Jefferson,
643680	650160	one will have to find a way of replacing Jefferson's occasional references to natural law and
650360	656920	self-evident political truths by a more up-to-date version of Enlightenment rationalism.
656920	663320	This is the role in which Habermas and Opel cast what they call discourse ethics.
663320	668480	Only if one has given up hope for discourse ethics and for all other attempts at such
668480	674480	neutrality will the alternative I'm suggesting seem attractive.
674480	679520	Whether one gives up that hope should, I think, be decided, at least in part, on the basis
679520	684480	of one's view of the sort of argument from performative self-contradiction which is at
684480	687840	the heart of discourse ethics.
687840	694440	I see that argument as weak and unconvincing, but I have nothing better to put in its place.
694440	699640	Because I have nothing better, I'm inclined to reject the very idea of neutral principles
699640	704960	and ask myself what philosophers might do for democratic politics apart from trying to
704960	708360	ground this politics on principles.
708360	714440	My answer is they can get to work substituting hope for knowledge, substituting the idea
714440	720280	that the ability to be citizens of the full-fledged democracy which is yet to come rather than
720280	725520	the ability to grasp truth is what's important about being human.
725520	730640	This is not a matter of what Opel calls let's be glündung, but of re-describing humanity
730640	736440	and history in terms which make democracy seem desirable.
736440	742360	If doing that is said to be, as Opel calls it, mere rhetoric rather than proper argument,
742360	748200	I should rejoin that it is no more or less rhetorical or argumentative than my opponent's
748200	754640	attempt to make discourse, to describe discourse and communication in terms that make democracy
754640	761960	seem linked to the intrinsic nature of humanity.
761960	766960	New section on truth and justification.
766960	771080	There are many uses for the word true, but the only one which could not be eliminated
771080	776760	from our linguistic practice with relative ease is the cautionary use.
776760	781400	This is the use we make of the word when we contrast justification and truth and say that
781400	785880	a belief may be justified, but still not true.
785880	790400	Outside of philosophy, this cautionary use is used to contrast less informed with better
790400	796720	informed audiences and more generally past audiences with future audiences.
796720	801760	In nonphilosophical context, the point of contrasting truth and justification is simply
801760	807400	to remind oneself that there may be objections arising from newly discovered data or more
807400	812680	ingenious explanatory hypotheses or a shift in the vocabulary used for describing the
812680	817760	objects under discussion which have not occurred to any of the audiences to whom the belief
817760	821920	in question has so far been justified.
821920	826360	This sort of gesture toward an unpredictable future is made, for example, when we say that
826360	831880	our present moral and scientific beliefs may look as primitive to our remote descendants
831880	835600	as those of the Greeks look to us.
835600	840280	My grounding premise that you can only work for what you could recognize is a corollary
840280	844640	of James's principle that a difference has to make a difference to practice before it's
844640	847040	worth discussing.
847040	851600	The only difference between truth and justification which makes such a difference is, as far as
851600	858480	I can see, the difference between old audiences and new audiences.
858480	863840	So I take the appropriate pragmatist attitude toward truth to be, it's no more necessary
863840	868560	to have a philosophical theory about the nature of truth or the meaning of the word true
868560	874280	than it is to have one about the nature of danger or the meaning of the word danger.
874280	878920	The principle reason we have a word like danger in the language is to caution people,
878920	884560	to warn them that they may not have envisaged all the consequences of their proposed action.
884560	889160	We pragmatists who think that beliefs are habits of action rather than attempts to correspond
889160	896120	to reality see the cautionary use of the word true as flagging a special sort of danger.
896120	900840	We use it to remind ourselves that people in different circumstances, people facing
900840	906640	future audiences, may not be able to justify the belief which we have triumphantly justified
906640	911200	to all the audiences we have encountered.
911200	915640	Given this pragmatist view of the function of the word true, what about the claim that
915640	919080	all human beings desire truth?
919080	923920	This claim is ambiguous between the claim that all of them desire to justify their beliefs
923960	930720	to some, though not necessarily all other human beings, and the claim that they all
930720	933680	want their beliefs to be true.
933680	936960	The first claim seems to me unobjectionable.
936960	941560	The second claim, however, seems dubious unless it's merely an alternative formulation
941560	943400	of the first.
943400	947960	For the only other interpretation which we pragmatists can give to the second claim is
947960	952400	that all human beings are concerned about the danger that someday an audience will
952400	959280	come into being before whom a presently justified belief cannot be justified.
959280	963400	But in the first place, mere fallibilism is not what philosophers who hope to make the
963400	967880	notion of truth relevant to democratic politics want.
967880	973560	In the second place, such fallibilism is not, in fact, a feature of all human beings.
973560	979120	It is much more prevalent among inhabitants of wealthy, secure, tolerant, inclusivist societies
979200	983960	than elsewhere, for these people are brought up to rethink themselves that they might be
983960	989080	mistaken, that there are people out there who might disagree with them and whose disagreement
989080	991920	needs to be taken into account.
991920	996600	If you favor democratic politics, you will want to encourage fallibilism.
996600	1000600	But there are other ways to do so, beside harping on the difference between the conditional
1000600	1005840	character of justification and the unconditional character of truth.
1005840	1011080	One might, for example, harp on the sad fact that many previous communities have betrayed
1011080	1017120	their own interests by being too sure of themselves and so failing to attend to objections raised
1017120	1018600	by outsiders.
1018600	1025360	Furthermore, we should distinguish between fallibilism and philosophical skepticism.
1025360	1031200	Fallibilism has nothing in particular to do with the quest for universality and unconditionality.
1031200	1032920	Skepticism does.
1032920	1037240	Skepticism will usually not go into philosophy, at least in anglophone countries, unless one
1037240	1041800	is impressed by the sort of skepticism found in Descartes' meditations.
1041800	1045920	The sort of skepticism which says that the mere possibility of error defeats knowledge
1045920	1047860	claims.
1047860	1053680	Not many people find this sort of skepticism interesting, but those who do ask themselves,
1053680	1059120	is there any way in which we can ensure ourselves against having beliefs which may be unjustifiable
1059120	1061760	to some future audience?
1061760	1066880	Is there any way in which we can ensure that we have beliefs justifiable to any and every
1066880	1069040	audience?
1069040	1073680	The tiny minority which finds this question interesting consists almost entirely of philosophy
1073680	1076800	professors and divides into three groups.
1076800	1084160	First, skeptics like Straude, who say that Descartes' argument from dreams is unanswerable.
1084160	1089040	For the skeptics, there is always an audience, the future self who is awoken from the dream,
1089040	1093800	which will not be satisfied by any justification offered by our present, possibly, dreaming
1093800	1096800	self.
1096800	1101040	Second, foundationalists like Chisholm, who say that even if we're now dreaming, we
1101040	1105920	can't be wrong about certain beliefs, certain of our beliefs.
1105920	1110680	Third, coherentists like Sellers say that, I quote, Sellers, all our beliefs are up for
1110680	1114200	grabs, though not all at once.
1114200	1118360	We pragmatists who have been impressed by Perse's criticisms of Descartes think that
1118360	1123360	both skeptics and foundationalists are led astray by the picture of beliefs as attempts
1123360	1129040	to represent reality and by the associated idea that truth is a matter of correspondence
1129040	1130400	to reality.
1130400	1133000	So we become coherentists.
1133000	1139000	But we coherentists remain divided about what, if anything, needs to be said about truth.
1139000	1143840	I think that once one has explicated the difference between justification and truth by that between
1143840	1149640	present and future justifiability, there is little more to be said.
1149640	1155320	Some of my fellow coherentists, Appel, Habermas, and Putnam, think, as Perse also did, that
1155320	1163200	there's a lot more to be said and that saying it is important for democratic politics.
1163200	1169720	Section four, universal validity and context transcendence, Putnam, Appel, and Habermas
1169720	1177680	all take over from Perse an idea which I reject, the idea of convergence upon the one truth.
1177680	1183800	Instead of arguing that because reality is one and truth correspondence to that one reality,
1183800	1190000	Perseans argue that the idea of convergence is built into the presuppositions of discourse.
1190000	1194800	They all agree that the principal reason why reason cannot be naturalized is that reason
1194800	1199000	is normative and norms cannot be naturalized.
1199000	1203600	But they say we can make room for the normative without going back to the traditional idea
1203600	1208380	of a duty to correspond to the intrinsic nature of reality.
1208380	1214120	We do this by attending to the universalistic character of the idealizing presuppositions
1214120	1216000	of discourse.
1216000	1220680	This strategy has the advantage of setting aside meta-ethical questions about whether
1220680	1225600	there is a moral reality to which our moral judgments might hope to correspond as our
1225640	1231800	physical science supposedly hopes to correspond to physical reality.
1231800	1237800	Habermas says that every validity claim, quote, has a transcendent moment of universal validity
1237800	1242440	which bursts every provinciality asunder.
1242440	1249640	In addition to the validity claim strategic role in some context bound discussion.
1249640	1255000	As I see it, the only truth in this idea is that many claims to validity are made by people
1255080	1259680	who would be willing to defend their claims before audiences other than the one which
1259680	1262680	they are currently addressing.
1262680	1265200	Not all assertions obviously are of this sort.
1265200	1269880	Lawyers, for example, are quite aware that they fashion their claims to suit the quaint
1269880	1273360	context of a highly local jurisprudence.
1273360	1278920	But willingness to take on new and unfamiliar audiences is one thing, bursting provinciality
1278920	1281880	asunder is another.
1281960	1286280	Habermas's doctrine of a transcendent moment seems to me to run together a commendable
1286280	1290480	willingness to try something new with an empty boast.
1290480	1295080	To say I'll try to defend this argument, I'll try to defend this belief against all
1295080	1301160	comers is often depending upon the circumstances a commendable attitude.
1301160	1307120	But to say I can successfully defend this against all comers is silly.
1307120	1311800	Maybe you can, but you're in no more opposition to say that than the village champion
1311800	1315120	is to claim that he can beat the world champion.
1315120	1319680	The only sort of situation in which you would be in a position to say the latter is one
1319680	1325120	in which the rules of the argumentative game have been agreed upon in advance, as in normal
1325120	1329400	as opposed to revolutionary mathematics, for example.
1329400	1333600	But in most cases, including the moral and political claims in which Habermas is most
1333600	1336680	interested, there are no such rules.
1336680	1341760	The notion of context dependence has a clear sense in the sorts of cases I've just mentioned,
1342280	1346840	in provincial law courts and in language games such as normal mathematics regulated
1346840	1350000	by clear and explicit conventions.
1350000	1356880	For most assertions, however, neither the notion of context dependence nor the notion
1356880	1360560	of universal validity has such a sense.
1360560	1366120	For most assertions, such as Clinton is the better candidate, Alexander came before Caesar,
1366120	1371160	Gold is insoluble in hydrochloric acid and the like, it's hard to see why I should ask
1371200	1376000	myself, is my claim context dependent or universal?
1376000	1380560	No difference to practice is going to be made by coming down in favor of one alternative
1380560	1384200	rather than the other.
1384200	1389640	Habermas puts forward an analog of this distinction between the context dependent and the universal,
1389640	1394120	which might seem more relevant to practice.
1394120	1399440	This analog is what he calls the tension between facticity and validity.
1399440	1404800	He views this tension as a central philosophical problem and says that this tension is responsible
1404800	1410040	for many of the difficulties encountered in theorizing democratic politics.
1410040	1414080	He thinks it is a distinctive and valuable feature of his theory of communicative action
1414080	1420120	that, quote, it already absorbs the tension between facticity and validity into its fundamental
1420120	1422400	concepts.
1422400	1427720	It does so by distinguishing between the strategic use of discourse and what he calls the use
1427720	1431720	of language oriented to reaching understanding.
1431720	1435740	This latter distinction might seem just the one we are looking for, the one which lets
1435740	1441360	us interpret the distinction between context dependence in universality and universality
1441360	1445040	in a way which makes a difference to practice.
1445040	1450160	As I see it, however, the distinction between the strategic and non-strategic use of language
1450160	1455040	is just the distinction between cases in which all we care about is convincing others and
1455040	1458400	cases in which we hope to learn something.
1458400	1463080	In the latter set of cases, we are quite willing to give up our present views if we hear something
1463080	1464400	better.
1464400	1469440	These cases are two ends of a spectrum, at one end of which we shall use any dirty trick
1469440	1475880	we can, lying, omitting the truth, suggesting the false and so on, to convince.
1475880	1481560	At the other end, we talk to others as we talk to ourselves when we are most at ease,
1481560	1484200	most reflective and most curious.
1484200	1488920	Most of the time, we are somewhere in the middle between these two extremes.
1488920	1493160	My problem is, I don't see that these two extremes have anything in particular to do
1493160	1498320	with a distinction between context dependence and universality.
1498320	1503360	The pure pursuit of truth is the traditional name for the sort of conversation which takes
1503360	1506680	place at one end of this spectrum.
1506680	1513600	But I don't see what that sort of conversation has to do with universality or with unconditionality.
1513600	1518720	It is non-strategic in the sense that in such conversations we let the wind blow where
1518720	1524200	it lists it, but it's hard to see that the assertions we make in such conversations presuppose
1524200	1529160	something which is not presupposed in the assertions I make when I'm at the other end
1529160	1534000	of the spectrum, the dirty tricks end of the spectrum.
1534000	1539240	Habermas, however, thinks that unless we recognize, quote, that the validity claims
1539240	1545000	raised hiket nunk and aimed at intersubjective recognition or acceptance can at the same
1545000	1552040	time overshoot local standards for taking yes-no positions, we shall not see that this
1552040	1558960	transcendent moment alone distinguishes the practices of justification oriented to truth
1558960	1566240	claims from other practices that are regulated merely by social convention.
1566240	1570640	This passage is a good example of what seems to me Habermas' undesirable commitment to
1570640	1575680	the logocentric distinction between opinion and knowledge, a distinction between mere
1575680	1581920	obedience to the norms of social practices, even the sort of norm which would be found
1581920	1589040	in a utopian democratic society, and the kind of foussé by nature relation to reality which
1589040	1592280	is provided by the grasp of truth.
1592280	1596760	Both the opinion knowledge and the normals foussé's distinction appear to delians as
1596760	1601480	remnants of Plato's obsession with the kind of certainty found in mathematics, and more
1601480	1607200	generally with the idea that the universal being somehow eternal and unconditional provides
1607200	1613760	an escape from what is particular, temporal, and conditioned.
1613760	1619080	In this passage Habermas is, I take it, using the term practices of justification oriented
1619080	1625120	to truth claims to refer to the nice end of the spectrum I described above.
1625120	1628760	But from my point of view, truth has nothing to do with it.
1628760	1634760	Since social convention, rather they're regulated by certain particular social conventions,
1634760	1640600	those of a society even more democratic, tolerant, leisure, wealthy, and diverse than our own,
1640600	1645800	one in which inclusivism is built into everyone's sense of moral identity.
1645800	1651600	In this society everybody always welcomes strange opinions on all sorts of topics.
1651600	1656280	These are also the conventions of certain lucky parts of contemporary society.
1656280	1662840	For example, university seminars, summer camps for intellectuals, and the like.
1662840	1668640	Perhaps the most far-reaching difference between Habermas and I is that pragmatists like myself
1668640	1675000	sympathize with the anti-metaphysical, so-called postmodern thinkers whom Habermas criticizes
1675120	1679880	when they suggest that the idea of a distinction between social practice and what transcends
1679880	1685280	such practice is an undesirable remnant of logocentrism.
1685280	1690560	Foucault and Dewey can agree that whether or not inquiry is always a matter of power,
1690560	1693880	it never transcends social practice.
1693880	1696280	So incidentally, can brand them.
1696280	1705600	So this issue comes up in the context of Brandon's work tomorrow.
1705600	1709840	Both would say that the only thing that can transcend the social practice is another social
1709840	1714960	practice, just as the only thing that can transcend the present audience is a future
1714960	1715960	audience.
1715960	1720600	Similarly, the only thing that can transcend a discursive strategy is another discursive
1720600	1725560	strategy, one aimed at other better goals.
1725560	1731040	But because I don't know how to aim at it, I don't think that truth names such a goal.
1731040	1736520	I know how to aim at greater honesty, greater charity, greater patience, greater inclusiveness,
1736520	1737680	and so on.
1737680	1743320	I see democratic politics as serving such concrete, desirable goals, but I don't see
1743320	1750440	that it helps things to add truth or universality or unconditionality to the list of goals.
1750440	1759440	Or I don't see what we will do differently depending on whether or not we make such additions.
1759440	1764200	It may sound at this point as if the difference between me and Habermas is one that makes
1764200	1766160	no difference to practice.
1766160	1768400	We both have the same utopias in mind.
1768400	1771600	We both engage in the same sort of democratic politics.
1771600	1776600	So why quibble about the difference between whether to call utopian communication practices
1776600	1779160	oriented to truth or not?
1779160	1785040	Why quibble about the whole subject of the relevance of truth to democratic politics?
1785040	1789400	The answer is that Habermas thinks it does make a difference to practice because he gets
1789400	1792960	to make an argumentative move which isn't open to me.
1792960	1798160	He gets to accuse his opponents of performative self-contradiction.
1798160	1804440	Habermas thinks that, quote, the universal discourse of an unbounded community of interpretation
1804440	1810760	is unavoidably assumed by anybody, even me, who gets into any argument.
1810760	1817080	He says, quote, even if these presuppositions have an ideal content that can only be approximately
1817080	1822660	satisfied, all participants must de facto accept them, accept the presuppositions of
1822660	1827720	communication, whether they assert or deny the truth of a statement in any way and would
1827720	1835960	like to enter into argumentation aimed at justifying this validity claim.
1835960	1841120	My experience of speaking in Frankfurt is invariably that, at a certain point, Appel
1841120	1845680	will accuse me of performative self-contradiction.
1845680	1853400	This is the standard Frankfurt move, sort of the basic strategy of the school.
1853880	1858680	What about somebody who is outraged as are many trustees of American universities by
1858680	1863400	the social conventions of the better parts of the better universities, places where
1863400	1869080	even the most paradoxical and unpromising claims are seriously discussed, and in which
1869080	1875260	feminists, atheists, homosexuals, blacks, etc. are taken seriously as moral equals and
1875260	1876760	conversational partners?
1876760	1883200	I take it that on Habermas's view, such a person will be contradicting himself if he
1883200	1888160	offers arguments to the effect that these conventions should be replaced by other more
1888160	1890640	exclusivist conventions.
1890640	1895720	By contrast, I can't tell the narrow-minded university trustee that he's contradicting
1895720	1896720	himself.
1896720	1901560	I can only try to weedle him into greater tolerance by the usual indirect means, giving
1901560	1907240	examples of present platitudes which were once paradoxes of the contributions to culture
1907240	1912440	made by black female homosexual atheists and so on.
1912440	1920800	The big question of whether anybody has ever been convinced by the charge of performative
1920800	1922360	self-confidiction.
1922360	1927960	I don't think that there are many clear examples of such a change being taken to heart.
1927960	1932400	If you tell a bigot of the sort I've sketched that he's committed to making context-surpassing
1932400	1936880	validity claims to aiming at truth, he'll probably agree that that's exactly what he's
1936880	1938440	doing.
1938440	1943480	If you tell him that he can't make such claims and still balk at the paradoxes or the people
1943480	1948080	at whom he balks, he will probably not get the point.
1948080	1954240	He will say that people who invent such paradoxes are too crazy to argue with or argue about
1954240	1957820	that women have a distorted view of reality and the why.
1957820	1964800	He will think it irrational or immoral or both to take such paradoxes and people seriously.
1964800	1971720	That's why he doesn't think the university should allow them to teach, speak and so on.
1971720	1976320	I can't see much difference between the bigot's reaction to me and Habermas and Habermas's
1976320	1979000	and my reactions to him.
1979000	1986000	I can't see that anything like communicative reason favors our reactions rather than his.
1986000	1992400	This is because I don't see why the term reason is not as much up for grabs as the term academic
1992400	1999160	freedom or morality or pervert, nor how the anti-foundationalist coherentism which Habermas
1999160	2006400	and I share can make room for a non-recontextualizable, non-relativizable conversation stopper called
2006400	2009380	performative self-contradiction.
2009380	2014560	What the bigot and I do and I think should do when told that we have violated a presupposition
2014560	2020320	of communication is to haggle about the meanings of the terms used in stating the purported
2020320	2028000	presupposition, terms like true argument, reason, communication, domination and so on.
2028000	2033880	This haggling will with luck eventually turn into a mutually profitable conversation about
2033880	2036000	our respective utopias.
2036000	2044800	Our respective ideas about what an ideal society or university empowering an ideally competent
2044800	2047120	audience would look like.
2047120	2051000	But this conversation is not likely to end with the bigot's rocked and admission that
2051000	2054600	he has entangled himself in a contradiction.
2054600	2060000	Even if I should, by a miracle, succeed in convincing him of the worth of my utopia,
2060000	2066320	his reaction will be to regret his own previous lack of curiosity and imagination rather than
2066320	2072000	to regret his failure to spot his own presuppositions.
2072000	2082160	This section is about an argument of Albrecht Velmers who's associated with Habermas but
2082160	2086640	differs from him in various interesting ways.
2086640	2092280	I agree with Appel and Habermas that Perse was right in telling us to talk about discourse
2092280	2097800	rather than about consciousness, but I think that the only ideal presupposed by discourse
2097800	2103200	is that of being able to justify your beliefs to a competent audience.
2103200	2107440	As a coherentist, I think that if you can agree with other members of such an audience
2107440	2112840	about what is to be done, then you don't have to worry about your relationship to reality.
2112840	2117360	But everything depends upon what constitutes a competent audience.
2117360	2121400	Unlike Appel and Habermas, the moral I draw from Perse is that we philosophers who are
2121400	2126560	concerned with democratic politics should leave truth alone as a sublimely undiscussable
2126560	2131400	topic and instead turn to the question of how to persuade people to broaden the size
2131400	2136760	of the audience they take to be competent to increase the size of the relevant community
2136760	2138640	of justification.
2138640	2143640	The latter project is not only relevant to democratic politics, it pretty much is democratic
2143640	2146120	politics.
2146120	2150480	Appel and Habermas think that the demand to maximize the size of this community is already,
2150480	2153520	so to speak, built into communicative action.
2153520	2159480	This is the cash value of their claim that every assertion claims universal validity.
2159480	2165960	Albert Velmer, like me, rejects the convergentism which Habermas and Appel share with Buttman.
2165960	2171320	But he nevertheless accepts their claim that our truth claims, quote, transcend the context,
2171320	2177640	the local or cultural context in which they are raised.
2177640	2182160	My problem with Velmer, Appel and Habermas is that I don't see what the pragmatic force
2182280	2186800	of saying that an argument which, like all other arguments, convinces certain people and
2186800	2190780	not others is a good argument.
2190780	2195480	This seems like saying that a tool which, like all tools, is useful for certain purposes
2195480	2199120	but not others is a good tool.
2199120	2203060	Imagine the surgeon who, after unsuccessfully attempting to dig a tunnel out of his prison
2203060	2207720	cell with his scalpel saying, still, it's a good tool.
2207720	2213120	Imagine picture him saying, after unsuccessfully trying to convince his guards to let him escape,
2213120	2217000	so that he may resume his position as leader of the resistance, saying, still, they were
2217000	2219400	good arguments.
2219400	2225080	My problem is intensified when I ask myself whether my truth claims transcend my local
2225080	2227560	cultural context.
2227560	2232080	I have no clear idea whether they do or not because I can't see what transcendence means
2232080	2233080	here.
2233400	2239240	I can't even see what the point of taking my assertion as making a truth claim is.
2239240	2244480	When I believe that Pee and express this belief by asserting it in the course of a conversation,
2244480	2246880	am I making a claim?
2246880	2249080	What's the force of saying that?
2249080	2254480	What to saying that add to saying that I am, to speak with Purse, informing my interlocutor
2254480	2260280	about my habits of action, giving her hints about how to predict and control my future
2260400	2264440	conversational and non-conversational behavior.
2264440	2268920	Depending on the situation at hand, I may also be inviting her to disagree with me by telling
2268920	2273320	me about her different habits of action, suggesting that I'm prepared to give reasons
2273320	2277960	from my belief, trying to make a good impression on her and a thousand other things.
2277960	2282000	As Austin reminded us, there are lots of things I do when I make an assertion which can be
2282000	2287400	interpreted as part of the give and take between me and my interlocutor.
2287400	2292600	This give and take is a matter of, roughly, the reciprocal adjustment of our behavior,
2292600	2298800	the strategic coordination of that behavior in ways which may prove mutually profitable.
2298800	2303640	Of course, if somebody asks me after I have asserted Pee whether I believe that Pee is
2303640	2306360	true, I shall say yes.
2306360	2311120	But I shall wonder, as Wittgenstein did, what the point of that question was.
2311120	2313680	Is he questioning my sincerity?
2313680	2318640	Is he expressing incredulity about my ability to offer reasons from my belief?
2318640	2324080	I can try to straighten things out by asking the question to the spell out why he asks.
2324080	2329600	But he replies, I just wanted to be sure you are making a context-transcendent truth claim.
2329600	2331560	I'll be baffled.
2331560	2335080	What does he want to be reassured about, exactly?
2335080	2339400	What would it be like for me to make a context-dependent assertion?
2339400	2344640	Of course, in the trivial sense that an assertion may not always be applicable, all assertions
2344640	2345640	are context-dependent.
2345640	2350880	But what would it mean for the proposition asserted to be context-dependent, as opposed
2350880	2354880	to the speech act being context-dependent?
2354880	2358960	I'm not sure how people like Habermas and Velmer, who've given up on correspondence
2358960	2363360	theories of truth and consequently can't distinguish between a claim to report a habit
2363360	2369320	of action and a claim to represent reality, can draw this distinction between context-dependence
2369360	2371840	and context-independence.
2371840	2376840	My best guess is that they believe that, in Velmer's words, quote, whenever we raise
2376840	2382440	a truth claim on the basis of what we take to be good arguments or compelling evidence,
2382440	2388040	we take the epistemic conditions prevailing here and now to be ideal in the following
2388040	2389800	sense.
2389800	2394640	We presuppose that no arguments or evidence will come up in the future which would put
2394640	2398080	our own truth claims into question.
2398080	2404640	Whereas Velmer also puts it, quote, relying upon reasons or evidences as compelling means
2404640	2411520	to exclude the possibility of being proved wrong as time goes on.
2411520	2417120	If that's what it takes to make a context-transcendent truth claim, then I have never made one.
2417120	2422960	I would not know how to exclude the possibility that Velmer described, nor would I know how
2422960	2427880	to presuppose that no arguments or evidence will turn up in the future which will cast
2427920	2430640	out on my belief.
2430640	2434640	Relying once again on the fundamental pragmatist principle that any difference has to make
2434640	2439880	a difference to practice, I want to know whether this excluding or presupposing are things
2439880	2443080	I can decide to do or not to do.
2443080	2447360	If they are, I want to know more about how to go about doing them.
2447360	2450680	If they aren't, they seem to me empty.
2450680	2455000	I can make my point in another way by asking, what's the difference between a metaphysician
2455000	2460320	committed to a correspondence theory of truth, telling me that whether I know it or will
2460320	2465320	admit it or not, my assertions automatically willy-nilly amount to a claim to represent
2465320	2471680	reality accurately, and my fellow Perseans telling me that they automatically willy-nilly
2471680	2478800	amount to an exclusion of possibilities or a presupposition about what the future holds.
2478800	2484000	In both cases, I'm being told that I presuppose something which, even after considerable reflection,
2484000	2486520	I don't think I believe.
2486520	2491360	But the notion of presupposition, when it's extended to beliefs which the purported presupposer
2491360	2497600	astoutly denies, becomes hard to distinguish from the notion of re-description of person
2497600	2501000	A in person B's language.
2501000	2506400	If A can explain what I'm doing and why I'm doing it in her own terms, what right has
2506400	2513560	B got to keep on saying, no, what you, A, are really doing is so-and-so.
2513560	2518000	In the case at hand, we doians think we have a perfectly good way of describing our own
2518000	2524280	behavior, behavior of which Habermas approves, in ways which, as true terms, like universal,
2524280	2527880	unconditional, and transcendence.
2527880	2533200	It seems to me in the spirit of Perse's criticism of Descartes' make-believe doubt, to raise
2533200	2537840	the question of whether we are not dealing here with make-believe transcendence, a sort
2537840	2541720	of make-believe response to a make-believe doubt.
2541800	2547280	Real doubt, Perse said, comes when some concrete difficulty is envisaged if one acts according
2547280	2550560	to the habit which is the belief.
2550560	2555760	Such a difficulty might be, for example, having to seize asserting and believing some relevant
2555760	2560680	but conflicting proposition.
2560680	2566400	Real transcendence, I should say, occurs when I say, I am prepared to justify this belief,
2566400	2570720	not just to people who share the following premises with me, but to lots of other people
2570720	2575000	who don't share those premises but with whom I share a certain others.
2575000	2579960	The question whether I am so prepared is a concrete, practical question, whose answer
2579960	2585560	I determine by, for example, imaginatively previewing various other audience's responses
2585560	2589680	to my assertion and my subsequent behavior.
2589680	2593320	But such experiments and imagination obviously have limits.
2593320	2598960	I can't imagine myself defending my assertion to any possible audience.
2598960	2602640	In the first place, I can usually dream up audiences to whom it would be pointless to
2602640	2609080	try to justify my beliefs, try defending beliefs about justice in the antitholes or Nazi prison
2609080	2614560	guards or about quarks to Aristotle or about trigonometry to three-year-olds.
2614560	2619440	In the second place, no good pragmatist ever uses the term all possible.
2619440	2623680	He doesn't know how to imagine or discover the bounds of possibility.
2624400	2629520	Indeed, he can't figure out what the point of attempting such a feat would be.
2629520	2634480	Under what concrete circumstances would it be important to consider the difference between
2634480	2640280	all the x's I can think of and all possible x's?
2640280	2645760	How could that difference make a difference to practice?
2645760	2651920	I conclude that Delmer's way of distinguishing between context-dependent and context-independent
2651920	2656160	claims can't be made plausible, at least to pragmatists.
2656160	2660560	Since I can think of no better way, I think we should ask why Delmer, Appel and Habermas
2660560	2663840	think this distinction worth drawing.
2663840	2668860	The obvious answer is that they want to avoid what they call the relativism, which contextualism
2668860	2671480	purportedly entails.
2671480	2677280	So I turn now to what Delmer calls the antinomy of truth, the clash between relativist and
2677280	2681080	absolutist intuitions.
2681080	2686960	Over the beginning of his essay, Truth, Contingency and Modernity, Delmer writes his pause.
2686960	2694440	If there is irresolvable disagreement about the possibility of justifying truth claims,
2694440	2699280	about standards of argumentation or evidential support, e.g. between members of different
2699280	2705600	linguistic, scientific or cultural communities, may I still suppose that there are, somewhere,
2705600	2710880	the correct standards, the right criteria, in short, that there is an objective truth
2710880	2711880	of the matter.
2711880	2717360	Or should I rather think that truth is relative to cultures, languages, communities, or even
2717360	2719560	persons?
2719560	2724000	While relativism, the second alternative, appears to be inconsistent, absolutism, the
2724000	2727920	first alternative seems to imply metaphysical assumptions.
2727920	2730760	Let's call this the antinomy of truth.
2730760	2735360	Much important philosophical work has been done in the last decades to resolve this antinomy,
2735480	2740080	either by trying to show that absolutism need not be metaphysical, or by trying to show
2740080	2744040	that the critique of absolutism need not lead to relativism.
2744040	2746480	End of quote.
2746480	2750400	My problem with Delmer's antinomy is that I don't think that denying that there are
2750400	2756040	the correct standards should lead anybody to say that truth, as opposed to justification,
2756040	2758320	is relative to something.
2758320	2763360	As far as I can see, nobody would think that the critique of absolutism leads to relativism,
2763360	2767440	unless you thought that the only reason for justifying our beliefs to each other is that
2767440	2773040	such justification makes it more likely that our beliefs are true.
2773040	2777120	I don't think there's any reason to think that such justification makes it more likely
2777120	2779840	that our beliefs are true.
2779840	2784600	But I don't think that's a cause for concern, since I don't think that our practice of justifying
2784600	2788160	our beliefs needs justification.
2788160	2792920	If I'm right, that the only indispensable function of the word true, or any other indefinable
2792920	2798880	normative term, such as good or right, is to caution to warn against danger by making
2798880	2805280	gestures toward unpredictable situations, future audiences, future moral dilemmas, etc.,
2805280	2811440	then it doesn't make much sense to ask whether or not justification leads to truth.
2811440	2815600	Justification to more and more audiences leads to less and less danger of rebuttal, and
2815600	2818600	thus to less and less need for caution.
2818600	2823840	If I convince them, we often say to ourselves, I should be able to convince anybody.
2823840	2828480	But one would only say that it leads to truth if one could somehow project from the condition
2828480	2834840	to the uncondition, from all imaginable to all possible audiences.
2834840	2839400	Such a prediction makes some sense if one believes in convergence.
2839400	2844640	For such a belief, seems the space of reasons as finite and structured, so that as more
2844640	2850120	and more audiences are satisfied, more and more members of a finite set of possible objections
2850120	2852320	are eliminated.
2852320	2858120	One will be encouraged to see the space of reasons in this way if one is a representationalist,
2858120	2862960	because one will see reality, or at least the spatiotemporal hunk of reality relevant
2862960	2869800	to human concerns, as finite and as constantly shoving us out of error and toward truth,
2869800	2874600	discouraging inaccurate representations of itself and thereby producing increasingly
2874600	2878080	accurate ones.
2878080	2883120	But if one does not take knowledge to be accurate representation of reality, nor truth to be
2883120	2888000	correspondence to reality, then it's harder to be a convergentist and harder to think
2888000	2892520	of the space of reasons as finite and structured.
2892520	2897760	Filmar, it seems to me, wants to project from the condition our various experiences of success
2897760	2902720	in justifying our beliefs to the unconditioned truth.
2902720	2907160	The big difference between me and Velmer is that I think the answer to Velmer's question,
2907160	2913880	as a quote from Velmer, do our democratic and liberal principles define just one possible
2913880	2919480	political language game among others, is an unqualified yes.
2919480	2925600	Velmer, however, thinks, quote, a qualified no can be justified, and by justification
2925600	2934000	I now mean not justification for us, but justification period, end of quote.
2934000	2939320	As I see it, the very idea of justification period commits Velmer to the thesis that the
2939320	2944320	logical space of reason giving is finite and structured.
2944320	2948880	So I would urge him to abandon the latter thesis for the same reasons that he abandoned
2948880	2952880	Apples and Habermas's convergentism.
2952880	2957720	But oddly enough, the reasons these reasons are pretty much the reasons he gives for giving
2957720	2961080	his qualified no.
2961080	2966040	Velmer's central point in defense of this qualified no answer is one which I wholeheartedly
2966040	2973280	accept, namely that the very idea of incompatible and perhaps reciprocally unintelligible language
2973280	2978480	games is a pointless fiction, and that in real cases representatives of different traditions
2978480	2982760	and cultures can always find a way to talk over their differences.
2982760	2988280	I entirely agree with Velmer when he says, quote, rationality in any relevant sense of
2988280	2993440	the word cannot end at the borderline of closed language games since there is no such thing
2993440	2997560	as a closed language game.
2997560	3003080	My disagreement with Velmer starts when after a semicolon, Velmer finishes that sentence
3003080	3010760	with, but then the ethnocentric contextuality of all argumentation is quite well compatible
3010760	3016480	with the raising of truth claims which transcend the context, the local or cultural context
3016480	3021000	in which they are raised and in which they can be justified.
3021000	3027200	I should have finished that same sentence by saying, but then the ethnocentric contextuality
3027200	3032880	of all argumentation is quite well compatible with the claim that a liberal and democratic
3032880	3039040	society can bring together and include all sorts of diverse ethnoi, all sorts of diverse
3039040	3045360	local, cultural, social practices.
3045360	3049200	Here's a way of summing up the difference between me and Velmer.
3049200	3054000	We agree that one reason to prefer democracies is that they enable us to construct ever bigger
3054000	3059360	and better contexts of discussion, but I stop there and Velmer goes on.
3059360	3067440	He adds that this reason is not just a justification of democracy for us, but a justification period.
3067440	3072580	He thinks that the democratic and liberal principles of modernity should potcherority
3072580	3076520	be understood in a universalistic sense.
3076520	3081520	My problem, of course, is that I don't have the option of understanding them that way.
3081520	3085880	Pragmatists like me can't figure out how to tell whether we're understanding a justification
3085880	3092640	as just a justification for us or as a justification period.
3092640	3097480	This strikes me as like trying to tell whether I think of my scalpel or my computer as a
3097480	3102840	good tool for the task at hand or a good tool period.
3102840	3109960	At this point, however, one can imagine Velmer rejoining then so much the worse for pragmatism.
3109960	3114960	Any view which makes you unable to understand a distinction everybody else understands
3114960	3117880	must have something wrong with it.
3117880	3122440	My rebuttal would be you're only entitled to that distinction as long as you can back
3122440	3128040	it up with a distinction between what seemed good reasons to us and what seemed good reasons
3128040	3132920	to something like an ahistorical Kantian tribunal of reason.
3132920	3138240	But you deprive yourself of that possibility when you gave up on convergentism and thus
3138240	3144560	gave up the non-metaphysical Frankfurt substitute for such a tribunal vis the idealization
3144560	3149680	called the undistorted communication situation.
3149680	3154640	I agree with Velmer that quote, democratic and liberal institutions are the only ones
3154640	3160040	which could possibly coexist with a recognition of contingency and still reproduce their own
3160040	3162160	legitimacy.
3162160	3168160	At least if one takes the term reproduce their own legitimacy to mean something like make
3168160	3173560	its view of the situation of human beings in the universe hang together with its political
3173560	3174560	practices.
3174560	3180520	But I don't think that the recognition of contingency serves as a justification period
3180520	3187360	for democratic politics because I don't think it does what Velmer says, namely, quote, destroys
3187360	3196320	the intellectual bases of dogmatism, foundationalism, authoritarianism and immoral and legal inequality.
3196320	3203160	This is because I don't think that dogmatism or moral inequality have intellectual bases.
3203160	3207440	If I am a bigoted proponent of the inequality of Blacks, women and homosexuals to straight
3207440	3213360	white males, I need not necessarily appeal to the denial of contingency by invoking a
3213360	3217640	metaphysical theory about the true nature of human beings.
3217640	3223000	I could do that, but I might also, when it came to philosophy, be a pragmatist.
3223000	3229680	A bigot and I can say the same Foucaultian, Nietzschean thing, that the only real question
3229680	3231520	is one of power.
3231520	3237280	The question of which community is going to inherit the earth, mine or my opponents?
3237280	3242200	One's choice of a community for that role is intertwined with one's sense of what counts
3242200	3245120	as a competent audience.
3245120	3248520	Do only Aryans count as a competent audience?
3248520	3251080	Do only Christians count as a competent audience?
3251080	3255520	Do only liberal democrats count as a competent audience?
3255520	3260800	The fact that there are no mutually unintelligible language games, the point Velmer insists on
3260800	3267560	and which Davidson, I think, effectively argues for, the fact that there are no mutually unintelligible
3267560	3274480	language games does not in itself do much to show that disputes between racists and anti-racists,
3274480	3278560	democrats and fascists, can be decided without resort to foes.
3278560	3284760	Both sides may agree that although they understand what each other says perfectly well and share
3284760	3290720	common views on most topics, including perhaps the recognition of contingency, the false
3290760	3295640	pseudo-fellow gocentrism and so on, there seems no prospect of reaching agreement on
3295640	3298000	the particular issue at hand.
3298000	3302120	So both sides say as they reach for their guns, it looks as if we'll have to fight it
3302120	3305880	out.
3305880	3311320	My answer to Velmer's question about whether our democratic and liberal principles define
3311320	3316680	just one possible political language game among others is yes.
3316680	3321240	If the force of the question is to ask whether there is something in the nature of discourse
3321240	3324360	which singles our game out.
3324360	3329120	I can't see what other force the question could have and I think so, I think we have
3329120	3334640	to rest content with saying that no philosophical thesis either about contingency or about truth
3334640	3339240	does anything decisive for democratic politics.
3339240	3344760	By decisive, I mean doing what Oppel and Habermas want to do, convicting the anti-democrat
3344760	3348120	of a performative self-contradiction.
3348120	3353280	The most that an insistence on contingency can do for democracy is to supply one more
3353280	3356920	debating point on the democratic side of the argument.
3356920	3362280	Just as the insistence that, for example, only the Aryan race is in tune with the intrinsic
3362280	3367840	necessary nature of things can supply one more debating point on the other side.
3367840	3372880	I can't take the latter point seriously but I don't think that there's anything self-contradictory
3373160	3380640	in the Nazis refusal to take me seriously so we may both have to reach for our guns.
3380640	3386120	Unlike Habermas, I don't think that disciplines like philosophy, linguistics, and developmental
3386120	3389760	psychology can do much for democratic politics.
3389760	3395640	I see the development of the social conventions in which Habermas and I both rejoice as a
3395640	3396960	lucky accident.
3397320	3403120	Still, I'd be happy to think I'd be wrong about this, that I'd be happy to think that
3403120	3405640	I was wrong about this.
3405640	3410600	Maybe the gradual development of these conventions, that is, the gradual development of the social
3410600	3418240	practices which make up the basis of liberal society, maybe the gradual development of
3418240	3424280	those conventions does, as Habermas thinks, illustrate a universal pattern of phylo or
3424280	3430720	ontogenetic development, a pattern captured by the rational reconstruction of competences,
3430720	3437040	offered by various human sciences, and illustrated by the transition from traditional to modern
3437040	3440280	rationalized societies.
3440280	3445440	But unlike Habermas, I should be unperturbed if the offers currently made by the human
3445440	3447920	sciences were withdrawn.
3447920	3454240	For example, if Chomsky's universalistic ideas about communicative competence were repudiated
3454320	3459760	by a connectionist revolution and artificial intelligence, I have a footnote saying that
3459760	3466280	Davidson's argument in his article, A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs, against the sort of
3466280	3476800	MIT language learning reconstruction of communicative competence in terms of Chomsky and fundamental
3476800	3483840	grammar seems to be, you know, this Davidsonian point that we don't really need the idea
3483840	3490400	of mastering a set of grammatical rules in order to understand language learning seems
3490400	3498000	to be being supported by connectionist programs in artificial intelligence.
3498000	3500960	I don't know whether this is true or not.
3500960	3508880	I just put it in as an example of a change in the opinion of linguists of an anti-Chomsky
3508880	3515400	revolution in linguistics, which it seems to me wouldn't greatly matter to philosophers
3515400	3523920	or political thinkers, but I think Habermas goes out on a limb in, you know, his attachment
3523920	3532280	to Chomsky and his use of Chomsky's notion of competence as a sort of structural device
3532280	3536960	for his own work.
3536960	3542640	I should be unreturbed if Chomsky's ideas were repudiated if Piaget's and Colberg's
3542640	3547240	empirical results proved to be unduplicatable and so on.
3547240	3551760	I don't see that it matters much whether there are actual patterns here.
3551760	3556840	I don't much care whether democratic politics is an expression of something deep or whether
3556840	3562080	it expresses nothing better than some hopes which popped from nowhere into the brains
3562080	3567600	of a few remarkable people like Socrates, Christ, Jefferson, and so on, and which for
3567600	3571400	unknown reasons became popular.
3571400	3576520	Habermas and Oppel think that the way to create a cosmopolitan community is to study the nature
3576520	3582320	of something called rationality, which all human beings share, something already present
3582320	3585840	within them but insufficiently acknowledged.
3585840	3590880	That's why they would be depressed if the offers made by Chomsky, Colberg, etc. were
3590880	3594000	in the course of time withdrawn.
3594000	3598800	But suppose we say that all that rationality amounts to, all that marks human beings off
3598800	3604400	from other species of animals, is the ability to use language and thus to have sentential
3604400	3607640	attitudes like beliefs and desires.
3607640	3612360	It seems plausible to add that there is no more reason to expect all the organisms which
3612360	3618640	share this ability to form a single community of justification than to expect such a community
3618640	3625000	to unite all the organisms able to walk long distances or to remain monogamous or to digest
3625000	3626520	vegetables.
3626520	3631120	One will not expect such a single community of justification to be created by the ability
3631120	3637280	to communicate if one takes the ability to use language to be, like the prehensile thumb,
3637280	3644880	just one more gimmick which organisms have developed to increase their chances of survival.
3644880	3649600	If we combine this Darwinian point of view with the holistic attitude toward intentionality
3649600	3655040	and language use found in Wittgenstein and Davidson, we shall say that there is no language
3655040	3660880	use without justification, no ability to believe without an ability to argue about what beliefs
3660880	3661880	to have.
3661880	3667880	But this is not to say that the ability to use language to have beliefs and desires entails
3667880	3674520	a desire to justify one's beliefs to every language using organism one encounters.
3674520	3678800	It's not to say that any language user who comes down the road will be treated as a member
3678800	3681240	of a competent audience.
3681240	3686160	On the contrary, human beings usually divide up into mutually suspicious, not mutually
3686160	3691840	unintelligible, communities of justification, mutually exclusive groups depending on the
3691840	3696920	presence or absence of sufficient overlap in belief and desire.
3696920	3701560	The principle source of conflict between human communities is the belief that I have no reason
3701560	3707480	to justify my beliefs to you and none in finding out what alternative beliefs you may have,
3707480	3714360	because you are, for example, an infidel, a foreigner, a woman, a child, a slave, a pervert,
3714360	3715880	or an untouchable.
3715880	3721160	In short, you're not one of us, not one of the real human beings, the paradigm human
3721160	3729240	beings, the ones whose persons and opinions are to be treated with respect.
3729240	3733600	The philosophical tradition has tried to stitch exclusivist communities together by saying
3733600	3738560	there's more overlap between infidels and true believers, masters and slaves, men and
3738560	3744060	women than you might have thought, for as Aristotle said, all human beings by nature
3744060	3746240	desire to know.
3746240	3751680	This desire brings them together in a universal community of justification.
3751680	3756960	To a pragmatist, however, this Aristotelian dictum seems thoroughly misleading.
3756960	3761160	It runs together three different things, the need to make one's beliefs coherent, the
3761160	3765440	need for the respective one's peers, and curiosity.
3765440	3769360	We pragmatists think that the reason people try to make their beliefs coherent is not
3769360	3773160	that they love truth, but because they can't help doing so.
3773160	3777880	Our minds can no more stand in coherence than our brains can stand whatever the neurochemical
3777880	3781440	substrate of such coherence may be.
3781440	3786000	Just as our neural networks are presumably both constrained and in part constructed by
3786000	3791960	something like the algorithms used in parallel distributed processing of information by computer
3791960	3797280	programmers, so our minds are constrained by the need to tie our beliefs and desires
3797280	3801160	together into a reasonably perspicuous whole.
3801160	3807880	That's why we can't, in James' unhappy expression, will to believe, believe what we like regardless
3807880	3810360	of what else we believe.
3810360	3814920	It's why, for example, we have such a hard time keeping our religious beliefs in a separate
3814920	3820680	compartment from our scientific ones and in isolating our respect for democratic institutions
3820680	3825640	from our contempt for many or most of our fellow voters.
3825640	3830000	The need to make one's beliefs coherent is for reasons familiar from Hagel, Mead and
3830000	3834720	Davidson not separable from the need for the respective our peers.
3834720	3839400	We have as hard a time tolerating the thought that everybody but ourselves is out of step
3839400	3844120	as we do the thought that we believe both P and not P.
3844120	3848800	We need the respect of our peers because we cannot trust our own beliefs nor maintain
3848800	3854040	our self-respect unless we're fairly sure that our conversational interlocutors agree
3854040	3860320	among themselves on such propositions as, he's not crazy, he's one of us, he may have
3860320	3865360	strange beliefs on some subjects, but he's basically sound and so on.
3865360	3869320	This interpenetration of the need to make one's beliefs coherent among themselves and
3869320	3874120	the need to make them coherent with most of those of one's peers results from the fact
3874120	3879920	that, as Wittgenstein said, to imagine a form of human life we have to imagine agreement
3879920	3882760	in judgments as well as in meanings.
3882760	3888120	Davidson brings out the considerations which support Wittgenstein's insight when he says,
3888120	3893880	quote, the ultimate source of both objectivity and communication is the triangle that by
3893880	3901720	relating speaker, interpreter, and the world determines the contents of thought and speech.
3901720	3906360	You would not know what you believe nor have any beliefs unless your belief had a place
3906360	3911480	in a network of beliefs and desires, but that network would also not exist where you and
3911480	3916000	others unable to pair off features of your non-human environment with assent to your
3916000	3923740	utterances by other language users, utterances caused as are yours by those very features.
3923740	3927580	The difference between the use which Davidson and I would like to make of Hegel's and Meade's
3927580	3933060	realization that ourselves are dialogical all the way down, that there is no private
3933060	3940180	core on which to build, and the use which Hoppe and Habermas make of this point can
3940180	3945940	be exhibited by looking at the sentence immediately following the one I just quoted from Davidson.
3945940	3951260	Davidson continues, given the source that is given that the source of both objectivity
3951260	3959460	and communication is this triangle, there is no room for a relativized concept of truth.
3959460	3963540	Davidson's point is that the only sort of philosopher who would take seriously the idea
3963540	3970060	that truth is relative to a context and particularly to a choice between human communities is one
3970060	3976120	who thinks that he or she can contrast being in touch with a human community with being
3976160	3982200	in touch with reality. But Davidson's point about there being no language without triangulation
3982200	3987880	means that this contrast can't be drawn. You can't have any language or any beliefs without
3987880	3994400	being in touch with both a human community and non-human reality. There's no possibility
3994400	4000320	of agreement without truth, nor of truth without agreement. Most of our beliefs must
4000320	4005400	be true, Davidson says, because a description to a person of mostly false beliefs would
4005400	4010480	mean either that we had mistranslated the person's marks and noises, or that she didn't,
4010480	4015760	in fact, have any beliefs, was not, in fact, speaking a language. Most of our beliefs must
4015760	4021280	be justified in the eyes of our peers for a similar reason. If they were not justified,
4021280	4026840	if our peers could not attribute to us a largely coherent web of beliefs and desires, they
4026840	4030760	would have to conclude that they had either misunderstood us, sorry, they would have to
4030760	4036680	conclude either that they had misunderstood us, or that we did not speak their language.
4036680	4041040	Coherence, truth, and community go together, not because truth is to be defined in terms
4041040	4047000	of coherence rather than correspondence, in terms of social practice rather than in terms
4047000	4052520	of coping with non-human forces, but simply because to ascribe a belief is automatically
4052520	4059760	to ascribe a place in a largely coherence of mostly true belief. But to say that there's
4059760	4065600	no contact via belief and desire with reality, no truth without community, is as yet to say
4065600	4071200	nothing about what sort of community is in question. A radically exclusivist community
4071200	4075440	made up of only the priests or the nobles or the males or the whites is quite as good
4075440	4080800	as any other sort of community for Davidsonian purposes. This is the difference between what
4080800	4085240	Davidson thinks you can get out of reflection on the nature of discourse and what Oppo and
4085240	4089840	Habermas think you can get out of it. The latter philosophers think that you can get
4089840	4093760	something more out of such reflection than the fact that there are neither beliefs nor
4093760	4099640	persons nor truth without justification in the eyes of a community. They think you can
4099640	4105040	get an argument in favor of the inclusivist project, an argument which says that people
4105040	4111120	who resist this project involve themselves in performative self-contradictions. By contrast,
4111160	4115800	Davidson thinks that any community of justification will do to make you a language user and a
4115800	4121200	believer, no matter how distorted Oppo and Habermas take communication within that community
4121200	4127200	to be. From Davidson's point of view, philosophy of language runs out before we reach the moral
4127200	4135600	imperatives which make up Oppo's discourse ethics. Oppo and Habermas run together the
4135600	4139960	need for coherence and for justification, which is required if one is to use language
4140000	4145240	at all, and a commitment to what they call universal validity, a commitment which can
4145240	4151240	only be consistently acted upon by aiming at the sort of domination-free communication
4151240	4157840	which is impossible as long as there are human communities which remain exclusivist. Davidson
4157840	4163040	and I have no use for the claim that any communicative action contains a claim to universal validity
4163040	4168400	because this so-called presupposition seems to us to have no role to play in the explanation
4168400	4176040	of linguistic behavior. It does, to be sure, play a part in the explanation of the behavior,
4176040	4181280	linguistic and other, of a small minority of human beings, those who belong to the liberal
4181280	4186240	universalistic and classivist tradition of the European Enlightenment. But this tradition,
4186240	4191160	to which Davidson and I are as much attached as Oppo and Habermas, derives no support from
4191160	4196760	reflection on discourse as such. We language users who belong to this minority tradition are
4196880	4202280	morally superior to those who don't, but those who don't are no less coherent in their use of
4202280	4208560	language. Oppo and Habermas invoke the presupposition of universal validity to get from a commitment
4208560	4213160	to justification to a willingness to submit one's beliefs to the inspection of any and every
4213160	4220000	language user, even a slave, even a black, even a woman. They see the desire for truth construed
4220000	4226000	as the desire to claim universal validity as the desire for universal justification, but as I see
4226040	4231720	it there, inferring invalidly from, you can't use language without invoking consensus within a
4231720	4237200	community of other language users to, you can't use language consistently without enlarging that
4237200	4243280	community to include all users of language. Because I see this inference as invalid, I think that
4243280	4248800	the only thing which can play the role in which Aristotle, Perse, Oppo and Habermas have cast
4248800	4254680	the desire for knowledge, and thus for truth, is curiosity. I use this term to mean the urge to
4254680	4261040	expand one's horizons of inquiry in all areas, ethical as well as logical and physical, so as
4261040	4266520	to encompass new data, new hypotheses, new terminologies and the like. This urge brings
4266520	4273440	cosmopolitanism and democratic politics in its train. The more curiosity you have, the more
4273440	4278240	interest you will have in talking to foreigners, infidels, and anybody else who claims to know
4278240	4285800	something you don't know to have some ideas you have not yet had. Section 6, communicating or
4285800	4293000	educating. If one sees the desire and possession of both truth and justification as inseparable from
4293000	4298720	using language, while still resisting the thought that this desire can be used to convict members of
4298720	4304920	exclusivist human communities, our performative self-contradiction, then one will see inclusivist
4304960	4309720	communities as based on contingent human development, such as the twitchy curiosity of the
4309720	4315120	sort of eccentrics we call intellectuals, the desire for intermarriage beyond tribal or caste
4315120	4320480	boundaries produced by erotic obsession, the need to trade across such boundaries produced by lack
4320480	4326200	of, for example, salt or gold within one's own territory, the possession of enough wealth,
4326200	4332040	security, education, and independence, so that one's self-respect no longer depends upon membership
4332280	4339280	in an exclusivist community, e.g. on not being an infidel or a slave or a woman and the like. The
4339280	4343440	increased communication between previously exclusivist communities produced by such
4343440	4349600	contingent human developments may gradually create universality, but I can't see any sense in which
4349600	4356680	it recognizes a previously existent universality. Philosophers like Habermas who worry about the
4356680	4361480	anti-enlightenment overtones of the views they call contextualist think that since
4361520	4368280	justification is, and obviously context relative notion, one justifies to a given audience and
4368280	4374480	the same justification won't work for all audiences, it endangers the ideal of human fraternity.
4374480	4383080	Habermas regards contextualism as only the flip side of logocentrism. He sees contextualists as
4383080	4390000	negative metaphysicians infatuated by diversity and says that, quote, the metaphysical priority of
4390080	4396360	unity above plurality and the contextualist priority of plurality above unity are secret
4396360	4405640	accomplices. The idea is that post-moderns in the tradition of Nietzsche, including me,
4405640	4414480	for these purposes, are plurality freaks in the same way that the western metaphysical tradition
4414560	4420160	condemned by Heidegger and Derrida were unity freaks, whereas Habermas is neither a unity
4420160	4427080	freak nor a plurality freak but just right. I agree with Habermas that it's as pointless to
4427080	4432600	prize diversity as to prize unity, but I disagree with him that we can use the pragmatics of
4432600	4438400	communication to do the job which metaphysicians hope to achieve by appealing to the Plotinian
4438400	4444000	one or to the transcendental structure of self-consciousness. My reasons for disagreement
4444000	4450880	are those offered by Walzer, McCarthy, Ben Hubby, Velmer, and others. Reasons nicely summed up in
4450880	4457120	an article by Michael Kelly that I cite in the footnote. Habermas argues for the thesis that,
4457120	4464160	quote, the unity of reason only remains perceptible in the plurality of its voices. As the possibility
4464160	4470400	and principle of passing from one language to another, a passage that no matter how occasional is
4470560	4476960	still comprehensible. This possibility of mutual understanding, which is now guaranteed only
4476960	4483200	procedurally and is realized only transitorally, forms the background for the existing diversity
4483200	4490480	of those who encounter one another even when they fail to understand one another. I agree with Habermas
4490480	4496560	against Lyotav Foucault and others that there are no incommensurable languages, that any language
4496560	4502080	can be learned by one who is able to use any other language that Davidson is right in denouncing
4502080	4508000	the very idea of a conceptual scheme. But I disagree with him about the relevance of this point to
4508000	4516240	the utility of the ideas of universal validity and objective truth. Habermas says that, quote,
4516800	4523040	what the speaker here and now in a given context asserts as valid transcends according to the
4523040	4531600	sense of his claim all contexts dependent merely local standards of validity. As I said before,
4531600	4537600	I can't see what transcends means here. If it means that he's claiming to say something true,
4537600	4541760	then the question is whether it makes any difference whether you say that a sentence
4541760	4547760	s is true or whether you simply offer a justification for it by saying, here are my reasons for
4547760	4553440	believing s. Habermas thinks there's a difference because he thinks that when you assert s, you
4553440	4560880	claim truth, you claim truth, you claim to represent the real and that reality transcends context.
4561600	4568320	I quote, with the concept of reality to which every representation necessarily refers, we
4568320	4574640	presuppose something transcendent. Here, in my view, is where the notion of representation
4574640	4584320	raises its ugly head in Habermas and offers us a reason for never, never saying that sentences
4584320	4591040	represent reality. Habermas tends to take for granted that truth claims or claims to represent
4591040	4596240	accurately and to be suspicious of those who, like Davidson and myself, give up on the notion
4596240	4602160	of linguistic representation. He follows sellers in being a coherentist rather than a skeptic
4602160	4607600	or a foundationalist, but he's dubious about the move I want to make from coherentism to
4607600	4614800	anti-representationalism. He commends Purse over Socio because Purse, quote, examines expressions
4614800	4621680	from the point of view of their possible truth and at the same time from that of their communicability.
4622320	4629040	He goes on to say, quote, from the perspective of its capacity for being true, an acertoric
4629040	4634560	sentence stands in an epistemic relation to something in the world. It represents a state of
4634560	4640000	affairs. At the same time, from the perspective of its employment in a communicative act,
4640000	4645680	it stands in a relation to a possible interpretation by a language user. It's suitable for the
4645680	4651360	transmission of information. My own view, which I take from Davidson, is that you can give up the
4651360	4657680	notion of an epistemic relation to something in the world and just rely on the ordinary causal
4657680	4663840	relations which bind utterances together with the otterer's environments. The idea of representation
4663840	4669120	on this view adds nothing to the notion of transmission of information, or more exactly,
4669120	4675280	it adds nothing to the notion of taking part in the discursive practice of justifying one's assertions.
4676880	4682400	Habermas sees Putnam as, like himself, defending a third position over against the metaphysics of
4682400	4688720	unity on the one hand, and people like me, the enthusiasts for incommensurability on the other.
4690000	4696080	He thinks I'm an enthusiast for incommensurability. He defines this third position as, quote,
4696080	4701120	the humanism of those who continue the Kantian tradition by seeking to use the philosophy
4701120	4705520	of language to save a concept of reason that is skeptical and post-metaphysical.
4707040	4711200	Putnam and Habermas have offered similar criticisms of my attempt to get rid of a
4711200	4716560	specifically epistemic concept of reason, the concept according to which one is rational only
4716560	4723120	if one tries to represent reality accurately, and to replace it by the purely moral idea of
4723120	4728880	solidarity. My central disagreement with both Habermas and Putnam is whether,
4730880	4736000	sorry, is over the question of whether the regulative ideas of undistorted communication
4736000	4741760	or accurate representation of reality can do any more for the ideals of the French Revolution
4741760	4748320	than the bare context-dependent notion of justification. Some people care about defending
4748320	4753280	their assertions only to a few people, and some care, or say they care, about defending their
4753280	4759440	assertions to everyone. I'm not thinking here of the distinction between specialized technical
4759440	4764480	discourse and non-technical discourse. Rather, the distinction I want is the one between people
4764480	4769840	who want to defend their views to all people who share certain attributes, for example devotion to
4769840	4774800	the ideals of the French Revolution or membership in the Aryan race, and those who say they want
4774800	4780560	to justify their view to every actual and possible language user. There are certainly people who say
4780560	4785760	that the latter is what they want, but I'm not sure they really mean it. Do they want to justify
4785760	4791040	their views to language users who are four years old? Well, perhaps they do in the sense that they
4791040	4796800	would like to educate four-year-olds to the point at which they could appreciate the arguments for
4796800	4803200	and against views in question. Do they want to justify them to intelligent but convinced Nazis,
4803200	4808320	people who believe that the first thing to find out is whether the view under discussion is tainted
4808320	4814800	by the Jewish ancestry of its inventors or propounders? Well, perhaps they do in the sense
4814800	4819840	that they would like to convert these Nazis into people who have doubts about the advisability
4819840	4825120	of a Jew-free Europe and the infallibility of Hitler, and therefore are more or less willing
4825120	4831280	to listen to arguments for positions associated with Jewish thinkers. But in both cases, what
4831280	4836560	they want seems to me best described not as wanting to justify their view to everybody,
4836560	4842160	but as wanting to create an audience to whom they would have a sporting chance of justifying their
4842160	4848880	view. Let me use the distinction between arguing with people and educating people to abbreviate
4848880	4854240	the distinction I've just drawn. The distinction between proceeding on the assumption that people
4854240	4860240	will follow your arguments and knowing that they cannot but hoping to alter them so that they can.
4861600	4868000	If all education were a matter of argument, this distinction would collapse. But unless one broadens
4868000	4874560	the term argument beyond recognition, a lot of education is not. In particular, a lot of it is
4874640	4880080	simple appeal to sentiment. The distinction between such appeal and argument is fuzzy,
4880640	4885680	but I take it nobody would say that making an unregenerate Nazi watch films of the opening
4885680	4891840	of the concentration camps or making her read the diary of Anne Frank counts as arguing with her.
4893280	4898320	People interested in democratic politics both cherish the ideal of human fraternity
4898320	4905920	and cherish the idea of the universal availability of education. When asked about the education we
4905920	4912560	have in mind, we often say that it is education in critical thinking in the ability to talk over
4912560	4921280	the pros and cons of any view. We oppose critical thinking to ideology and say that we oppose
4921280	4927840	ideological education of the sort which the Nazis inflicted on German youth. But we thereby
4927920	4933760	leave ourselves wide open to Nietzsche's scornful suggestion that we are simply inculcating our own
4933760	4940160	ideology, the ideology of what he calls Socrates. The issue between me and Habermas I think boils
4940160	4946160	down to a disagreement about what to say to Nietzsche at this point. I should reply to Nietzsche
4946160	4953040	by conceding that there is no non-local, non-contextual way to draw the distinction between ideological
4953040	4959920	education and non-ideological education because there's nothing to say to my use of the term reason
4959920	4966240	that could not be replaced by the way we wet western liberals the heirs of Socrates and the
4966240	4972240	French Revolution conduct ourselves. I agree with McIntyre and Michael Kelly that all reasoning,
4972240	4980640	both in physics and ethics, is tradition bound. Habermas thinks this an unnecessary concession
4980640	4986240	and more generally thinks that my cheerful ethnocentrism can be avoided by thinking through what
4986240	4993520	he calls the symmetrical structure of perspectives built into every speech situation. The issue
4993520	4998560	between Habermas and myself thus comes to a head when he takes up my suggestion that we drop the
4998560	5005680	notions of rationality and objectivity and instead just discuss the kind of community we want to create.
5006000	5012880	He paraphrases this suggestion by saying that I want to treat the aspiration for objectivity as
5012880	5019520	quote simply the desire for as much intersubjective agreement as possible, namely the desire to expand
5019520	5027520	the referent of for us to the greatest possible extent. Habermas then paraphrases one of Putnam's
5027520	5033840	objections to me by asking quote, can we explain the possibility of the critique and self critique
5034480	5040880	of established practices of justification if we do not take the idea of the expansion of our
5040880	5048640	interpreted horizon seriously as an idea and if we do not connect this idea with the intersubjectivity
5048640	5053920	of an agreement that allows precisely for the distinction between what is current for us and
5053920	5062080	what is current for them. Habermas enlarges on this point by saying quote, the merging of interpretive
5062160	5069760	horizons does not signify an assimilation to us, rather it must mean a convergence steered through
5069760	5077680	learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have
5077680	5085120	to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent. For learning itself
5085120	5093680	belongs neither to us or to them, both sides are caught up on it in the same way. Even in the most
5093680	5099360	difficult processes of reaching understanding all parties appeal to the common reference point
5099360	5105360	of a possible consensus even if this reference point is projected in each case from within
5105360	5111840	their own context. For although they may be interpreted in various ways and applied according
5111840	5117520	to different criteria concepts like truth rationality or justification play the same
5117520	5125280	grammatical role in every linguistic community. End of quote. The note of the argument is I think
5125280	5130720	a disagreement about how much help for democratic politics can be gotten out of what Habermas here
5130720	5136320	calls grammar. As I said earlier I think that all we can get out of the grammar of the words true
5136320	5145360	and rational is the same as what we get out of a rather thin idea of justification. This thin idea
5145360	5150880	is the one we get when we answer the question where does the line come between causing people to
5150880	5157120	adjust their behavior by persuasion by working on their beliefs and desires and doing so by other
5157120	5163920	means. Unlike Foucault and some others I think it's both possible and important to draw a line here.
5164560	5169680	I don't think it helpful to extend the term violence as widely as Foucault extended it.
5170400	5175920	Whatever we're doing when we make Nazis look at pictures of concentration camp survivors it isn't
5175920	5182080	violence anymore than it was violence to educate the Hitler youth to believe the Jews were worthless
5182080	5189040	Berman. The inevitable fuzziness of the line between persuasion and violence causes problems
5189040	5195120	however when we come to the question of education. We're reluctant to say that the Nazis used
5195120	5202560	persuasion on the Hitler youth since we have two criteria of persuasion. One is simply using
5202560	5209200	words rather than blows or other forms of physical pressure. One can imagine with a bit of distortion
5209200	5215600	of history that in this sense only persuasion was employed on the Hitler youth. The second
5215600	5222320	criterion of persuasion includes abstention from words like stop asking these stupid questions
5222320	5227440	about whether there aren't some good Jews questions which make me doubt your area and
5227440	5233600	consciousness and ancestry or the Reich will find another use for you. Those are not blows but one
5233600	5240640	might say it isn't exactly persuasion either it's you know threats or something you know something
5240640	5250400	that doesn't quite deserve the name persuasion. Another example is abstention from not assigning
5250400	5256400	their stigma to one student. Unsecretic methods of this latter sort are the kind which Habermas
5256400	5261120	would say do not respect the symmetrical relationships of participants in discourse.
5261920	5266800	Habermas clearly thinks that there's something in the grammar of concepts like truth rationality
5266800	5272880	and justification which tell us not to use methods of the latter sort. He would presumably grant
5272880	5278480	that the use of such words is language use but he needs a category of distorted language use or
5278480	5286000	distorted communication to explain that it is so to speak ungrammatical language use. Immediately
5286000	5293760	after the passage I quoted about grammar Habermas says quote all languages offer the possibility
5293760	5299760	of distinguishing what is true and what we hold to be true. The supposition of a common objective
5299760	5306160	world is built into the pragmatics of every single linguistic usage and the dialogue roles of every
5306160	5315360	speech situation enforce a symmetry in participant perspective. A bit later he says quote from the
5315360	5321120	possibility of reaching understanding linguistically we can read off a concept of situated reason that
5321120	5327040	is given voice and validity claims that are both context dependent and transcendent. He then
5327040	5333440	approvingly quotes Putnam as saying reason is in this sense both imminent not to be found outside
5333440	5339920	of concrete language games and institutions and transcendent i.e. a regulative idea that we use
5339920	5347280	to criticize the conduct of all activities and institutions. It seems to me that the regulative
5347280	5353760	idea that we we wet liberals we heirs of the enlightenment we socrates most frequently used
5353760	5360960	to criticize the conduct of various conversational partners is the concept of needing education
5360960	5368160	in order to outgrow their primitive fears hatreds and superstitions. This is the concept the victorious
5368160	5374000	allied armies used when they said about reeducating the citizens of occupied Germany and Japan.
5374960	5380000	It's also the one which was used by American school teachers who had read Dewey and were
5380000	5385840	concerned to get students to think scientifically and rationally about such matters as the origin
5385840	5391920	of the species and sexual behavior that is to get the students to read Darwin and Freud without
5391920	5398880	disgust or incredulity. It is a concept which I like most Americans who teach humanities or social
5398880	5404080	science in colleges and universities use when we hope that the students who enter as bigoted
5404080	5410560	religious fundamentalists will leave college with views more like our own. What's the relation of
5410560	5416800	this idea to the regulative idea of reason which Putnam believes to be transcendent and which Habermas
5416800	5422480	believes to be discoverable within the grammar of concepts in a limitable from our description
5422480	5428480	of the making of assertions? The answer to that question depends upon how much the reeducation
5428480	5434400	of Nazis and fundamentalists has to do with merging interpretive horizons and how much with
5434400	5440800	replacing such horizons. The fundamentalist parents of my fundamentalist students think that the
5440800	5447440	entire liberal establishment is engaged in a conspiracy. Had they read Habermas these people
5447440	5452800	would say that the typical communication situation in American college classrooms or at least my
5452800	5459040	classroom is no more hair shots fly no more domination free than that in the Hitler Youth Camp.
5460480	5466640	These parents have a point. Their point is that we liberal teachers no more feel in a symmetrical
5466640	5472160	communication situation when we talk with our fundamentalist students than do kindergarten
5472160	5478560	teachers with their students. In both college classrooms and kindergartens it is equally difficult
5478560	5484560	for the teachers to feel that what is going on is what Habermas calls a convergence steered through
5484560	5491360	learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have
5491360	5496720	to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent.
5497680	5502560	When we American college teachers encounter religious fundamentalists we do not consider the
5502560	5508800	possibility of reformulating our own practices of justification so as to give more authority
5508800	5513840	to the weight of the Christian scriptures more weight to the authority of the Christian scriptures.
5514400	5519120	Instead we do our best to convince these persons of the benefits of secularization.
5519840	5525360	We assign for example first person accounts of growing up homosexual to our homophobic students
5525360	5530560	for the same reasons that German school teachers in the post-war period assigned the diary of Anne
5530560	5537280	Frank. Putnam and Habermas can rejoin that we teachers do our best to be socratic to get our
5537280	5544320	job of reeducation secularization and liberalization done by conversational exchange. That's true up
5544320	5550560	to a point but what about assigning books like Black Boy the Diary of Anne Frank and a Boy's Life.
5551200	5557040	The racist or fundamentalist parents of our students say that in a truly democratic society
5557040	5562400	the students should not be forced to read books by such people. Black people, Jewish people,
5562400	5567360	homosexual people and so on. They'll protest that these books are being jammed down their
5567360	5572960	children's throats. I can't see how to reply to this charge without saying something like
5573520	5579840	there are credentials for admission to our democratic society. Credentials which we liberals
5579840	5586400	have been making steadily more stringent by doing our best to excommunicate racist male chauvinist
5586400	5593760	homophobes and so on. You have to be educated in order to be a citizen of our society, a participant
5593760	5600160	in our conversation, someone with whom we can envisage merging our horizons. So we're going to go
5600160	5605360	right on trying to discredit you in the eyes of your children, trying to strip your fundamentalist
5605360	5611200	religious community of dignity, trying to make your views seem silly rather than discussable.
5611200	5615440	We are not so inclusivist as to tolerate intolerance such as yours.
5616720	5622400	I have no trouble offering this reply because I don't claim to make the distinction between
5622400	5628480	education and conversation on the basis of anything except loyalty to a particular community.
5629040	5635120	A community whose interests required re-educating the Hitler youth in 1945 and re-educating the
5635120	5641920	children of Southwestern Virginia in 1996. I don't see anything hair-shafts fly about my
5641920	5647680	handling of my fundamentalist students. I think those students are lucky to find themselves under
5647680	5654160	the hair-shaft of people like me and have escaped from their rather frightening and dangerous parents.
5655040	5659360	So I think that the handling of such students is a problem for Putnam and Habermals.
5660000	5664960	It seems to me that I'm just as provincial and contextualist as the Nazi teachers who made
5664960	5671120	their students read their stoma. The only difference is that I serve a better cause. I come from a
5671120	5680560	better province. I recognize, of course, that domination-free communication is only a regulative
5680560	5686960	ideal never to be attained in practice. But unless a regulative ideal makes a difference to practice,
5686960	5692480	it isn't good for much. So I ask, is there an ethics of discourse which lets me assign the
5692480	5697680	books I want to assign, but makes no reference to the local and ethnocentric considerations
5697680	5703520	which I should cite to justify my pedagogic practices? Can you get such an ethics out of
5703520	5710240	the notions of reason, truth, and justification, or do you have to load the dyes? Can I invoke
5710240	5717120	universalistic notions in defense of my action as well as local ones? Like McIntyre, Ben Habib,
5717120	5722000	Kelly, and others, I think that you have to smuggle some provinciality into your universals
5722000	5727760	before they do you any good. We think this for the same sorts of reasons as Hegel thought
5727760	5733360	you had to smuggle in some provinciality, some ethical substance, before you could get any use
5733360	5739280	out of Kant's notion of unconditional moral obligation. In particular, you have to smuggle
5739280	5746160	in some rule like no putative contribution to a conversation can be rejected simply because it
5746160	5751680	comes from somebody who has some attribute which can vary independently of his or her opinions
5751760	5758800	and attribute like being Jewish or black or homosexual. I call this rule provincial because
5758800	5763920	it violates the intuitions of a lot of people outside the province in which we heirs of the
5763920	5770320	Enlightenment run the educational institutions. It violates what they would describe as their
5770320	5778160	moral intuitions. I'm reluctant to admit that these are moral intuitions and should prefer to
5778160	5784000	call them revolting prejudices. But I don't think that any in the grammar of the term moral
5784000	5790000	intuition or revolting prejudice helps us to reach agreement on this point, nor can I see
5790000	5795200	that a theory of rationality, abandoning the hopeless quest to talk in philosophy, find
5795200	5800640	politically neutral premises, premises which can be justified to anybody from which to infer
5800640	5806240	an obligation to pursue democratic ethics. Dropping that question would let us admit
5806240	5812320	in Velmer's formula that democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language
5812320	5818320	game, among others. Such an admission would be in line with the Darwinian idea that the
5818320	5823840	inclusivist project is no more rooted in something larger than itself than, say, the project of
5823840	5829840	replacing ideographic by alphabetic writing or representing three spatial dimensions on a two
5829840	5836560	dimensional surface. All three of these were good, immensely fruitful ideas, but none of them need
5836560	5844080	universalistic backup. They can stand on their own feet. If we abandon the idea of philosophy
5844080	5849360	which manages to be both politically neutral and politically relevant, we could start asking the
5849360	5854160	question, given that we want to be ever more inclusivist, what should the public rhetoric of our
5854160	5860000	society be like? How different should it be from the public rhetoric of previous societies?
5861120	5866960	Habermas's implicit answer to this question is that we should hang on to a good many Kantian ideas
5866960	5873600	about the connection between universality and moral obligation. Dewey, however, was willing to move
5873600	5879840	much further away from Kant. Though he would have heartily agreed with Habermas that Aristotle's
5879840	5886240	political vocabulary was unable to capture the spirit of democratic politics, he did not like
5886240	5891520	the distinction between morality and prudence, which Habermas thinks essential, and on this point
5891520	5897520	he would have thought Aristotle preferable. Dewey thought that the Kantian notion of unconditional
5897520	5903680	obligation, like the notion of unconditionality itself and of universality and so far as that
5903680	5909600	idea is implicitly accompanied by that of unconditional necessity, could not survive Darwin.
5910800	5916480	Whereas Habermas thinks that we need what he calls the reconstructive sciences designed to grasp
5916480	5922560	universal competences in order to break out of what he calls the hermeneutic circle in which the
5922560	5928720	geist is fissonshaft and as well as the interpretive social sciences are trapped, Dewey did not feel
5928720	5935040	trapped. This was because he saw no need to resolve attention between facticity and validity.
5935680	5942320	He saw that tension as a philosopher's fiction, as a result of separating out two
5942320	5948160	parts of the situation for no good, that is to say no practical reason, and then complaining that
5948160	5954960	they can't be put back together again. For him, all obligations were situational and conditional.
5956080	5960880	This refusal to be unconditional led Dewey to be charged with relativism.
5961840	5968240	If relativism just means failure to find the use for the notion of context independent validity,
5968240	5976560	then the charge was entirely justified. But no roads lead from this failure to an inability
5976560	5982640	to engage in democratic politics unless one thinks that such politics require us to deny
5982640	5989040	that in Dewey's formula, democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language
5989040	5994640	game among others. The question about universality is for Dewey just the question of whether
5994640	5999920	democratic politics can start from an affirmation rather than a denial of that claim.
6001360	6006720	I don't think we can get much further in debating that question by talking about either modernity
6006720	6011760	or reason. The question of whether Hegel should have stuck to the topic of reason
6012480	6017360	by developing a theory of communicative reason, or should instead have dropped the topic and
6017360	6023120	simply politicized philosophy, is not going to be settled by looking more closely at the grammar
6023120	6029760	of words like true rational and argument. I'm referring here to a passage in Habermas's
6029760	6035280	Philosophical Discourse of Modernity where he says, Hegel had this great opportunity.
6035920	6041120	If he had gone on to become, let us say, random and developed a theory of communicative reason,
6042000	6046480	he would have had it made. But because he was stuck with the philosophy of consciousness,
6046480	6054560	he missed the chance and we had to wait for another 150 years before Habermas and random came along
6054560	6062000	with a theory of communicative reason. Neither is the question of whether philosophers like
6062000	6068480	Annette Beyer are right in suggesting that we set Kant aside and go back to Hume's attempt to
6068480	6075600	describe reason in terms of condition sentiment rather than unconditional obligation. That is,
6075600	6081840	whether Beyer is right in her view of Kant isn't to be settled by thinking harder about what we
6081840	6089520	mean by true rational argument. Although we don't, if I'm right, need a theory of rationality,
6089520	6095600	we do need a narrative of maturation. As I see it, the deepest disagreement between Habermas and
6095600	6100720	myself is about whether the distinction between the unconditional and the conditional in general
6100800	6105680	and the distinction between morality and prudence in particular is a mark of maturity
6105680	6111360	or a transitional stage on the way to maturity. One of the many points on which Dewey agreed
6111360	6117840	with Nietzsche was that it was the latter. Dewey thought that the desire for universality,
6117840	6124000	unconditionality, and necessity was undesirable because it led one away from the practical problems
6124000	6130400	of democratic politics into a never-never land of theory. Kant and Habermas think it's a desirable
6130400	6136080	desire, one which one shares, only when one reaches the highest level of moral development.
6137280	6142080	In this paper, I've tried to show how things look when one puts democratic politics in the
6142080	6148320	context of Dewey's narrative of maturation. I can't offer anything remotely approaching a
6148320	6155360	knockdown argument based on commonly accepted premises for this narrative. The best I could do
6155360	6162080	by way of further defense of my view would be to tell a fuller story, encompassing more topics,
6162080	6167200	in order to show how post-Nichie and European philosophy looks from a Dewey an angle rather
6167200	6173840	than a universalistic one. This is something I've tried to do in bits and pieces in various
6173840	6179520	articles. I think that narratives are a perfectly fair means of persuasion and that Habermas has
6179520	6186080	blocked the philosophical discourse of modernity and Dewey is the quest for certainty, like,
6186080	6195200	for example, Kant's What is Enlightenment and Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history
6195200	6201920	are both admirable illustrations of the power of narratives of maturation. My reasons for
6201920	6207360	preferring Dewey's to Habermas's narrative are not that I think Dewey got truth and rationality
6207360	6212960	right and that Habermas gets them wrong. I think that there's nothing to be gotten right or wrong
6212960	6219600	here. At this level of abstraction concepts like truth, rationality, and maturity are up for grads.
6220320	6225360	The only thing that matters is which way every shaping them will in the long run make them more
6225360	6232000	useful for democratic politics. Concepts are, as Wittgenstein taught us, uses of words.
6232640	6237280	Philosophers have long wanted to understand concepts, but the point is to change them,
6237280	6243360	so as to make them serve our purposes better. Habermas's, Oppel's, Putnam's, and Velmer's
6243360	6248480	linguistification of Kantian concepts is one suggestion about how to make these
6248480	6255600	Kantian concepts more useful. Dewey's and Davidson's thoroughgoing anti-Kantian naturalism is another
6255600	6259200	suggestion.
