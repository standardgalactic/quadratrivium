0	12400	Okay, well, thank you all for coming. I'm John Dupre, as it says on the board. I'm
12400	20040	physically here from the University of Exeter. So, let me start off with a very kind of general
20040	26200	comment about the kind of thing that I'm doing. Actually, as a sort of background, a lot of
26200	33120	people I work with call themselves nowadays philosophers of science in practice, which
33120	37400	sometimes means philosophers of science in practice, and sometimes means philosophers
37400	45000	of science in practice. But either way, people are supposed to be doing something relevant,
45000	52400	connected to science. And I have to say, some of my colleagues sometimes will say, metaphysics,
52400	56400	what's that? Why do we care about that? I thought we're supposed to be concerned with
56400	62400	science and engage with science. Well, so I would just start off by saying that I think
62400	69240	there are many reasons in my mind for being concerned with very general, very abstract
69240	75160	accounts of what we're talking about when or what indeed science is talking about. And
75160	82280	so I'm interested as a philosopher of biology, which is my sort of primary job description,
83160	89560	giving or offering at least a very general account of living things. And I think that
89560	98040	this is really important for biology, that this is in my way of doing things, it's supposed
98040	102840	to be what we sometimes call a naturalistic account. That's to say, a metaphysics grounded
102840	108840	in the science, but also one that feeds back into the science. So we look at, we try and
108880	113520	find out what the world looks like from the point of view of the best science we're currently
113520	118680	doing. And then we might ask whether some bits of science need to pay more attention or perhaps
118680	127680	are using a kind of an outdated or not very defensible view of their subject matter. And
127680	134880	we could perhaps set them back onto the path of truth and goodness and beauty. And I guess
134920	142280	another, you know, apart from all that, as this quote from a much maligned 20th century
142280	149080	philosophy of biology, Joseph Henry Woodyer says, you can't avoid it. You can't do science
149080	154000	without a general picture of what you're talking about. And the general picture of what you're
154000	162680	talking about is what I call metaphysics. Okay. So, so I think there is a constant interaction
162720	170600	between metaphysics, ontology, what there is, what exists, and empirical science. Okay.
170600	176560	So let me just start off with a very brief bit of history. The topic I'm talking about is a
176560	184000	really ancient one that goes back to the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers at least. And here are two
184000	191600	kind of archetypal figures from that period. Parmenides, who is famous for saying change is
191720	200800	an illusion. There is everything is just what it is, and stays that way. And, you know, we kind of
200800	206680	from our very limited perspective, see all kinds of things happening. But really, you know, from,
206680	213160	from a broader point of view, there is just the way things are. The complete opposite view perhaps
213160	219800	was expressed by famously by Heraclitus, the sort of patron saint of process philosophers who said
220080	227200	something like, nothing endures but change. There is only change. And this is, I guess, you
227200	233880	will realize the view that I think at least some version of which I would like to commend to you.
233880	243560	Now, of course, I just say change is an illusion is probably not a very fair, you know, certainly
243560	250520	for a philosopher of science in practice is not a very fair characterization of the alternative to
250520	259600	process metaphysics. So, perhaps we should go rather to Democritus, who allegedly said, nothing
259600	266520	except exists, except atoms and empty space. Everything else is opinion. So, why is this,
266560	275680	this is, is close to the Parmenidian view, because all the really is, is a lot of atoms. And the
275680	281520	atoms are defined as being unchanging. Nothing happens to them. The only thing that changes is
281520	286160	their relation to one another. That's to say, you know, the atoms move around, and then they come
286160	293280	together and form you and me for a, for a tiny instant in eternity. But they don't really change.
293720	300800	All that changes is, is their relations to one another. Okay, so moving on, a millennium and a
300800	309520	half or so, we come to sort of dawn of Western science. And my basic message is, Parmenides,
309520	316240	or at least Democritus, won. And, and we have, and he sort of quotes from, I know I got these
316280	324600	separated from Robert Boyle, one of the better known scientists of that, of the scientific
324600	330960	revolution. The naturalist in explaining particular phenomena considers only the size, shape, motion,
330960	336240	or want of it, texture, and the resulting qualities and attributes of the small particles of matter.
336240	342880	Basically, something very close to the Democritian view. They really are just atoms moving around,
343160	348160	when we want to understand the things that seem to change, the sort of complex structures we
348160	353080	encounter, we really just need to find out what the atoms are doing, how they stick together,
353080	359720	perhaps they nudge one another, and things like that. But, but the things that we encounter at
359720	368560	our kind of spatial and temporal scales are, in some sense, not really real. So what I want to
368560	377120	say in this talk is that Parmenides' victory was a very disastrous one for the future study of
377120	385440	biology, because it's much better to think of the living world in the Heraclitian view as composed
385440	393680	of processes change, as always dynamic, and in no way should we think in terms of the kind of
394280	399920	Parmenidaean, basically there's just atoms moving around in the void way of seeing things.
399920	408560	Okay, so that's about it for history. So what am I going to do in this talk, moving into the
408560	416480	future? So the talk is that all living beings are processes, rather than substances, this is kind
416480	424160	of rather technical term in, in the history of philosophy, that I shall avoid on the whole. And
424160	428920	I just tend to talk about things. Now, of course, there's no really good word that, you know,
428920	435600	that's why we have technical words like substance, but I'll say a bit what I mean by thing. So I mean,
435600	442240	don't, don't just take it absolutely as any interpretation you might have of thing. And I
442240	448760	shall use this to contrast with processes, and I'll explain this more. So, so I'll say I start off
448760	455240	with saying about something about this difference. And then I'll talk about why I think organisms as
455240	463720	one kind of paradigmatic example should be thought of as processes and not as things. I should mention
463720	469920	in passing, I just probably mentioned this again. I am actually very strongly drawn to the view that
469920	475600	it's processes all the way down, that, you know, the even down to, you know, subatomic physics,
475600	482160	it's all processes. But I'm not, I don't feel comfortable defending that view. I mean, it obviously
482160	487280	would take one into some fairly technical bits of physics. I'm pretty comfortable down to the level
487280	495200	of macromolecules. But if you want to go down to, you know, quarks and things and, you know, some,
495760	500720	and you have physical, physical expertise as a physicist, which tells you the quarks really are
501280	508240	atoms as democratists might have thought of them. I won't argue with you, though I could if I really
508240	513440	had to wheel up a few physicists or at least philosophers of physics who would disagree,
513440	519200	but, but that's not my. So if you want to take this, this is, this is really a talk
519680	526320	arguing that life, living things are all living things. It's very hard to avoid the word, which
526320	537200	tells you something that living beings, living systems are processes and not things. And I'll talk
537200	542880	after talking about organisms, I'll talk more briefly about how we might incorporate some other
543200	550080	levels of biological organization and form a general, might we say, metaphysics of life.
550800	555840	And then at the end, I will just say a few things rather briefly about why this matters. Some of
555840	564320	them I'll say a bit more about in further lectures this week. Okay. So first of all, things and
564320	571920	processes. Okay. So what's a thing? So I think this is, this is the philosophical
571920	579920	orthodoxy that the world is made up of things. They are, and they're things specific with properties
579920	585840	we have. And that, that's, I say, as a kind of basis for a great deal of contemporary philosophy,
585840	589440	the world, there are these things in the world and they have various properties.
589840	599360	Particularly, they have, and this, this is, of course, is, is another big area that I won't go
599360	605760	into a great detail. But one kind of properties that's very important in, in this metaphysical
605760	611440	tradition are essential properties, the properties that make the thing a particular thing, either
611440	618960	a particular kind of thing, or the very specific particular thing it is. And, and there are reasons
618960	628880	why it's quite hard to make sense of a ontology of things without appealing to some kind of
628880	635520	essential properties. But again, I won't, I'm happy to talk about this later, but I won't say
635520	640720	much more about that now. Things are autonomous. And this, I think, is something that is really
641760	647920	very important to the tradition of thinking about things. If you have a thing, it could be the only
647920	654800	thing in the universe, right? I mean, it's, it doesn't depend on anything else for its existence,
654800	661120	or for its relations to anything else for its existence. Now, of course, there are maybe some
661120	667040	things that contingently do for reasons of, you know, for kind of for, for specific reasons, a
667040	672880	thing of that kind wouldn't actually continue to exist if it didn't, wasn't related to something
672880	679040	else. But in general, the interesting things, the most important things that we're going to talk
679040	685280	about and, and, and assume in our philosophy of things are things that are autonomous in that
685280	691760	sense. And finally, a thing has reasonably clear boundaries. Now, of course, you know, as always,
691760	696880	one can have a bit of fuzziness, but not too much fuzziness. I mean, there's, we really ought to be
696880	705280	able to, to see where, roughly where it begins and ends. And this is actually important for one, for,
705280	712480	for another reason that a lot of, of, of the discussion of why we should think about things
712480	718720	has to do with counting. We want to know how many things there are. And to be able to divide the
718720	724400	world into a definite number of things requires that we know roughly where one ends and the next
724400	731680	one begins. Okay. And, and I guess I've actually rather oddly arranged because I've gone back to
731680	735600	essential properties. I'm sorry about that in the slide. I don't know quite what I was thinking.
736400	743040	But when I say other properties, what I mean is essential, non essential properties can change.
744320	751280	And, but crucially, when other properties of things change, we typically want an explanation,
751280	756480	because the default for a thing is to stay the same. And I think this is a very important point
756480	761840	for understanding what attracts the interest of scientists. They tend to be interested in
761840	768720	why things change, giving explanations of change, typically by giving causes of change.
768720	774880	Okay. So the default state of a thing is stasis. Now I've got to, you know, here are some examples of
775840	782720	what we classically think of things. As I said, in, in my true view of the world, these are all
782720	788480	probably processes too. But, but I'm not going to argue that today. So I'm going to take, you know,
788480	793760	these very, you know, a bit of furniture is very thing like it certainly has clear boundaries,
794400	802640	doesn't seem to depend on anything else, and so on. Okay. So the question, of course, is whether,
802640	810320	you know, maybe this is a, is a thing. And I guess in, in traditional philosophical thought,
810320	816400	this is a standard, certainly in, if one use the technical word substance, this is a paradigm
816400	823440	example of a substance. And I think it's tends to be thought of in a thing like way. So what about
823520	832400	a process for a process philosophy? Being is dynamic. Everything is changing all the time.
833040	840560	And what we thought of as things, certainly the biological things are, as I like to say, and
840560	846800	not not the only process philosopher who has had this kind of paradigm for this eddies.
846800	852400	Things are eddies in a flux of process, which would think of the world as at its most fundamental
852400	861040	level, just stuff happening. But somehow, and that's the great challenge to understand the world,
861040	868400	somehow out of this flux emerge structures that have more or less stability, never complete
868400	877280	stability. And the stability they have is maintained always by changes by things happening. And
878240	885840	my kind of definition here of a process is for it to continue to exist for a process to carry on,
885840	892000	it has to change, things have to happen. So here's one of my favorite paradigms is I had to
892000	897680	actually, Jupiter was one of my examples of a thing. Here we have the red spot on Jupiter,
897680	902560	which you might have thought was, you know, an island or some kind of, but actually, what we
902640	910720	know is that it is a storm, essentially. It's a storm maintained by winds, very high velocity
910720	917120	winds. And the reason I like this example is ever since we've had telescopes big enough to see it,
917120	924720	the red spot has been there on Jupiter. It changes its shape, you know, but that's about 400 years,
924720	932320	I think, that we've observed this entity, which as I say, looks from a distance. You might be
932400	937440	a thing, but it's actually a process. If it stopped, if the wind stopped flowing around it,
937440	942800	if the activity stopped, it would rapidly dissipate. And then here's some more
944000	951200	typical kind of examples of processes. A river, which I guess was Heraclitus, most famous example,
951200	957120	you probably all heard the saying from Heraclitus, which I won't try and discuss, though again,
957120	961360	we could bring it up that you can never step into the same river twice. He didn't actually quite
961360	965680	say that, or nobody knows what he quite said, but he probably didn't. Nobody actually thinks he
965680	972320	quite said that and so on, but that's what he's the most famous for. And then, of course, finally,
972320	979520	we move on to the most un-thing-like processes. I have an example of a battle, which clearly,
979520	986080	if everybody stops fighting, there's no more battle, right? So this is a very clearly fits
986080	992720	this definition. And again, of course, we can ask whether these paradigmatic organisms are
993600	1001680	processes, which of course is my thesis. So just to summarize, we have a conception of a thing
1001680	1006720	as integrated. I didn't actually talk about that, but I guess it's almost implicit. It's always so
1006720	1013680	obvious to say things and perhaps follows from the boundaries. Independent, not dependent on,
1013680	1019760	for its existence, on anything else, stable by default and has definite boundaries. Now,
1019760	1025920	none of these is necessary or even typical for processes. Processes persist through activity,
1025920	1034960	i.e. they are not stable by default. And this is the strongest contest I make as against things
1034960	1039200	for which the default condition is stasis. And again, this is something I think has
1039200	1043920	some real practical implications for how we should think about some scientific problems.
1044800	1052160	So just a quote from one of the, well, actually two mentioned here of the most prominent contemporary
1052160	1058160	defendants of Processed Philosopher, Nicholas Rescher. And then the Stanford Encyclopedia,
1058160	1066880	his article was updated by Nicholas Rescher, by John Assyk. As process ontologists see it,
1066880	1072160	enduring things are never more than patterns of stability in a sea of process. So that's really
1072160	1080560	the thesis. And by process, I understand again, something, and I often notice the embarrassment
1080560	1086800	that in English, one can't help saying something, anything, everything, all the time when one's
1086800	1095120	trying to say there are no things. So please forgive this linguistic annoyance. Some entity,
1095200	1100320	which just doesn't work in English, for which change or activity is necessary for it to continue
1100320	1109200	to be the kind of entity it is. Okay. So one last sort of preliminary note, many people will
1109760	1117360	associate Processed Philosophy with Alfred North Whitehead, who is certainly the most famous
1117920	1125440	recent advocate of Processed Philosophy. And I certainly don't want to demean the contributions
1125440	1134080	of Whitehead, which were many including this. But I really want to bypass Whitehead in my work
1134080	1142240	for a couple of reasons. One is he is notoriously difficult to understand, possibly obscure. He
1142240	1148320	also has some views tied in with his Processed Philosophy that I don't want to endorse. I mean,
1149120	1155840	I guess panpsychism, maybe sometimes I feel a little tiny pull in that direction, but it's
1155840	1165440	fairly small. I'm not comfortable with it, certainly, or theology, which again, as I suppose, is
1165440	1170880	quite widely associated with Processed Theology, but with Processed Philosophy, but not in my
1171680	1178640	view of the world. And I guess finally, to be rather mean to Whitehead, I don't really think he's
1178640	1185520	a Processed Philosopher. And that's because I think he has an atomistic view of processes.
1186640	1196720	So any of you here who are Whitehead aficionados, he has little things called occasions, actual
1196800	1205520	occasions, things which look to me a bit like unchanging atoms which make up the processes.
1205520	1213280	And I don't think we need or want such things. Anyhow, again, no disrespect to an important
1213280	1221040	contributor, but I find it easier to reinvent wheels sometimes than try and figure out where the
1221040	1229680	wheel is underneath all the mud in a very overused kind of vest. This has gone much too far. Okay,
1229680	1238720	right. So organisms and why organisms are processes. So I think there are three reasons
1238720	1243520	for thinking organisms are process, each of which is sufficient. And together, we really,
1243520	1249760	really shouldn't have any debate about this. So first of all, organisms, we all know,
1249840	1255760	are dynamically stabilized. They are systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, right? That's
1256800	1260640	it's, you know, one of the puzzles for understanding life has always been
1260640	1269280	how something so thermodynamically improbable stays around. And of course, we know the answer to this
1269280	1274960	is through, I mean, in outline, there's a constant turnover of matter, organisms take in
1274960	1281600	matter and energy, and they process it, and they process it to maintain their structures and their
1281600	1290800	functions. And so it's the very nature of such a system, far from thermodynamic equilibrium,
1290800	1299040	that it's doing stuff to maintain itself as what it is. Second, organisms have life cycles.
1299600	1306800	They, they are not even apparently constant structures. In fact, they have a sequence
1306800	1313680	of different stages, sometimes quite dramatically different from one another. And third, and this
1313680	1321680	is, I think, is actually the thing that, that the aspect that really led me into process thinking
1321680	1329440	was realizing the omnipresence of symbiosis, and that actually organisms stabilize themselves,
1329440	1335920	not merely by what they do, their own taking in energy and processing it, but through their
1335920	1343520	relations to many other organisms, cooperative relations, which I guess, you know, we mostly,
1343520	1348560	we know, perhaps best through what we've all learned recently about our gut,
1349440	1355040	microbiomes, but of course we have lots of other organisms we're related to in many other
1355040	1360640	different ways. And I'll say more about all of these. So, so let me just go through these quickly,
1360640	1367200	not much really to say more about this. Organisms are thermodynamically open systems,
1367200	1374000	far from equilibrium, and this implies that they are not independent, they require constant input
1374000	1383200	from the environment, type of the, nor stable by default. I, if an organism doesn't do anything,
1383200	1387680	I mean, if nothing happens, you know, there's trillions of things happening inside all of us,
1387680	1394000	and every second, if those stop happening, we cease, we become dead organisms, and if we stop
1394000	1399600	taking in matter from the environment, we also more slowly become dead organisms. In fact,
1399680	1406240	if you count oxygen, we quite quickly become dead organisms. So, it's, it's, they're certainly not,
1406240	1411520	you know, independent autonomous entities. Secondly, they are developmental processes,
1412320	1416240	and I just give an example, which will all be quite familiar, possibly not the
1416800	1422400	wonderful sea creature, I don't know what that is, Medusa, on the bottom, there are some sea
1422400	1429360	creatures just have wonderful life cycles. But my point is that properties change dramatically
1429360	1434720	over the life cycle. They were all very used to the idea that the egg and the caterpillar and the
1434720	1441680	pupa and the adult are the same organism, but if we were trying to understand how that could be
1442240	1446800	the same thing, and there could be some essential property that said this is some same
1447520	1456000	entity going through all these drastic changes, it's quite a struggle. And I don't know if I might
1456560	1463280	go to this later, but people sometimes think we may be answered to that with the genome,
1463280	1470320	happy to talk about this, but just let me, just two things, genomes are highly dynamic,
1470320	1476560	of course, but also there are lots of genomes in an organism, and they're not all the same by any
1476560	1483360	means, and for various reasons. So, I could, I can certainly talk more about that if anybody
1483440	1490480	would like to become a genome essentialist and defend the, that is a way of saying an organism
1490480	1500400	is a thing at least against this objection. So, organisms don't persist by default, but as quite
1500400	1506080	often happens for process, they persist, well, sorry, as always happens for organisms, they persist
1506080	1512960	by some kind of causal continuity, but this is consistent with going through drastically
1512960	1518640	different stages. And somebody in the seminar this morning brought up the example of a party
1518640	1523760	as a process where parties can be lively at one point, and then most people can leave, and they
1523760	1529040	can be really desultory, and nobody's really saying anything, and nobody thinks the party is
1529840	1535600	absolutely ended because it stops being lively, or people stop dancing. We're used to the idea
1535600	1540960	that processes can go through changes. These are rather more dramatic changes, perhaps, I mean,
1540960	1548480	from a, from a pupa to an adult insect is about as dramatic a change as you could easily imagine,
1548480	1553760	and yet we have no trouble in the idea that just the causal continuity of the process
1554960	1564000	leads us to say that this is still the same organism. Finally, symbiosis, and I just got some,
1564800	1573120	you know, a few randomly selected illustrations here, but, you know, the basic point is that we
1573120	1581440	now think pretty much all organisms, you know, there are some, some sort of a few things floating
1581440	1586880	around in the oceans that maybe don't have much to do with anything else, but on the whole organisms
1586880	1595920	are symbiotic. The famous one that, you know, has heard of humans, and there's a debate whether,
1595920	1601760	you know, something between 50 and 90 percent of the cells in a human body are not what we
1601760	1611840	used to call human cells, they're microbial cells. Trees have amazingly complex, or plants generally,
1611840	1618640	relations to bacteria and fungi, there are whole these amazingly complex systems that interact
1618640	1624000	with the roots, the fungi actually kind of live inside the roots and then through and out into,
1624000	1630160	send their hyphae out into the surrounding soil where they interact with consortia of bacteria,
1630160	1637520	all processing the materials going in and out, and indeed, as now quite famously, passing material
1638080	1645040	down the hyphae networks to other plants in their vicinity, sometimes plants of different species,
1645040	1655840	so the degree of interconnectedness in complex botanical systems is stunning, and I guess, you
1655840	1662000	know, we often see the mushrooms that come out of these systems, but if we once thought that they
1662000	1670400	were kind of independent autonomous organisms, now realizing their very complex, intimate relations
1670400	1674720	to the plants, they live around, see something quite different, and I don't think I'll go into the
1674720	1683440	insects, that's another nice system that's been much studied, so autonomous is not a word that
1683440	1689600	really applies well to any organ, or any but a very small minority at any rate of organisms.
1690560	1696160	Okay, and so I just, you know, I like this a lot, so I just give one example,
1697120	1704400	which leads to a thesis that I like to kind of use to illustrate the significance,
1704400	1710400	in one significance of this process, your perspective. So here's one of the most successful
1710400	1718720	organisms in a typical forest environment, leaf cutter ants, I won't go too much into the biology,
1718720	1722080	but you can see here's a picture of them carrying off little bits of leaf
1722880	1729600	into their colonies, where they go various different casts, some carry the leaves,
1729600	1736800	some defend the colony, some look after the insides of the colony in various different ways,
1738160	1745120	but more interestingly, inside the colonies there are things that you can think of as the stomach
1745120	1752000	of the whole system, whether leaves are processed by specialist fungi, actually by specialist fungi,
1752560	1759680	and that depend themselves on consortia of bacteria, there are different consortia in other
1759680	1767600	parts of the system, and it turns out actually that I mentioned insects and some of their
1767600	1774960	obligate symbionts while back here are very well known when they actually also involved in
1774960	1783360	these ants, and kind of rather interestingly in some cases the while back here determine the sex
1783360	1790240	of the ants, so if you're looking for some organisms that's running the system since it's
1790240	1796960	really quite important, which what the sex of the ants are, and the cast of the ants, it may be the
1796960	1803360	while back here that are really running it as little micro reduced bacterial symbionts inside
1803360	1810000	the ants, I don't think anybody has studied the role of viruses, but almost certainly viruses
1810000	1814240	are involved, I think they're involved in pretty much any system, I'm not sure if I can mention
1814240	1821200	that further today, and so what I want to say is there's lots of ways you could sort out an organism
1821200	1827200	here, people will often say the colony is a super organism, sort of technical term, but it's a
1827200	1835120	very well integrated whole, the individual ants look most like organisms, but people often say
1835120	1840000	well they're so far from autonomous, I mean most of them are not sexual, so they can't
1840800	1846480	reproduce themselves, but also they can't, I mean there's nothing they can do to survive on their own,
1847440	1855680	you might think of the fungal stomach as an organism, a just a specialized organism for
1855680	1863040	living inside ant colonies, because I mean it's nothing, it's not related by descent to the ants,
1863040	1870800	it's a collaboration that's come together over time, and so on, so I mean there are many ways
1870800	1876640	you can carve, and of course you know there are questions at each point whether you include the
1877360	1884480	obligate microbial symbionts as part of the organisms or not, there are many different ways
1884480	1894080	you could carve up this flow of biological activity into organisms, which I call this
1894720	1901760	thesis of promiscuous individualism, and I won't go into some of you may know I have a
1902720	1907360	somewhat similar system view, which I call promiscuous realism about kinds,
1908560	1915520	but basically this thesis is just organisms are abstracted from this flux for particular
1915520	1923040	reasons according to what you're interested in, why you're doing it. Okay so processes,
1924080	1930080	and I just want to say this is quite characteristic of a lot of processes, processes intertwine with
1930080	1938560	one another in quite complex ways and have quite indeterminate boundaries, this is quite natural
1938560	1945200	for processes, very hard to understand things as entangled in this sort of way with one another,
1945600	1952720	and I you know I come back to the sort of example famous from Heraclitus of the river,
1952720	1960000	and I think you know the way rivers keep constantly changing, merging, separating is actually
1960000	1966640	remarkably similar in some ways to the way organisms, particularly the evolutionary
1966640	1972480	flow of organisms, but also just the flow of organisms in a complex system like the ant colony
1973040	1981600	can be thought of. Okay so biology is all process and another crucial thing to understand
1982240	1989680	is that this process has multiple timescales, so evolution I guess being the slowest timescale
1989680	1995680	which can be we can think of in terms of you know many millions of years, development which
1995760	2006320	can take from minutes to decades, and I guess something that maybe I should should say I hope
2006320	2013280	it's obvious in a sense it is the developmental system or cycle which is the the entity that evolves,
2014080	2020320	so you couldn't evolve just you know an ant caterpillar, I'm sorry a butterfly caterpillar,
2021280	2026080	you could what has evolved is the system, the caterpillar can't exist except as part of this
2026640	2037200	flow of process through the various stages. Metabolism at much faster rates is a great
2037200	2044320	number of processes that keep the parts of the system running, keeping them in
2045120	2054400	stable in non-thermal, far from thermal equilibrium at many different rates.
2055760	2064960	So all of the entities that one might think of in a hierarchy of biological systems are processes
2064960	2072320	at these various timescales and one of the really fascinating things in trying to get a
2072320	2078000	big picture of biology is understanding how these timescales interact, how the processes at these
2078000	2087360	different timescales build up or down to interconnect and maintain the stability of the whole flow.
2088400	2092720	So what is an organism? Now it's a horrible thing that I think I've never done before
2092720	2098080	which is that philosophers sometimes do is when they want to break up words into bits
2098960	2105280	put little subscripts on them, so I apologize but it just did seem it's a natural way of
2105280	2114960	doing it. One of the, so if you ask most biologists what they mean by an organism,
2114960	2120080	they will say something like I think what I said by organism, by organism sub one.
2120640	2125040	So there are bacteria which are single-celled organisms and then there are multicellular
2125040	2134160	organisms which typically or perhaps always come about from a starting cell which divides
2134880	2140480	multiple times, differentiates, the cells differentiate and we end up with a multicellular
2140480	2149920	organism. Basically all cells with roughly the same genetic constitution, I say roughly because
2150880	2158320	that's problematic. But when we actually look at the systems that I've been looking at we see
2158320	2166480	that actually these, a real organism moving around contains cells from many different sources
2166480	2171760	that combine to form a functional system or the one that really interacts with the rest of the
2171760	2178320	biological world. So I'll call this an organism two and as I say living systems typically involve
2178400	2186000	a complexly intertwined interaction between many distinct organisms one and this of course is
2186000	2192240	why defining the boundaries of organisms two which is I think is the most fundamental sense
2192800	2199360	is very difficult, undetermined and interest relative because you know that there are different
2199360	2206160	levels of interconnectedness between the various processes that interact but it is these very
2206160	2214240	roughly defined systems with somewhat indeterminate boundaries that I think what we mean when we
2214240	2220480	refer to organisms. When I you know point to a cow I don't mean as I say that's a cow I don't mean
2220480	2226240	apart from all the bacteria in its four stomachs. I mean the whole thing that walks around and
2226240	2235920	processes grass. So and this is actually something that I formulate in a particular way
2236160	2242960	as what an organism or what indeed a biological system is is the intersection between lineages
2242960	2251440	and the metabolic intersection of various biological lineages produces these stable
2251440	2258160	thing-like organisms and the stabilization you know facilitates of these processes in turn
2258160	2263040	facilitate the persistence of the lineage. I haven't really talked about that I'll get onto that a bit
2263040	2270160	later. So here's the sort of picture in the middle of the picture we have a traditional
2270160	2278000	kind of thing-like view of how I think it's still very common to think of the biological world
2278000	2283520	is a hierarchy of things that are put together to form bigger things so molecules making cells
2283520	2291120	cells making tissues organs so on. What I want to say is that these are actually all processes
2291760	2298240	processes synchronized between different time scales and crucially processes that
2298960	2306320	the synchronization is both from above and from below so the traditional picture that I'm arguing
2306320	2314080	against tends to be really bottom up the molecules explain how the cells work and then when you
2314080	2318560	know how the cells work you can put them together to form tissues and so on but I just you know
2318640	2324480	looking right in the middle and it was something like the heart we all know actually that of
2324480	2330400	course the heart has a physiology it's made of certain kinds of cells that you know oscillate
2330400	2336880	in certain kinds of ways but we also know that if the organism doesn't take its proper exercise and
2336880	2344960	eat its five portions of vegetables a day that it won't function very well so actually the persistence
2344960	2353040	of the organ depends entirely on its positioning within a more complex system that it's part of
2353040	2359680	and of course we could also say well the organisms would not persist if they were not
2359680	2367280	part of lineages that keep throwing them out and so on so all along I think that we should look at
2367280	2374800	not only the way the components at the lower level interact to get the behaviors of things
2374800	2380560	at the higher level but also the way the embedding in the higher level systems actually
2382400	2388640	helps to explain the properties of the components themselves okay so
2390560	2400080	so I guess what I want to say is that that's basically it that that's my summary of of what
2400160	2406720	the difference between a thing and a process is and why organisms and in fact
2407600	2418080	everything along the the hierarchy of biological complexity is is really best seen as a process
2419040	2425840	I just want to now just say a few things about some implications that this has for
2426720	2437040	what we should how we should think about some quite significant problems the first one to say is
2437040	2447600	medicine it's I think extremely standard to think of medical medicine in relation to the organism
2447600	2454880	as a mechanism a mechanism that has you know the set of parts that interact with one another to
2454880	2462880	produce healthy existence and something gets broken right we have to figure so what we do is
2462880	2468800	first of all figure out what the broken part is and figure out how we're going to fix it and of
2468800	2476960	course you know sometimes that works very well if you break your leg and you can't walk we we
2476960	2483840	quite rightly think the best way forward is to try and get the leg to join together and restore
2483840	2489360	its structural integrity and then you could with luck walk again so it's not that there's nothing
2490720	2498880	nothing right about this it's just that it's I think a very limited perspective because I think
2498880	2506320	from a process perspective the the the central mission of medical research is rather to understand
2506960	2513680	the processes that stabilize human life cycles at these various time scales and develop interventions
2513680	2519680	that maintain fortify or of course sometimes restore these processes I remember years and years
2519680	2525200	ago somebody told me and it I don't know whether it's true or not and it didn't mean much apart
2525200	2531440	from being memorable at the time that in Chinese medicine you pay your doctor as long as you don't
2531440	2539920	get sick if you get sick then you stop paying your doctor that came back to me I just thought
2539920	2545840	that is quite wonderful that is exactly how medicine should work of course you know and I
2545840	2552000	guess you contrast it with you know the power the opposite paradigm which I guess I think lived in
2552000	2558400	the US American medicine is desperately trying to invent sicknesses so that you can be paid you
2558400	2567120	pay somebody to say you don't have them anymore I'm a bit simplistic I know but but it does seem
2567120	2580240	to me that that if you if you accept the view that the default of a process is actually ceasing
2580240	2588160	to persist I mean that that process is persist by doing things then you shouldn't have this you know
2588160	2595360	that this is very different in its implications from the mechanistic view and I think my my my
2596320	2600160	favorite illustration I'm favorite I mean sounds if I love this stuff I mean I don't mean this you
2600160	2609520	know and I like it kind of way but I think the the the the illness that makes this clearest to me
2609520	2616880	is cancer so let me just say a little bit about this so when you think about human development
2616880	2625600	which is by which I don't just mean you know like zero to 15 I mean minus three quarters to
2626480	2634400	however long you live is a process of human development and as we we certainly know the
2635040	2642160	this process involves this constant and massive division differentiation and disposal of cells
2642160	2650640	right we you know the all through the life cycle we are cells dividing at various different rates
2650640	2658640	and at certain points differentiating so that we have different organs and and and so on and and
2658640	2665600	there's also we we we now know they're a process of time times at which cells are disposed of they've
2665600	2673920	outlived their usefulness now if you just try and imagine how exquisitely this process is timed
2673920	2683600	to enable a human to go through a life cycle if it goes wrong if this doesn't happen right a lot of
2683600	2690560	the things that go wrong are things we call cancer i.e cells are not being disposed of as they should
2690560	2696160	or cells are dividing when they shouldn't or cells are differentiating in ways that they're not
2696160	2700000	supposed to i don't have you ever seen some of these appalling cancers where you have little
2700000	2708960	bits of organs in a tumor um a little bit of yes one yeah yeah quite quite one seed never forgotten
2710560	2718480	but um yeah that's sort of thing feet and near here and a bit of yeah um but i mean it's it's
2718480	2725040	once yeah i think you you you get your mind around the the perfection of this process in a certain
2725040	2732160	way i mean obviously it's um there's much more to be said about that too um it's the amazing thing
2732160	2739360	is that most of the time we don't have you know seriously harmful cancers of course actually we
2739360	2746160	all we do have you know incipient cancers all the time um throughout our bodies but most of the time
2746160	2753920	we manage to suppress these and carry on through the normal life cycle um so cancer we should
2753920	2760400	assume as we of course now know is multi-causal there is no you know cause of cancer there are
2760400	2769040	countless things that make us more likely to um to to experience cancers um and the way this is
2769040	2774960	so i'd say the general problem is is to explain why we often don't get cancer rather than why
2774960	2781920	we sometimes do and how we maintain our developmental process on something i mean i'm
2781920	2787920	putting quotes because normal is such a terrible word in biology but on something that let's say a
2787920	2794960	healthy path um so and i think there are conclusions for this that that there is i don't think we're
2794960	2803200	going to find a cure for cancer i mean this seems like um this would just be extraordinarily improbable
2803200	2811840	because as if somehow after you know evolution has spent all these billions of years refining this
2811840	2816160	system we're suddenly going to say something okay but it's a bit unreliable here's something that's
2816160	2823760	going to make it 100 reliable that's not going to happen but um but there may be many cures for
2823760	2829680	many cancers which of course is rather the way we're going and i think it at least provides a
2829680	2837920	perspective that could help us think about this question in new ways um and i'm not a cancer
2837920	2847040	scientist so that i need throw that out as um a general optimistic view so um here's another one
2847040	2855760	that i've i've done a little bit more on two um viruses now viruses are for me a kind of paradigm
2855760	2861280	process if you hear people talking about viruses i think they often imagine that there are these
2861280	2867920	little things floating around the world that are viruses and you run into one or two or maybe a
2867920	2875120	bunch of them and um then they do something horrible to you well there's something true about that
2875120	2881440	there is a stage in the viral process which is the very inert stage the virion which is a little
2881440	2890640	thing that gets you know um churned out by a virus um reproducing in a host and can start the
2890640	2898720	process that that process in um some other organism but actually um if you follow the
2898720	2905600	life cycle of a virus the virion ceases to exist for the active part of the viral life cycle i
2905600	2914400	it goes into the cell all kinds of biochemistry happen you know the the the the the protein
2914400	2923760	manufacturing mechanisms get co-opted they make proteins for new viruses and eventually the cell
2925520	2931840	typically dissolves and a bunch of new virions comes out so the virions then don't do anything
2931840	2940320	until they hit another suitable cell that they can they can infect so there is nothing that runs
2940320	2947360	through the life cycle of a virus even actually you know you might think that even the genomes
2947360	2956480	don't always do this they for example switch between dna and rna forms sometimes they sit
2956480	2963360	inside the host genome for periods when is that a virus if there's a little bit of the host genome
2963360	2969680	doing nothing that's just sitting there as dna which is waiting to turn into an rna virus at
2969680	2978640	some time in the i mean um at anyway it's um it's extremely um improbable to try and think of
2978720	2986720	of a thing undergoing changes there's a there's a thing like entity that then initiates a very
2986720	2993200	un-thing like process at the end of which is a bunch more thing like entities but the virus is
2993200	3002000	surely the whole life cycle not just the inert stage of its operation so i think instead we
3002000	3009280	should think rather of a flow of dna passing through organisms sometimes sticking um and actually
3010080	3017840	i think since i uh wrote this slide um and this is another one coming which is in which case i'm
3017840	3024240	sorry if i'm anticipating i don't think i um it turns out actually that that some some things that
3025200	3033760	i didn't know make this perspective actually even more appealing which is that it turns out actually
3033760	3041600	that the infecting virus very often isn't a single virion it's actually people talk about viral
3041600	3049760	clouds quasi species and a lot of times it turns out that the infectivity of a virus depends on
3049840	3058800	properties of the population of viruses by which you're infected and actually the variations
3058800	3066640	across the population are what um defeat the immune system in a very complex set of interactions
3066640	3075680	which has a huge evolutionary history um and and so actually i mean and and i guess this this may be
3075760	3080160	something that's kind of been a little puzzling if you have the sort of simple view of the virus
3080720	3087120	as you know one particle gets into your cell and then releases all these other virions you think one
3087840	3093280	one virus would be enough to get you sick one virion now sometimes in some cases that's true in
3093280	3101520	others as as we i think learned in covid um actually it's very important how large a dose you get
3101520	3110160	and that's actually to do with the probably the diversity within the population of viruses that
3110160	3120320	infects you so actually the process of viruses interacting with hosts can often be a population
3120320	3125760	level phenomenon rather than an individual level phenomenon again something that's a much more
3125760	3132800	natural thought in terms of this flow picture i think than in terms of a thing with nasty properties
3134160	3141280	and i guess the final thing that i that i think is um you know it's now becoming increasingly clear
3142320	3148400	and again i think is um within this broader picture should be totally unsurprising
3148960	3156880	is that viruses mostly of course are harmless but actually many of them are probably functional
3156880	3165360	and essential and in fact maybe the outnumbering the cells in your body are the viruses that you
3165360	3173200	require for the function the stability of your system in particular one obvious way in this they
3173200	3179920	do this is by regulating the bacterial populations most of the viruses in your body are phages that's
3179920	3189040	to say viruses that um that um the hosts of which are bacteria and the numbers of phages in your
3189040	3196240	body makes it seem very likely that they have important roles in um stabilizing the different
3196240	3203360	the relations between the different sorts of organisms in your body i just lost the okay
3205120	3213120	okay so some conclusions um i think i'm argue that our thinking about life is actually hampered
3213760	3220960	by is grounding in the world view that since the scientific revolution has driven a great
3220960	3229360	deal of scientific thought basically a picture of things pushing pulling one another stuck together
3229360	3240480	to form mechanisms machine like connections of these entities so life isn't you know like this
3240480	3247440	sort of put all the bits together and the machine starts to go it's this really hard one constantly
3247440	3255120	maintained moment of structure and stability that emerges somehow and of course it doesn't emerge
3255120	3260960	you know the moment you're born it's emerged over billions of years of evolution from this
3260960	3270800	surrounding ocean of broadly directionless activity and i think realizing this should give us a very
3270800	3279600	different view of many aspects of life and even of ourselves and that's what i will hope to convince
3279600	3287120	any of you who come back for more in the course of this week in the next and the rest of this series
3287120	3294800	of lectures but for now i just end with if you are interested in this here's a place to go and
3294800	3300960	find out more and i'm happy to do this because this is an open access book anybody can read
3300960	3305760	it and so i'm not trying to make money off royalties or anything that is sad sorry thing
3305760	3312640	state for an academic to be in if i were but um but this is um uh this is where to look
3313360	3316000	for more on many of these topics
3325360	3332240	right so i will um take questions i'm i'm i'm instructed to ask if you could make your
3332240	3340080	questions as short as you can because i've been asked to try and summarize them before answering
3340080	3349760	them and um so um yeah i saw you first and then yeah so thank you for the wonderful talk so um
3350560	3358720	i think i'd buy the picture when we're looking at biology and then the question is um how would the
3358720	3372240	dialectic with uh your non-process opponent go concerning other things and um uh and one way
3372240	3379280	to phrase that would be to say whether one could somehow eat some of what you get from process
3379280	3388400	philosophy within a thing ontology but with processes so he would be distorted on on the
3388400	3396080	t-shirt of that view uh so it would be organisms involve processes but they are not processes
3396080	3401280	as it were so they involve processes but they're not so you have this sort of thing view there
3401280	3405600	are various processes going on and you say these processes connected with the organisms
3405600	3411520	which is their thing and the difference between draw view and that view seems to be that you
3411520	3416800	identify the organism straight forward with the processes whereas this you get acknowledges that
3416800	3422400	you have multiple processes all these things that you don't talk about just resist the identification
3422400	3428080	we don't go into the reasons for why there's the resistance but um what would you say to this
3428560	3437440	um okay so i i i um i have some sympathy with that question and i guess the sympathy i have
3437440	3447920	is um that i can see why one might want to just introduce a new term right so so i think there's
3447920	3456240	that you know the things i contrast it with things substances really carry philosophical
3456240	3464640	baggage that has really been unhelpful in thinking about life so i want i want to suggest that
3466000	3474080	the reason that that that what unites this unhelpful baggage is its kind of statusism
3474080	3480880	the fact that it's it's doesn't adequately involve the fact that the the properties we're interested
3480880	3492160	in are outputs of all kinds of activity now you might say but now we've got um and i think
3492160	3500720	this is earlier today it's somewhat similar it is you might say well okay so so organisms
3502000	3508560	are very unlike traditional or or or many of don't share many of the properties that have
3508560	3513760	traditionally been paradigmatic of things substances in the philosophical tradition
3513760	3521280	but on the other hand they're not terribly like what we used to think of as processes i um your
3521280	3526880	example i showed was that i mentioned was the party or i had a picture of a battle um or when you
3526880	3536240	know or the erosion of a cliff or you know there there are sort of processes that um seem as if
3536240	3547520	they are necessarily happenings that happen to things so maybe we should have uh maybe we
3547520	3552960	should have the things but then of course if some of the things aren't at all like traditional things
3552960	3557760	maybe we don't want to say that we don't want to say the organisms are things we don't want to say
3557760	3562400	their process so maybe we can call them something else you know we can come up with a word for them
3563280	3571120	my personal feeling well for i guess for two reasons one is it's always a kind of uphill struggle
3571120	3577200	um you know inventing a whole new category and saying that um you know we need to start thinking
3577200	3583120	in terms of a kind of category of an ontological category that we didn't really know existed
3583120	3588880	before but the other thing is there is a tradition here i mean i you know i i may have sound as if
3588880	3599120	there was basically hieroclitus whiteheader than me um and i certainly don't mean to say that um i mean
3599120	3605040	and for example um one of the things my collaborator on this book Dan Nicholson has done a great
3605040	3614320	deal of work on is the um early 20th century biology which was um was inspired actually by
3614320	3621680	whitehead people like waddington um and various actually who i mentioned at that point um was
3621680	3630560	involved with it so a bunch of of um biologists who have tried to articulate a process ontology
3630560	3637040	and i think there's there's a little historical story that actually if you look at the 20th century
3637040	3644720	up to about let's say 1953 you have um you have a lot of theoretical biology that's process
3644720	3654640	directed and then 1953 as everybody probably knows with the structure of dna was um published
3655280	3666640	and this initiated an extraordinarily productive but in some way misguided um his chapter in the
3666640	3674320	history of biology we found out a huge amount but that also embedded um a lot of really misleading
3674320	3681200	views notably the view that biology was basically just all you know run by these little bits of
3681200	3688640	dna which we now know is completely wrong the wonderful molecules dna but it doesn't it's not a
3689280	3696400	blueprint and it's not a master molecule it's just part of a complex system um and um
3696480	3702880	and i think so so so i don't think we need to go outside the tradition and invent something new
3702880	3712400	i think we need to you know reclaim a lot of the pre dna biology and then and and and actually
3712400	3718560	and it's easy to do that in a way because we know much now we know actually lots of things about
3719120	3725520	dna that make us see it's a thoroughly active molecule that's constantly doing things changing
3726240	3733040	changing its shape changing its chemical structure um you know it's it's as dynamic as i mean
3733040	3739360	there are aspects of it that are importantly very stable but even them they're not stable
3739360	3745280	because it's a very stable molecule they're stable also because there's a whole host of systems
3745280	3753520	that stabilize it that repair the sequence when it gets damaged and so on so i think um that picking
3753520	3761680	up this this thread and saying actually you know these these process oriented biologists prior to
3761680	3769200	i say the second half of the 20th century were so right about the basic metaphysics even if you
3769200	3776800	know the quite different view has been very productive we should pick it up and and reassert
3776800	3784080	the processual nature of of of life right uh yeah i i've got lots of questions but
3785040	3789280	great thanks for a great talk and it's all right if anything might be
3789280	3794080	having a little bit of fun in some ways so this is a relatively simple thing but um
3794800	3799120	basically i was wondering why do you think they cancer being more affordable means that they're
3800080	3806400	so let me illustrate what i mean um i use this distinction that you can be quite helpful in
3806400	3811200	philosophy of medicine so it's something that i call sort of contributing cause of factors and
3811200	3819360	then realizing cause of factors so um namely you may have lots of different not things but lots
3819360	3824560	lots of different causes contributing to the appearance of some sort of phenomenal whatever
3824560	3829920	but then it could happen this is maybe where this might be used for in some ways you could have a
3829920	3834720	process that kind of instantiates the thing if you like so it namely realizes it and just in the
3834720	3842720	system um and so uh you know one of the most promising paradigm for something like cancer is
3842720	3849280	this framework that i mentioned earlier briefly um so basic vision and in that kind of framework
3849280	3855920	you may well have various you know a whole range of reasons for this bioelectric communication
3855920	3862240	to break down right but the ultimate sort of realizing thing that you target would be
3863040	3869120	communication breaking down right and so in that case as long as you manage to kind of
3869120	3876160	re re-establish it you would be getting rid of cancer right so i mean basically i definitely
3876160	3882240	think that cancer being multi-posal in the sense of contributing cause of factors means that prevention
3882240	3886160	would have to be multiple multiple in that sense right like you couldn't just
3886880	3892320	decide on one course of action and prevent that but treatment seems to be rather different
3892320	3897040	because i think in in most cases it targets something closer to realizing cause of factors
3897040	3905680	so yeah i was wondering oh well i think it probably depends how broadly you interpret
3905680	3912560	communication breaking down um and if you interpret it sufficiently broadly um i mean
3912560	3918960	this is always the case where you's where with with um sort of pluralistic arguments i mean
3918960	3926000	you could you can make the terminology sufficiently inclusive to include all the things that a
3926000	3934720	pluralist would like to break down but it seems to me that taking as i hear your question that there
3934720	3945200	is one particular kind of relation that um the failure of which is what we call cancer
3946320	3953200	i mean so that that's the the monistic reading of that and if i took it that way i would say
3953200	3963120	that seems really improbable for the reason that i i tried to give that the articulation of all these
3963120	3971440	cellular divisions differentiations and deaths that constitutes a healthy life cycle is not
3972480	3982000	constituted by one single kind of relation it's i i'm i'm pretty sure constituted by or and and
3982000	3988880	maintained by an awful lot of relations now if you say you know those relations are communications
3988880	3997840	between cells yeah perhaps that's right um i mean messaging between cells determines whether they
3997840	4004640	do these things uh but that seems to me more almost like just describing cancer rather than
4005200	4012080	than providing an etiology for it and that's why i say i mean and that's why i say in a sense
4012800	4021360	you've avoided the pluralism by taking a sufficiently wide-ranging definition of what's
4021360	4028480	happening that i'm just saying it's this not working anymore i i i did see a lot of hands before
4028480	4036880	so we may have a chance i'm sure to etiology better for prevention okay yeah i mean that that's yeah
4037600	4045200	um yeah so so yeah so i was wondering that um there can be an in-between case which is neither
4045840	4054400	just since or just processes but if the stability which you think can be achieved is
4054400	4061760	achieved in a timescale which is important for humans then i think one might think then in that
4061840	4071200	case we can use substance but when the stability is not achieved in the in a we can't just run
4073200	4078560	say which is the timescale then there is only processes so there is one option which is
4079520	4086800	not everything is seen but very few things is seen and more things are processed than we
4086800	4094560	thought before and that would be closer to your view but a bit like because the stability for you
4094560	4101440	is very important and if we would say that when the stability is stable we achieve then at least
4101440	4109200	we can call it same then uh the kind of contrast between process and something else still can be
4109200	4115040	maintained which might be useful yeah no i mean i that that's that's something actually i'm very
4115600	4121440	happy to do in in many cases i mean i i think again for those of you who were here earlier i mean
4121440	4128160	that's that's how i would explain why mechanism is often a a successful strategy because the
4128160	4134080	things that you identify as the parts of the mechanism are stable over the timescale you're
4134080	4139120	interested in understanding so i i'm and of course that's just that might be a very short one and
4139120	4145920	there might be an everyday life you might say you know a certain degree of stability is sufficient
4145920	4152000	to count as a thing um and of course that wouldn't have any that wouldn't in any way i think fundamentally
4152000	4158960	contradict anything i'm saying i'm happy with that great what kind of uh mathematics would you
4158960	4165440	suggest for process based modeling in biology this is a classical question because a in
4165440	4172880	organized tradition in the retinal biology so that question has been discussed since maybe
4172880	4182720	budger, Bergalanti, Waddington, René Tom, Robert Rosen say what would be your answer um my answer
4182720	4192880	would be to i'm afraid to to refuse to try and answer i i mean you know i i'm i'm um i'm not a
4192880	4201920	mathematician um and you know i i'm um so i'm i'm not going to adjudicate between somebody
4201920	4207120	um i can't understand at all like Rosen and somebody i can't understand very much like
4207120	4214640	Bergalanti um i i think these the i i have greatest respect for this kind of work but it's not my
4215520	4224160	pathway into the subject i i'm afraid to say so yeah i saw you say yeah um yeah yeah yeah
4224160	4231840	and then what um yeah you then then then okay so what can you tell us about these similarities
4231840	4238000	or uh difference between your approach and all the biases and the extended cognition
4238240	4249360	um so extended cognition i think is is relative i mean i think it's it's very congenial but i
4249360	4255920	think it's it's in a different um era i mean it's it's debate a different arena i mean it's
4255920	4263120	arguing with different people i say i'm very very sympathetic to it um and i i think i buy a lot of
4263120	4272320	it but um but i don't think it's um it's kind of a competitor i think it's just a an ally
4273920	4278320	though obviously i don't mean that all people in that line of work would necessarily agree
4280080	4287680	autopoiesis um i have a i mean a lot of similarities i think um the the only
4287680	4293600	trouble with autopoiesis is well the biggest trouble that is the word autopoiesis um i mean
4293600	4303760	the notion that organisms make themselves i find very unfortunate um and i think you know an awful
4303760	4311600	lot of what um you know varela and machirana actually say seems just right and i'm totally
4311600	4320480	sympathetic to but the framework of um you know things allegedly making themselves seems to be a
4320480	4326880	pity but but that's that's probably just a little bit of a semantic quibble i think there's a great
4326880	4334640	deal um in common um and i think i would mostly say um i guess again rather like whitehead they're
4334640	4341920	not always the easiest um people to understand and and i mean you know the this is this sounds
4341920	4350160	like laziness on my part and probably is but um i do think that you know there's the you know i mean
4350160	4358160	whitehead i think in all honesty does has done quite a lot of harm to process thinking and not
4358240	4365360	by getting things wrong so much as by making people think oh my god if i if i get interested in
4365360	4373680	process i'll have to read a process in reality and that's um i know nobody wants to do that i mean
4373680	4381520	i i i obviously exaggerate but but um but i and i and i do think um so so obviously one of the
4382160	4388880	one of the aims of this project is to try and suggest actually it's i mean and obviously i'd
4388880	4393600	leave others to judge whether i'm succeeding in this but really one ought to be able to say
4393600	4398480	this sort of stuff in a perfectly straightforward understandable way it's it's really easy to
4398480	4406400	understand and i think you know um i think i think you know vralla maturana sort of often make it
4406400	4412720	seem harder than it is and come up with and and i guess the production of of of weird and slightly
4412720	4420800	misguided terminology is part of that so i i i so i would say definitely an ally definitely
4420800	4429360	right about lots but also slightly a little bit of the whitehead thing of making people think
4430000	4432800	it's much harder to understand and probably not worth the trouble
4434320	4440320	so that's it's not it's not a i'm not very happy with that answer but it'll maybe do for now uh yeah
4444000	4452160	as i understand the merit of this process is that it's also a family of problems kind of
4452320	4459760	like the shape of these things like where are the boundaries say more good as a master
4461680	4469200	the back of my first day in barba and then a few plus stages okay but um i remember for my studies
4469200	4476160	in my cell biology and molecular biology that needed reading of these subjects are studied
4476160	4484720	quite mechanistically we were interested in like different gates and triggers and the movement of
4484720	4491520	molecules themselves so it seems that this process metaphysics is helpful for framing like when you
4491520	4501040	talked about cancer and viruses but the integrity of it seems to be the mechanistic view has been
4501040	4508720	very fruitful yeah so do you think that these two kind of somehow like co-exist absolutely and this
4508720	4515280	is comes back to i just alluded to in in in the question i want to go that i don't think it's not
4515280	4522560	that i want to say all this mechanistic explanation is completely misguided at all i think we've
4522560	4530000	we just go and this why i say you know that the the very mechanistic um biology that that followed
4530000	4537280	the kind of analysis of dna and and the processes of of you know of translation and and all i mean
4537280	4544080	that's wonderful biology looks kind of mechanistic and you know the last thing i want to do is to
4544080	4551040	say that's all rubbish right so so absolutely so so the but there's two levels the first is is
4552000	4558480	there's two two kinds of reply the first is yes i i think it's perfectly intelligible within a
4558480	4565760	process framework simply by just recognizing that when you're talking about a mechanism you're not
4565760	4573600	talking about you know fixed parts you're talking about parts that are sufficiently fixed for the
4573600	4580720	time frame that you're interested in but but there are also other other perspectives in which these
4580800	4588560	parts are changing these parts may be you know uh doing other things um you know there are other
4588560	4596480	perspectives that you might if you if you think too much in terms of biology as being about finding
4596480	4603200	mechanisms there are things that you're not going to notice or you're not going to focus on i'm sorry
4603200	4612000	again to people who who've been here in this morning but i will repeat one one kind of line of
4612000	4622240	examples here i'm fascinated by the parallel histories in some ways of um genomics and proteomics
4623440	4630480	that um you know that that they start out with so here's the genome here are all these genes
4630560	4635120	lined up what they do here's the gene for this here's the gene for that you know and maybe the
4635120	4641200	gene for is just the gene for making a particular protein it doesn't have to be the gene for aggression
4641200	4648240	or something really silly but at any rate we've got all this this stuff similar with you know protein
4648240	4654240	studies we used to have the protein that catalyzes this particular reaction the protein that makes
4654240	4660960	muscle fibers you know there we look at this thing we identify them see what kind of mechanism
4660960	4669600	we can fit them into and then we gradually find that this is hugely simplistic that this stretch
4669600	4676480	of DNA not only isn't the gene for aggression or homosexuality or some nonsense that that you know
4676480	4682560	sociopathic might have come up with it's it's actually not even the gene for making a particular
4682560	4689680	protein that it's really just a resource that can be used to make often many different proteins
4690720	4695840	then i mean and and then of course you know we we also find you know epigenetics and so on that
4695840	4703600	makes um all of this even more complicated same thing with proteins that it's a slightly um you
4703600	4710880	know more you know it's a slightly more complicated actually i think a deeper problem that people you
4710880	4716880	know would think what's the function of this protein that's a bad question because what we find is
4716880	4724000	of course there is a system which we can call a mechanism in which this protein does something
4724000	4730320	and helps us to understand but then we find and i say again sorry to repeat myself but one of my
4730320	4737200	favorite bits of giveaway language in biology is we found these things were moonlighting right
4737200	4742160	this is we have moonlighting proteins that were doing something other than their job in their spare
4742160	4749280	time and you know and then they finally do 10 different jobs and what you what you realize is
4749280	4756720	that the notion that you have this set of parts that fit into a mechanism in some way obscures
4756720	4764720	something really fundamental about how biological systems work that they make multiple use of the
4764720	4773360	parts and and the parts actually become different parts in different uses so having first of all
4773360	4780400	moved on to the moonlighting process proteins we now find at least half of them are the the um the
4780400	4786160	idps the i'd never know what it sounds for the the it that's right the intrinsically disorder
4786160	4791920	proteins which actually exist in a whole bunch of different structures and only settle on a structure
4792720	4799120	in a particular context so i mean the the diversity of these resources the fact that
4799120	4805920	the system is the system and this is i think is a kind of downward causation is able to use these
4805920	4812560	resources in multiple different ways in different contexts is i think absolutely fundamental thing
4812560	4821520	about how life a is possible and b is very unlike anything we uh or at least any traditional way of
4821600	4827360	thinking about mechanism and it's not so so we can look at the particular mechanisms and if we if
4827360	4833760	we start with a particular phenomenon there you know how does a particular um you know molecule
4833760	4840080	gets synthesized we can look at a mechanism but if we then start thinking okay so now we've located
4840080	4847120	the function of all the elements involved in that mechanism then we've shut off all kinds of
4847120	4854560	thoughts that we might have about um what these things can do so again it's not it's it's not that
4854560	4859120	there's anything wrong with all the mechanism understanding we have it's just that it can
4860400	4867280	provide a framework which discourages us from looking at at certain things and and pushes
4867280	4873200	certain directions over others i mean there's an awful lot to find out in biology and and
4873200	4879520	mechanistic thinking has enabled us to find out an awful lot of stuff but but it's also i think
4879520	4888240	comes at a cost in terms of of kind of channeling thought in some directions and tending to channel
4888240	4896960	it away from other directions um sorry you you i have somewhat more big question about the boundaries
4897120	4903920	of an organism the boundaries of an organism okay and if you're deaf you'll be a way to draw the
4903920	4910320	boundaries so so for example if a human rises in thick the human with the bacteria on the screen do
4910320	4915680	not die at the same instant right and you could say that there's a boundary right here so everything
4915680	4925920	that died together instantly is within the boundary the bacteria outside um well but why would you say
4925920	4933520	that i mean i i so i guess two reasons i would be skeptical about one is i mean no death is
4934800	4941040	ending is i think is easier than beginning so you've um but but supposing supposing that you
4941840	4949360	putting that on one side why would you why would you i mean so if you have um you know
4950320	4961920	absolutely um required bacterial um symbionts um they don't necessarily die with the i mean
4961920	4969040	they might carry on with you know the next thing that ate you after you died um or they might you
4969040	4976800	know i mean typically i guess they mostly die but by no means always or necessarily
4977520	4985120	so i'm not sure why you would why you would want that to be a criterion
4994160	5000320	i take it the idea would be you decide of the living organism whether something is part of it
5000880	5007120	on the basis of whether it dies when that organism dies is that is that the so yeah i
5007120	5013280	can i mean i certainly um it's an interesting suggestion um but i i'm not sure i can really
5013920	5018240	i'm not sure i can quite see the motivation for it apart from it being a criterion that you could
5018240	5025360	apply and that would give you some um answers sometimes but but even then does it i mean i i
5025360	5030720	guess i don't actually know the the sort of empirical facts about you know what the probability
5030720	5038480	of of a random part of your you know skin bacteria i guess they've probably got a good chance of living
5038480	5044240	and they tend to be quite transitory so let's say your gut bacteria i don't know what proportion
5044240	5049520	of them die when you die i mean i think a lot of what happens is the proportions of different
5049520	5055600	kinds change dramatically and some kinds um find themselves very happy living on your
5057200	5066480	corpse and become others are not so happy and become less so um so maybe and maybe maybe you
5066480	5072000	want to say i don't if you're going to eat my corpse you're not part of me um but but more
5072000	5081040	seriously i i just i don't really see a motivation for it um i mean am i is the apart from i mean
5081040	5085760	again depending sort of on the empirical facts it could turn out that there was a really nice
5085760	5095440	cutoff and certain obligate symbionts um did pretty much all go when you went but i'm not sure if
5095440	5103920	that's true and i wouldn't and it wouldn't be very surprising if it were not true right i mean
5103920	5110160	if if if lots of obligate symbionts tended to carry on just fine eating you for a bit and waiting
5110160	5116480	to somebody else at you i mean well i think the kind of these two boundaries is the correct
5116480	5123120	rest of all the things that's the which the sorry having clear boundaries and are supposed to have
5123120	5128800	things and you would say that being able to eliminate the clear boundaries from number of
5133440	5138400	yeah i mean i i but i guess i suppose it's it's um i don't i suppose you're i think you say i mean
5138480	5144560	temporal boundaries yes i mean you know lots of stuff dies but but why that should
5145280	5150000	why that should be an answer the question of spatial boundaries when you're not there i guess is
5150000	5159600	is the question that i don't really see a strong motivation for but but it's a um yeah
5160000	5168240	the the morbid subtlety uh it's wondering uh do you regard death as um as a process or an end
5168240	5174640	of or end of process or without fitting well it's an interesting one i mean i guess something i don't
5174640	5181680	talk about much at all are events um which are in many philosophers ontology is very important
5182400	5189840	i tend to think events are just very short sharp processes uh but but um but i guess you know one
5189840	5194720	differentiation that a lot of people would make would say death is an event of course but then i
5194720	5199680	guess i would also say not necessary a slow lingering death if we're going to be morbid
5199680	5204640	is much more like a process you know a bullet in the head pretty much an event
5205360	5208000	but sorry sorry to get um
5211280	5219120	legally it's still very difficult to say one someone is technically dead because what is there
5219120	5224960	is complicated is that the cardiac arrest we can pinpoint the moment of the cardiac arrest
5224960	5230960	is that the moment when the brain is too damaged to be started again without the hurt again so even
5231680	5237280	having to pinpoint on that is really really difficult to medicine and especially in the
5237280	5244080	question of organ transplant the moment where we can uh our best i would say organ of someone
5244080	5250320	because this person is dead is still a tricky part because of the absence of brain stem break
5250320	5257520	flexes it's great in fact exactly that's when you go for jobs yeah in the case of the
5257520	5264240	legislation of the country in France you have to be branded with certain measure for at least
5264240	5274320	20 hours and i think that in the UK in fact it's a legal definition more than legal health
5274320	5280000	like science but more it's more a legal definition and it's probably yeah it is driven more by
5280560	5288640	pragmatics and you know operationalizability i think rather than any deep kind of philosophical
5291040	5298240	insight i mean obviously people would sometimes like that to be a deep philosophical truth but
5298240	5305040	i think for just the sort of reasons you're saying it's kind of hard to locate one
5305280	5313600	and certainly yeah you could be brain dead and um your symbionts would live happily for
5314400	5318880	years while you were in a permanent vegetative state which some people might say was not was
5318880	5331040	a state post death um so yeah that's actually yeah okay one last question is anybody wanted
5331360	5333680	hasn't asked a question just just okay so
5335920	5345200	so if you describe yourself as a from viscous uh individualist yeah i mean i i want to just bracket
5345200	5357360	that a little bit
5362400	5366080	so i'm just wondering about the non-promiscuous
5367040	5377760	process here is here because the promiscuity here concerns a kind of of way of different ways
5377760	5385040	of abstracting all movements from this flux so in principle that could be a position which was
5385040	5392000	much like walls in terms of the underlying ontology to some degree except that they were more
5392800	5399280	more verquining or you know more more more sort of of a hardliner about
5400400	5406160	processes of individuation and abstraction what would the consequences be because it seems to
5406800	5414640	add some onto the logical there is some agreement about underlying flux but then you're abstracting
5414640	5421680	individuals in this promiscuous way which you're aware is about but they want to be deflationary about
5422960	5431840	the abstraction process as it were yeah um i'm not sure what to say about that um
5432720	5438480	i mean what i'll say one thing which may be a bit tangential i mean i think sometimes people get
5438480	5446000	into some of the more bizarre views in philosophy by by feeling the need to assert
5446720	5454000	um you know firm boundaries and one example i think of is um and and you know some some some
5454720	5461760	um kind of analytic metaphysicians that i in many ways would respect um who argue that
5462480	5470720	the human life begins when twinning is no longer possible now i mean basically because
5470720	5477440	if twinning is possible then they they're led into the contradiction that you might become
5478080	5485200	two non-identical people and that would mean a contradiction so so life has to begin
5485840	5491360	at the moment whenever that may be when it is no longer possible in theory so i know i mean
5492160	5499520	that strikes me as um kind of you know a kind of reductioid absurdum of metaphysical argument of
5499520	5506640	the most extreme kind i mean you know that that's their problem not the problem for you know the
5506640	5515600	the perfectly happy um non-twinning embryo that is part of the same process as the you know the
5515600	5522240	non-twin fetus that it becomes um it's just whereas again you know i'd say you know if you're
5523040	5529760	happily kind of promiscuous processualist or say no it's a process that's divided i mean that's
5531360	5537760	we don't we don't you know this is this is um so i don't know if that exactly answers your
5537760	5542240	question it probably doesn't i'm pretty sure it does because you you're sort of saying that
5543600	5549360	this this kind of abstraction in fact empirically goes with the nature of the phenomena which
5549360	5556720	requires some sort of like a package yeah and i think as i said i think i think the the i mean
5556720	5563600	i think you know if i were looking for um you know a kind of reductio of the assumption that
5563600	5569600	somehow one has to draw the boundaries around an individual that would be um a nice place to go at
5569600	5576560	least because actually you know it's just the process process is split um and and you know all
5576560	5585360	these all the the industry of split brains and all of that is is just um uh a an industry of
5585360	5593360	self-destruction for um substance theorists in my world for which i have no i don't think i have
5593360	5606160	any problems with at all so
