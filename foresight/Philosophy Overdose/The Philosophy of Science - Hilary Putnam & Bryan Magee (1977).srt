1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,760
The

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,160
connection between philosophy and the mathematical sciences has always been

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,200
very close. Plato had written over the door of his academy the words, let no

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,240
one enter here who is ignorant of geometry. It was Aristotle who codified

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,600
the basic sciences into the categories and gave them the names that we use to

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,520
this day. Some of the greatest philosophers have been themselves great

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,680
mathematicians who invented new branches of mathematics. Descartes is an obvious

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,000
example and so is Leibniz and Pascal. In fact most of the great philosophers, not

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,080
all but most, came to philosophy from mathematics or the sciences and this

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,640
tendency has continued into our present century. Bertrand Russell was trained

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,680
first as a mathematician. Wittgenstein was trained first as an engineer. The

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,200
reason for this persisting connection is I think obvious and that is that the

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,640
basic urge which has driven most of the greatest philosophers has been the urge

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,560
to deepen our understanding of the world and of its structure and this is also

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,240
what creative scientists are doing. For most of the past, too, people thought

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,200
that mathematics was the most indubitable knowledge as well as being

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,080
utterly precise and clear that human beings possessed. So there have always

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,120
been plenty of philosophers examining mathematics to try and find out what was

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,200
so special about it and whether this was something that could be applied to the

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,520
acquisition of other sorts of knowledge. Ditto with the sciences which were also

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,520
thought to yield a very specially safe and certain kind of knowledge. What was

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
it about science that made its results so reliable? People asked themselves and

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,800
could its methods, whatever these were, be used in other fields? These

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,740
investigations into the concepts and methods and procedures and models that

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,760
are involved in mathematics and in science have come to be known as the

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,080
philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science and it's with

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,980
these that we're going to be concerned in this program. Chiefly with the

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,880
philosophy of science, though in fact we have someone taking part who is

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,840
expert in both, Professor Hilary Putnam of Harvard University. Professor Putnam,

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,720
I'd like to start our discussion from a standpoint which I think a very large

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,140
number of our viewers occupy anyway and it's really this. Since the 17th century

32
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,620
I suppose there's been a spectacular decline in religious belief especially

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,740
in the West and especially among educated people and for millions the role

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,660
that used to be taken in life by a world view based on religion has been

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,180
increasingly supplanted by a world view based on science or at least purporting

36
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,120
to be derived from science anyway and this is still enormously powerful in the

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,980
whole that it has on people's minds throughout the West. Probably it affects

38
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,200
all of us. So I think I'd like to start this discussion by getting you to pin

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,780
down that scientific world outlook which is so influential in the modern world

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,020
which will be underlying a lot of what we're going to have to talk about.

41
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,700
Let me dodge the question a little bit by talking not about what scientists

42
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,860
think now but what many scientists thought a hundred years ago or 75 years

43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,300
ago. Think of doing a crossword puzzle. You might have to change a few things as

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,740
you go along but towards the end everything fits and things get added on

45
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,500
one step at a time. That's the way the progress of science looked for 300 years

46
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,940
in 1900 a famous mathematician David Hilbert gave a list of 50 mathematical

47
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,140
problems to a world congress of mathematicians which are still very famous.

48
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,260
It's very interesting that he included one problem which we would not call a

49
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,980
mathematical problem very early in the list I think problem three which was to

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,060
put the foundations of physics on a satisfactory basis. Just a small task

51
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,460
and that was for mathematicians. Not for physicists, right. The idea is to tidy it

52
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:25,700
up. That's right. The idea is Newton, Maxwell, Dalton and so on had all put in

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,340
all the parts of the story and now it was just for mathematicians to basically

54
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,860
clean up the logic as it were. I think in a conversation we had a couple of days

55
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,220
ago you described this as a treasure chest view and I like that picture but

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,340
here's this big chest that we're just filling up. It's an accumulation and you

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,940
don't have to subtract, you don't have to take out. Occasionally you make a little

58
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,900
mistake but basically the idea is or to shift the metaphor like building a

59
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,140
pyramid. You put down the ground floor then the next floor then the next floor

60
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,100
and it just goes up. That's part of it. This view of knowledge is growing by

61
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,060
accumulation. The other part of it is the idea that the special success of the

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,020
sciences and obviously what we're impressed by is success. This culture

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,900
value of success and science is a successful institution but there's the

64
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,620
idea that science owes its success to using a special method and that comes

65
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,060
partly from the history of science from the fact that Newton for example lived

66
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,020
after bacon and was influenced by bacon and the idea that empirical science has

67
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,260
grown up together with something called inductive logic and this idea that is a

68
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,900
method, the inductive method and that the sciences can be characterized by the

69
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,900
fact that they use this method and use it explicitly and consciously as it were,

70
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,580
not unconsciously as maybe someone who's learning cooking might be using it but

71
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,340
pretty deliberately and explicitly. So I think that these two things, the idea of knowledge

72
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,900
is growing by accumulation and growing by the use of a special method, the

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,100
inductive method, are the key elements of the old view. Yes and if I were going to

74
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,780
put the same thing, I suppose slightly differently, I think I'd say this that

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,300
for two or three hundred years educated Western man thought of the universe and

76
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,100
everything in it as consisting of matter in motion and that was all there was

77
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,340
whether from the outermost galaxies of the stars into ourselves and our bodies

78
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,820
and the cells of which we're made up and so on and that science was finding out

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,780
more and more about this matter and its structure and its motion by a method

80
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,740
which you just characterized as scientific method and the idea was that if we

81
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,700
went on long enough we'd simply, as you said with your crossword puzzle metaphor,

82
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,980
we'd find out everything there was to find out. We could eventually by

83
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,020
scientific methods completely explain and understand the world. Now that has

84
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,900
been abandoned by scientists, hasn't it? Though in fact this hasn't got

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,140
through yet to the non-scientists. There are still large numbers of

86
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,460
non-scientists who go on thinking that that's how scientists think but of

87
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,300
course they no longer do that. I mean this has started a breakdown. I think it

88
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,740
started to break down. I think it started to break down with Einstein. If I can

89
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,140
drag in a bit of history of philosophy, screaming by the hair, Kant did

90
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,060
something in philosophy which I think has begun to happen now in science. He

91
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,460
challenged a certain view of truth. Before Kant, no philosopher really doubted

92
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,700
that truth was simply correspondence to reality. I mean they're different words

93
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,220
some philosophers spoke of agreement but the idea is a mirror theory of

94
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,660
knowledge. Today I think, well Kant said it isn't so simple. There's a

95
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,220
contribution of the thinking mind. Sure it isn't made up by the mind. Kant was

96
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,140
no idealist. It is not a fiction. It isn't something we make up but it isn't

97
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,780
just a copy either. What we call truth depends both on what there is on the way

98
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,460
things are and on the contribution of the thinker, the mind. I think that today

99
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,940
scientists have come to a somewhat similar view that since the beginning of

100
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,820
the 20th century the idea that there's a human contribution, a mental

101
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,100
contribution to what we call truth. The theories aren't simply dictated to us by

102
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,700
the facts as it were. I'd like to ask you to unpack that a little because I think

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,460
that some of our viewers will find this idea a little puzzling. How can it be?

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,420
Some people will ask themselves that what is and is not true can depend not

105
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,660
only on what the facts are but on the human mind. How can that be? Well let me

106
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,580
use an analogy with vision. We tend to think that what we see just depends on

107
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,860
what's out there but the more one studies vision either as a scientist or as a

108
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,700
painter. One discovers that what's called vision involves an enormous amount of

109
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,780
interpretation. The color we see as red is not the same color in terms of

110
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,740
wavelengths at different times of the day. So even in what we think of as our

111
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,740
simplest transaction with the world just looking at it, we are interpreting, you

112
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,020
know. In other words we bring a whole number of things to the world that we're

113
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,020
not directly conscious of usually unless we turn inwards and start examining

114
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,620
them. That's right. I think the world must have looked different in the Middle

115
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,900
Ages to someone who looked up and thought of the stars as up and us at the

116
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,220
bottom for example. Today when we look out into space I think we have a

117
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,700
different experience than somebody with the medieval worldview. And what you're

118
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,860
saying is that the very categories in which we see the world and interpret

119
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,060
our experience and the the ideas within which we organize our observations and

120
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,820
the facts around us and so on are provided by us so that the world as

121
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,460
conceived by science is partly contributed by external facts but also

122
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,420
partly contributed by categories and ways of seeing things which come from

123
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,220
the human observer. That's right. And an example of that in science I'll

124
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,980
oversimplify but it's not basically falsified is this wave particle business.

125
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,300
It's not that there's something an electron which is some half a wave and

126
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
half a particle that would be meaningless but that there are many

127
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,580
experiments which can be described two ways. You can either think of the electron

128
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,300
as a wave or you can think of it as a particle and both descriptions are in

129
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,460
some crazy way true and adequate. Alternative ways of describing the same

130
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,180
facts and both descriptions are accurate. That's right. Philosophies have

131
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,420
started talking of equivalent descriptions. There's a term used in

132
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,780
philosophy of science. Now for a couple of hundred years after Newton educated

133
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,860
Western man thought that what Newton had produced was objective fact that he had

134
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,460
discovered laws which governed the workings of the world and the workings

135
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,540
of the universe and this was just objectively true independently of us

136
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,580
that Newton and other scientists had read these facts off of nature by

137
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,700
observing it and looking at it and so on and these statements which made up

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,380
science was simply true. Now there came didn't there a period in the development

139
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,220
of science and beginning in the late 19th century when people began to

140
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,940
realise that these statements were not entirely true that this wasn't just a

141
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,060
body of objective fact which had been read off from the world in other words

142
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,020
that science was courageable scientific theories could be wrong and that raises

143
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,860
some very profound questions. I mean if science isn't just an objectively true

144
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,740
description of the way things are what is it and if we don't get it from

145
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,500
observing the world where do we get it from? Well I don't want to say we don't

146
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,900
get it from observing the world at all obviously part of this Kantian image is

147
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,140
that there is a contribution which is not us there's something out there but

148
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,460
that also there's a contribution from us and even Kant by the way thought that

149
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,060
Newtonian science was indubitable that he thought we contributed its

150
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,020
indubitability. The step beyond Kant is the idea that not only is reality

151
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,980
partly mind-dependent but that there are alternatives and that the concepts we

152
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,540
impose on the world may not be the right ones and we may have to change them

153
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,580
that there's an interaction between what we contribute and what we find out.

154
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,380
Now what was it that made people begin to realise that this basic

155
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,580
conception of science as objective truth was wrong that science was

156
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,700
courageable, that science was fammable? I think it's that the older science turned

157
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,700
out to be wrong where no one expected it to be wrong not in detail but in the big

158
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,100
picture. It's not that we find out that say the Sun isn't 93 million miles from

159
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,060
the earth but only 20 million miles from the earth that's not going to happen.

160
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,820
I mean sometimes it makes blunders even about things like that but that's like

161
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,980
making a blunder about whether there's a chair in the room, wholesale

162
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,180
skepticism about whether numerical values are right in science would be as

163
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,660
unjustified as wholesale skepticism about anything but where the newer theories

164
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,420
don't agree with Newton it's not over the approximate truths of the

165
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,100
mathematical expressions in Newton's theory those are still perfectly good

166
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,940
for calculation. It's over the big picture we've replaced the picture of an

167
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,620
absolute space and an absolute time by the picture of a four-dimensional space

168
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,820
time we replaced the picture of a Euclidean world by a picture of a

169
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,500
world which obeys a geometry Euclid never dreamed of we've replaced we've

170
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,620
swung back to the picture of the world as having a beginning in time which is

171
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,300
really a shocker it's not even the things once refuted stay refuted forever.

172
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,460
Yes so it means really that a whole conception of science has been superseded

173
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,300
instead of thinking of science as a body of knowledge which is being added to all

174
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,300
the time by further scientific work that whole conception of science has been

175
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,500
dispensed with really hasn't it and we now think of it as a set of theories

176
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,140
which are themselves constantly being replaced by better theories by more

177
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,420
accurate theories by richer more explanatory theories and even the

178
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,900
theories we now have like those of Einstein and his successors will

179
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,780
probably be replaced in the course of time by other better theories by

180
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,140
scientists yet unknown isn't that so? That's exactly right in fact scientists

181
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,780
themselves make this prediction that is that the the main theories of the 20th

182
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,220
century relativity and quantum mechanics will give way to some other theory

183
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,780
which will interpret both of them and so on forever. Now this raises a very

184
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,980
fundamental question namely the question what is truth I mean when we say that

185
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,060
this or that scientific statement is true or this or that scientific theory is

186
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,060
true what in these newly understood circumstances of ours can we mean by

187
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,540
truth? There are still two views as there have been since Kant one is this

188
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,540
old correspondence view still has its adherence but I think the view that's

189
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,620
coming in more and more is that one cannot make it a total separation between

190
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,540
what's true and what our standards of assertibility are that the way in which

191
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,180
the what I called using the Kantian picture the mind dependence of truth

192
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,780
comes in is the fact that what's true and what's false is in part a function of

193
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,980
what our standards of truth and falsity are and that depends on our interests

194
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,220
and which again change over time of course. That's right. I'd like you to

195
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,460
say a little more about this question of truth because this again I think is

196
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,100
puzzling to the layman I think that people who are not trained in science

197
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,820
or philosophy are apt to think that there are a certain set of facts and a true

198
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,180
statement is a statement that accurately describes those facts I'd like you to

199
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,100
talk a little about some of the difficulties that are actually involved

200
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:58,900
in this. I think the the biggest difficulty in science itself comes from

201
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,220
the fact that even within one scientific theory you often find different

202
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,940
accounts can be given of so-called facts this came in with the special theory

203
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,780
of relativity when it turned in turned out that facts about simultaneity

204
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,380
when the two things happen at the same time could be described differently by

205
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,340
different observers one could say Boy Scout A fired a starter's pistol before

206
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,780
Boy Scout B the other could say no Boy Scout B fired a starter's pistol before

207
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,180
Boy Scout A and if the distance is sufficiently large so that a light

208
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,780
signal can't travel from one to the other without exceeding the speed of light

209
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,100
then it may be both descriptions are correct both are admissible. Of course

210
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,060
this leads to I mean profound conceptual difficulties in understanding some

211
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,180
modern scientific theories and this prompts the thought that a scientific

212
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,260
theory can be useful and meaningful and can work even if nobody really quite

213
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,780
understands what it means this is the case with quantum mechanics isn't it

214
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,940
I mean nobody is really sure what quantum mechanics actually means and yet it

215
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,900
works. That's right and again there I want to say one shouldn't push that too

216
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,700
far because I think we don't want to give up our standards of intelligibility

217
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,580
altogether we want to say quantum mechanics works and the very fact that

218
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,860
it works means that there's something fundamentally right about it and with

219
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,220
respect to its intelligibility we're willing to say in part that may be that

220
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,620
we have the wrong standards of intelligibility that we have to change

221
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,860
our intuitions but in part there are real paradoxes in the theory and I think

222
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,380
that more work has to be done to really get a satisfactory resolution of these

223
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,700
paradoxes. Things are very ticklish now. Yes I think somebody hearing our

224
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,620
discussion and to whom perhaps some of these ideas are new might find himself

225
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,980
thinking well if all this is so how is it that science works if traditional

226
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,460
scientific theories are breaking down if science is turning out not to be a body

227
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,620
of reliable permanent firm objective knowledge if a significant proportion of

228
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,300
every scientific theory is subjective anyway in the sense that it's

229
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,380
contributed by the human mind by the observer by the scientist how is it in

230
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,260
these circumstances that we can actually build bridges fly airplanes make rockets

231
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,380
go to the moon and actually make all this soft fuzzy changing partly

232
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,060
subjective body of theory work for us it must fit the world in some very basic

233
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,020
way in spite of everything that we've been saying. That's true but I think the

234
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,580
contrast between being subjective and fitting the world isn't altogether

235
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,220
right. I'm not saying that scientific knowledge is subjective or that anything

236
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,620
goes and say when the difficult position that we often are in in life of

237
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,020
thinking there is a difference we good and bad reasoning but we don't have a

238
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,260
mechanical rule. In everyday life we use interest loaded terms we wouldn't say

239
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,820
that there's a policeman on the corner if we didn't have a whole network of

240
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,020
social institutions somebody coming from a primitive tribe which didn't have

241
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,820
policemen might say there's a man in blue on the corner but the fact that the

242
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,580
notion of a policeman is shaped by our interest doesn't mean that it can't be

243
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,100
objectively true that there's a policeman on the corner. Also I think

244
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,580
science works precisely because of this corrigibility in large part as Professor

245
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,660
Poppers pointed out the difference between science and previous ways of

246
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,860
trying to find out truth is in large part that scientists are willing to test

247
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,860
their ideas because they don't regard them as infallible in a way that was

248
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,460
known at the beginning and then in the success of Newtonian science somewhat

249
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,700
forgotten and we've had to be reminded again of what Bacon knew that you have

250
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,820
to put questions to nature and be willing to change your ideas if they

251
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,620
don't work. In some respects the traditional opposition between science

252
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,820
and religion has the two parties of cross places haven't they I mean many

253
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,780
religious people now believe they have certain knowledge about the world that

254
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,460
it was created by a god that he made us in his own image gave us immortal souls

255
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,140
which will survive our death and so on certain very fundamental propositions

256
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,980
which they hold with absolute certainty and it's the scientist who believes

257
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,380
that everything is fallible that the world is a mysterious place that we'll

258
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,860
never get to the end of the mystery of and so on and so forth isn't there

259
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:17,780
something in that? It may be. You say it may be. I'm not sure. Well let's not pursue

260
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,100
that but one point I do want to take up with you leaving even religion aside is

261
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,180
that now that science is seen in this entirely different way that you've been

262
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,500
describing by virtually all scientists doesn't it mean that the difference

263
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,820
between science and non-science isn't what it was always thought of as being in

264
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,060
other words since science is so subjective indefinite changing and so on

265
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,060
it's no longer a clearly cut and different kind of human activity or

266
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,020
kind of human knowledge from other sorts of human knowledge and other sorts of

267
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,380
human activity. I think that's both true and culturally very important. I think

268
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,460
the harm that the old picture of science does is that if there is this realm of

269
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,540
absolute fact that scientists are gradually accumulating then everything

270
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,460
else appears somehow as non-knowledge something to which even words like true

271
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,740
and false can't properly apply. I think that the so-called fact value dichotomy

272
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,860
is a very good example of this. It's hard to have a discussion on politics for

273
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,700
example without someone very quickly saying at least in my country is that a

274
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,820
fact or a value judgment as though it can't be a fact that Hitler was a bad

275
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,140
man for example or a fact that Farrah Fawcett Major is a beautiful woman. And do

276
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:45,340
you think that it is a fact that Hitler was a bad man? Oh yes I do. I do too. But then if

277
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,860
this is so if we are abandoning so many of these comfortable clear-cut

278
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,580
distinctions of the past what's the point of continuing to use the category or

279
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,700
the notion or the term science anyway? I mean does it any longer clearly demarcate

280
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,140
something differentiable from everything else? I don't think it does. I think that

281
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,940
you know if you're going to distinguish science from non-science that makes a

282
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,940
lot of sense if you still have this old view that there's this inductive method

283
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,500
what makes something science is that it uses it and uses it pretty consciously and

284
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
pretty deliberately and that what makes something known science is either it

285
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,620
uses it entirely unconsciously as in learning how to cook you're not

286
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,020
consciously thinking about inductive logic or perhaps does use it at all as

287
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,060
metaphysics was alleged not to use it at all I think unfairly. But once you say

288
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:41,420
but both say that there's a sharp line between say practical knowledge and

289
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,340
science and to say that the method which is supposed to draw this line is rather

290
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,460
fuzzy something that we can't state exactly and attempts to state it by the

291
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,380
way have been very much a failure still inductive logic cannot be say programmed

292
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,700
on a computer the way deductive logic can be programmed on a computer. I think

293
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,140
the development of deductive logic in the last hundred years and the development

294
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,100
of the computer have really brought home very dramatically just what a different

295
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,460
state we are in with respect to proof in the mathematical sciences which we can

296
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,300
state rigorous canons for and proof in what used to be called the inductive sciences

297
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,500
where we can state general maxims but you really have to use intuition general know how

298
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:37,020
and so on in applying them. One of the two categories that you described the old

299
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,860
fashioned we're looking at science in terms of was that there was a particular

300
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:47,020
scientific method if you observed the facts and on the basis of these observed instances

301
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,540
you generalized to form scientific theories which you then verified by experiment and so

302
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,140
that was the old view wasn't it now that that has been abandoned is there any longer any single

303
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,260
method which is thought of as being scientific method. I don't think there should be people

304
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,780
talk of scientific method as a sort of fiction but I think that even in physics where you do get

305
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,740
experiments and tests which pretty much fit the textbooks there's a great deal that does and

306
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,780
then a great deal that shouldn't and I think in fact in the culture I don't really believe

307
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,580
there's an agreement on what's a science so what is it any university will tell you in its catalog

308
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,980
that there are things called social sciences not sociology of the science so that economics is

309
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,420
a science I bet if you ask anyone in the physics department whether sociology is a science you'll

310
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,980
say no and why will he say no that's interesting I think the real reason is not that the sociologists

311
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,420
don't use the inductive method they probably use it more conscientiously poor things than the

312
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,660
physicists do I think it's because they're not as successful so in other words science has become

313
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,340
almost a name for successful pursuit of knowledge that's right yeah yeah well now I think you've

314
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,100
given a very very good description of the way in which this age-old view of what science was has

315
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,300
broken down in our century and been replaced by something much more fluid and perhaps much more

316
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,500
difficult to get hold of but you have I think described it very clearly can we now come against

317
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,340
this background to what philosophers of science are actually doing you are a philosopher of science

318
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:26,140
what do you and your colleagues do well part of what we do which I won't try to describe on this

319
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,140
broadcast is fairly technical investigation of specific scientific theories we look at quantum

320
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,940
mechanics very closely we look at both to learn what lessons we can for it from it for philosophy

321
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,140
and to see what contributions we can make as philosophers to clarifying its foundations we

322
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,580
look at relativity theory very closely we look at Darwinian evolution very closely and so on

323
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,460
this is the part of philosophy of science that provides the data for the rest but much philosophy

324
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,300
of science is leads shades over into general philosophy and I think it's the best way to

325
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,460
describe it is in terms of what we've been talking about that is each of the issues we've been talking

326
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,660
about divides philosophers of science the issue there are philosophers of science who have a

327
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,340
correspondence view of truth and try to show this can be made precise the answers can the objections

328
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,100
can be overcome you can still view science somehow in the old way and there are others who try to

329
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,700
sketch what another view of truth would come to there are philosophers who still think there is

330
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,580
an inductive method that can be rigorously stated and who work on inductive logic and by the way

331
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,220
I think it's important that there should be because we won't make progress to trying to state the

332
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,500
inductive method if there aren't and that there are others who view the development of science

333
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,260
more culturally more historically and that people like myself who have a sort of in-between

334
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,620
position that there's something to the notion of a scientific method there are clear examples

335
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,620
but that it's more or less a continuum that you you mustn't think of it as a kind of

336
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,100
mechanical rule an algorithm that you can apply to get scientific knowledge so that I'd say each

337
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,460
of these issues the nature of truth the nature of the scientific method whether there's any

338
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,740
necessary truth in science anything conceptual contribution which is permanent and can't be

339
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,260
subject to revision is a big question and who are you plural doing all this work for

340
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,140
I asked that I don't ask that in an irreverent way but what I have in mind is this I've myself

341
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,500
taken part in attempts to bring scientists and philosophers together for discussions of precisely

342
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,940
the issues that you've raised and these attempts have usually failed and failed for the same reason

343
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,060
namely that the scientists lose interest they go back to their laboratories and get on with doing

344
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:49,900
more science and the great bulk of working scientists it seems to me don't in fact take very

345
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,540
much of an interest in the issues that you've been talking about I think it's conspicuous that

346
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,900
the greatest of all scientists are exceptions I mean they they're really blockbusting the path

347
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,900
breaking scientists who've actually made the revolution in this century that you've been

348
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,540
talking about people like Einstein, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Max Bohr, Schrödinger, De Broglie,

349
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,980
these people were enormously interested in the conceptual questions that you've raised but these

350
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,580
were the the pioneering geniuses and the great mass of thousands of scientists who follow on

351
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,900
behind them and put their work to its practical application they don't seem to care so who is

352
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,620
listening to you who is reading the stuff that you publish well I'd say first of all I think we

353
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,420
are basically writing for the philosophically interested layman for the reader of philosophy

354
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,780
I don't view philosophy of science as giving direct advice to scientists just as I think

355
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,180
moral philosophers are ill advised to think that they're giving at least immediately

356
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:55,580
current contemporary advice on how to live your life or what bills to pass in parliament on the

357
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,820
other hand I do think that scientists tend to know the philosophy of science of 50 years ago

358
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,660
and perhaps this is the bad thing that it's perhaps this time lag this culture lag has some

359
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,420
value in weeding out what they shouldn't pay attention to I mean it's a novel philosopher

360
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,900
to encounter a scientist who's both sure that he didn't listen to any philosophy of science

361
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,900
and then who produces verbatim ideas which you can recognize is coming from what was popular in 1928

362
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,740
and is there a direct parallel here between what you're saying about scientists and

363
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,620
Cain the the economist Cain's is famous remark that nearly all businessmen who thought that they

364
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,900
were indifferent to airy-fairy economic theory were in fact the slaves of the economic theorists of

365
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,740
yesterday of a previous generation that's exactly true I suppose another parallel one could make

366
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,940
would be to say that the account that ordinary language users give of language and their use

367
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,740
of language would be extremely unsophisticated simply because they take it for granted and

368
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,780
have never thought about it that too would probably apply to the account that most scientists would

369
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,340
give of what they were doing when they were doing their science that's right that is it's a mistake

370
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:08,460
to think that merely because when practices an activity one can give a theory of it one criticism

371
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,100
that's often been made about philosophers of science is that although they talk of science in

372
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,180
this general way what they're nearly always referring to in fact is is one science namely physics

373
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,060
now it's true isn't it that the science in which the most exciting developments have probably taken

374
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:30,780
place in the last 20 years anyway has been not physics but biology our philosophers of science

375
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,380
open genuinely to the criticism of being too physics-based in their view of science and having

376
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:43,740
ignored biology too much I think I would defend us against that on the grounds that I don't although

377
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:50,060
the theories in biology are of great scientific importance Darwin's theory of evolution Crick

378
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:57,020
Watson on DNA and so on they don't by and large pose big methodological problems of a kind that

379
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,340
don't arise in physical science I'm not sure that you're going to agree with that well I mean

380
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,340
you mentioned the word evolution just now and it seems to me that here is a concept

381
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,500
which originated in one of the sciences namely biology and which over a comparatively short

382
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,620
period of time has spread throughout the whole of our culture so that the way almost everybody

383
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:27,260
thinks is influenced by the notion of evolution not only about the origins of man but about

384
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,620
institutions or the arts all kinds of other things I mean evolution has become a dimension

385
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,300
of western man's thinking about almost anything is that not so that's right and perhaps there has

386
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,460
not been enough attention to this theory though what strikes me as interesting is that the possibility

387
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,740
of explanations of what we think of as the biological kind explanations in terms of function

388
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:58,940
rather than in terms of the building physics and chemistry what you're made of have come under

389
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,300
more attention recently as a result of computer science now this this is very this does raise

390
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,260
something I'm particularly interested in when you talk of computer science and that is the

391
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,180
interaction between our technology in the case of computers and philosophy not just science and

392
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,060
philosophy but technology and philosophy I mean computers were originally constructed on the

393
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,420
basis of a self-conscious analogy with the human mind weren't they but as they became more and more

394
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:32,540
sophisticated we began to learn things from them about the human mind so our construction of computers

395
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:39,500
and what they then tell us about ourselves seems to actually proceed by interactive growth isn't

396
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,340
that so that's right and today the this is one area by the way in which philosophers are in close

397
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,940
contact with scientists that is the fields of linguistics cognitive psychology computer science

398
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,020
philosophy of language today interact constantly people send papers to one another not because

399
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,420
someone tells them to there are conferences at which specialists in these field meet together again

400
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:07,020
not because someone decided there should be some cross fertilization the interesting thing about

401
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,460
the computer case if I can stick with it for a moment is one might have thought that the computer

402
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,460
the rise of the computer would encourage a certain kind of vulgar materialism the idea so after all

403
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,860
we are machines so after all everything about us can be explained in terms of physics and chemistry

404
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,740
paradoxically the real effect of the computer on psychology and on philosophy of mind has been a

405
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:38,380
decrease in that kind of reductionism see the thing about the computer is that when you work

406
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,740
with computers you very rarely have to think about their physics and chemistry there's a

407
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,380
distinction that people draw between their software meaning their program their instructions

408
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,220
their rules the way they do things and their hardware and generally you ignore their hardware

409
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,260
you talk about computers at the software level and you wouldn't really be able to explain

410
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,100
what they do in a way that would be of any use to anyone in terms of the hardware level you

411
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,300
there is a kind of emergence here although it's not a mystical kind of emergence it's not that

412
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:18,060
they're violating the laws of physics it's just that the the level of work at higher level facts

413
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,980
about organization have a kind of autonomy you'd say this the fact that's following this program

414
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,340
explains why it does this and I don't need to know how it's built I only need to know it can be built

415
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:36,060
in such a way that it will follow this program this is a return to a view and if you apply this to

416
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,020
the mind it suggests a return to a view of the mind that I associate with Aristotle there's the

417
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:50,460
view that we are not ghosts in a machine not spirits which only temporarily embodies but that

418
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,580
the relation between the mind and the body is a relation of function to what has that function

419
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,060
Aristotle said if you use the word soul in connection with an ax and of course he said you

420
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,500
don't you'd say the soul of an ax is cutting and he said the soul of the eye is seeing and he thought

421
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:13,020
of man as a thing that thinks you're talking now of the alternative to materialism and

422
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,860
say a religious view that this gives us puts me in mind instantly of the most significant of all

423
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,500
the materialist philosophers in the modern world namely Marxism which after all is the

424
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,020
official state philosophy of about a third of mankind as we sit here discussing this

425
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,780
it Marxism claims to be scientific and this is a very important thing about it

426
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,700
is there a significant Marxist contribution to the philosophy of science I don't think there's

427
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:47,580
a significant Marxist contribution but I don't think that the Marxists were all wrong either

428
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:54,220
I think Engels was one of the most scientifically learned men of his century he had a he got a

429
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,820
number of things wrong but he had an immense general scientific knowledge and anti-during his

430
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:05,980
big book on philosophy of science although it contains some rather strange ideas some of which

431
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:12,060
he gets from Hegel by the way is on the whole a sensible book on philosophy of science among

432
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,260
other things on the other hand it's not specifically Marxist I'd say that Engels views in philosophy

433
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:24,540
of science are in large part influenced by the standard philosophy of science of the time they're

434
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:31,180
fairly sophisticated inductive account and what about subsequent Marxist thinkers who also had

435
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,740
some pretension to be philosophers like Lenin for example well I think they're uneven Lenin I think

436
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,020
is on the whole one of the worst he says for example the theories are copies of motion I mean

437
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,900
there you have the copy theory of science just copying off the reality in its crudest view

438
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,340
Mao is more sophisticated and Mao is very influenced by John Dewey who was widely read in

439
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,500
China in the 1920s do you think it's actually made a contribution to the subject as it is today or

440
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,620
not really I think that it anticipated it perhaps might have made a contribution if

441
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,820
people had been less ideologically divided because I think non-Marxists could have learned the Marxists

442
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:19,580
were among the first people to try to somehow combine a realist view with the with a stress on

443
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,700
practice with a stress on corrigibility and they were very hostile to the notion of a priori truth

444
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,380
and today many mainline philosophers of science are very hostile to a priori truth as it is they

445
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,700
play somewhat the role in philosophy of science I think that Cain said they play in economics he

446
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,700
described Marx as one of his sort of underground predecessors yes yes when I was introducing

447
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,660
this program I mentioned not only the philosophy of science but also the philosophy of mathematics

448
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:53,020
and before we close I would like like us to say something about that anyway I suppose one can

449
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,500
really say that the central problem in the philosophy of mathematics is a direct parallel

450
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:03,740
to the central problem in the philosophy of science namely how does it fit the world with science it's

451
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:10,140
how does science fit the world in mathematics it's how does mathematics fit the world is that right

452
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:17,260
that's right and it's even worse because if you're trying to defend a copy view a correspondence

453
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,380
view of truth and empirical science you can answer the question well how do we build up this picture

454
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,340
in such a way that corresponds by saying we have sense organs as I mentioned before that's not a

455
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,900
total answer because there's a tremendous amount of interpretation involved in simple seeing and

456
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:38,300
simple hearing but if you are talking about numbers and sets and somebody says okay if

457
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,740
mathematical knowledge is simply some kind of a copy of the way numbers are and the way sets are

458
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:51,100
and the way other abstract objects that mathematician study are the question then what sense enables us

459
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,260
to see how they are because what is a number what yes yes a deeply problematic question but

460
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,020
still an important one that's right and on the other hand I don't want to say that the anti

461
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,020
correspondence view has it very easy either it seems to me that mathematical knowledge is a real

462
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,020
puzzle and I think that philosophers should concentrate more on philosophy of mathematics

463
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:16,220
than they do now because it seems to be an area where no theory works very well isn't there another

464
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:23,260
very important parallel between mathematics and science I mean throughout the history of science

465
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,260
one of the conflicts has been between one camp who thought that it was all about objects in the

466
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,580
world which existed independent of human experience and another camp which thought no it's human beings

467
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,260
and observers who actually contribute most of this and as you pointed out much earlier our discussion

468
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:47,820
the truth is almost certainly a combination of both there is a long-standing dispute in mathematics

469
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,380
isn't there between one body of people who think that mathematical knowledge is something that so

470
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,980
to speak inherent in the structure of the world and we derive it from the world by experience

471
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,980
and observation and another body of mathematical thought that says no no no mathematics is a

472
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:10,780
creation of the human mind which we then tries to try to impose on reality like a grid as it were

473
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:16,780
on a landscape isn't that so that's right the latter story is attractive because of the sense

474
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:22,700
organ problem but it doesn't seem to work either because it it seems that we're not free to impose

475
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,740
any mathematics or any logic we want almost anyone would admit that at least you have to be

476
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,580
consistent and what's consistent what isn't isn't somehow something we can just make up or decide

477
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,740
as when we try to stress conventionalist accounts subjective accounts we come up against the

478
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,700
objectivity of mathematics we try to stress the objectivity of mathematics we come up against

479
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,060
another set of problems I think we can learn a lot more than we now know about human knowledge

480
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:57,260
and about scientific knowledge by going further into this area talking of of where we're going from

481
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,540
where we are so to speak I think the most interesting way in which you could end this

482
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,660
discussion Professor Putnam would be by talking about what you regard as the most interesting

483
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,460
problem areas of the moment and therefore I take it the most likely growth areas for the

484
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,580
immediate future in both of the subjects we've been discussing philosophy of science and philosophy

485
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,420
of mathematics okay I think that if I'm allowed to confine my prediction of the immediate future

486
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,220
because we know that long-run predictions are always false but in the immediate future I would

487
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,260
expect philosophy of mathematics to be a growth area and philosophy of logic I would expect

488
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,860
philosophy of physics I think to decline somewhat from its central place in philosophy of science

489
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:42,300
although I think they're part of it touches philosophy of logic the question the astounding

490
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,180
suggestion has actually come forward in connection with quantum mechanics that we may have to change

491
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:53,340
our logic our view of what the true logical laws are in order to really understand how the world

492
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,140
can be quantum mechanical I think this side of philosophy of quantum mechanics that touches

493
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,860
philosophy of logic will be a hot discussion area but more generally I think areas which we almost

494
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,580
don't think of as philosophy of science that become philosophy of language and philosophy of mind

495
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,980
like these questions about computer models of the mind computer models of language

496
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:21,340
and these more general questions about theories of truth the nature of truth the nature of

497
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,500
verification how science can be objective even though there's not a rigorous scientific method

498
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,260
that I think these questions will continue to be the staples of the field one thing that worries me

499
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:40,700
about this whole area is its relationship to the educated layman I mean which in a sense is the

500
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:47,100
person our discussion has been for after all it's now over 70 years since the 25 year old

501
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,140
Einstein published the theorem of relativity and I'm sure you'll agree with me that it's true

502
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,420
to say now that the great majority of educated people with higher educations university degrees

503
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,860
and so on still have scarcely any idea of what this is all about and it's done very little to

504
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,820
actually influence their view of the world isn't there a danger that now science and mathematics

505
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:15,100
are simply racing ahead and the whole new range and world of insight that that is giving us into

506
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,180
the universe in which we live simply isn't filtering through to the non-specialist or not

507
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,740
filtering through anything like fast enough that is a danger but it's one that something can be done

508
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,900
about there's now for example a text of special relativity called spacetime physics which is

509
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,900
designed for the first month of the first freshman college physics course and the authors say at the

510
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,460
beginning that they look forward to the time when it will be taught in high schools and do you think

511
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,100
that time will in fact come and quite soon I'm sure of it as well I I think you're right and

512
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,060
indeed I hope you are thank you very much Professor Putnam thank you
