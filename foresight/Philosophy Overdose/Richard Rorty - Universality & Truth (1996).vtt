00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
The question of whether there are any beliefs or desires common to all human beings is a

00:07.200 --> 00:14.520
little interest apart from the vision of a utopian inclusivist human community, one which

00:14.520 --> 00:17.200
prides itself on the different sorts of people.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.920
It welcomes rather than on the firmness with which it keeps out the stranger.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.200
Most human communities are exclusivist.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.600
Their sense of identity and the self-images of their members depend on pride in not being

00:31.600 --> 00:37.680
certain other sorts of people, people who worship the wrong God, eat the wrong foods, or have

00:37.680 --> 00:42.080
some other perverse, repellent beliefs or desires.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.080
Philosophers would not bother trying to show that certain beliefs and desires are found

00:47.080 --> 00:54.480
in every society or are implicit in some ineliminable human practice, unless they hope to show that

00:54.480 --> 01:01.160
the existence of these beliefs demonstrates the possibility of or the obligation to construct

01:01.160 --> 01:04.640
a planet-wide inclusivist community.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.920
In this paper I'll use the term democratic politics as a synonym for the attempt to bring

01:09.920 --> 01:13.820
such a community into existence.

01:13.820 --> 01:18.960
One of the desires said to be universal by philosophers interested in democratic politics

01:18.960 --> 01:21.800
is the desire for truth.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.040
In the past, such philosophers have typically conjoined the claim that there is universal

01:26.040 --> 01:31.800
human agreement on the supreme desirability of truth with the further premises that truth

01:31.800 --> 01:38.160
is correspondence to reality and that reality has an intrinsic nature, that there is in

01:38.160 --> 01:42.200
Nelson Goodman's terms a way the world is.

01:42.200 --> 01:47.560
Given these three premises, they proceed to argue that truth is one and that the universal

01:47.560 --> 01:53.640
human interest in truth provides motive for creating an inclusivist community.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.520
For such a community would be best suited to accomplishing our desire of discovering

01:58.520 --> 02:00.360
the one truth.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.000
The more of that truth we uncover, the more common ground we shall share, and the more

02:05.000 --> 02:09.320
tolerant and inclusivist we shall therefore become.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.760
The rise of relatively democratic, relatively tolerant societies in the last few hundred

02:13.760 --> 02:19.880
years is said to be due to the increased rationality of modern times, where rationality denotes

02:19.880 --> 02:24.480
the exercise of a truth-oriented faculty.

02:24.480 --> 02:30.240
The three premises I've listed are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason.

02:30.240 --> 02:37.600
That is, the premises that everybody wants truth, that truth is correspondence to reality

02:37.600 --> 02:40.680
and that reality has an intrinsic nature.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.480
These three premises are sometimes said to be necessitated by reason, but this claim

02:45.480 --> 02:50.480
is usually tautologists for philosophers who say that, typically explain their use of the

02:50.480 --> 02:59.160
word reason by listing those same three premises as constitutive of the very idea of rationality.

02:59.160 --> 03:05.320
They view colleagues who have doubts about one or another of these three premises as irrationalism.

03:05.320 --> 03:13.200
I have a footnote about Nietzsche, James, and Habermas as people who are called irrationalists

03:13.200 --> 03:18.920
for rejecting one or another or more of those premises.

03:18.920 --> 03:25.080
Degrees of irrationality are attributed according to how many of these premises the distrusted

03:25.080 --> 03:30.280
philosopher denies, and also according to how little interest he or she shows in democratic

03:30.280 --> 03:32.760
politics.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.400
In this paper, I'll consider the prospects for defending democratic politics while denying

03:37.400 --> 03:40.920
all of the three premises I've listed.

03:40.920 --> 03:46.240
I'll be arguing that what philosophers have described as the universal desire for truth

03:46.240 --> 03:51.280
is better described as the universal desire for justification.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.440
The grounding premise of my argument is that you can't aim at something, can't work to

03:55.440 --> 03:59.920
get it, unless you could recognize it once you got it.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.840
One difference between truth and justification is just that between the unrecognizable and

04:05.840 --> 04:07.840
the recognizable.

04:07.840 --> 04:13.240
We shall never know for sure whether a given belief is true, but we can be sure that nobody

04:13.240 --> 04:18.480
at the moment is able to summon up any residual objections to it that everybody agrees that

04:18.480 --> 04:21.280
it ought to be held.

04:21.280 --> 04:28.080
There are to be sure what Lacanians call impossible, indefinable, sublime objects of desire, but

04:28.080 --> 04:33.800
a desire for such an object cannot be made relevant to democratic politics.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.360
On my view, truth is just that sort of object.

04:37.360 --> 04:42.720
It's too sublime, so to speak, to be either recognized or aimed at.

04:42.720 --> 04:48.080
Justification is merely beautiful as opposed to sublime, but it is recognizable and therefore

04:48.080 --> 04:52.000
capable of being systematically worked for.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.360
Sometimes with Locke justification is even achieved.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.320
But that achievement is usually only temporary, since sooner or later, with Locke, some dual

05:00.320 --> 05:05.240
objections to the temporarily justified belief will be developed.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.880
As I see it, the yearning for unconditionality, the yearning which leads philosophers to insist

05:09.880 --> 05:17.320
that we need to avoid contextualism and relativism, is indeed satisfied by the notion of truth.

05:17.320 --> 05:22.280
But this yearning is unhealthy because the price of unconditionality is irrelevant to

05:22.280 --> 05:24.000
practice.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.320
So I think the topic of truth can't be made relevant to democratic politics and that philosophers

05:29.320 --> 05:36.080
devoted to such politics should forget about truth and stick to the topic of justification.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.800
Now I turn to Habermas.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.600
In order to place my view within the context of contemporary philosophical controversies,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.120
I'll begin with some comments on Habermas.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.080
Habermas draws his well-known distinction between subject-centered reason and communicative

05:52.080 --> 05:57.040
reason in connection with his attempt to separate out what's useful to democratic politics

05:57.040 --> 06:02.920
and the traditional philosophical notion of rationality from what's useless.

06:02.920 --> 06:09.680
I think that he makes a tactical error when he tries to preserve the notion of unconditionality.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.320
Although I think Habermas is absolutely right that we need to socialize and linguistify

06:14.320 --> 06:21.040
the notion of reason by viewing it as communicative, I think that we also need to naturalize reason

06:22.040 --> 06:28.600
Habermas, like Putnam, believes that reason cannot be naturalized.

06:28.600 --> 06:34.440
Both philosophers think, and that's a phrase from Putnam endorsed by Habermas, both philosophers

06:34.440 --> 06:39.320
think it important to insist on this point in order to avoid the relativism which seems

06:39.320 --> 06:46.480
to them to put democratic politics on a par with totalitarian politics.

06:46.480 --> 06:54.320
You could say, if there's a moment of unconditionality, then you can't naturalize it.

06:54.320 --> 07:01.680
Both think it important to say that democratic politics is more rational than totalitarian

07:01.680 --> 07:03.600
fascist politics.

07:03.600 --> 07:08.120
I don't think we should say that because I don't think the notion of rationality can

07:08.120 --> 07:10.680
be stretched that far.

07:10.680 --> 07:15.640
We should admit that we have no neutral ground to stand on when we defend democratic politics

07:15.640 --> 07:18.160
against its opponents.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.560
If we don't admit this, I think we can rightly be accused of attempting to smuggle our own

07:22.560 --> 07:29.120
social practices into the definition of something universal and ineluctable because presupposed

07:29.120 --> 07:33.360
by the practices of any and every language user.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.040
It would be franker and therefore better to say that democratic politics can no more appeal

07:38.040 --> 07:46.200
to such presuppositions than can anti-democratic politics, but is none the worse for that.

07:46.200 --> 07:53.000
Habermas agrees with the criticism which post-Nichyan writers have made of what Derrida calls logo-centrism

07:53.000 --> 07:58.400
and specifically with their denial that, quote, the linguistic function of representing states

07:58.400 --> 08:03.080
of affairs is the so human monopoly.

08:03.080 --> 08:07.760
So do I, but I would extend this criticism as follows.

08:07.760 --> 08:12.600
Only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that there was an aim of inquiry

08:12.600 --> 08:18.160
called truth in addition to the aim of justification.

08:18.160 --> 08:24.680
More generally, only over-attention to fact-stating would make one think that acclaim to universal

08:24.680 --> 08:29.160
validity is important for democratic politics.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.760
Still more generally, abetting the logo-centric idea that knowledge is the distinctive human

08:34.760 --> 08:40.360
capacity would leave room for the idea that democratic citizenship is better suited for

08:40.360 --> 08:44.600
the role of the distinctively human capacity.

08:44.600 --> 08:49.000
The latter is what we human beings should take most pride in and should make central

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
to our self-image.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.360
As I see it, Habermas' attempt to redefine the term reason after deciding that, as he

08:57.360 --> 09:02.280
says, the paradigm of the philosophy of consciousness is exhausted.

09:02.280 --> 09:08.800
His attempt to re-describe reason as communicative through and through is insufficiently radical.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.680
It's a halfway house between thinking in terms of validity claims and thinking in terms of

09:13.680 --> 09:16.280
justificatory practices.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.320
It comes down halfway between the Greek idea that human beings are special because they

09:21.320 --> 09:27.480
can know, whereas other animals can merely cope, and Dewey's idea that we are special

09:27.840 --> 09:32.920
because we can take charge of our evolution, take ourselves in directions which have neither

09:32.920 --> 09:38.840
precedent nor justification in either biology or history.

09:38.840 --> 09:43.920
The latter idea can be made to sound unattractive by dubbing it Nietzschean and construing it

09:43.920 --> 09:49.600
as one more form of the same will to power which was incarnate in the Nazis.

09:49.600 --> 09:55.200
I'd like to make it sound attractive by calling it American and construing it as the idea

09:55.200 --> 10:01.720
common to Emerson and Whitman, the idea of a new self-creating community united not by

10:01.720 --> 10:07.680
knowledge of the same truths, but by sharing the same generous, inclusivist, democratic

10:07.680 --> 10:09.600
hopes.

10:09.600 --> 10:15.960
The idea of communal self-creation, of realizing a dream which has no justification in unconditional

10:15.960 --> 10:22.080
claims to universal validity, sounds suspicious to Habermas and Opel because they naturally

10:22.080 --> 10:24.440
associate it with Hitler.

10:24.440 --> 10:29.520
It sounds somewhat better to Americans because they naturally associate it with Jefferson,

10:29.520 --> 10:31.360
Whitman and Dewey.

10:31.360 --> 10:37.920
The moral to be drawn, I think, is that this suggestion is neutral between Hitler and Jefferson.

10:37.920 --> 10:43.680
If one wants neutral principles on the basis of which to decide between Hitler and Jefferson,

10:43.680 --> 10:50.160
one will have to find a way of replacing Jefferson's occasional references to natural law and

10:50.360 --> 10:56.920
self-evident political truths by a more up-to-date version of Enlightenment rationalism.

10:56.920 --> 11:03.320
This is the role in which Habermas and Opel cast what they call discourse ethics.

11:03.320 --> 11:08.480
Only if one has given up hope for discourse ethics and for all other attempts at such

11:08.480 --> 11:14.480
neutrality will the alternative I'm suggesting seem attractive.

11:14.480 --> 11:19.520
Whether one gives up that hope should, I think, be decided, at least in part, on the basis

11:19.520 --> 11:24.480
of one's view of the sort of argument from performative self-contradiction which is at

11:24.480 --> 11:27.840
the heart of discourse ethics.

11:27.840 --> 11:34.440
I see that argument as weak and unconvincing, but I have nothing better to put in its place.

11:34.440 --> 11:39.640
Because I have nothing better, I'm inclined to reject the very idea of neutral principles

11:39.640 --> 11:44.960
and ask myself what philosophers might do for democratic politics apart from trying to

11:44.960 --> 11:48.360
ground this politics on principles.

11:48.360 --> 11:54.440
My answer is they can get to work substituting hope for knowledge, substituting the idea

11:54.440 --> 12:00.280
that the ability to be citizens of the full-fledged democracy which is yet to come rather than

12:00.280 --> 12:05.520
the ability to grasp truth is what's important about being human.

12:05.520 --> 12:10.640
This is not a matter of what Opel calls let's be glündung, but of re-describing humanity

12:10.640 --> 12:16.440
and history in terms which make democracy seem desirable.

12:16.440 --> 12:22.360
If doing that is said to be, as Opel calls it, mere rhetoric rather than proper argument,

12:22.360 --> 12:28.200
I should rejoin that it is no more or less rhetorical or argumentative than my opponent's

12:28.200 --> 12:34.640
attempt to make discourse, to describe discourse and communication in terms that make democracy

12:34.640 --> 12:41.960
seem linked to the intrinsic nature of humanity.

12:41.960 --> 12:46.960
New section on truth and justification.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.080
There are many uses for the word true, but the only one which could not be eliminated

12:51.080 --> 12:56.760
from our linguistic practice with relative ease is the cautionary use.

12:56.760 --> 13:01.400
This is the use we make of the word when we contrast justification and truth and say that

13:01.400 --> 13:05.880
a belief may be justified, but still not true.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.400
Outside of philosophy, this cautionary use is used to contrast less informed with better

13:10.400 --> 13:16.720
informed audiences and more generally past audiences with future audiences.

13:16.720 --> 13:21.760
In nonphilosophical context, the point of contrasting truth and justification is simply

13:21.760 --> 13:27.400
to remind oneself that there may be objections arising from newly discovered data or more

13:27.400 --> 13:32.680
ingenious explanatory hypotheses or a shift in the vocabulary used for describing the

13:32.680 --> 13:37.760
objects under discussion which have not occurred to any of the audiences to whom the belief

13:37.760 --> 13:41.920
in question has so far been justified.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.360
This sort of gesture toward an unpredictable future is made, for example, when we say that

13:46.360 --> 13:51.880
our present moral and scientific beliefs may look as primitive to our remote descendants

13:51.880 --> 13:55.600
as those of the Greeks look to us.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.280
My grounding premise that you can only work for what you could recognize is a corollary

14:00.280 --> 14:04.640
of James's principle that a difference has to make a difference to practice before it's

14:04.640 --> 14:07.040
worth discussing.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.600
The only difference between truth and justification which makes such a difference is, as far as

14:11.600 --> 14:18.480
I can see, the difference between old audiences and new audiences.

14:18.480 --> 14:23.840
So I take the appropriate pragmatist attitude toward truth to be, it's no more necessary

14:23.840 --> 14:28.560
to have a philosophical theory about the nature of truth or the meaning of the word true

14:28.560 --> 14:34.280
than it is to have one about the nature of danger or the meaning of the word danger.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.920
The principle reason we have a word like danger in the language is to caution people,

14:38.920 --> 14:44.560
to warn them that they may not have envisaged all the consequences of their proposed action.

14:44.560 --> 14:49.160
We pragmatists who think that beliefs are habits of action rather than attempts to correspond

14:49.160 --> 14:56.120
to reality see the cautionary use of the word true as flagging a special sort of danger.

14:56.120 --> 15:00.840
We use it to remind ourselves that people in different circumstances, people facing

15:00.840 --> 15:06.640
future audiences, may not be able to justify the belief which we have triumphantly justified

15:06.640 --> 15:11.200
to all the audiences we have encountered.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.640
Given this pragmatist view of the function of the word true, what about the claim that

15:15.640 --> 15:19.080
all human beings desire truth?

15:19.080 --> 15:23.920
This claim is ambiguous between the claim that all of them desire to justify their beliefs

15:23.960 --> 15:30.720
to some, though not necessarily all other human beings, and the claim that they all

15:30.720 --> 15:33.680
want their beliefs to be true.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.960
The first claim seems to me unobjectionable.

15:36.960 --> 15:41.560
The second claim, however, seems dubious unless it's merely an alternative formulation

15:41.560 --> 15:43.400
of the first.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.960
For the only other interpretation which we pragmatists can give to the second claim is

15:47.960 --> 15:52.400
that all human beings are concerned about the danger that someday an audience will

15:52.400 --> 15:59.280
come into being before whom a presently justified belief cannot be justified.

15:59.280 --> 16:03.400
But in the first place, mere fallibilism is not what philosophers who hope to make the

16:03.400 --> 16:07.880
notion of truth relevant to democratic politics want.

16:07.880 --> 16:13.560
In the second place, such fallibilism is not, in fact, a feature of all human beings.

16:13.560 --> 16:19.120
It is much more prevalent among inhabitants of wealthy, secure, tolerant, inclusivist societies

16:19.200 --> 16:23.960
than elsewhere, for these people are brought up to rethink themselves that they might be

16:23.960 --> 16:29.080
mistaken, that there are people out there who might disagree with them and whose disagreement

16:29.080 --> 16:31.920
needs to be taken into account.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.600
If you favor democratic politics, you will want to encourage fallibilism.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.600
But there are other ways to do so, beside harping on the difference between the conditional

16:40.600 --> 16:45.840
character of justification and the unconditional character of truth.

16:45.840 --> 16:51.080
One might, for example, harp on the sad fact that many previous communities have betrayed

16:51.080 --> 16:57.120
their own interests by being too sure of themselves and so failing to attend to objections raised

16:57.120 --> 16:58.600
by outsiders.

16:58.600 --> 17:05.360
Furthermore, we should distinguish between fallibilism and philosophical skepticism.

17:05.360 --> 17:11.200
Fallibilism has nothing in particular to do with the quest for universality and unconditionality.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.920
Skepticism does.

17:12.920 --> 17:17.240
Skepticism will usually not go into philosophy, at least in anglophone countries, unless one

17:17.240 --> 17:21.800
is impressed by the sort of skepticism found in Descartes' meditations.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.920
The sort of skepticism which says that the mere possibility of error defeats knowledge

17:25.920 --> 17:27.860
claims.

17:27.860 --> 17:33.680
Not many people find this sort of skepticism interesting, but those who do ask themselves,

17:33.680 --> 17:39.120
is there any way in which we can ensure ourselves against having beliefs which may be unjustifiable

17:39.120 --> 17:41.760
to some future audience?

17:41.760 --> 17:46.880
Is there any way in which we can ensure that we have beliefs justifiable to any and every

17:46.880 --> 17:49.040
audience?

17:49.040 --> 17:53.680
The tiny minority which finds this question interesting consists almost entirely of philosophy

17:53.680 --> 17:56.800
professors and divides into three groups.

17:56.800 --> 18:04.160
First, skeptics like Straude, who say that Descartes' argument from dreams is unanswerable.

18:04.160 --> 18:09.040
For the skeptics, there is always an audience, the future self who is awoken from the dream,

18:09.040 --> 18:13.800
which will not be satisfied by any justification offered by our present, possibly, dreaming

18:13.800 --> 18:16.800
self.

18:16.800 --> 18:21.040
Second, foundationalists like Chisholm, who say that even if we're now dreaming, we

18:21.040 --> 18:25.920
can't be wrong about certain beliefs, certain of our beliefs.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.680
Third, coherentists like Sellers say that, I quote, Sellers, all our beliefs are up for

18:30.680 --> 18:34.200
grabs, though not all at once.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.360
We pragmatists who have been impressed by Perse's criticisms of Descartes think that

18:38.360 --> 18:43.360
both skeptics and foundationalists are led astray by the picture of beliefs as attempts

18:43.360 --> 18:49.040
to represent reality and by the associated idea that truth is a matter of correspondence

18:49.040 --> 18:50.400
to reality.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.000
So we become coherentists.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
But we coherentists remain divided about what, if anything, needs to be said about truth.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.840
I think that once one has explicated the difference between justification and truth by that between

19:03.840 --> 19:09.640
present and future justifiability, there is little more to be said.

19:09.640 --> 19:15.320
Some of my fellow coherentists, Appel, Habermas, and Putnam, think, as Perse also did, that

19:15.320 --> 19:23.200
there's a lot more to be said and that saying it is important for democratic politics.

19:23.200 --> 19:29.720
Section four, universal validity and context transcendence, Putnam, Appel, and Habermas

19:29.720 --> 19:37.680
all take over from Perse an idea which I reject, the idea of convergence upon the one truth.

19:37.680 --> 19:43.800
Instead of arguing that because reality is one and truth correspondence to that one reality,

19:43.800 --> 19:50.000
Perseans argue that the idea of convergence is built into the presuppositions of discourse.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.800
They all agree that the principal reason why reason cannot be naturalized is that reason

19:54.800 --> 19:59.000
is normative and norms cannot be naturalized.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.600
But they say we can make room for the normative without going back to the traditional idea

20:03.600 --> 20:08.380
of a duty to correspond to the intrinsic nature of reality.

20:08.380 --> 20:14.120
We do this by attending to the universalistic character of the idealizing presuppositions

20:14.120 --> 20:16.000
of discourse.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.680
This strategy has the advantage of setting aside meta-ethical questions about whether

20:20.680 --> 20:25.600
there is a moral reality to which our moral judgments might hope to correspond as our

20:25.640 --> 20:31.800
physical science supposedly hopes to correspond to physical reality.

20:31.800 --> 20:37.800
Habermas says that every validity claim, quote, has a transcendent moment of universal validity

20:37.800 --> 20:42.440
which bursts every provinciality asunder.

20:42.440 --> 20:49.640
In addition to the validity claim strategic role in some context bound discussion.

20:49.640 --> 20:55.000
As I see it, the only truth in this idea is that many claims to validity are made by people

20:55.080 --> 20:59.680
who would be willing to defend their claims before audiences other than the one which

20:59.680 --> 21:02.680
they are currently addressing.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.200
Not all assertions obviously are of this sort.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.880
Lawyers, for example, are quite aware that they fashion their claims to suit the quaint

21:09.880 --> 21:13.360
context of a highly local jurisprudence.

21:13.360 --> 21:18.920
But willingness to take on new and unfamiliar audiences is one thing, bursting provinciality

21:18.920 --> 21:21.880
asunder is another.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.280
Habermas's doctrine of a transcendent moment seems to me to run together a commendable

21:26.280 --> 21:30.480
willingness to try something new with an empty boast.

21:30.480 --> 21:35.080
To say I'll try to defend this argument, I'll try to defend this belief against all

21:35.080 --> 21:41.160
comers is often depending upon the circumstances a commendable attitude.

21:41.160 --> 21:47.120
But to say I can successfully defend this against all comers is silly.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.800
Maybe you can, but you're in no more opposition to say that than the village champion

21:51.800 --> 21:55.120
is to claim that he can beat the world champion.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.680
The only sort of situation in which you would be in a position to say the latter is one

21:59.680 --> 22:05.120
in which the rules of the argumentative game have been agreed upon in advance, as in normal

22:05.120 --> 22:09.400
as opposed to revolutionary mathematics, for example.

22:09.400 --> 22:13.600
But in most cases, including the moral and political claims in which Habermas is most

22:13.600 --> 22:16.680
interested, there are no such rules.

22:16.680 --> 22:21.760
The notion of context dependence has a clear sense in the sorts of cases I've just mentioned,

22:22.280 --> 22:26.840
in provincial law courts and in language games such as normal mathematics regulated

22:26.840 --> 22:30.000
by clear and explicit conventions.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.880
For most assertions, however, neither the notion of context dependence nor the notion

22:36.880 --> 22:40.560
of universal validity has such a sense.

22:40.560 --> 22:46.120
For most assertions, such as Clinton is the better candidate, Alexander came before Caesar,

22:46.120 --> 22:51.160
Gold is insoluble in hydrochloric acid and the like, it's hard to see why I should ask

22:51.200 --> 22:56.000
myself, is my claim context dependent or universal?

22:56.000 --> 23:00.560
No difference to practice is going to be made by coming down in favor of one alternative

23:00.560 --> 23:04.200
rather than the other.

23:04.200 --> 23:09.640
Habermas puts forward an analog of this distinction between the context dependent and the universal,

23:09.640 --> 23:14.120
which might seem more relevant to practice.

23:14.120 --> 23:19.440
This analog is what he calls the tension between facticity and validity.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.800
He views this tension as a central philosophical problem and says that this tension is responsible

23:24.800 --> 23:30.040
for many of the difficulties encountered in theorizing democratic politics.

23:30.040 --> 23:34.080
He thinks it is a distinctive and valuable feature of his theory of communicative action

23:34.080 --> 23:40.120
that, quote, it already absorbs the tension between facticity and validity into its fundamental

23:40.120 --> 23:42.400
concepts.

23:42.400 --> 23:47.720
It does so by distinguishing between the strategic use of discourse and what he calls the use

23:47.720 --> 23:51.720
of language oriented to reaching understanding.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.740
This latter distinction might seem just the one we are looking for, the one which lets

23:55.740 --> 24:01.360
us interpret the distinction between context dependence in universality and universality

24:01.360 --> 24:05.040
in a way which makes a difference to practice.

24:05.040 --> 24:10.160
As I see it, however, the distinction between the strategic and non-strategic use of language

24:10.160 --> 24:15.040
is just the distinction between cases in which all we care about is convincing others and

24:15.040 --> 24:18.400
cases in which we hope to learn something.

24:18.400 --> 24:23.080
In the latter set of cases, we are quite willing to give up our present views if we hear something

24:23.080 --> 24:24.400
better.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.440
These cases are two ends of a spectrum, at one end of which we shall use any dirty trick

24:29.440 --> 24:35.880
we can, lying, omitting the truth, suggesting the false and so on, to convince.

24:35.880 --> 24:41.560
At the other end, we talk to others as we talk to ourselves when we are most at ease,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.200
most reflective and most curious.

24:44.200 --> 24:48.920
Most of the time, we are somewhere in the middle between these two extremes.

24:48.920 --> 24:53.160
My problem is, I don't see that these two extremes have anything in particular to do

24:53.160 --> 24:58.320
with a distinction between context dependence and universality.

24:58.320 --> 25:03.360
The pure pursuit of truth is the traditional name for the sort of conversation which takes

25:03.360 --> 25:06.680
place at one end of this spectrum.

25:06.680 --> 25:13.600
But I don't see what that sort of conversation has to do with universality or with unconditionality.

25:13.600 --> 25:18.720
It is non-strategic in the sense that in such conversations we let the wind blow where

25:18.720 --> 25:24.200
it lists it, but it's hard to see that the assertions we make in such conversations presuppose

25:24.200 --> 25:29.160
something which is not presupposed in the assertions I make when I'm at the other end

25:29.160 --> 25:34.000
of the spectrum, the dirty tricks end of the spectrum.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.240
Habermas, however, thinks that unless we recognize, quote, that the validity claims

25:39.240 --> 25:45.000
raised hiket nunk and aimed at intersubjective recognition or acceptance can at the same

25:45.000 --> 25:52.040
time overshoot local standards for taking yes-no positions, we shall not see that this

25:52.040 --> 25:58.960
transcendent moment alone distinguishes the practices of justification oriented to truth

25:58.960 --> 26:06.240
claims from other practices that are regulated merely by social convention.

26:06.240 --> 26:10.640
This passage is a good example of what seems to me Habermas' undesirable commitment to

26:10.640 --> 26:15.680
the logocentric distinction between opinion and knowledge, a distinction between mere

26:15.680 --> 26:21.920
obedience to the norms of social practices, even the sort of norm which would be found

26:21.920 --> 26:29.040
in a utopian democratic society, and the kind of foussé by nature relation to reality which

26:29.040 --> 26:32.280
is provided by the grasp of truth.

26:32.280 --> 26:36.760
Both the opinion knowledge and the normals foussé's distinction appear to delians as

26:36.760 --> 26:41.480
remnants of Plato's obsession with the kind of certainty found in mathematics, and more

26:41.480 --> 26:47.200
generally with the idea that the universal being somehow eternal and unconditional provides

26:47.200 --> 26:53.760
an escape from what is particular, temporal, and conditioned.

26:53.760 --> 26:59.080
In this passage Habermas is, I take it, using the term practices of justification oriented

26:59.080 --> 27:05.120
to truth claims to refer to the nice end of the spectrum I described above.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.760
But from my point of view, truth has nothing to do with it.

27:08.760 --> 27:14.760
Since social convention, rather they're regulated by certain particular social conventions,

27:14.760 --> 27:20.600
those of a society even more democratic, tolerant, leisure, wealthy, and diverse than our own,

27:20.600 --> 27:25.800
one in which inclusivism is built into everyone's sense of moral identity.

27:25.800 --> 27:31.600
In this society everybody always welcomes strange opinions on all sorts of topics.

27:31.600 --> 27:36.280
These are also the conventions of certain lucky parts of contemporary society.

27:36.280 --> 27:42.840
For example, university seminars, summer camps for intellectuals, and the like.

27:42.840 --> 27:48.640
Perhaps the most far-reaching difference between Habermas and I is that pragmatists like myself

27:48.640 --> 27:55.000
sympathize with the anti-metaphysical, so-called postmodern thinkers whom Habermas criticizes

27:55.120 --> 27:59.880
when they suggest that the idea of a distinction between social practice and what transcends

27:59.880 --> 28:05.280
such practice is an undesirable remnant of logocentrism.

28:05.280 --> 28:10.560
Foucault and Dewey can agree that whether or not inquiry is always a matter of power,

28:10.560 --> 28:13.880
it never transcends social practice.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.280
So incidentally, can brand them.

28:16.280 --> 28:25.600
So this issue comes up in the context of Brandon's work tomorrow.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.840
Both would say that the only thing that can transcend the social practice is another social

28:29.840 --> 28:34.960
practice, just as the only thing that can transcend the present audience is a future

28:34.960 --> 28:35.960
audience.

28:35.960 --> 28:40.600
Similarly, the only thing that can transcend a discursive strategy is another discursive

28:40.600 --> 28:45.560
strategy, one aimed at other better goals.

28:45.560 --> 28:51.040
But because I don't know how to aim at it, I don't think that truth names such a goal.

28:51.040 --> 28:56.520
I know how to aim at greater honesty, greater charity, greater patience, greater inclusiveness,

28:56.520 --> 28:57.680
and so on.

28:57.680 --> 29:03.320
I see democratic politics as serving such concrete, desirable goals, but I don't see

29:03.320 --> 29:10.440
that it helps things to add truth or universality or unconditionality to the list of goals.

29:10.440 --> 29:19.440
Or I don't see what we will do differently depending on whether or not we make such additions.

29:19.440 --> 29:24.200
It may sound at this point as if the difference between me and Habermas is one that makes

29:24.200 --> 29:26.160
no difference to practice.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.400
We both have the same utopias in mind.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.600
We both engage in the same sort of democratic politics.

29:31.600 --> 29:36.600
So why quibble about the difference between whether to call utopian communication practices

29:36.600 --> 29:39.160
oriented to truth or not?

29:39.160 --> 29:45.040
Why quibble about the whole subject of the relevance of truth to democratic politics?

29:45.040 --> 29:49.400
The answer is that Habermas thinks it does make a difference to practice because he gets

29:49.400 --> 29:52.960
to make an argumentative move which isn't open to me.

29:52.960 --> 29:58.160
He gets to accuse his opponents of performative self-contradiction.

29:58.160 --> 30:04.440
Habermas thinks that, quote, the universal discourse of an unbounded community of interpretation

30:04.440 --> 30:10.760
is unavoidably assumed by anybody, even me, who gets into any argument.

30:10.760 --> 30:17.080
He says, quote, even if these presuppositions have an ideal content that can only be approximately

30:17.080 --> 30:22.660
satisfied, all participants must de facto accept them, accept the presuppositions of

30:22.660 --> 30:27.720
communication, whether they assert or deny the truth of a statement in any way and would

30:27.720 --> 30:35.960
like to enter into argumentation aimed at justifying this validity claim.

30:35.960 --> 30:41.120
My experience of speaking in Frankfurt is invariably that, at a certain point, Appel

30:41.120 --> 30:45.680
will accuse me of performative self-contradiction.

30:45.680 --> 30:53.400
This is the standard Frankfurt move, sort of the basic strategy of the school.

30:53.880 --> 30:58.680
What about somebody who is outraged as are many trustees of American universities by

30:58.680 --> 31:03.400
the social conventions of the better parts of the better universities, places where

31:03.400 --> 31:09.080
even the most paradoxical and unpromising claims are seriously discussed, and in which

31:09.080 --> 31:15.260
feminists, atheists, homosexuals, blacks, etc. are taken seriously as moral equals and

31:15.260 --> 31:16.760
conversational partners?

31:16.760 --> 31:23.200
I take it that on Habermas's view, such a person will be contradicting himself if he

31:23.200 --> 31:28.160
offers arguments to the effect that these conventions should be replaced by other more

31:28.160 --> 31:30.640
exclusivist conventions.

31:30.640 --> 31:35.720
By contrast, I can't tell the narrow-minded university trustee that he's contradicting

31:35.720 --> 31:36.720
himself.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.560
I can only try to weedle him into greater tolerance by the usual indirect means, giving

31:41.560 --> 31:47.240
examples of present platitudes which were once paradoxes of the contributions to culture

31:47.240 --> 31:52.440
made by black female homosexual atheists and so on.

31:52.440 --> 32:00.800
The big question of whether anybody has ever been convinced by the charge of performative

32:00.800 --> 32:02.360
self-confidiction.

32:02.360 --> 32:07.960
I don't think that there are many clear examples of such a change being taken to heart.

32:07.960 --> 32:12.400
If you tell a bigot of the sort I've sketched that he's committed to making context-surpassing

32:12.400 --> 32:16.880
validity claims to aiming at truth, he'll probably agree that that's exactly what he's

32:16.880 --> 32:18.440
doing.

32:18.440 --> 32:23.480
If you tell him that he can't make such claims and still balk at the paradoxes or the people

32:23.480 --> 32:28.080
at whom he balks, he will probably not get the point.

32:28.080 --> 32:34.240
He will say that people who invent such paradoxes are too crazy to argue with or argue about

32:34.240 --> 32:37.820
that women have a distorted view of reality and the why.

32:37.820 --> 32:44.800
He will think it irrational or immoral or both to take such paradoxes and people seriously.

32:44.800 --> 32:51.720
That's why he doesn't think the university should allow them to teach, speak and so on.

32:51.720 --> 32:56.320
I can't see much difference between the bigot's reaction to me and Habermas and Habermas's

32:56.320 --> 32:59.000
and my reactions to him.

32:59.000 --> 33:06.000
I can't see that anything like communicative reason favors our reactions rather than his.

33:06.000 --> 33:12.400
This is because I don't see why the term reason is not as much up for grabs as the term academic

33:12.400 --> 33:19.160
freedom or morality or pervert, nor how the anti-foundationalist coherentism which Habermas

33:19.160 --> 33:26.400
and I share can make room for a non-recontextualizable, non-relativizable conversation stopper called

33:26.400 --> 33:29.380
performative self-contradiction.

33:29.380 --> 33:34.560
What the bigot and I do and I think should do when told that we have violated a presupposition

33:34.560 --> 33:40.320
of communication is to haggle about the meanings of the terms used in stating the purported

33:40.320 --> 33:48.000
presupposition, terms like true argument, reason, communication, domination and so on.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.880
This haggling will with luck eventually turn into a mutually profitable conversation about

33:53.880 --> 33:56.000
our respective utopias.

33:56.000 --> 34:04.800
Our respective ideas about what an ideal society or university empowering an ideally competent

34:04.800 --> 34:07.120
audience would look like.

34:07.120 --> 34:11.000
But this conversation is not likely to end with the bigot's rocked and admission that

34:11.000 --> 34:14.600
he has entangled himself in a contradiction.

34:14.600 --> 34:20.000
Even if I should, by a miracle, succeed in convincing him of the worth of my utopia,

34:20.000 --> 34:26.320
his reaction will be to regret his own previous lack of curiosity and imagination rather than

34:26.320 --> 34:32.000
to regret his failure to spot his own presuppositions.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.160
This section is about an argument of Albrecht Velmers who's associated with Habermas but

34:42.160 --> 34:46.640
differs from him in various interesting ways.

34:46.640 --> 34:52.280
I agree with Appel and Habermas that Perse was right in telling us to talk about discourse

34:52.280 --> 34:57.800
rather than about consciousness, but I think that the only ideal presupposed by discourse

34:57.800 --> 35:03.200
is that of being able to justify your beliefs to a competent audience.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.440
As a coherentist, I think that if you can agree with other members of such an audience

35:07.440 --> 35:12.840
about what is to be done, then you don't have to worry about your relationship to reality.

35:12.840 --> 35:17.360
But everything depends upon what constitutes a competent audience.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.400
Unlike Appel and Habermas, the moral I draw from Perse is that we philosophers who are

35:21.400 --> 35:26.560
concerned with democratic politics should leave truth alone as a sublimely undiscussable

35:26.560 --> 35:31.400
topic and instead turn to the question of how to persuade people to broaden the size

35:31.400 --> 35:36.760
of the audience they take to be competent to increase the size of the relevant community

35:36.760 --> 35:38.640
of justification.

35:38.640 --> 35:43.640
The latter project is not only relevant to democratic politics, it pretty much is democratic

35:43.640 --> 35:46.120
politics.

35:46.120 --> 35:50.480
Appel and Habermas think that the demand to maximize the size of this community is already,

35:50.480 --> 35:53.520
so to speak, built into communicative action.

35:53.520 --> 35:59.480
This is the cash value of their claim that every assertion claims universal validity.

35:59.480 --> 36:05.960
Albert Velmer, like me, rejects the convergentism which Habermas and Appel share with Buttman.

36:05.960 --> 36:11.320
But he nevertheless accepts their claim that our truth claims, quote, transcend the context,

36:11.320 --> 36:17.640
the local or cultural context in which they are raised.

36:17.640 --> 36:22.160
My problem with Velmer, Appel and Habermas is that I don't see what the pragmatic force

36:22.280 --> 36:26.800
of saying that an argument which, like all other arguments, convinces certain people and

36:26.800 --> 36:30.780
not others is a good argument.

36:30.780 --> 36:35.480
This seems like saying that a tool which, like all tools, is useful for certain purposes

36:35.480 --> 36:39.120
but not others is a good tool.

36:39.120 --> 36:43.060
Imagine the surgeon who, after unsuccessfully attempting to dig a tunnel out of his prison

36:43.060 --> 36:47.720
cell with his scalpel saying, still, it's a good tool.

36:47.720 --> 36:53.120
Imagine picture him saying, after unsuccessfully trying to convince his guards to let him escape,

36:53.120 --> 36:57.000
so that he may resume his position as leader of the resistance, saying, still, they were

36:57.000 --> 36:59.400
good arguments.

36:59.400 --> 37:05.080
My problem is intensified when I ask myself whether my truth claims transcend my local

37:05.080 --> 37:07.560
cultural context.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.080
I have no clear idea whether they do or not because I can't see what transcendence means

37:12.080 --> 37:13.080
here.

37:13.400 --> 37:19.240
I can't even see what the point of taking my assertion as making a truth claim is.

37:19.240 --> 37:24.480
When I believe that Pee and express this belief by asserting it in the course of a conversation,

37:24.480 --> 37:26.880
am I making a claim?

37:26.880 --> 37:29.080
What's the force of saying that?

37:29.080 --> 37:34.480
What to saying that add to saying that I am, to speak with Purse, informing my interlocutor

37:34.480 --> 37:40.280
about my habits of action, giving her hints about how to predict and control my future

37:40.400 --> 37:44.440
conversational and non-conversational behavior.

37:44.440 --> 37:48.920
Depending on the situation at hand, I may also be inviting her to disagree with me by telling

37:48.920 --> 37:53.320
me about her different habits of action, suggesting that I'm prepared to give reasons

37:53.320 --> 37:57.960
from my belief, trying to make a good impression on her and a thousand other things.

37:57.960 --> 38:02.000
As Austin reminded us, there are lots of things I do when I make an assertion which can be

38:02.000 --> 38:07.400
interpreted as part of the give and take between me and my interlocutor.

38:07.400 --> 38:12.600
This give and take is a matter of, roughly, the reciprocal adjustment of our behavior,

38:12.600 --> 38:18.800
the strategic coordination of that behavior in ways which may prove mutually profitable.

38:18.800 --> 38:23.640
Of course, if somebody asks me after I have asserted Pee whether I believe that Pee is

38:23.640 --> 38:26.360
true, I shall say yes.

38:26.360 --> 38:31.120
But I shall wonder, as Wittgenstein did, what the point of that question was.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.680
Is he questioning my sincerity?

38:33.680 --> 38:38.640
Is he expressing incredulity about my ability to offer reasons from my belief?

38:38.640 --> 38:44.080
I can try to straighten things out by asking the question to the spell out why he asks.

38:44.080 --> 38:49.600
But he replies, I just wanted to be sure you are making a context-transcendent truth claim.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.560
I'll be baffled.

38:51.560 --> 38:55.080
What does he want to be reassured about, exactly?

38:55.080 --> 38:59.400
What would it be like for me to make a context-dependent assertion?

38:59.400 --> 39:04.640
Of course, in the trivial sense that an assertion may not always be applicable, all assertions

39:04.640 --> 39:05.640
are context-dependent.

39:05.640 --> 39:10.880
But what would it mean for the proposition asserted to be context-dependent, as opposed

39:10.880 --> 39:14.880
to the speech act being context-dependent?

39:14.880 --> 39:18.960
I'm not sure how people like Habermas and Velmer, who've given up on correspondence

39:18.960 --> 39:23.360
theories of truth and consequently can't distinguish between a claim to report a habit

39:23.360 --> 39:29.320
of action and a claim to represent reality, can draw this distinction between context-dependence

39:29.360 --> 39:31.840
and context-independence.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.840
My best guess is that they believe that, in Velmer's words, quote, whenever we raise

39:36.840 --> 39:42.440
a truth claim on the basis of what we take to be good arguments or compelling evidence,

39:42.440 --> 39:48.040
we take the epistemic conditions prevailing here and now to be ideal in the following

39:48.040 --> 39:49.800
sense.

39:49.800 --> 39:54.640
We presuppose that no arguments or evidence will come up in the future which would put

39:54.640 --> 39:58.080
our own truth claims into question.

39:58.080 --> 40:04.640
Whereas Velmer also puts it, quote, relying upon reasons or evidences as compelling means

40:04.640 --> 40:11.520
to exclude the possibility of being proved wrong as time goes on.

40:11.520 --> 40:17.120
If that's what it takes to make a context-transcendent truth claim, then I have never made one.

40:17.120 --> 40:22.960
I would not know how to exclude the possibility that Velmer described, nor would I know how

40:22.960 --> 40:27.880
to presuppose that no arguments or evidence will turn up in the future which will cast

40:27.920 --> 40:30.640
out on my belief.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.640
Relying once again on the fundamental pragmatist principle that any difference has to make

40:34.640 --> 40:39.880
a difference to practice, I want to know whether this excluding or presupposing are things

40:39.880 --> 40:43.080
I can decide to do or not to do.

40:43.080 --> 40:47.360
If they are, I want to know more about how to go about doing them.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.680
If they aren't, they seem to me empty.

40:50.680 --> 40:55.000
I can make my point in another way by asking, what's the difference between a metaphysician

40:55.000 --> 41:00.320
committed to a correspondence theory of truth, telling me that whether I know it or will

41:00.320 --> 41:05.320
admit it or not, my assertions automatically willy-nilly amount to a claim to represent

41:05.320 --> 41:11.680
reality accurately, and my fellow Perseans telling me that they automatically willy-nilly

41:11.680 --> 41:18.800
amount to an exclusion of possibilities or a presupposition about what the future holds.

41:18.800 --> 41:24.000
In both cases, I'm being told that I presuppose something which, even after considerable reflection,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.520
I don't think I believe.

41:26.520 --> 41:31.360
But the notion of presupposition, when it's extended to beliefs which the purported presupposer

41:31.360 --> 41:37.600
astoutly denies, becomes hard to distinguish from the notion of re-description of person

41:37.600 --> 41:41.000
A in person B's language.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.400
If A can explain what I'm doing and why I'm doing it in her own terms, what right has

41:46.400 --> 41:53.560
B got to keep on saying, no, what you, A, are really doing is so-and-so.

41:53.560 --> 41:58.000
In the case at hand, we doians think we have a perfectly good way of describing our own

41:58.000 --> 42:04.280
behavior, behavior of which Habermas approves, in ways which, as true terms, like universal,

42:04.280 --> 42:07.880
unconditional, and transcendence.

42:07.880 --> 42:13.200
It seems to me in the spirit of Perse's criticism of Descartes' make-believe doubt, to raise

42:13.200 --> 42:17.840
the question of whether we are not dealing here with make-believe transcendence, a sort

42:17.840 --> 42:21.720
of make-believe response to a make-believe doubt.

42:21.800 --> 42:27.280
Real doubt, Perse said, comes when some concrete difficulty is envisaged if one acts according

42:27.280 --> 42:30.560
to the habit which is the belief.

42:30.560 --> 42:35.760
Such a difficulty might be, for example, having to seize asserting and believing some relevant

42:35.760 --> 42:40.680
but conflicting proposition.

42:40.680 --> 42:46.400
Real transcendence, I should say, occurs when I say, I am prepared to justify this belief,

42:46.400 --> 42:50.720
not just to people who share the following premises with me, but to lots of other people

42:50.720 --> 42:55.000
who don't share those premises but with whom I share a certain others.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.960
The question whether I am so prepared is a concrete, practical question, whose answer

42:59.960 --> 43:05.560
I determine by, for example, imaginatively previewing various other audience's responses

43:05.560 --> 43:09.680
to my assertion and my subsequent behavior.

43:09.680 --> 43:13.320
But such experiments and imagination obviously have limits.

43:13.320 --> 43:18.960
I can't imagine myself defending my assertion to any possible audience.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.640
In the first place, I can usually dream up audiences to whom it would be pointless to

43:22.640 --> 43:29.080
try to justify my beliefs, try defending beliefs about justice in the antitholes or Nazi prison

43:29.080 --> 43:34.560
guards or about quarks to Aristotle or about trigonometry to three-year-olds.

43:34.560 --> 43:39.440
In the second place, no good pragmatist ever uses the term all possible.

43:39.440 --> 43:43.680
He doesn't know how to imagine or discover the bounds of possibility.

43:44.400 --> 43:49.520
Indeed, he can't figure out what the point of attempting such a feat would be.

43:49.520 --> 43:54.480
Under what concrete circumstances would it be important to consider the difference between

43:54.480 --> 44:00.280
all the x's I can think of and all possible x's?

44:00.280 --> 44:05.760
How could that difference make a difference to practice?

44:05.760 --> 44:11.920
I conclude that Delmer's way of distinguishing between context-dependent and context-independent

44:11.920 --> 44:16.160
claims can't be made plausible, at least to pragmatists.

44:16.160 --> 44:20.560
Since I can think of no better way, I think we should ask why Delmer, Appel and Habermas

44:20.560 --> 44:23.840
think this distinction worth drawing.

44:23.840 --> 44:28.860
The obvious answer is that they want to avoid what they call the relativism, which contextualism

44:28.860 --> 44:31.480
purportedly entails.

44:31.480 --> 44:37.280
So I turn now to what Delmer calls the antinomy of truth, the clash between relativist and

44:37.280 --> 44:41.080
absolutist intuitions.

44:41.080 --> 44:46.960
Over the beginning of his essay, Truth, Contingency and Modernity, Delmer writes his pause.

44:46.960 --> 44:54.440
If there is irresolvable disagreement about the possibility of justifying truth claims,

44:54.440 --> 44:59.280
about standards of argumentation or evidential support, e.g. between members of different

44:59.280 --> 45:05.600
linguistic, scientific or cultural communities, may I still suppose that there are, somewhere,

45:05.600 --> 45:10.880
the correct standards, the right criteria, in short, that there is an objective truth

45:10.880 --> 45:11.880
of the matter.

45:11.880 --> 45:17.360
Or should I rather think that truth is relative to cultures, languages, communities, or even

45:17.360 --> 45:19.560
persons?

45:19.560 --> 45:24.000
While relativism, the second alternative, appears to be inconsistent, absolutism, the

45:24.000 --> 45:27.920
first alternative seems to imply metaphysical assumptions.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.760
Let's call this the antinomy of truth.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.360
Much important philosophical work has been done in the last decades to resolve this antinomy,

45:35.480 --> 45:40.080
either by trying to show that absolutism need not be metaphysical, or by trying to show

45:40.080 --> 45:44.040
that the critique of absolutism need not lead to relativism.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.480
End of quote.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.400
My problem with Delmer's antinomy is that I don't think that denying that there are

45:50.400 --> 45:56.040
the correct standards should lead anybody to say that truth, as opposed to justification,

45:56.040 --> 45:58.320
is relative to something.

45:58.320 --> 46:03.360
As far as I can see, nobody would think that the critique of absolutism leads to relativism,

46:03.360 --> 46:07.440
unless you thought that the only reason for justifying our beliefs to each other is that

46:07.440 --> 46:13.040
such justification makes it more likely that our beliefs are true.

46:13.040 --> 46:17.120
I don't think there's any reason to think that such justification makes it more likely

46:17.120 --> 46:19.840
that our beliefs are true.

46:19.840 --> 46:24.600
But I don't think that's a cause for concern, since I don't think that our practice of justifying

46:24.600 --> 46:28.160
our beliefs needs justification.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.920
If I'm right, that the only indispensable function of the word true, or any other indefinable

46:32.920 --> 46:38.880
normative term, such as good or right, is to caution to warn against danger by making

46:38.880 --> 46:45.280
gestures toward unpredictable situations, future audiences, future moral dilemmas, etc.,

46:45.280 --> 46:51.440
then it doesn't make much sense to ask whether or not justification leads to truth.

46:51.440 --> 46:55.600
Justification to more and more audiences leads to less and less danger of rebuttal, and

46:55.600 --> 46:58.600
thus to less and less need for caution.

46:58.600 --> 47:03.840
If I convince them, we often say to ourselves, I should be able to convince anybody.

47:03.840 --> 47:08.480
But one would only say that it leads to truth if one could somehow project from the condition

47:08.480 --> 47:14.840
to the uncondition, from all imaginable to all possible audiences.

47:14.840 --> 47:19.400
Such a prediction makes some sense if one believes in convergence.

47:19.400 --> 47:24.640
For such a belief, seems the space of reasons as finite and structured, so that as more

47:24.640 --> 47:30.120
and more audiences are satisfied, more and more members of a finite set of possible objections

47:30.120 --> 47:32.320
are eliminated.

47:32.320 --> 47:38.120
One will be encouraged to see the space of reasons in this way if one is a representationalist,

47:38.120 --> 47:42.960
because one will see reality, or at least the spatiotemporal hunk of reality relevant

47:42.960 --> 47:49.800
to human concerns, as finite and as constantly shoving us out of error and toward truth,

47:49.800 --> 47:54.600
discouraging inaccurate representations of itself and thereby producing increasingly

47:54.600 --> 47:58.080
accurate ones.

47:58.080 --> 48:03.120
But if one does not take knowledge to be accurate representation of reality, nor truth to be

48:03.120 --> 48:08.000
correspondence to reality, then it's harder to be a convergentist and harder to think

48:08.000 --> 48:12.520
of the space of reasons as finite and structured.

48:12.520 --> 48:17.760
Filmar, it seems to me, wants to project from the condition our various experiences of success

48:17.760 --> 48:22.720
in justifying our beliefs to the unconditioned truth.

48:22.720 --> 48:27.160
The big difference between me and Velmer is that I think the answer to Velmer's question,

48:27.160 --> 48:33.880
as a quote from Velmer, do our democratic and liberal principles define just one possible

48:33.880 --> 48:39.480
political language game among others, is an unqualified yes.

48:39.480 --> 48:45.600
Velmer, however, thinks, quote, a qualified no can be justified, and by justification

48:45.600 --> 48:54.000
I now mean not justification for us, but justification period, end of quote.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.320
As I see it, the very idea of justification period commits Velmer to the thesis that the

48:59.320 --> 49:04.320
logical space of reason giving is finite and structured.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.880
So I would urge him to abandon the latter thesis for the same reasons that he abandoned

49:08.880 --> 49:12.880
Apples and Habermas's convergentism.

49:12.880 --> 49:17.720
But oddly enough, the reasons these reasons are pretty much the reasons he gives for giving

49:17.720 --> 49:21.080
his qualified no.

49:21.080 --> 49:26.040
Velmer's central point in defense of this qualified no answer is one which I wholeheartedly

49:26.040 --> 49:33.280
accept, namely that the very idea of incompatible and perhaps reciprocally unintelligible language

49:33.280 --> 49:38.480
games is a pointless fiction, and that in real cases representatives of different traditions

49:38.480 --> 49:42.760
and cultures can always find a way to talk over their differences.

49:42.760 --> 49:48.280
I entirely agree with Velmer when he says, quote, rationality in any relevant sense of

49:48.280 --> 49:53.440
the word cannot end at the borderline of closed language games since there is no such thing

49:53.440 --> 49:57.560
as a closed language game.

49:57.560 --> 50:03.080
My disagreement with Velmer starts when after a semicolon, Velmer finishes that sentence

50:03.080 --> 50:10.760
with, but then the ethnocentric contextuality of all argumentation is quite well compatible

50:10.760 --> 50:16.480
with the raising of truth claims which transcend the context, the local or cultural context

50:16.480 --> 50:21.000
in which they are raised and in which they can be justified.

50:21.000 --> 50:27.200
I should have finished that same sentence by saying, but then the ethnocentric contextuality

50:27.200 --> 50:32.880
of all argumentation is quite well compatible with the claim that a liberal and democratic

50:32.880 --> 50:39.040
society can bring together and include all sorts of diverse ethnoi, all sorts of diverse

50:39.040 --> 50:45.360
local, cultural, social practices.

50:45.360 --> 50:49.200
Here's a way of summing up the difference between me and Velmer.

50:49.200 --> 50:54.000
We agree that one reason to prefer democracies is that they enable us to construct ever bigger

50:54.000 --> 50:59.360
and better contexts of discussion, but I stop there and Velmer goes on.

50:59.360 --> 51:07.440
He adds that this reason is not just a justification of democracy for us, but a justification period.

51:07.440 --> 51:12.580
He thinks that the democratic and liberal principles of modernity should potcherority

51:12.580 --> 51:16.520
be understood in a universalistic sense.

51:16.520 --> 51:21.520
My problem, of course, is that I don't have the option of understanding them that way.

51:21.520 --> 51:25.880
Pragmatists like me can't figure out how to tell whether we're understanding a justification

51:25.880 --> 51:32.640
as just a justification for us or as a justification period.

51:32.640 --> 51:37.480
This strikes me as like trying to tell whether I think of my scalpel or my computer as a

51:37.480 --> 51:42.840
good tool for the task at hand or a good tool period.

51:42.840 --> 51:49.960
At this point, however, one can imagine Velmer rejoining then so much the worse for pragmatism.

51:49.960 --> 51:54.960
Any view which makes you unable to understand a distinction everybody else understands

51:54.960 --> 51:57.880
must have something wrong with it.

51:57.880 --> 52:02.440
My rebuttal would be you're only entitled to that distinction as long as you can back

52:02.440 --> 52:08.040
it up with a distinction between what seemed good reasons to us and what seemed good reasons

52:08.040 --> 52:12.920
to something like an ahistorical Kantian tribunal of reason.

52:12.920 --> 52:18.240
But you deprive yourself of that possibility when you gave up on convergentism and thus

52:18.240 --> 52:24.560
gave up the non-metaphysical Frankfurt substitute for such a tribunal vis the idealization

52:24.560 --> 52:29.680
called the undistorted communication situation.

52:29.680 --> 52:34.640
I agree with Velmer that quote, democratic and liberal institutions are the only ones

52:34.640 --> 52:40.040
which could possibly coexist with a recognition of contingency and still reproduce their own

52:40.040 --> 52:42.160
legitimacy.

52:42.160 --> 52:48.160
At least if one takes the term reproduce their own legitimacy to mean something like make

52:48.160 --> 52:53.560
its view of the situation of human beings in the universe hang together with its political

52:53.560 --> 52:54.560
practices.

52:54.560 --> 53:00.520
But I don't think that the recognition of contingency serves as a justification period

53:00.520 --> 53:07.360
for democratic politics because I don't think it does what Velmer says, namely, quote, destroys

53:07.360 --> 53:16.320
the intellectual bases of dogmatism, foundationalism, authoritarianism and immoral and legal inequality.

53:16.320 --> 53:23.160
This is because I don't think that dogmatism or moral inequality have intellectual bases.

53:23.160 --> 53:27.440
If I am a bigoted proponent of the inequality of Blacks, women and homosexuals to straight

53:27.440 --> 53:33.360
white males, I need not necessarily appeal to the denial of contingency by invoking a

53:33.360 --> 53:37.640
metaphysical theory about the true nature of human beings.

53:37.640 --> 53:43.000
I could do that, but I might also, when it came to philosophy, be a pragmatist.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.680
A bigot and I can say the same Foucaultian, Nietzschean thing, that the only real question

53:49.680 --> 53:51.520
is one of power.

53:51.520 --> 53:57.280
The question of which community is going to inherit the earth, mine or my opponents?

53:57.280 --> 54:02.200
One's choice of a community for that role is intertwined with one's sense of what counts

54:02.200 --> 54:05.120
as a competent audience.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.520
Do only Aryans count as a competent audience?

54:08.520 --> 54:11.080
Do only Christians count as a competent audience?

54:11.080 --> 54:15.520
Do only liberal democrats count as a competent audience?

54:15.520 --> 54:20.800
The fact that there are no mutually unintelligible language games, the point Velmer insists on

54:20.800 --> 54:27.560
and which Davidson, I think, effectively argues for, the fact that there are no mutually unintelligible

54:27.560 --> 54:34.480
language games does not in itself do much to show that disputes between racists and anti-racists,

54:34.480 --> 54:38.560
democrats and fascists, can be decided without resort to foes.

54:38.560 --> 54:44.760
Both sides may agree that although they understand what each other says perfectly well and share

54:44.760 --> 54:50.720
common views on most topics, including perhaps the recognition of contingency, the false

54:50.760 --> 54:55.640
pseudo-fellow gocentrism and so on, there seems no prospect of reaching agreement on

54:55.640 --> 54:58.000
the particular issue at hand.

54:58.000 --> 55:02.120
So both sides say as they reach for their guns, it looks as if we'll have to fight it

55:02.120 --> 55:05.880
out.

55:05.880 --> 55:11.320
My answer to Velmer's question about whether our democratic and liberal principles define

55:11.320 --> 55:16.680
just one possible political language game among others is yes.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.240
If the force of the question is to ask whether there is something in the nature of discourse

55:21.240 --> 55:24.360
which singles our game out.

55:24.360 --> 55:29.120
I can't see what other force the question could have and I think so, I think we have

55:29.120 --> 55:34.640
to rest content with saying that no philosophical thesis either about contingency or about truth

55:34.640 --> 55:39.240
does anything decisive for democratic politics.

55:39.240 --> 55:44.760
By decisive, I mean doing what Oppel and Habermas want to do, convicting the anti-democrat

55:44.760 --> 55:48.120
of a performative self-contradiction.

55:48.120 --> 55:53.280
The most that an insistence on contingency can do for democracy is to supply one more

55:53.280 --> 55:56.920
debating point on the democratic side of the argument.

55:56.920 --> 56:02.280
Just as the insistence that, for example, only the Aryan race is in tune with the intrinsic

56:02.280 --> 56:07.840
necessary nature of things can supply one more debating point on the other side.

56:07.840 --> 56:12.880
I can't take the latter point seriously but I don't think that there's anything self-contradictory

56:13.160 --> 56:20.640
in the Nazis refusal to take me seriously so we may both have to reach for our guns.

56:20.640 --> 56:26.120
Unlike Habermas, I don't think that disciplines like philosophy, linguistics, and developmental

56:26.120 --> 56:29.760
psychology can do much for democratic politics.

56:29.760 --> 56:35.640
I see the development of the social conventions in which Habermas and I both rejoice as a

56:35.640 --> 56:36.960
lucky accident.

56:37.320 --> 56:43.120
Still, I'd be happy to think I'd be wrong about this, that I'd be happy to think that

56:43.120 --> 56:45.640
I was wrong about this.

56:45.640 --> 56:50.600
Maybe the gradual development of these conventions, that is, the gradual development of the social

56:50.600 --> 56:58.240
practices which make up the basis of liberal society, maybe the gradual development of

56:58.240 --> 57:04.280
those conventions does, as Habermas thinks, illustrate a universal pattern of phylo or

57:04.280 --> 57:10.720
ontogenetic development, a pattern captured by the rational reconstruction of competences,

57:10.720 --> 57:17.040
offered by various human sciences, and illustrated by the transition from traditional to modern

57:17.040 --> 57:20.280
rationalized societies.

57:20.280 --> 57:25.440
But unlike Habermas, I should be unperturbed if the offers currently made by the human

57:25.440 --> 57:27.920
sciences were withdrawn.

57:27.920 --> 57:34.240
For example, if Chomsky's universalistic ideas about communicative competence were repudiated

57:34.320 --> 57:39.760
by a connectionist revolution and artificial intelligence, I have a footnote saying that

57:39.760 --> 57:46.280
Davidson's argument in his article, A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs, against the sort of

57:46.280 --> 57:56.800
MIT language learning reconstruction of communicative competence in terms of Chomsky and fundamental

57:56.800 --> 58:03.840
grammar seems to be, you know, this Davidsonian point that we don't really need the idea

58:03.840 --> 58:10.400
of mastering a set of grammatical rules in order to understand language learning seems

58:10.400 --> 58:18.000
to be being supported by connectionist programs in artificial intelligence.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.960
I don't know whether this is true or not.

58:20.960 --> 58:28.880
I just put it in as an example of a change in the opinion of linguists of an anti-Chomsky

58:28.880 --> 58:35.400
revolution in linguistics, which it seems to me wouldn't greatly matter to philosophers

58:35.400 --> 58:43.920
or political thinkers, but I think Habermas goes out on a limb in, you know, his attachment

58:43.920 --> 58:52.280
to Chomsky and his use of Chomsky's notion of competence as a sort of structural device

58:52.280 --> 58:56.960
for his own work.

58:56.960 --> 59:02.640
I should be unreturbed if Chomsky's ideas were repudiated if Piaget's and Colberg's

59:02.640 --> 59:07.240
empirical results proved to be unduplicatable and so on.

59:07.240 --> 59:11.760
I don't see that it matters much whether there are actual patterns here.

59:11.760 --> 59:16.840
I don't much care whether democratic politics is an expression of something deep or whether

59:16.840 --> 59:22.080
it expresses nothing better than some hopes which popped from nowhere into the brains

59:22.080 --> 59:27.600
of a few remarkable people like Socrates, Christ, Jefferson, and so on, and which for

59:27.600 --> 59:31.400
unknown reasons became popular.

59:31.400 --> 59:36.520
Habermas and Oppel think that the way to create a cosmopolitan community is to study the nature

59:36.520 --> 59:42.320
of something called rationality, which all human beings share, something already present

59:42.320 --> 59:45.840
within them but insufficiently acknowledged.

59:45.840 --> 59:50.880
That's why they would be depressed if the offers made by Chomsky, Colberg, etc. were

59:50.880 --> 59:54.000
in the course of time withdrawn.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.800
But suppose we say that all that rationality amounts to, all that marks human beings off

59:58.800 --> 01:00:04.400
from other species of animals, is the ability to use language and thus to have sentential

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.640
attitudes like beliefs and desires.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.360
It seems plausible to add that there is no more reason to expect all the organisms which

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.640
share this ability to form a single community of justification than to expect such a community

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:25.000
to unite all the organisms able to walk long distances or to remain monogamous or to digest

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.520
vegetables.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.120
One will not expect such a single community of justification to be created by the ability

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:37.280
to communicate if one takes the ability to use language to be, like the prehensile thumb,

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.880
just one more gimmick which organisms have developed to increase their chances of survival.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.600
If we combine this Darwinian point of view with the holistic attitude toward intentionality

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:55.040
and language use found in Wittgenstein and Davidson, we shall say that there is no language

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.880
use without justification, no ability to believe without an ability to argue about what beliefs

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880
to have.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.880
But this is not to say that the ability to use language to have beliefs and desires entails

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.520
a desire to justify one's beliefs to every language using organism one encounters.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.800
It's not to say that any language user who comes down the road will be treated as a member

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.240
of a competent audience.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.160
On the contrary, human beings usually divide up into mutually suspicious, not mutually

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.840
unintelligible, communities of justification, mutually exclusive groups depending on the

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.920
presence or absence of sufficient overlap in belief and desire.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:41.560
The principle source of conflict between human communities is the belief that I have no reason

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.480
to justify my beliefs to you and none in finding out what alternative beliefs you may have,

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:54.360
because you are, for example, an infidel, a foreigner, a woman, a child, a slave, a pervert,

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.880
or an untouchable.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:01.160
In short, you're not one of us, not one of the real human beings, the paradigm human

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:09.240
beings, the ones whose persons and opinions are to be treated with respect.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.600
The philosophical tradition has tried to stitch exclusivist communities together by saying

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.560
there's more overlap between infidels and true believers, masters and slaves, men and

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.060
women than you might have thought, for as Aristotle said, all human beings by nature

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.240
desire to know.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.680
This desire brings them together in a universal community of justification.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.960
To a pragmatist, however, this Aristotelian dictum seems thoroughly misleading.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.160
It runs together three different things, the need to make one's beliefs coherent, the

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.440
need for the respective one's peers, and curiosity.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.360
We pragmatists think that the reason people try to make their beliefs coherent is not

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.160
that they love truth, but because they can't help doing so.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.880
Our minds can no more stand in coherence than our brains can stand whatever the neurochemical

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.440
substrate of such coherence may be.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.000
Just as our neural networks are presumably both constrained and in part constructed by

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.960
something like the algorithms used in parallel distributed processing of information by computer

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.280
programmers, so our minds are constrained by the need to tie our beliefs and desires

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.160
together into a reasonably perspicuous whole.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.880
That's why we can't, in James' unhappy expression, will to believe, believe what we like regardless

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.360
of what else we believe.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.920
It's why, for example, we have such a hard time keeping our religious beliefs in a separate

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:40.680
compartment from our scientific ones and in isolating our respect for democratic institutions

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.640
from our contempt for many or most of our fellow voters.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.000
The need to make one's beliefs coherent is for reasons familiar from Hagel, Mead and

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.720
Davidson not separable from the need for the respective our peers.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.400
We have as hard a time tolerating the thought that everybody but ourselves is out of step

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.120
as we do the thought that we believe both P and not P.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.800
We need the respect of our peers because we cannot trust our own beliefs nor maintain

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.040
our self-respect unless we're fairly sure that our conversational interlocutors agree

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:20.320
among themselves on such propositions as, he's not crazy, he's one of us, he may have

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.360
strange beliefs on some subjects, but he's basically sound and so on.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.320
This interpenetration of the need to make one's beliefs coherent among themselves and

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.120
the need to make them coherent with most of those of one's peers results from the fact

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.920
that, as Wittgenstein said, to imagine a form of human life we have to imagine agreement

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.760
in judgments as well as in meanings.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.120
Davidson brings out the considerations which support Wittgenstein's insight when he says,

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.880
quote, the ultimate source of both objectivity and communication is the triangle that by

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:01.720
relating speaker, interpreter, and the world determines the contents of thought and speech.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.360
You would not know what you believe nor have any beliefs unless your belief had a place

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.480
in a network of beliefs and desires, but that network would also not exist where you and

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.000
others unable to pair off features of your non-human environment with assent to your

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.740
utterances by other language users, utterances caused as are yours by those very features.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.580
The difference between the use which Davidson and I would like to make of Hegel's and Meade's

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:33.060
realization that ourselves are dialogical all the way down, that there is no private

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:40.180
core on which to build, and the use which Hoppe and Habermas make of this point can

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:45.940
be exhibited by looking at the sentence immediately following the one I just quoted from Davidson.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:51.260
Davidson continues, given the source that is given that the source of both objectivity

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:59.460
and communication is this triangle, there is no room for a relativized concept of truth.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.540
Davidson's point is that the only sort of philosopher who would take seriously the idea

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:10.060
that truth is relative to a context and particularly to a choice between human communities is one

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:16.120
who thinks that he or she can contrast being in touch with a human community with being

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.200
in touch with reality. But Davidson's point about there being no language without triangulation

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:27.880
means that this contrast can't be drawn. You can't have any language or any beliefs without

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:34.400
being in touch with both a human community and non-human reality. There's no possibility

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.320
of agreement without truth, nor of truth without agreement. Most of our beliefs must

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.400
be true, Davidson says, because a description to a person of mostly false beliefs would

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.480
mean either that we had mistranslated the person's marks and noises, or that she didn't,

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:55.760
in fact, have any beliefs, was not, in fact, speaking a language. Most of our beliefs must

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.280
be justified in the eyes of our peers for a similar reason. If they were not justified,

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.840
if our peers could not attribute to us a largely coherent web of beliefs and desires, they

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.760
would have to conclude that they had either misunderstood us, sorry, they would have to

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:16.680
conclude either that they had misunderstood us, or that we did not speak their language.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.040
Coherence, truth, and community go together, not because truth is to be defined in terms

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.000
of coherence rather than correspondence, in terms of social practice rather than in terms

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.520
of coping with non-human forces, but simply because to ascribe a belief is automatically

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:39.760
to ascribe a place in a largely coherence of mostly true belief. But to say that there's

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:45.600
no contact via belief and desire with reality, no truth without community, is as yet to say

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.200
nothing about what sort of community is in question. A radically exclusivist community

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.440
made up of only the priests or the nobles or the males or the whites is quite as good

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.800
as any other sort of community for Davidsonian purposes. This is the difference between what

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.240
Davidson thinks you can get out of reflection on the nature of discourse and what Oppo and

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.840
Habermas think you can get out of it. The latter philosophers think that you can get

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.760
something more out of such reflection than the fact that there are neither beliefs nor

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.640
persons nor truth without justification in the eyes of a community. They think you can

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.040
get an argument in favor of the inclusivist project, an argument which says that people

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:31.120
who resist this project involve themselves in performative self-contradictions. By contrast,

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.800
Davidson thinks that any community of justification will do to make you a language user and a

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.200
believer, no matter how distorted Oppo and Habermas take communication within that community

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.200
to be. From Davidson's point of view, philosophy of language runs out before we reach the moral

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:55.600
imperatives which make up Oppo's discourse ethics. Oppo and Habermas run together the

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.960
need for coherence and for justification, which is required if one is to use language

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.240
at all, and a commitment to what they call universal validity, a commitment which can

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:11.240
only be consistently acted upon by aiming at the sort of domination-free communication

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.840
which is impossible as long as there are human communities which remain exclusivist. Davidson

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:23.040
and I have no use for the claim that any communicative action contains a claim to universal validity

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.400
because this so-called presupposition seems to us to have no role to play in the explanation

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:36.040
of linguistic behavior. It does, to be sure, play a part in the explanation of the behavior,

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.280
linguistic and other, of a small minority of human beings, those who belong to the liberal

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.240
universalistic and classivist tradition of the European Enlightenment. But this tradition,

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.160
to which Davidson and I are as much attached as Oppo and Habermas, derives no support from

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.760
reflection on discourse as such. We language users who belong to this minority tradition are

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.280
morally superior to those who don't, but those who don't are no less coherent in their use of

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:08.560
language. Oppo and Habermas invoke the presupposition of universal validity to get from a commitment

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.160
to justification to a willingness to submit one's beliefs to the inspection of any and every

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:20.000
language user, even a slave, even a black, even a woman. They see the desire for truth construed

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
as the desire to claim universal validity as the desire for universal justification, but as I see

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.720
it there, inferring invalidly from, you can't use language without invoking consensus within a

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.200
community of other language users to, you can't use language consistently without enlarging that

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.280
community to include all users of language. Because I see this inference as invalid, I think that

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.800
the only thing which can play the role in which Aristotle, Perse, Oppo and Habermas have cast

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.680
the desire for knowledge, and thus for truth, is curiosity. I use this term to mean the urge to

01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:01.040
expand one's horizons of inquiry in all areas, ethical as well as logical and physical, so as

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.520
to encompass new data, new hypotheses, new terminologies and the like. This urge brings

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:13.440
cosmopolitanism and democratic politics in its train. The more curiosity you have, the more

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.240
interest you will have in talking to foreigners, infidels, and anybody else who claims to know

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:25.800
something you don't know to have some ideas you have not yet had. Section 6, communicating or

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:33.000
educating. If one sees the desire and possession of both truth and justification as inseparable from

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.720
using language, while still resisting the thought that this desire can be used to convict members of

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.920
exclusivist human communities, our performative self-contradiction, then one will see inclusivist

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.720
communities as based on contingent human development, such as the twitchy curiosity of the

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:55.120
sort of eccentrics we call intellectuals, the desire for intermarriage beyond tribal or caste

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:00.480
boundaries produced by erotic obsession, the need to trade across such boundaries produced by lack

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.200
of, for example, salt or gold within one's own territory, the possession of enough wealth,

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:12.040
security, education, and independence, so that one's self-respect no longer depends upon membership

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:19.280
in an exclusivist community, e.g. on not being an infidel or a slave or a woman and the like. The

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.440
increased communication between previously exclusivist communities produced by such

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:29.600
contingent human developments may gradually create universality, but I can't see any sense in which

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:36.680
it recognizes a previously existent universality. Philosophers like Habermas who worry about the

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.480
anti-enlightenment overtones of the views they call contextualist think that since

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.280
justification is, and obviously context relative notion, one justifies to a given audience and

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.480
the same justification won't work for all audiences, it endangers the ideal of human fraternity.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:03.080
Habermas regards contextualism as only the flip side of logocentrism. He sees contextualists as

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.000
negative metaphysicians infatuated by diversity and says that, quote, the metaphysical priority of

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:16.360
unity above plurality and the contextualist priority of plurality above unity are secret

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:25.640
accomplices. The idea is that post-moderns in the tradition of Nietzsche, including me,

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:34.480
for these purposes, are plurality freaks in the same way that the western metaphysical tradition

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.160
condemned by Heidegger and Derrida were unity freaks, whereas Habermas is neither a unity

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:47.080
freak nor a plurality freak but just right. I agree with Habermas that it's as pointless to

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.600
prize diversity as to prize unity, but I disagree with him that we can use the pragmatics of

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.400
communication to do the job which metaphysicians hope to achieve by appealing to the Plotinian

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.000
one or to the transcendental structure of self-consciousness. My reasons for disagreement

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.880
are those offered by Walzer, McCarthy, Ben Hubby, Velmer, and others. Reasons nicely summed up in

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.120
an article by Michael Kelly that I cite in the footnote. Habermas argues for the thesis that,

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:24.160
quote, the unity of reason only remains perceptible in the plurality of its voices. As the possibility

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.400
and principle of passing from one language to another, a passage that no matter how occasional is

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.960
still comprehensible. This possibility of mutual understanding, which is now guaranteed only

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.200
procedurally and is realized only transitorally, forms the background for the existing diversity

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:50.480
of those who encounter one another even when they fail to understand one another. I agree with Habermas

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.560
against Lyotav Foucault and others that there are no incommensurable languages, that any language

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.080
can be learned by one who is able to use any other language that Davidson is right in denouncing

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:08.000
the very idea of a conceptual scheme. But I disagree with him about the relevance of this point to

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:16.240
the utility of the ideas of universal validity and objective truth. Habermas says that, quote,

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:23.040
what the speaker here and now in a given context asserts as valid transcends according to the

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:31.600
sense of his claim all contexts dependent merely local standards of validity. As I said before,

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.600
I can't see what transcends means here. If it means that he's claiming to say something true,

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.760
then the question is whether it makes any difference whether you say that a sentence

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.760
s is true or whether you simply offer a justification for it by saying, here are my reasons for

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:53.440
believing s. Habermas thinks there's a difference because he thinks that when you assert s, you

01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:00.880
claim truth, you claim truth, you claim to represent the real and that reality transcends context.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:08.320
I quote, with the concept of reality to which every representation necessarily refers, we

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.640
presuppose something transcendent. Here, in my view, is where the notion of representation

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:24.320
raises its ugly head in Habermas and offers us a reason for never, never saying that sentences

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:31.040
represent reality. Habermas tends to take for granted that truth claims or claims to represent

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:36.240
accurately and to be suspicious of those who, like Davidson and myself, give up on the notion

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.160
of linguistic representation. He follows sellers in being a coherentist rather than a skeptic

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.600
or a foundationalist, but he's dubious about the move I want to make from coherentism to

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:54.800
anti-representationalism. He commends Purse over Socio because Purse, quote, examines expressions

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.680
from the point of view of their possible truth and at the same time from that of their communicability.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.040
He goes on to say, quote, from the perspective of its capacity for being true, an acertoric

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.560
sentence stands in an epistemic relation to something in the world. It represents a state of

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:20.000
affairs. At the same time, from the perspective of its employment in a communicative act,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.680
it stands in a relation to a possible interpretation by a language user. It's suitable for the

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.360
transmission of information. My own view, which I take from Davidson, is that you can give up the

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:37.680
notion of an epistemic relation to something in the world and just rely on the ordinary causal

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:43.840
relations which bind utterances together with the otterer's environments. The idea of representation

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:49.120
on this view adds nothing to the notion of transmission of information, or more exactly,

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.280
it adds nothing to the notion of taking part in the discursive practice of justifying one's assertions.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.400
Habermas sees Putnam as, like himself, defending a third position over against the metaphysics of

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:08.720
unity on the one hand, and people like me, the enthusiasts for incommensurability on the other.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.080
He thinks I'm an enthusiast for incommensurability. He defines this third position as, quote,

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.120
the humanism of those who continue the Kantian tradition by seeking to use the philosophy

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.520
of language to save a concept of reason that is skeptical and post-metaphysical.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.200
Putnam and Habermas have offered similar criticisms of my attempt to get rid of a

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.560
specifically epistemic concept of reason, the concept according to which one is rational only

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:43.120
if one tries to represent reality accurately, and to replace it by the purely moral idea of

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.880
solidarity. My central disagreement with both Habermas and Putnam is whether,

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.000
sorry, is over the question of whether the regulative ideas of undistorted communication

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.760
or accurate representation of reality can do any more for the ideals of the French Revolution

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.320
than the bare context-dependent notion of justification. Some people care about defending

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.280
their assertions only to a few people, and some care, or say they care, about defending their

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.440
assertions to everyone. I'm not thinking here of the distinction between specialized technical

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.480
discourse and non-technical discourse. Rather, the distinction I want is the one between people

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.840
who want to defend their views to all people who share certain attributes, for example devotion to

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.800
the ideals of the French Revolution or membership in the Aryan race, and those who say they want

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.560
to justify their view to every actual and possible language user. There are certainly people who say

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.760
that the latter is what they want, but I'm not sure they really mean it. Do they want to justify

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.040
their views to language users who are four years old? Well, perhaps they do in the sense that they

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:56.800
would like to educate four-year-olds to the point at which they could appreciate the arguments for

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:03.200
and against views in question. Do they want to justify them to intelligent but convinced Nazis,

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:08.320
people who believe that the first thing to find out is whether the view under discussion is tainted

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.800
by the Jewish ancestry of its inventors or propounders? Well, perhaps they do in the sense

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.840
that they would like to convert these Nazis into people who have doubts about the advisability

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.120
of a Jew-free Europe and the infallibility of Hitler, and therefore are more or less willing

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:31.280
to listen to arguments for positions associated with Jewish thinkers. But in both cases, what

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.560
they want seems to me best described not as wanting to justify their view to everybody,

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:42.160
but as wanting to create an audience to whom they would have a sporting chance of justifying their

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.880
view. Let me use the distinction between arguing with people and educating people to abbreviate

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.240
the distinction I've just drawn. The distinction between proceeding on the assumption that people

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.240
will follow your arguments and knowing that they cannot but hoping to alter them so that they can.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:08.000
If all education were a matter of argument, this distinction would collapse. But unless one broadens

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.560
the term argument beyond recognition, a lot of education is not. In particular, a lot of it is

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.080
simple appeal to sentiment. The distinction between such appeal and argument is fuzzy,

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:25.680
but I take it nobody would say that making an unregenerate Nazi watch films of the opening

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.840
of the concentration camps or making her read the diary of Anne Frank counts as arguing with her.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.320
People interested in democratic politics both cherish the ideal of human fraternity

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:45.920
and cherish the idea of the universal availability of education. When asked about the education we

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:52.560
have in mind, we often say that it is education in critical thinking in the ability to talk over

01:21:52.560 --> 01:22:01.280
the pros and cons of any view. We oppose critical thinking to ideology and say that we oppose

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:07.840
ideological education of the sort which the Nazis inflicted on German youth. But we thereby

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:13.760
leave ourselves wide open to Nietzsche's scornful suggestion that we are simply inculcating our own

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:20.160
ideology, the ideology of what he calls Socrates. The issue between me and Habermas I think boils

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:26.160
down to a disagreement about what to say to Nietzsche at this point. I should reply to Nietzsche

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:33.040
by conceding that there is no non-local, non-contextual way to draw the distinction between ideological

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.920
education and non-ideological education because there's nothing to say to my use of the term reason

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.240
that could not be replaced by the way we wet western liberals the heirs of Socrates and the

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.240
French Revolution conduct ourselves. I agree with McIntyre and Michael Kelly that all reasoning,

01:22:52.240 --> 01:23:00.640
both in physics and ethics, is tradition bound. Habermas thinks this an unnecessary concession

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:06.240
and more generally thinks that my cheerful ethnocentrism can be avoided by thinking through what

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:13.520
he calls the symmetrical structure of perspectives built into every speech situation. The issue

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:18.560
between Habermas and myself thus comes to a head when he takes up my suggestion that we drop the

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:25.680
notions of rationality and objectivity and instead just discuss the kind of community we want to create.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.880
He paraphrases this suggestion by saying that I want to treat the aspiration for objectivity as

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:39.520
quote simply the desire for as much intersubjective agreement as possible, namely the desire to expand

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:47.520
the referent of for us to the greatest possible extent. Habermas then paraphrases one of Putnam's

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.840
objections to me by asking quote, can we explain the possibility of the critique and self critique

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.880
of established practices of justification if we do not take the idea of the expansion of our

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:08.640
interpreted horizon seriously as an idea and if we do not connect this idea with the intersubjectivity

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.920
of an agreement that allows precisely for the distinction between what is current for us and

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:22.080
what is current for them. Habermas enlarges on this point by saying quote, the merging of interpretive

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:29.760
horizons does not signify an assimilation to us, rather it must mean a convergence steered through

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:37.680
learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:45.120
to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent. For learning itself

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:53.680
belongs neither to us or to them, both sides are caught up on it in the same way. Even in the most

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.360
difficult processes of reaching understanding all parties appeal to the common reference point

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:05.360
of a possible consensus even if this reference point is projected in each case from within

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:11.840
their own context. For although they may be interpreted in various ways and applied according

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.520
to different criteria concepts like truth rationality or justification play the same

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:25.280
grammatical role in every linguistic community. End of quote. The note of the argument is I think

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.720
a disagreement about how much help for democratic politics can be gotten out of what Habermas here

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.320
calls grammar. As I said earlier I think that all we can get out of the grammar of the words true

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:45.360
and rational is the same as what we get out of a rather thin idea of justification. This thin idea

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.880
is the one we get when we answer the question where does the line come between causing people to

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:57.120
adjust their behavior by persuasion by working on their beliefs and desires and doing so by other

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.920
means. Unlike Foucault and some others I think it's both possible and important to draw a line here.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.680
I don't think it helpful to extend the term violence as widely as Foucault extended it.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.920
Whatever we're doing when we make Nazis look at pictures of concentration camp survivors it isn't

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.080
violence anymore than it was violence to educate the Hitler youth to believe the Jews were worthless

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:29.040
Berman. The inevitable fuzziness of the line between persuasion and violence causes problems

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:35.120
however when we come to the question of education. We're reluctant to say that the Nazis used

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.560
persuasion on the Hitler youth since we have two criteria of persuasion. One is simply using

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.200
words rather than blows or other forms of physical pressure. One can imagine with a bit of distortion

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:55.600
of history that in this sense only persuasion was employed on the Hitler youth. The second

01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:02.320
criterion of persuasion includes abstention from words like stop asking these stupid questions

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.440
about whether there aren't some good Jews questions which make me doubt your area and

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.600
consciousness and ancestry or the Reich will find another use for you. Those are not blows but one

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:20.640
might say it isn't exactly persuasion either it's you know threats or something you know something

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:30.400
that doesn't quite deserve the name persuasion. Another example is abstention from not assigning

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.400
their stigma to one student. Unsecretic methods of this latter sort are the kind which Habermas

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.120
would say do not respect the symmetrical relationships of participants in discourse.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.800
Habermas clearly thinks that there's something in the grammar of concepts like truth rationality

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.880
and justification which tell us not to use methods of the latter sort. He would presumably grant

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.480
that the use of such words is language use but he needs a category of distorted language use or

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:06.000
distorted communication to explain that it is so to speak ungrammatical language use. Immediately

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.760
after the passage I quoted about grammar Habermas says quote all languages offer the possibility

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.760
of distinguishing what is true and what we hold to be true. The supposition of a common objective

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:26.160
world is built into the pragmatics of every single linguistic usage and the dialogue roles of every

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:35.360
speech situation enforce a symmetry in participant perspective. A bit later he says quote from the

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:41.120
possibility of reaching understanding linguistically we can read off a concept of situated reason that

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:47.040
is given voice and validity claims that are both context dependent and transcendent. He then

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.440
approvingly quotes Putnam as saying reason is in this sense both imminent not to be found outside

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.920
of concrete language games and institutions and transcendent i.e. a regulative idea that we use

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:07.280
to criticize the conduct of all activities and institutions. It seems to me that the regulative

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:13.760
idea that we we wet liberals we heirs of the enlightenment we socrates most frequently used

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:20.960
to criticize the conduct of various conversational partners is the concept of needing education

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:28.160
in order to outgrow their primitive fears hatreds and superstitions. This is the concept the victorious

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.000
allied armies used when they said about reeducating the citizens of occupied Germany and Japan.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:40.000
It's also the one which was used by American school teachers who had read Dewey and were

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.840
concerned to get students to think scientifically and rationally about such matters as the origin

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.920
of the species and sexual behavior that is to get the students to read Darwin and Freud without

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.880
disgust or incredulity. It is a concept which I like most Americans who teach humanities or social

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:04.080
science in colleges and universities use when we hope that the students who enter as bigoted

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:10.560
religious fundamentalists will leave college with views more like our own. What's the relation of

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:16.800
this idea to the regulative idea of reason which Putnam believes to be transcendent and which Habermas

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:22.480
believes to be discoverable within the grammar of concepts in a limitable from our description

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:28.480
of the making of assertions? The answer to that question depends upon how much the reeducation

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:34.400
of Nazis and fundamentalists has to do with merging interpretive horizons and how much with

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:40.800
replacing such horizons. The fundamentalist parents of my fundamentalist students think that the

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:47.440
entire liberal establishment is engaged in a conspiracy. Had they read Habermas these people

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.800
would say that the typical communication situation in American college classrooms or at least my

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:59.040
classroom is no more hair shots fly no more domination free than that in the Hitler Youth Camp.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:06.640
These parents have a point. Their point is that we liberal teachers no more feel in a symmetrical

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.160
communication situation when we talk with our fundamentalist students than do kindergarten

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.560
teachers with their students. In both college classrooms and kindergartens it is equally difficult

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:24.560
for the teachers to feel that what is going on is what Habermas calls a convergence steered through

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:31.360
learning of our perspective and their perspective no matter whether they or we or both sides have

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.720
to reformulate established practices of justification to a greater or lesser extent.

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.560
When we American college teachers encounter religious fundamentalists we do not consider the

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:48.800
possibility of reformulating our own practices of justification so as to give more authority

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.840
to the weight of the Christian scriptures more weight to the authority of the Christian scriptures.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.120
Instead we do our best to convince these persons of the benefits of secularization.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:05.360
We assign for example first person accounts of growing up homosexual to our homophobic students

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.560
for the same reasons that German school teachers in the post-war period assigned the diary of Anne

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:17.280
Frank. Putnam and Habermas can rejoin that we teachers do our best to be socratic to get our

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.320
job of reeducation secularization and liberalization done by conversational exchange. That's true up

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.560
to a point but what about assigning books like Black Boy the Diary of Anne Frank and a Boy's Life.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:37.040
The racist or fundamentalist parents of our students say that in a truly democratic society

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:42.400
the students should not be forced to read books by such people. Black people, Jewish people,

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.360
homosexual people and so on. They'll protest that these books are being jammed down their

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:52.960
children's throats. I can't see how to reply to this charge without saying something like

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.840
there are credentials for admission to our democratic society. Credentials which we liberals

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:06.400
have been making steadily more stringent by doing our best to excommunicate racist male chauvinist

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:13.760
homophobes and so on. You have to be educated in order to be a citizen of our society, a participant

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:20.160
in our conversation, someone with whom we can envisage merging our horizons. So we're going to go

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:25.360
right on trying to discredit you in the eyes of your children, trying to strip your fundamentalist

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:31.200
religious community of dignity, trying to make your views seem silly rather than discussable.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.440
We are not so inclusivist as to tolerate intolerance such as yours.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:42.400
I have no trouble offering this reply because I don't claim to make the distinction between

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.480
education and conversation on the basis of anything except loyalty to a particular community.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.120
A community whose interests required re-educating the Hitler youth in 1945 and re-educating the

01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:01.920
children of Southwestern Virginia in 1996. I don't see anything hair-shafts fly about my

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.680
handling of my fundamentalist students. I think those students are lucky to find themselves under

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:14.160
the hair-shaft of people like me and have escaped from their rather frightening and dangerous parents.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.360
So I think that the handling of such students is a problem for Putnam and Habermals.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.960
It seems to me that I'm just as provincial and contextualist as the Nazi teachers who made

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:31.120
their students read their stoma. The only difference is that I serve a better cause. I come from a

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:40.560
better province. I recognize, of course, that domination-free communication is only a regulative

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.960
ideal never to be attained in practice. But unless a regulative ideal makes a difference to practice,

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.480
it isn't good for much. So I ask, is there an ethics of discourse which lets me assign the

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.680
books I want to assign, but makes no reference to the local and ethnocentric considerations

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.520
which I should cite to justify my pedagogic practices? Can you get such an ethics out of

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:10.240
the notions of reason, truth, and justification, or do you have to load the dyes? Can I invoke

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:17.120
universalistic notions in defense of my action as well as local ones? Like McIntyre, Ben Habib,

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.000
Kelly, and others, I think that you have to smuggle some provinciality into your universals

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.760
before they do you any good. We think this for the same sorts of reasons as Hegel thought

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.360
you had to smuggle in some provinciality, some ethical substance, before you could get any use

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.280
out of Kant's notion of unconditional moral obligation. In particular, you have to smuggle

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:46.160
in some rule like no putative contribution to a conversation can be rejected simply because it

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.680
comes from somebody who has some attribute which can vary independently of his or her opinions

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:58.800
and attribute like being Jewish or black or homosexual. I call this rule provincial because

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:03.920
it violates the intuitions of a lot of people outside the province in which we heirs of the

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:10.320
Enlightenment run the educational institutions. It violates what they would describe as their

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:18.160
moral intuitions. I'm reluctant to admit that these are moral intuitions and should prefer to

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.000
call them revolting prejudices. But I don't think that any in the grammar of the term moral

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
intuition or revolting prejudice helps us to reach agreement on this point, nor can I see

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.200
that a theory of rationality, abandoning the hopeless quest to talk in philosophy, find

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.640
politically neutral premises, premises which can be justified to anybody from which to infer

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.240
an obligation to pursue democratic ethics. Dropping that question would let us admit

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:52.320
in Velmer's formula that democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.320
game, among others. Such an admission would be in line with the Darwinian idea that the

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.840
inclusivist project is no more rooted in something larger than itself than, say, the project of

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:09.840
replacing ideographic by alphabetic writing or representing three spatial dimensions on a two

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:16.560
dimensional surface. All three of these were good, immensely fruitful ideas, but none of them need

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:24.080
universalistic backup. They can stand on their own feet. If we abandon the idea of philosophy

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:29.360
which manages to be both politically neutral and politically relevant, we could start asking the

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.160
question, given that we want to be ever more inclusivist, what should the public rhetoric of our

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:40.000
society be like? How different should it be from the public rhetoric of previous societies?

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:46.960
Habermas's implicit answer to this question is that we should hang on to a good many Kantian ideas

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.600
about the connection between universality and moral obligation. Dewey, however, was willing to move

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.840
much further away from Kant. Though he would have heartily agreed with Habermas that Aristotle's

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:06.240
political vocabulary was unable to capture the spirit of democratic politics, he did not like

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.520
the distinction between morality and prudence, which Habermas thinks essential, and on this point

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.520
he would have thought Aristotle preferable. Dewey thought that the Kantian notion of unconditional

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:23.680
obligation, like the notion of unconditionality itself and of universality and so far as that

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:29.600
idea is implicitly accompanied by that of unconditional necessity, could not survive Darwin.

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.480
Whereas Habermas thinks that we need what he calls the reconstructive sciences designed to grasp

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.560
universal competences in order to break out of what he calls the hermeneutic circle in which the

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.720
geist is fissonshaft and as well as the interpretive social sciences are trapped, Dewey did not feel

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.040
trapped. This was because he saw no need to resolve attention between facticity and validity.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:02.320
He saw that tension as a philosopher's fiction, as a result of separating out two

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.160
parts of the situation for no good, that is to say no practical reason, and then complaining that

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:14.960
they can't be put back together again. For him, all obligations were situational and conditional.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.880
This refusal to be unconditional led Dewey to be charged with relativism.

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.240
If relativism just means failure to find the use for the notion of context independent validity,

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:36.560
then the charge was entirely justified. But no roads lead from this failure to an inability

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:42.640
to engage in democratic politics unless one thinks that such politics require us to deny

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:49.040
that in Dewey's formula, democratic and liberal principles define just one possible language

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.640
game among others. The question about universality is for Dewey just the question of whether

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.920
democratic politics can start from an affirmation rather than a denial of that claim.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.720
I don't think we can get much further in debating that question by talking about either modernity

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.760
or reason. The question of whether Hegel should have stuck to the topic of reason

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.360
by developing a theory of communicative reason, or should instead have dropped the topic and

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:23.120
simply politicized philosophy, is not going to be settled by looking more closely at the grammar

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:29.760
of words like true rational and argument. I'm referring here to a passage in Habermas's

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.280
Philosophical Discourse of Modernity where he says, Hegel had this great opportunity.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.120
If he had gone on to become, let us say, random and developed a theory of communicative reason,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.480
he would have had it made. But because he was stuck with the philosophy of consciousness,

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:54.560
he missed the chance and we had to wait for another 150 years before Habermas and random came along

01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:02.000
with a theory of communicative reason. Neither is the question of whether philosophers like

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.480
Annette Beyer are right in suggesting that we set Kant aside and go back to Hume's attempt to

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:15.600
describe reason in terms of condition sentiment rather than unconditional obligation. That is,

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:21.840
whether Beyer is right in her view of Kant isn't to be settled by thinking harder about what we

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:29.520
mean by true rational argument. Although we don't, if I'm right, need a theory of rationality,

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.600
we do need a narrative of maturation. As I see it, the deepest disagreement between Habermas and

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.720
myself is about whether the distinction between the unconditional and the conditional in general

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.680
and the distinction between morality and prudence in particular is a mark of maturity

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.360
or a transitional stage on the way to maturity. One of the many points on which Dewey agreed

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:57.840
with Nietzsche was that it was the latter. Dewey thought that the desire for universality,

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.000
unconditionality, and necessity was undesirable because it led one away from the practical problems

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.400
of democratic politics into a never-never land of theory. Kant and Habermas think it's a desirable

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.080
desire, one which one shares, only when one reaches the highest level of moral development.

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.080
In this paper, I've tried to show how things look when one puts democratic politics in the

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:28.320
context of Dewey's narrative of maturation. I can't offer anything remotely approaching a

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:35.360
knockdown argument based on commonly accepted premises for this narrative. The best I could do

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:42.080
by way of further defense of my view would be to tell a fuller story, encompassing more topics,

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:47.200
in order to show how post-Nichie and European philosophy looks from a Dewey an angle rather

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:53.840
than a universalistic one. This is something I've tried to do in bits and pieces in various

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:59.520
articles. I think that narratives are a perfectly fair means of persuasion and that Habermas has

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:06.080
blocked the philosophical discourse of modernity and Dewey is the quest for certainty, like,

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:15.200
for example, Kant's What is Enlightenment and Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.920
are both admirable illustrations of the power of narratives of maturation. My reasons for

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.360
preferring Dewey's to Habermas's narrative are not that I think Dewey got truth and rationality

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.960
right and that Habermas gets them wrong. I think that there's nothing to be gotten right or wrong

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.600
here. At this level of abstraction concepts like truth, rationality, and maturity are up for grads.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.360
The only thing that matters is which way every shaping them will in the long run make them more

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:52.000
useful for democratic politics. Concepts are, as Wittgenstein taught us, uses of words.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.280
Philosophers have long wanted to understand concepts, but the point is to change them,

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:03.360
so as to make them serve our purposes better. Habermas's, Oppel's, Putnam's, and Velmer's

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.480
linguistification of Kantian concepts is one suggestion about how to make these

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:15.600
Kantian concepts more useful. Dewey's and Davidson's thoroughgoing anti-Kantian naturalism is another

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.200
suggestion.
