00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
All right, the question that I'm going to talk about is, I think, the largest question in contemporary philosophy today.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
And in a way, it's the largest question in intellectual life.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
And the question is, how do we give an account of ourselves that is consistent with what we know about how the world is anyhow?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
You see, the central fact about knowledge is it grows.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And we know a lot more than we did 100 or 300 years ago.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
And we have a pretty good idea about the basic structure of the universe.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Roughly speaking, it's a matter of physical particles in fields of force.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Particles, probably the wrong word, maybe they're strings or points of mass energy.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
But anyway, I leave that, I'm paying the physicist to sort that out.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
But now, if the, that's how what the universe consists in, is physical particles.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Those physical particles are mindless and meaningless.

00:54.000 --> 01:06.000
And yet we think that we have lives that are full of consciousness, rationality, intelligence, language, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and all sorts of other things.

01:06.000 --> 01:17.000
Now, how do we reconcile the basic physical structure of the universe with our conception of ourselves as conscious, rational, free agents?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Now, maybe we won't succeed in reconciling it.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Maybe we'll have to give up on certain things like free will.

01:23.000 --> 01:33.000
But at any rate, we should start out assuming that our self-conception is more or less accurate and that what we've learned from the natural sciences is accurate.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
How do we reconcile the two?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And it's not enough that they should be consistent.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
You've got to show how the human reality is a natural outcome of the more basic reality.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You've got to show how, once you've got protons, you're going to get presidents.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And once you've got electrons, you're going to get elections.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
The one has to be a natural consequence of the other.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Now, last time I talked about one aspect of that problem and that was consciousness.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And I think that the big mistake in our history is one I pointed out last time.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
And that is the effort to deny that we live in one world.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
The effort to say, well, really there are two worlds that we live in.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
A physical world as described by science and a spiritual world.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And I think that is a deep mistake.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm going to resist that.

02:21.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm going to say we live in one world and I now have to show you how the things that we think are distinctive of human civilization are part of that one world.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
And they're a natural consequence of the more basic reality.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
So I'm going to be talking about what you could call, to use a fancy jargon, social ontology.

02:44.000 --> 02:57.000
The mode of existence of social phenomena as money and property and government and marriage and universities and income tax deductions and so on.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
There's a huge range of the social ontology.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Now philosophers like paradoxes.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Now I'm going to start with a paradox.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
All of this human reality is created by human consciousness by created by subjective consciousness.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And yet it's an objective fact.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
It's an objective fact that I'm a citizen in the United States at the piece of paper in my wallet is a $20 bill and so on.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
How can there be an objective reality created by human subjectivity?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Now those of you who came Tuesday know the answer to that.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
The ontological subjectivity, the domain, does not prevent us from having an epistemically objective account of that domain.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
It's true, human consciousness has to create institutional reality.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
But once created, we can then state objective facts about it.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
It's an objective fact that I'm a professor in Berkeley, a citizen in the United States.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
That I owe a lot of credit card debts and all this kind of nonsense that we all live with.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
All right, now how does it actually work?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
What is the nature of the existence of this reality?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
And how do the, here we are, you see I like to think of our history.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
We are, as far as we can tell, Darwinian natural selection has suited us just fine

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
for a hunter-gatherer existence.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
And we apparently haven't had much change in our gene pool in the past 30,000 years.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
But we've had an enormous difference in the mode of existence of human life in those 30,000 years.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And I want to talk about what the structure of that is.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And I'm going to begin by contrasting us with other animals.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a good idea and a good beginning point to think that we are continuous with other animals.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
We know enough about biology to see the commonality between us and other animals, especially us and the primates.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
All the same, with all the commonality, there is a whole range of terrific differences

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
between us and any other animals known to me.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
My dog, my favorite example here, is very intelligent, but he's not worried about what he's going to do for Christmas vacation

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
or how he's going to handle the income tax this year.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
He just does not have that kind of worry.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Now, what's the matter with him?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Is he being irresponsible?

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, no, I think we have an apparatus that gives us a kind of power that he doesn't have.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
And the first notion I want to introduce is the notion of an institutional fact.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
We have the capacity to create institutional facts, facts that presuppose human institutions,

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
facts like the fact that you are students and faculty members of the University of Indiana

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
or that you're citizens of the United States.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
And we need to contrast institutional facts with brute facts.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And the question is, how do you get from a world of brute facts, facts that don't presuppose any institutions,

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
facts like the fact that hydrogen atoms have one electron and the earth is 93 million miles from the sun?

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
How do you get from those brute facts to facts about money and citizenship and property and marriage?

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
And it seemed to me there was a rather simple answer to that question, and I'm going to give you that answer.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
It doesn't quite work, but it's pretty good, and then I'm going to improve on it.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
It seemed to me it's rather simple. You need just three things to get from brute reality to institutional reality.

06:43.000 --> 06:53.000
First of all, you need this remarkable capacity that humans and many other species have to cooperate.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
There's a piece of jargon that we used to describe this.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
You need a capacity for collective intentionality, for the ability to cooperate with other people.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay, so you got now these beasts running around the woods and they're able to cooperate with each other.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
What else do you need?

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, humans have a remarkable capacity that some animals have, but not all animals,

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
and that is they can impose functions on objects.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
They can take an object and give it a function, so I'm sorry to give these sorted examples,

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
but my pockets are full of objects that will perform various sorted functions like combing my hair

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
or writing on paper or things that are too unmentionable to describe.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But all of these are functional objects.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Now notice an interesting thing.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
They perform their functions in virtue of their physical structure.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
So I can write with this damn thing, but I can't comb my hair with it,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and I'll show you a thing that I can comb my hair with, but I can't write with it.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Alright, so far so good.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
But then humans in their ingenuity have invented a great idea,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and it is really the origin of civilization.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Here it is.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
You can assign functions to objects and people where the function is not performed

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
in virtue of the physical structure, or not solely in virtue of the physical structure,

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
but in virtue of the fact that we have assigned a status to the person or the object.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
And with that status, a function that can only be performed in virtue of the collective acceptance

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
of that status by the community, or at least a sizable number of the members of the community.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
And that's the first basic idea I want to introduce is the notion of a status function.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
All functions are observer relative.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
It only has the function because we have assigned it the function.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
But status functions are remarkable because the status function doesn't perform the function

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
in virtue of its physical structure, but in virtue of what?

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
Well, in virtue of the beginning we can say the fact that people accept it as having a certain status,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
and now show off even more sorted objects I carry around with me.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Here is another object that performs a function.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It's a $5 bill.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
But unlike that other stuff I showed you, it doesn't perform the function in virtue of its physical structure.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
It performs the function in virtue of the fact that we accept, or recognize, or agree

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
in virtue of our attitudes that it performs the function of the $5 bill, not in virtue of its physical structure.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
So the question we have to ask is, how does that work?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That's an amazing phenomenon.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
And for a long time it seemed to me that the key to understanding this was that there are certain kind of rules,

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
which I call constitutive rules to distinguish them from regulative rules.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Regulative rules regulate previously existing or independently existing forms of behavior.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Drive on the right-hand side of the road.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
That's a regulative rule.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But not all rules are like that.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Some rules constitute the very behavior that they regulate,

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
because performing the behavior consists in acting in accordance with the rules,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
or at least with a big enough subset of the rules.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The philosopher's favorite example is always chess.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
It's not the case that a whole lot of people were pushing bits of wood around on boards,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
and some genius said, fellas, we've got to get some rules,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
because you're always banging into my bishop with your knight.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
No, it's not like that.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Rather, playing chess consists in acting in accordance with these rules,

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
and typically these rules come in system, the rules of chess or the rules of football.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Or a much more powerful example, the United States Constitution.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's a set of constitutive rules.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Now, what do they look like, these constitutive rules?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Well, they have a peculiar structure.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
They have the structure where something counts as something that, so to speak, isn't intrinsically.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
X counts as Y in context C.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
So to take our chess example, such and such a position counts as a legal knight move.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Such and such a position counts as you being in check.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Such and such a form of check counts as you being in checkmate.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Getting a majority of votes in the electoral college counts as being president-elect,

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
and being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court counts as becoming president of the United States.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
You build this structure up where you count something as something else.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And it seemed to me, that's how we do it.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
We build civilization by repeated application of constitutive rules.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Now, you might think, well, that's too pathetic an apparatus.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
You can't build civilization with that.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
It looks too fragile, but it has two formal properties that are remarkable.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
One formal property is it iterates upward indefinitely.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So watch, I make noises through my mouth.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
They count as sentences of English.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Some of those utterances of sentences count as the making of promises.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Some promises count as undertaking a legal contract.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Now, watch what's happening in this case.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
We have X1 counts as Y1, but Y1 equals X2,

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
and that counts as Y2, and we keep going up.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
So in the case of a marriage, in the case of the contract,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
making the noise counts as making a promise, making that promise,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
counts as creating a certain kind of contract,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
and certain kinds of contract count as getting married.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
Now, in the state of California, when you get married, all hell breaks loose from an institutional point of view.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
You're entitled to spousal benefits and pregnancy leaves.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Even if you're a male, you can get a pregnancy leave, and I don't know what theory they have.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
But in any case, there are all these things that go on when you get this institutional status.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
So you have the status whereby you are married.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
That's an institutional fact, and that gives you a set of status functions.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
You have certain rights, duties, and obligations.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay, another remarkable feature of this apparatus, this X counts as Y and C,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
is it interlocks with other status functions.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
So I don't just have money, but I have money in my bank account at the Bank of America

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It's put there by my employers, the regents of the university,

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
and I use it to pay my state and federal income tax, my credit card debts, and a whole lot of other things.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
Now notice, just about every noun I use there, with a possible exception of Telegraph Avenue,

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
named a status function. It named some institutional thing, the Bank of America,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
my employers, the University of California.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
So one institution functions only by locking into a whole lot of other institutions.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
So it looks like a pretty good beginning to a theory.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
We're able to account for status functions by saying they arise as a result of application of constitutive rules,

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
and the constitutive rules look more powerful than they look on the surface,

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
because they keep going up indefinitely, you can keep creating new institutional facts,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
and they interlock with each other.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Nice theory, but philosophers will give you some counter examples,

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
and I want to tell you what's wrong with it, and then I'm going to improve on it.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Okay, so how are we doing? I hope I'm not going too fast,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
because my natural temptation is I want to get to the part that most interests me,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
but in any case, I think everybody looks like they're following me so far.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
All right, here are some interesting problems with this.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Some I thought of myself, but some my friendly colleagues in philosophy thought of,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
they're called counter examples.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Here's a difficulty I thought of myself.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Often you don't need a rule to create an institutional fact.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
A bunch of kids can just decide that somebody's going to be the captain of the softball team.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
They don't have to have a constitution to appeal to that,

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
they just do it, they just haul off and count this guy as the captain of the softball team.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
But furthermore, and this is more troublesome,

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
sometimes you don't even need an X term.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
You can create an institutional fact out of thin air.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
And my favorite example was always money, and I like to haul out a $20 bill and show it off.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
But the fact is, most money has no physical existence at all.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
There is no X that counts as a $20 bill in my bank account.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
You see, I'm very naive, and I think if I give these guys the money, and it's my bank account,

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
there ought to be a drawer with my name on it where they keep my money,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
and I want to go and see my money in the bank.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, that's not how it works.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
It's very disconcerting.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Your money has no physical existence at all.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
There are magnetic traces on computer disks in the bowels of the bank,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
but those magnetic traces haven't got any money glued to them.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
They are representations of money.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Now, here's a remarkable fact.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
In the case of money, which after all is very powerful,

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
you don't need any actual object to bear the status function.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Just the representation will do.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
And we could buy and sell just by exchanging representations,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
and that's what we're moving toward with a debit card.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
With a debit card, you don't actually have any cash,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
any currency that backs up the exchange.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
You just exchange the numerical value in your account

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
for a numerical value in somebody else's account.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
This is mind-boggling for philosophers.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
As I told you last time, to be a philosopher,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
you've got to allow yourself to be astounded

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
by what any sane person takes for granted.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Now, I am astounded by this fact about money,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
that there is no actual currency.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Here's an even more astounding fact,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
and that is, in their ingenuity,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
humans have invented whole institutions

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
that do not require any physical reality at all.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
And the most famous example is the Limited Liability Corporation.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Now, there's a wonderful research assistant I have called Google.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And if I look up on Google,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
the law for creating corporations in the state of California,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
it just says, you create a corporation

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
by saying you're creating a corporation.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
That's all I have to do.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
As it says, you file articles of incorporation.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What's going on in these cases?

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
How can there be a powerful institution,

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
corporations that have no physical existence at all?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
See, that corporation may have a building,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
which is its office, but that's not the corporation.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
That's just the building.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
The actual corporation is purely abstract.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
So what's going on?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Okay, now I want to start the second part of the lecture

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
where I'm going to try to show how to assimilate this account

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
that I gave you into a much more general account.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
And to do that, I need to tell you a little bit about how language works

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
because my essential message is going to be

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
that human civilization is created by a certain very specific type of speech act,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
by a very specific type of language act.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And we're not all that smart that we can do new and original things every time.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
We apply the same thing over and over again.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
That's what I'm going to, that's the bottom line of my discussion,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
but I want to have to work up to that.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay, so how are we doing?

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
I'm going to take a drink of water and catch my breath

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and go into the next part.

19:36.000 --> 19:43.000
Now, human beings have another remarkable trait, language.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
Now, we're familiar with the idea that there are signaling systems among animals

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
and some of them are rich enough, I think, to be called a language.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
I think the B language probably qualifies as a language.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
There's not going to be any proofs among the B's,

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
but it's clearly a signaling system that represents information in a complex fashion.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
And one of the things I like about it, it's clear that it's not just a matter of stimulus and response.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
My favorite experiment was this one.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
They took a boatload of flowers and carted it out in the middle of a lake.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And then the B went out in the middle of the lake, found this boatload of flowers,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
and she went back to the hive and told all her sisters,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
they're all females in the society, told her sisters,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
there are all these great flowers out there in the middle of the lake.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
They didn't show any interest at all.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
They just didn't believe it that there were all these flowers to be found in the middle of the lake.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Now, I think that's very human of them. I like that.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay, so now I don't know what you're going to do with a B language,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
but I know there are things you can do with human language that you cannot do with any others,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
and I want to tell you about how that works.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Human speech acts typically have this kind of structure.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
You have a certain force, what Austin called illocutionary force, and a propositional content.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So I can predict that you will leave the room.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I can order that you will leave the room.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I can ask whether you will leave the room.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
In each case, the same proposition as a different kind of speech act,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
a different kind of what Austin called illocutionary acts.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Now, if you look at that, you wonder how many of those kinds of things are there.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
And one of the ways of distinguishing among them is distinguish ways they relate to reality.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
So the philosopher's favorite, the statement, is supposed to be true or false.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
And it's true whether or not, if the statement up here matches the reality down here,

21:49.000 --> 21:57.000
and I think in simple metaphors, think of that as having a fit where the word is supposed to fit the world.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
That's the word to world direction of fit.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
And the simplest mark for whether a speech act has that direction of fit

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
is can you literally say that it's true or false?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
These are true or false.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
But of course, not all speech acts are like that.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Sometimes you give somebody an order, or you make a promise,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
and there you're supposed to change reality if it's a promise,

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
or the person given the order is supposed to change reality to match the content of the speech act

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
is supposed to change the world to match the words.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
So this kind over here has the world to word direction of fit.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
The world is supposed to change to match the world,

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
and you don't call those true or false.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
The order is said to be obeyed or disobeyed.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
The promise is said to be kept or broken.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
So you've got these two basic ways that language has of relating to reality.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
You represent how things are, that's the word to world true false direction of fit,

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
or you try to change reality so it matches how things are in the representation,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and that's orders and promises.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Now sometimes you get cases where the fit is taken for granted,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
for when I apologize for stepping on your foot,

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm not trying to get your foot stepped on, and I'm not claiming that I stepped on it,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm just expressing my regret.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
So there we just take the fit for granted.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
So we've got different classes of speech acts, though corresponding to these.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
We have an assertive class, the aim of which is to tell us how things are in reality,

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
and that includes statements and descriptions, all the philosophers' favorites are in these assertives.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
Then you have the directive class, and that includes orders and commands.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
These have this direction of fit, the directives have this direction of fit.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
Directives are orders and commands as well as suggestions and requirements.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
Okay, but now there's another class where you commit yourself to doing something,

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
and those I call commissives, the commissive class, and the philosophers' favorite is the promise,

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
where you promise, vow, threat, pledge, and thus create reasons for doing something.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm going through this fast, but I want you to get the basic idea.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Language has different ways of relating to reality,

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
and the two favorite ways are this way where you try to say how things are in the world,

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
and this way, which breaks into two kinds, hearer-based, the directive and speaker-based, the commissive,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
the directive you're trying to get somebody to do something,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
and the commissive you're committing yourself to doing something.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Now there is this weird class, the expressives, where you apologize, thank, congratulate,

24:51.000 --> 24:58.000
and those I just call expressives, where the aim is not to fit reality, but to express an attitude.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
But now, here is the amazing thing.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
There is an amazing group of speech acts that I call declarations,

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
and those are the cases where you make something in a case by just saying that it's the case.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
The chairman can adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
and you can fire an employee just by saying you're fired,

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
or you can hire somebody just by saying you're hired,

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
or you can pronounce a couple husband and wife if you're duly authorized by saying I pronounce you husband and wife.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Now what's going on in these cases?

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
What I'm going on, what is going on, I'm going to put very simply by saying,

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
in these cases, you get a double direction of fit.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
You get a world to word direction of fit when you say the meeting is adjourned,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
because the world changes, it's now adjourned, the meeting is now adjourned.

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
But the way it became adjourned is you represented it as being adjourned.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
That is to say, you achieved the world to word direction of fit by way of the word to world direction of fit.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
You performed not two speech acts, you didn't make a statement that the meeting is adjourned,

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
and then given order that it be adjourned, you made one speech act that included both.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's a stunning fact.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Now how do those work?

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Well, the favorite examples are Austin's examples of performatives,

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
where you make an order by saying I already had to leave the room,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
you make a promise by saying I promise to come and see you,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
you adjourn the meeting by saying the meeting is adjourned,

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
you give and bequeath your watch to your nephew by saying I give and bequeath my watch to my nephew.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
In all of those cases, you have a verb or verb phrase such as promise or order or adjourn.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
But you don't always need a special sentence to do that.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
You can do it a special kind of sentence.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
You can do it with any sentence provided it's understood in the right way.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
And again, my favorite example is in my wallet.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
And again, it's another case of being astounded by the obvious.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
There are stunning philosophical claims made on this sheet of paper.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
It says, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
Now, we're all epistemologists and our natural inclination is to say,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
how the hell do they know?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Has there been a study?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Has there been a survey?

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
They say, arrogantly, it's legal tender for all debts, public and private.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
What's the evidence that it's legal tender?

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And the answer, of course, is they don't discover that it's legal tender.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
They make it legal tender by declaring it to be legal tender.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
That's a declaration.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
So the declaration there, this note is legal tender, looks like an ordinary statement of fact.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
But it's not.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
It isn't that they did a serious survey and discovered, yep, really is legal tender.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
No, they made it legal tender by declaration.

28:11.000 --> 28:21.000
Now, this is a remarkable fact that human beings have the capacity to create a reality simply by declaring it to exist.

28:21.000 --> 28:29.000
Performatives to repeat are the favorite example, but it needn't be a performative verb.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
There needn't be a special verb that you use.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
I hear by adjourn the meeting, or I hear by order you to leave the room.

28:37.000 --> 28:47.000
You can just make a statement, and if it's accepted as generally creating the reality that it describes,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
then you have successfully performed a declaration.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
Now I want to make the strongest claim of the whole lecture, and that's this.

28:56.000 --> 29:06.000
All of human institutional reality, money, property, government, marriage, universities, cocktail parties, summer vacations,

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
and all the rest of it, that is created by, I have to put this carefully,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
representations that have the logical form of the Speech Act of Declaration.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It needn't be explicit.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
You don't have to come out and say explicitly, you're the boss.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Or we hereby make you the boss.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That would be an explicit declaration.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
But you can make somebody the boss just by treating her as the boss, just by always referring to her as the boss.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
By representing her as being the boss, you can make it the case that she is the boss.

29:39.000 --> 29:47.000
So what happens in all of these phenomena is that you create an institutional fact

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
by representing that institutional fact as existing, and that has the logical form of the declaration.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
So the shorthand is simply to say, all of human institutional reality,

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
and that's all of what is distinctive about human societies, how we differ from other animal societies,

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
is created by repeated applications of the same type of Speech Act, the declaration.

30:12.000 --> 30:20.000
Now just to have a name for those, I want to tie that into what I said earlier about how we have the capacity

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
to assign functions through collective intentionality, and some of these functions are status functions.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And the thesis that I'm now advancing is this.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
All status functions are created by declaration.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
They're all created by the same type of Speech Act.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
I have to qualify that and say by representations that have the logical form of the declaration,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
because you needn't do it explicitly.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
You can do it just by accepting something or recognizing it, but there has to be a representation

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
that enables you to do that, to create the institutional fact.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Okay, but now you've got a whole lot of interesting questions.

31:03.000 --> 31:12.000
If I'm right so far that this is the distinctive feature of human civilization, it looks like

31:12.000 --> 31:21.000
we get an interesting set of equations, and the equations come out as this.

31:21.000 --> 31:30.000
Status functions, where you have a function that is performed in virtue of the collective acceptance of a status,

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
status functions are co-extensive with institutional facts.

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
Institutional facts are created for the purpose of creating these status functions.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
What's the point? Why do we create all these status functions?

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Why do we make somebody chairman of the department, pronounce somebody husband and wife,

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
make somebody president of the United States, create money and private property and government and marriage?

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
And the answer is all of those are status functions.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Yes, but what's the function? What's the point of the function?

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
And the answer to that is we do it for power.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
All of those create power structures.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
All institutional reality is a matter of creating power structures.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
So if you have a $5 bill, you have a power that you don't have if you don't have that money.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
If you're a chairman of the philosophy department, you have power that you don't have if you're not chairman.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
A lot of the powers are negative powers.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
As a professor in Berkeley, I have a positive power to get a parking permit.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
That won't give me a parking space, but at least I have a permit.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
It gives me a right to look for a parking space.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
But I also have negative powers.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
I'm under an obligation to show up and teach my students on such and such a day.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
So status functions are institutional facts.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
These institutional facts, without exception, create powers,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
but the powers are of a very peculiar kind.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
They're what I call deontic powers.

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
And I call on that because the names of these types of powers

33:12.000 --> 33:21.000
would include rights, duties, obligations, authorizations, permissions, requirements, and others in that family.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
This again is a remarkable fact about human beings.

33:25.000 --> 33:36.000
As far as I know, a pack of dogs does not create a system of obligations and rights and duties within the pack.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
They may create a hierarchy where there's an alpha male and an alpha female,

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
but they do not create deontic powers with institutional facts and status functions.

33:48.000 --> 33:55.000
The reason that it's such a big deal, that status functions create our institutional facts,

33:55.000 --> 34:04.000
they're created by this constitutive operation, they're all created by status function declarations.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
And the reason that's such a big deal is that these,

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
I put in here status function declarations because the speech acts in question

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
that create the status functions have the logical form of the declarations,

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
and so I call them status function declarations.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
And they create, in creating institutional reality, they create a system of deontic powers,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
and deontic powers are remarkable in this respect.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
They lock into human rationality.

34:37.000 --> 34:45.000
They lock into human rationality in such a way that they give you reasons for acting

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
that are independent of your inclinations.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
So if you recognize an obligation as a binding obligation,

34:53.000 --> 35:01.000
you recognize that you have a desire independent reason for acting on that obligation.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I'll give you a real-life example.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
A nice guy invited me to go to Bloomington, Indiana, and give some lectures.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
It seemed like a great idea, many months away.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
But then a day comes when you got to get up early in the morning

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
and make your way to San Francisco Airport, and then it's just, well, you know what it's like.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
You got to stand in line, you got to take your shoes off,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
you got to eat airplane food, and you don't even get much of that anymore.

35:28.000 --> 35:35.000
And then, worst of all, you got to try to put your elbow where some other guy's trying to put his elbow, and so on.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
So nobody does it for fun.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
On the other hand, there was no question.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I had made a promise.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
I had created an institutional fact, and my promising, that institutional fact,

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
had created a reason for acting that was independent of my inclination.

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
I had a reason for coming, and here I am.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
I gave this example once in Chicago to a famous seminar

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
occupied by a very conservative economist, to put it charitably.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
And they don't think anybody ever did anything for a desire-independent reason.

36:15.000 --> 36:22.000
And they said, you just came to Chicago because you were worried about what we would think of you

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
if you didn't come to Chicago.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
And I didn't have the heart to tell them, I don't give a damn what you guys think of me.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I didn't have the heart to tell them that.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Anyway, I made it there.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
I got out of there alive.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Anyway, so here is the thesis that I am advancing.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
We live in a sea of status functions.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
The marvelous thing is they're almost totally invisible because you take them for granted.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
The clothes on my back are my private property.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
I am a citizen of the United States, a possessor of a valid California driver's license,

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
the owe of money on my various credit cards, and so on.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
The list is huge.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Many status functions of the kind that I described to you are codified.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
It's easy to make a law about these, and laws naturally tend to proliferate.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Why?

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Because the status function only exists if it's represented as existing,

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
and if you've got the representation, then it's relatively easy to codify the representation.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
There are some status functions that are not codified and would suffer if they were codified.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Think of cocktail parties, love affairs, and friendship.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Now all of those are status functions.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
The test is, is there a set of obligations and other deontic powers

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
that go with inviting people to a cocktail party or having other obligations of friendship

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
or obligations of a love affair?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
And the answer seems to me in every case, yes.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
But you don't want to try to codify it because partly you're inventing it as you go along.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
You're inventing the structure of the institutional effect.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
If it's a friendship or a love affair, and if it gets codified, you get serious,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
then it becomes much more flexible.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
Now you will suffer from problems when you go to other countries

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
where they have maybe a different conception of a love affair,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
a different conception of friendship, and you can get in a lot of trouble.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
I won't even go through into the details about that, about the different conceptions.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
Okay, but now another result that comes out of this, out of this discussion,

38:34.000 --> 38:41.000
is that language, unlike my earlier view, is not just one system of status functions,

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
among others, it's the basic human institution in this sense.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
All other human institutions that I mentioned, like a government and private property and universities,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
all of them presuppose language.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
You can have a society that has a language but doesn't have money or private property or government,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
but you can't have a converse.

39:04.000 --> 39:12.000
If an anthropologist comes back from the Amazon Basin and says her tribe has language

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
but they don't have private property and they don't have a government, that makes sense.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
But if she comes back and says they have private property, government, marriage, and money,

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
but they do not have a language, we know that couldn't be right,

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
because language is the fundamental human institution in that all others presuppose language.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
But then now there's an interesting asymmetry.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
I originally got this idea of the constitutive rule X counts as Y,

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
as a way of describing the operation of language, the performance of the speech act.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
Uttering the sentence, snow is white, in English counts as making the statement that snow is white.

39:52.000 --> 39:59.000
But now it turns out there's a big asymmetry between the operation of the constitutive rules with language

39:59.000 --> 40:06.000
and their operation with, so to speak, non-linguistic institutional facts like money and private property.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
The asymmetry is this.

40:08.000 --> 40:15.000
In the case of the status functions and the deonic powers that are non-linguistic,

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
for example, when we make somebody president of the United States,

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
we use language to create power that goes beyond the power of language.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
So we use language to say, by the authority vested in my, I hereby pronounce you president of the United States,

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
the guy then has powers that go beyond the powers of language,

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
but when we just use a sentence to make a statement, there are no powers that go beyond the powers of language.

40:44.000 --> 40:52.000
So the way, as a speaker of English, my knowledge of English enables me to have the power to make the statement that snow is white

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
by uttering the sentence, snow is white.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
That's a case where the semantics is all the power there is.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
The powers are just the semantic powers.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
But when you make somebody chairman of the philosophy department,

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
or you admit them to graduate school, or you award somebody a prize,

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
or you pronounce somebody husband and wife, or you borrow money from the bank,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
or you buy a house in Bloomington,

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
all of those are cases where you create institutional facts

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
and thus create deontic powers, and you use language to do that.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
But the powers that you create go beyond semantic powers.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
So all of Barack Obama's powers derive from semantics.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
He has to be created as president and treated as president, represented as president,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
but the powers go beyond semantics.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
The power to command American troops in battle goes far beyond the semantics,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
even though the initial origin of the power is on the basis of the semantics.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
The semantics creates powers that are not semantic.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
So it turns out that language is not only the fundamental human social institution,

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
the one that all others derive from, all others depend on,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
but it's fundamentally different in its operation,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
because just as far as the meanings of the sentences are concerned,

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
all you have when you know the language is the power to perform speech acts with those sentences.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
But when you're locked into a system of institutional facts and status functions and deontic powers,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
when you're buying and selling stocks on the stock market,

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
or you're passing legislation in Congress, or you're adjudicating cases,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
all of those cases involve the use of language,

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
but they use language to create powers that go beyond language.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Okay, how am I doing for time?

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Well, maybe I'll try and summarize, so we'll have plenty of time for discussion.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
Now, there are a few things I want to say of a theoretical kind before I throw it open for discussion.

42:53.000 --> 43:02.000
One is, it seems to me, if you think along these lines, as I'm suggesting,

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
you get a different conception of many traditional questions in the social science,

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
in the social sciences, and in political philosophy.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
If you look at our tradition in political and social theory,

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
there is an endemic flaw that goes back to the Greeks,

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
and that is, roughly speaking, they had an impoverished theory of language.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
They took language for granted.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Social contract theorists are the worst because they assume

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
that we're running around the woods speaking a language,

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
and then some genius says, let's make a social contract,

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
and then you get together and have a society.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
But the implication of what I'm saying is, if you've got a language,

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
you've already got an implicit social contract

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
because you have the possibility of creating status functions.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Now, how do we get away with it?

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
You see, what's amazing is we get away with it.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
And the short answer to that is, you get away with it if people accept it.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
And the most amazing creation of a status function by declaration

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
were by guys who wrote as if they had read my book.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
They used the very terminology.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
They call it the Declaration of Independence.

44:21.000 --> 44:27.000
Now, there's nothing in their status functions

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
prior to that moment that gives them the power to do this.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
These are, let us not forget, British subjects.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
They're not citizens of anything.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
They're subjects of King George III,

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
where in a British crown colony, Philadelphia, it's a crown colony.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It's got a status function.

44:47.000 --> 44:55.000
It's entirely under the government of the royal family in London,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
and they just got together and performed a collective speech act.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
They said we declare ourselves to be an independent nation.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Now, they got away with it.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
How did they get away with it?

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Well, the short answer is they got people to accept it.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
And we're here because people accepted and we accepted.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
The long answer is they had to fight a war to get the acceptance.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
And it wasn't really until Cornwallis was defeated at Yorktown

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
that they were free and clear.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And by the way, something Americans tend to forget,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
we couldn't have won the war without the help of the French.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
The French were essential in the creation of our country.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
So remember that when the French complained about us

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
and we complained about them, which is a common domestic conversation.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
So here are these guys who created an institutional reality of enormous power.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
However, it doesn't always work.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
A bunch of people, I guess, in Richmond, tried to do the same stunt.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
You know, they had a good model.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
They created the Confederate States of America and it didn't work.

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
They did not, again, it took a war to settle the issue, but the issue was settled.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
But the remarkable thing is that your life is entirely structured

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
within a series of complex families of status functions.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
They're all created by the same simple, logical, linguistic operation

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
applied over and over, the status function declaration.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
See, we're not smart enough to do something new and original every time.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
We have this device for creating status functions.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
It's the status function declaration and we apply it over and over.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
Now, I think, as I said, a lot of traditional issues are clarified

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
if you adopt the approach that's implicit in what I've been saying.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Let me conclude with one thought.

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
There are huge debates that go on in this country and internationally

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
about human rights, about universal human rights.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
And the question is, what is the ontology of the human rights?

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
And there are a class of philosophers who are very skeptical,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
like Jeremy Bentham and Alistair McIntyre.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
They think talk of human rights is nonsense.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
What are you talking about?

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
But I think, in fact, that the talk can be made legitimate

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
once you recognize what's actually going on.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
You don't have human rights the way you have thumbs.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
The human right is a status function.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
What's different about human rights and other rights

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
is that other rights typically arise within a preexisting institution.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
As a citizen, I have certain rights.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
As a husband, I have certain rights.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
As a professor, I have certain rights.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
But somebody in the 18th century, I don't know who it was.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Maybe it was 17th century, but it's in the Enlightenment.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
Somebody or some group of people got an idea of genius.

47:59.000 --> 48:04.000
Just being a human being is a why status function.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
They didn't have the right terminology for saying that.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
But that's what they were trying to say.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
Just being a human being is a why status function.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And as such, it carries deontic powers.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
It carries universal human rights.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
And I think that can be made intellectually legitimate

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
once you recognize that human rights are universal status functions

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
created and maintained by a certain type of speech act.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
And that speech act is the status function declaration.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Now, another claim I haven't really had time to develop

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
is that the institutional facts are not only created

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
in their initial form by the status function declaration,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
but that's how they maintain over a period of time.

48:49.000 --> 48:55.000
You maintain the system in power by constantly representing it

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
as the power structure that it is.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
So one of the ways to see this is to see the way

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
that revolutionary movements want to change the vocabulary.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
At the time of the Russian Revolution,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
the revolutionaries were very anxious

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
that people not use the traditional forms of address

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
of traditional Russia.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
They wanted everybody to be called comrade.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Why?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Because that marked an equality of status function

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
which calling somebody a lord or a duke or whatever

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
would not accept.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
So they were insistent on changing the vocabulary.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
And more recently, the feminists in the early days of feminism

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
were anxious that we not use the traditional vocabulary

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
of ladies and gentlemen,

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
because that marked status functions that they were anxious to overcome.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Now, I don't know how these things develop.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
It's quite interesting.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
If you, in somebody in Moscow today,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
I think if you address them as comrade, it'll be a joke.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
I mean, because the system that was created that

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
has become undermined.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
But even this is going on as we speak.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
If you look at older American laws,

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
the word spinster occurs commonly.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Now, I once asked my class,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
how many of you are spinsters?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Please raise your hand.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
One middle-aged woman had a courage to raise her hand.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I wanted to give her an A on the spot.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Because this is a term that is becoming obsolete.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
It did mark a status function.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
And I think bachelor may be becoming obsolete

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
with a change in what, with hesitation,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I call it marital practices.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
But with the relation of the sexes,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
we may be going for all sorts of new vocabularies.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
But the vocabulary is crucial,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
because the vocabulary is the articulation

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
of the assignment of a status function.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
So I think that I have only really begun a subject.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
But what I want to suggest, and I'll conclude with this,

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
is that when I use this somewhat provocative title,

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
the logical structure of human civilization.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Unfortunately, most people think,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I mean logical as opposed to illogical.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
That's not the point.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
The point is that it has a propositional structure.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
The propositional structure is the assignment

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
of a status function according to the Speech Act

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
of Declaration that makes something the case

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
by representing it as being the case.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
And wherever you have propositional structures,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
you have logical relations.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
That's why I call it the logical structure

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
of human civilization.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
But this, I think, is how we differ from other social animals.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
There are lots of social animals.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
Lots of them have power structures and hierarchies

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
with their alpha males and alpha females.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
But they do not have this remarkably rich,

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
stable system of status functions that we have.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
I visited Mike Tomasello at his primate lab in Leipzig.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And he's got all these primates

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
that are busy fighting it out every day.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Who's going to be the alpha male today?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And the alpha male has to find allies,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
among other males, to fight off other alpha males.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
Now, that's not how it works in the White House.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Barack Obama does not get up and think,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
today I got to beat everybody in arm wrestling

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
or whatever it might be.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
No, he's got an accepted system of status functions

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and that persists through time.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
And this is a feature both of good institutions

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and bad institutions.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
But I'm convinced that it is that key

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
to understanding the ontology of human civilization.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Thank you.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Thank you.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Thank you.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Thank you.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Thank you.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Thank you.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Thank you.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Thank you.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Thank you.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Thank you.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
John will take questions now.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
The microphones over here.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
The end of the line up.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Okay, Guy on the left.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I have a question.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Does that question be in one of those categories

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
or questions?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Questions.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I didn't give you an electron speech ask.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
Questions are species of directive.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Every question is a request.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
It's a request for an answer.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And indeed, there's a remarkable thing about questions

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
in English that the form of the question

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
determines the form of the answer.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
So if I answer, do you have any bananas

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and you say yes, that doesn't mean

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
yes, it's going to rain tomorrow.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
It means yes, we have bananas.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
And the one exception to this

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
is the peculiar English modal auxiliary verb.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
So if I ask you, shall I marry a Republican?

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
The correct answer is not yes, you shall

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
or no, you shall not,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
but rather yes, do or no, don't.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
It asks for advice.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
But that modal auxiliaries are hard to think about anyway.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
But go ahead.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Questions are directives. Yes.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That sort of was my question.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Okay.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Yeah.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Okay.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
All right.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Well, I was kind of thinking in the sense

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
of anything from satisfying curiosity

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
to questioning authority, like,

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
who do you think you are?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
What do you think you're doing?

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Okay.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Now, I resist the temptation of electron questions.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
They're a fascinating subject.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
And one interesting class are rhetorical questions.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
When the guy in the Republican National Convention

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
says, do we want four more years

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
of incompetent government?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
He doesn't want people to think about it.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
I don't know.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Do we or don't we?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I guess we do.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
No, it's not the form of the question.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
So rhetorical questions are interesting

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
in that the rhetorical question makes a statement

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
by assuming that the answer to the question is known.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It's assumed the answer is known

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
consequently you use the rhetorical question

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
to make a statement.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
So questions are fascinating, a lot to be said.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
But in any case, the short answer is real honest

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
and John questions like, how do I find my way to Bloomington?

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
That is a directive where you're asking for information.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Yes.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Oh, no.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Let's go over here first and then we'll come back to you.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Yeah.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
I agree with most of what you say, but I want to draw.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Watch out when somebody says that

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
because he's now going to tell us what he disagrees with.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
I want to draw attention to an important fact,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
namely you, for example, have a California driving license.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Now, suppose I were visiting California.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I didn't bring my driver's license.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You couldn't say, Roy, that's all right.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Just take mine.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
On the other hand, I have also a lunch coupon

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
for lunch tomorrow.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Yeah.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I could give that coupon to somebody else.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Yeah.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
And that person could eat lunch instead of me.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
So it's important that the driver's license is unique to you.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Yeah.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And when a policeman stops you,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
he wants to know that it's John Sir who was speeding

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
and not Kirk Ludwig.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
Whereas on the other hand, when it comes to lunch,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
it doesn't matter who is eating the lunch

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
because they want to make sure that the number of coupons

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
equals the number of people who pay.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Yes.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
No.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
So there are some important properties

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
about these certificates of power.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
No, that's absolutely right.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
And I'm grateful for the contribution.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I want to say a little bit more about it.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Many status function attached to specific individuals,

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
named individuals.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So you're named in the driver's license

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
or on the marriage license.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
You can't prove you're married by borrowing my marriage license.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
OK.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I mean, it is specific.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
The beauty of money is it's fungible.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Anybody with the money can use it to buy something with.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
But all sorts of other things are not in that way exchangeable.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Now, there's another topic.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I didn't have a chance to go into it,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
but I want to use this occasion to mention it.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
And that is that often we need indicators.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
You need status function indicators.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
So the policeman wears a uniform.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
And the actual license that I have is not the status function.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
It's an indicator that I am able to drive.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
It's a state, what I call a status function indicator.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
And these wedding rings, uniforms, driver's licenses,

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
all of these are status function indicators.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And their primary function is epistemic.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
They prove that I have the status that I claim to have.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Now, they can acquire a kind of life of their own.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So the driver's license in California

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
is used for all kinds of things that have nothing to do with driving.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
You can't buy a beer if you haven't got a driver's license

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
because you can't prove that you're over 21.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
And so sometimes the status indicators

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
will acquire a kind of separate life of their own.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
But the basic idea is that for many status functions,

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
you need to indicate that you have the status function

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
by some epistemic device.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
When I first got to Berkeley,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
you could tell who the professors were.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
They were the guys with ties on, ties and jackets.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Then in the 60s, you could tell the professors

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
they were the ones with shoes on

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
because dressing habits had changed by then.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
So you get these.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
And part of the problem in my old university, Oxford,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
is that when I was a student there,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
you could identify who was a member of the university

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
by their clothing.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
They wore, well, the kind of stuff I got on, roughly speaking.

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
They had on worsted flannel slacks and usually tweed jackets.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
This wouldn't qualify.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
But in any case, there was no question

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
about improper people wandering in the university.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
They would be immediately identified by their style of dress.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Now everybody wears blue jeans.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
They imitate the Americans.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So you can't do that anymore.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
And people have now started locking their doors.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
You have to lock your door in Oxford the way you didn't used to

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
because it was all members of the upper class

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
and they were readily identifiable by their dress.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Okay, did you finish?

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Thanks for the question.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Okay, you're on.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
In the beginning of your talk,

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
you talked about physical particles like protons and electrons.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Yeah.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
But you haven't said a word about how you get from protons

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
and electrons to human beings or to civilization.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Okay, let me answer that question.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Unfortunately, I only had two lectures to give here.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
One was about consciousness.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
So let me give you the short answer.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
To begin with, I'm not sure there are particles,

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
maybe points of mass energy or strings.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
But that's not what I'm paying the physicists to do,

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
to settle on the basic, the ontology of the basic entities.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
Okay, those are organized into systems.

59:45.000 --> 59:52.000
Now, on our little Earth, some of those particles are organized

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
into large molecules containing lots of carbon with hydrogen,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
nitrogen and oxygen.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And some of those systems of carbon-based molecules became alive.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Now, to this day, we don't know when and how and where that happened,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
but it did happen.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's an amazing fact.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And some of those living organic systems,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
some of those living organic systems continued to evolve

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and they were now talking about millions of years,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
continued to evolve until they became animals.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And some animals evolved consciousness.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And now, that's what I talked about last time,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
is how the brain creates consciousness.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And we still don't understand that.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
We don't know how exactly the brain creates consciousness

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
or how exactly it functions in the brain,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
but we know that it does.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Now, this lecture was the next step,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
where once you've got consciousness,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
then you can get language.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And I didn't discuss the structures of language.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I just talked about some of the uses.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And now, once you have language,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
you have the possibility of creating society,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
human society and human civilization.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So the pattern goes from the basic physical reality

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
of physical particles to the beginnings of life

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
in carbon-based molecules,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and then the development of life through evolution,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and then the development of evolutionary mechanisms

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
through the development of animals and conscious animals,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and then the development of language,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
and then us and then all the stuff we got.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
That's the picture.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I should have spelled that out,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
but that's how you get from protons to presidents.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You get from having the basic system of the physical particles.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Some of those become alive.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
A stunning fact.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And some of those living systems

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
evolve over long periods of evolutionary time,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
and then over that long period of time,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
you eventually reach folks like us.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Now, we ought not to be arrogant about our special situation.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
As I mentioned before,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
we are a very small solar system in a big galaxy,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I don't know how many of them can support life

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
or planets like as ours do.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But our galaxy with its 100 billion stars,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
it's one of 100 billion galaxies.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So it seems to me,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
unlikely that we're the only conscious beasts in the universe.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I don't suppose that other beasts in the universe look like us.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Why should they?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I mean, we're freaks of a certain kind of evolution.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And if they could see us,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
no reason why they have the ability to see,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
but if they could see us,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
we probably look as freakish to them as they do to us.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So we can't assume that we're the only possible reasonable way

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
for life to come about.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But it's what we got.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It's what we have to live with.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Now, that's the good news.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
There are only 100 billion stars in our galaxy,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and only 100 billion galaxies.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I've been telling my students this for years.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Here's the bad news.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I only discovered this in my physics fan frequently.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
The story I told you only covers 4% of the universe.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Oh, yeah?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
What about the other 96%?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I paid to hear about that.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Well, the other 96% is dark matter and dark energy.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And what's dark about it is epistemic darkness

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
that damn physicists haven't figured it out.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
They have pretty good reasons for believing in it.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I mean, here's the thing they say that always drives me crazy.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
The universe is expanding.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
What's it expanding in?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You know, if I say,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
we've decided to expand the kitchen.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
OK, well, then it's got to expand into the backyard.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But if we say, oh, yeah, and by the way,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
we're going to expand the kitchen and expand the universe.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
What do I expand the universe in?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Well, there is an answer to that,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
but they've been misleading us.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And the answer is to say the universe is expanding

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
is to say the galaxies are getting farther apart.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And they are.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
What's the force that's driving them farther apart?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, there's dark energy as well as dark matter.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So we're, I mean, we really are very ignorant of all

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
some of the most fundamental facts about the nature of ourselves

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and the nature of the universe.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
We really don't know much about how the universe works.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And in a way worse yet, we don't know much about how we work.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
We don't know how our brain creates consciousness.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We don't know how life began.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
We do know that it did begin and it did evolve.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And we have some conception of those mechanisms,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
but we're still ignorant of a whole lot of areas.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Well, as what makes philosophy fun is we got a lot to work on.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Okay, who's next?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I think you're, this guy's next.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Okay, you're on.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You've been talking about some of the implications

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
of the performative for social power and even social change.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The subtitle of Jared Diamond's book, Collapse,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
is How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Would you give us some hints about how we might avoid

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
catastrophic collapse and whether, whether,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
exactly, whether, whether there might be any

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
any performative incantation that would help in that task?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Well, that's why I love easy questions.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You know, I don't have a general theory of society

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
or social collapse, so I really am the wrong guy

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
to ask this question of.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
If I got a good characterization of social ontology,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the mode of existence, then I, you can go on from there,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
but I haven't gone on from there.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Well, what makes a good institution is a bad institution.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And there, it seems to me, you have to ask questions about,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
well, what constitutes human flourishing and what sorts

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
of healthy societies will facilitate human flourishing?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And it seems to me, there are lots of them in the world today

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
that are not very healthy, but Americans love to criticize themselves.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I think we're pretty well off compared with, let's say,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
what's happening in Syria.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I'm sure there are lots of joys to be had in Syria,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
but right now I'd rather be in Indiana and a whole lot

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
of other areas of the world that that's true.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So I don't have an answer to your question,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but what I provide, I hope, is a framework for ontology

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
for posing the questions.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Okay, you're on.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Okay, this one's a doozy, all right.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And it's been bothering me for a while.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
What the hell is an institution and what the hell is a society?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I mean, the institution is more important

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
because you've been using the word a lot.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
An institution, what is that?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, as I've told you, an institution is a system of constitutive rules.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Within those systems of constitutive rules,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
you create institutional facts.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
All institutional facts are created by the application

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
of a same type of speech act or the same type of linguistic representation,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
a status function declaration.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Now, there are immediate objections to that

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
because some of the things we think of as institutions

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
are not institutional facts on my account.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So the Christian calendar is not an institution

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
because being such and such a date doesn't carry a deontology.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The test is, does it carry a deontology?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Christmas Day is an institutional fact

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
because I have obligations and rights on Christmas Day.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I am obligated to give my children presents

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and I have a right to a day off.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It marks it as an institutional fact.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That's a status function.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So there are tests for status functions.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Does it carry a deontology?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But the short answer is institutions are systems of constitutive rules.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
They enable the creation of institutional facts

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
by status function declarations.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Status function declarations without exception create deontic powers

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and deontic powers are the glue that holds human civilization together

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
because they give us reason for acting

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
that are independent of our immediate inclinations.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That's a summary of the lecture.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
You brought this up towards the end concerning conflict

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and the degree to which declarations must be accepted on mass

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
for them to have causative effect.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But then it seems that this propositional logical structure

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
doesn't have very much prescriptive power.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Most of the things you can prove from this logical structure

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
are actually descriptive.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I look at my set of axioms which are the result of having already fought wars

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
and then I draw the facts from there.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So my predecessor on this side asked for could you avert society

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
simply by describing society as an iterative process of declarations.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But I have a more basic question.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Does this actually give you any prescriptive, proof-based power at all

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
or do you throw it out there and then see who wins might make right style?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yeah.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Well, okay, that's a larger question than I'll really be able to answer

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
but I would say there are lots of institutions

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
that are so obviously useful to all of us

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
that they really are not subject to challenge as institutions.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Most obvious is language.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
If you think that private property is a bad idea,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
okay, you can argue against private property.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But how would you argue against language?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You'd have to use language to argue against language

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and I don't, I mean it's just pretty hard to see language being challenged

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
as an institution.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Now some institutions are inherently evil.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Slavery seems to me, a slavery of human being seems to me inherently evil.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But then that's something you can argue for.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That's something you can, within institutional structures,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
you can make that out.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
There are some, as I said, institutions that are so obviously beneficial to everybody

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
that it's very hard to see how anybody could argue against them

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and language is the most obvious case.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But there are others.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
How about money?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Money is an institution.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Is it beneficial?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I think on balance it is.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
It's famously the root of all evil,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
but it's the root of an awful lot of good too.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I try to imagine what your life would be like

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
if you had no possibility of buying and selling or being paid

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
or being paid for your work or anything like that.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It's very hard to imagine how you would organize a decent life.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So there are lots of institutions that are very pervasive

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
that are effectively harmless.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Now how about private property?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Well I think private property, again, benefits just about everybody.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
But we now have in the United States such a disproportionate

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
concentration of private property, the famous 1%.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The wealth is so disproportionately concentrated

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
that it seems to me very unhealthy.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It's just not a healthy way to run a society

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
to have so much power, so much deontic power

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
in the hands of so few people.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
For one thing, it gives them a disproportionate amount of political power.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And these are real problems that we're going to have to face.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So I think if you want to ask about a given institution,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
is this institution a good one or a bad one,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
you have to tell me more about the institution

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and what it does, how it functions in human life.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I'd like to follow up on a question that was asked on this side a little earlier

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
when you were asked to spell out a little bit more about the way

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
that you get from molecules to presidents and so forth.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And what I'm going to ask you, some people would object to the treatment

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
of things like presidents and elections on the same ontological plane

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
as molecules and particles.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I wonder if you could say a little bit more about the logic

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
that allows from a materialist conception of the world

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
is reducible to material, how things emerge from that

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and can exist in any way on a different level.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
No, that's a very good question.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
One of the things I hope is implicit in what I've said

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
is that there are additional distinctions between the material

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and the mental or the material and the ideal.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I think those are all obsolete.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I mean, we live in one world.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's basic structure is that of physical particles.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Among the physical features of the world is consciousness,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
but I mean real honest to John consciousness,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
with all its subjectivity touchy-feely features,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and then organized systems of consciousness through collective intentionality

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
to create human civilization.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's the story about how you get from the protons to the presidents.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Of course, there are several steps in that story

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
we just don't understand.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
We don't understand how life got started.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It did.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
We don't understand how consciousness got started.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And we really don't understand how human languages took off,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and we may never really understand that because there's no fossil evidence.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We need to look at the fossils and see whether or not these guys had a subject verb language

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
or a language where the verb came first.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
You can't look at that.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Look at the skull and discover that.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So we may never have a full understanding of how these things developed,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
but they did develop.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:47.000
We did evolve from a solar system at least in which there were no living beings.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
We evolved into us, and we did evolve culturally

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
into something that's far more complicated

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and far more interesting, I think, than a hunter-gatherer existence

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
where no longer just running around the woods

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
trying to find enough food to get through the rest of the day.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Any other questions?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I've answered every question.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Yeah.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Thank you.
