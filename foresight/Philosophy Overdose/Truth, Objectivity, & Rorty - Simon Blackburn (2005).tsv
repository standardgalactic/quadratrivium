0	20000	I'm going to talk a little bit about the nature of truth and some of its enemies, and by the end of the talk I'm going to talk a little bit about the philosophy of Richard Rorty, who is famous amongst other things, for saying that only a metaphysical prig believes in truth anymore.
20000	32000	Well, I find myself a kind of prig, I suppose, in spite of having written a book about lust, and what I want to urge is that you can believe in truth without being a metaphysical prig.
32000	45000	You just have to be a prig. So that's going to be the plot. The setting against which I'm going to talk, I'm not going to read out all this material, partly because it makes up a book on truth,
45000	52000	but I'm going to summarize the plot as it leads up to the discussion of Richard Rorty.
52000	65000	Well, the setting is a very old one. It's one that you meet, for example, in the dialogue with Theotitus, in which we imagine a confrontation between relativists and absolutists.
65000	80000	The relativist is the kind of sneery person that you meet in the marketplace who thinks that a lot of our talk, talk about truth, objectivity, knowledge, talk about scientific rationality, perhaps,
80000	90000	a lot of such discourse is, in fact, to be seen simply as the putting on of masks of theatrical guises or of the adoption of a rhetorical pose.
90000	104000	It's a vocabulary to be used to persuade others of our opinion. In other words, the primary usage of those terms is in connection with power and persuasion.
104000	120000	I'll sometimes talk of that as a postmodernist view. I take it that's a harmless enough label, although, of course, you could dispute whether particular postmodernists like Foucault or Derrida or Leotard actually conform exactly to the description.
120000	136000	Against the relativist, you become the absolutists who think that truth, on the contrary, is a deity worth worshiping. Truth is real. Truth is absolute. Truth is something that you must worship.
136000	160000	A falling away from truth is a failure. Truth exerts a demand upon us, and so on. In the dialogue in the Theotetus, of course, Socrates is the champion of truth, the absolutist position, and he confronts Theodorus and disciple of Protagoras who takes the other view.
160000	180000	So you've got in a nutshell, on the one hand, philosophers believing that truth deserves, as it were, dignities and robes of state. Those are the absolutists. And on the other hand, you've got relativists who think that when we talk about truth, we're basically putting on something more like a theatrical costume, a set of masks.
180000	198000	I believe that the sides in this dispute tend to talk past each other, and a lot of the argument that is adduced on one side or the other therefore misses its target. I've got a story. I have put this story in print in my little book, Being Good.
198000	214000	So I'm afraid the happy few of you in the audience who may have read that book will have to bear with me for a moment, and I'll be telling you a story you know. But I've got a story which illustrates the way the two sides talk past each other, which I very much like, and it's a true story.
214000	239000	It happened to a friend of mine, the distinguished philosopher of Lord Jeremy Waldron actually, who was at a think tank in Princeton on ethics, and it was a condition of his fellowship at this institute that he attend all the talks or all the particular talks that the institute put on.
239000	255000	And one night they put on for the rest of the university, or perhaps the general public, a dialogue between proponents of the world's great religions. Jeremy had no particular interest in this topic, but he had to go along as a condition of his fellowship.
256000	276000	So he went along, and sure enough there was a little line up, and they let everybody have their go. And so as it were, first off the, let's say the Hindu went and he talked about karma and the reincarnation of the spirit and the number of lives you had to live and how you could eventually free yourself from the cycle and so on.
276000	297000	And everybody gave tremendous round of applause and said, you know, if that works for you, that's great. And then the Buddhist went and he talked about the, you know, the corruption of life by desire and the way to release yourself from that by the noble truths and the eightfold way and so on.
298000	316000	At the end of that, everybody said, wow, you know, tremendous applause. If that works for you, that's great. And so it went on and eventually the Catholic priest had his say and he talked about the fall of mankind, the Garden of Eden, the expulsion from the garden, the serpent, the redemption of the world through Jesus Christ and so forth.
317000	333000	And they all said, oh, wow, terrific, you know, if that works for you, that's great. And he thumped the table and said, no, it's not a question of if it works for me. It's the true word of the living God. And if you don't believe it, you're all damned to hell.
333000	360000	And they all said, wow, terrific, if that works for you. Well, that's what I mean by the two sides talking past each other. The ancient Greeks had a nice motto saying that you can give something with the right hand and yet it is received with the left.
360000	379000	And I think that's what the story illustrates. So how do we get past the opposition? How do we argue about it? How do we argue ourselves out of it? Well, I think that in recent philosophy of truth, far and away, the most promising suggestion has been to go minimalist.
379000	408000	And I'll explain a little bit what I mean by that, or deflationist. Some of you will have read the writings of people like Stephen Leeds or Paul Horwich, and you'll know what I'm talking about. But in a nutshell, it goes something like this. Along comes someone like Pilate, a Pontius Pilate, and says, what is truth? And everybody goes sort of dizzy. And you look to the philosopher to provide a suitably abstract and high-faluting answer.
409000	437000	The minimalist says you shouldn't answer Pilate. Or rather, if you answer Pilate, your answer should take the form of a question, which is, what are you interested in? So basically, you throw the question, what is truth back? Until a person who's interlocuting you, who's asking the question, gives you an example. He says, well, I'm interested in the question of whether penguins fly.
438000	459000	It's okay. Well, the truth there, the truth would consist in penguins flying. See, in other words, you just repeat the issue. That's very disappointing, of course. But the point of deflationism or minimalism is that that disappointing answer is all you should get. It's all you should expect, and it's all you're going to get.
460000	477000	It has a number of consequences. One of which is that when we talk in terms of truth, we're not elevating ourselves at all. We're not taking up, as it were, a God's eye viewpoint or an Archimedean viewpoint outside an issue.
477000	487000	If I say I really want to know whether it's true that penguins fly, I'm saying no more than I really want to know whether penguins fly. And that's a perfectly straightforward empirical question.
487000	500000	If I've defined a good issue, then the issue is the issue. And there's no question of I trying to adopt a stance, which is the peculiar privilege of the philosopher.
501000	513000	There may be something priggish, this is where priggishness comes back, in being particularly interested in a particular issue. But there's nothing metaphysically necessarily priggish about it.
513000	524000	If you're interested in whether penguins fly, good for you. And if you've got the money, you can go to the Antarctic and conduct some observations, or you can look it up in encyclopedias or do whatever appears appropriate.
525000	540000	So the minimalist says there's no general problem about truth. Of course, there may be problems that arise in connection with particular sentences. There might be sentences that don't define an issue, in which case you can't play the game I just played.
540000	550000	You can't deflate it and say, I know what the issue of truth is, it's that P, because you haven't got a proposition to wheel up about which you're inquiring.
551000	563000	But when you do, the minimalist says the issue is the issue, and anything else is a distraction. So you're neither putting on robes of state, nor are you adopting a rhetorical posture or putting on a theatrical mask.
563000	574000	Both the absolutist and the relativist thought there was a space for theory when there's none, and that is the minimalist or deflationist point.
575000	591000	It's sometimes thought that minimalism and deflationism take away a certain kind of ambitions that we might have, and this is, I think, possibly the only point of contact I've got with this conference, at least in its connection with value.
591000	600000	It's sometimes thought that minimalism and deflationism take away any idea that truth is intrinsically valuable, or that you can care about truth.
600000	616000	So, for example, if you think of Winston in George Orwell's 1984, or you think of the kind of morality exhibited by Primo Levi, then these people care about truth and they go to the stake for truth.
616000	626000	And it's thought that the minimalist somehow doesn't allow that. How can truth remain an ideal if there's no such robust, abstract property?
627000	635000	That, I think, is a natural question, but I don't think the challenge is unanswerable. In fact, I think the challenge can fairly easily be answered.
635000	640000	What the minimalist says is, as usual, will you tell me the issue?
640000	648000	I suppose the issue is whether penguins waddle. Then you care about the truth if you care about whether penguins waddle.
648000	659000	And you care, for example, about ancillary things like only saying that penguins waddle if penguins do waddle, or believing that penguins waddle if and only if penguins waddle.
659000	667000	In other words, you've got a way of saying for each sentence what caring about its truth amounts to.
667000	672000	And you can then turn that into a schema. Somebody can be said in general to care about truth.
673000	681000	If he cares about satisfying the schema, I believe that P, if and only if P, to the maximum number of times.
681000	688000	Or if he feels guilty when he turns out to have satisfied an instance of the schema, I believe P, although not P.
688000	697000	Or if he's prepared to put a lot of effort into maximizing either the proportion of times or the number of times that he satisfies that schema.
697000	709000	And since the schema, none of its instances mentions truth, you don't need a robust metaphysical property of truth to give sense to Winston's concern or to Premier Levy's concern.
709000	717000	So I don't think it's true that minimalism takes away your right to care about truth as you should.
718000	728000	Well now, is it then the case that the relativist, for example, has to slink back into silence?
728000	735000	Does this kind of thought, the minimalist thought, defeat any relativist leanings anyone might have?
736000	751000	I think it's true that it defeats, for instance, the moral relativist, at least what's sometimes called the sophomore moral relativist that you meet on the street, as it were, or in the freshman seminar room.
752000	767000	Suppose you've got a moral issue. I'll take the example of whether fox hunting should be banned, because this was a big issue in Britain quite recently, whether hunting with foxes should be disallowed.
767000	773000	And you can imagine a proponent of one side or the other. Somebody says that it should be allowed and somebody else says that it shouldn't.
773000	782000	So I suppose I'm arguing with somebody we'll call him Gengis, who Gengis thinks that fox hunting is a jolly good thing and I think it should be banned.
782000	794000	And now imagine the relativist Rosie coming along, and Rosie says something like, you two, you're always banging on about this issue as if there's a truth about it.
794000	803000	You ought to realize that it's true for you, Simon, that fox hunting ought to be banned, but it's true for Gengis that it ought not to be banned.
803000	815000	You relativize truth and just stop bickering, shut up about it. Something like that for the relativist is my truth, your truth is truth.
816000	825000	Minimalism, I think, stops that and stops it properly. It stops it properly because it gives no meaning to my truth, your truth.
825000	832000	Except, of course, I believe that fox hunting ought to be banned and Gengis believes that it ought not to be banned, but we already knew that.
832000	835000	That's why we've got an opposition, a debate on.
836000	851000	I think in silencing Rosie and giving her nothing to say, minimalism has a, it's a plus, it's an advantage to minimalism that it does that, because I think you can see that she is just actually a distraction.
852000	867000	Because what goes on after she's had her say, after she said, oh, look, it's true for Gengis that fox hunting ought to be banned, but it's true for you that it ought not to be banned and it's true for you that it ought to be banned.
867000	875000	What's supposed to go on? Are we supposed to just fall over and say, fine, we'll agree to differ? But of course we don't.
876000	884000	If I agree to differ with Gengis, that's functionally equivalent to tolerating as fox hunting, which is what I was against.
884000	893000	But why should I change my mind? Why should I cease from being against it and start tolerating it because of anything Rosie has said?
893000	902000	She hasn't said anything that makes fox hunting a jot more permissible or she hasn't changed the colors in which it might appear to me.
902000	914000	She hasn't, in other words, she hasn't engaged with any reasons I might have for thinking that fox hunting ought to be banned, nor has she engaged with any reasons Gengis might have for thinking it ought not to.
914000	919000	In other words, her contribution seems to be just a distraction.
920000	935000	I don't think that's always so. I think a contribution of that kind might not be a distraction if, for example, is not a real issue or if the two protagonists ought to stop bickering for some other reason.
935000	942000	Most likely that they haven't framed an issue properly and I think many issues about values are not framed properly.
942000	952000	For example, if you and I go to the art gallery and I say Rembrandt is a greater painter than Vermeer and you say no, Vermeer is a greater painter than Rembrandt,
952000	963000	there may be a point in somebody who comes along to, as it were, try to stop us from bickering because very probably put in those terms the issue is not worth discussing.
963000	971000	You can discuss all sorts of issues about the relationship between Rembrandt and Vermeer, but if you put it in terms of which is the greater painter,
971000	981000	I don't think you'll get anywhere and I don't think that without a lot of clarification you'll be defining an issue worth talking about and therefore not an issue worth bickering about.
981000	990000	So I don't think relativism is always a distraction or merely a distraction, but I think in cases where we have an issue which we have to sort out,
990000	1001000	then the motto is the issue is the issue and these remarks purporting to be remarks about the nature of truth are irrelevant and distractions.
1001000	1017000	Okay, what about though the movement of modern thought, the movement I vaguely pointed to as postmodernism, which you may think is unlikely to be silenced by the kinds of remarks I've made so far.
1017000	1031000	Minimalism about truth gets us so far, but the postmodernist climate, as it were, I think is not one that we're going to change simply by insisting upon it.
1032000	1046000	I think the postmodernist climate can best be summarized, I quite like a few years ago there was a very indiscreet and talkative butler,
1047000	1057000	man called Paul Burrell, who had been Princess Diana's butler and he spilled the beans to all the newspapers for considerable sums of money.
1057000	1068000	And he said apropos of Diana's death that the Queen had said to him, there are dark forces at work of which we know nothing.
1069000	1078000	Well, I rather doubt whether the Queen said any such thing, but if she did that she's in effect giving us a motto of postmodernism,
1078000	1095000	because I think the motivation, as it were, the steam behind a lot of what you read about the decline of truth or the absence of objectivity and so on.
1095000	1104000	The steam is given, I think, by the thought, voiced in different ways, of course, at the beginning of modernism by people like Freud or Nietzsche,
1104000	1119000	and then carried on through into almost everything in the 20th century, that our sayings and our perceptions of the world will inevitably be the result of a process of acculturation,
1119000	1125000	about which we know very little, and whose effects upon us we cannot discount for.
1125000	1137000	We in some sense cannot step outside our own skins and get rid of the bias that would be brought with our interests, our vocabularies, our saliences, our ways of looking at things.
1138000	1151000	Looked at like that, it's not true that postmodernism is the private property of weird continental philosophers of the kind that some of the graduate students in this room may suffer from.
1152000	1160000	It's also there very, very firmly in the Anglo-American culture.
1160000	1172000	If we think of a garden of Eden, a golden age, for example, sometimes perhaps of the heyday of positivism, although actually this is historically too simple,
1173000	1178000	but a golden age would be one way you've got, as it were, a determined experience.
1178000	1190000	You've got a determined way of taking experience to build theory, if not necessarily an algorithm for creating theory, at least a set of rational procedures for assessing theory,
1190000	1204000	and you've got determinate meaning so that you can pass on the results of any theorizing you've done and expect them to transmit without distortion.
1204000	1215000	If you think about a picture something like that, and perhaps with other components as well, for example, reliable logic, a priori certitude in various ways,
1216000	1229000	then I think you can see that everything that happened in post-war, analytical, Anglo-American philosophy, everything that, as it were, got brand names attached to it,
1229000	1234000	was in effect a dissolution of that sunny picture.
1234000	1238000	In other words, our expulsion from paradise was complete.
1238000	1249000	You think of sellers as attacking the myth of the given, undermining the sense that observations somehow unproblematically or directly plugged you into the fact observed.
1249000	1262000	You think of quine as undermining the determinacy of meaning, so that the idea that your words bore certain meaning which you could rely upon transmitting to other people.
1262000	1268000	That idea became attacked, quine also, of course, attacking the notion of the a priori.
1268000	1281000	You've got Wittgenstein stressing the role of human nature, human and perhaps a cultured nature, in determining what counted for us as going on the same way.
1281000	1289000	That's a very abstract way of putting what Wittgenstein was aiming at in the rule following considerations that chimes in with the way Goodman thought,
1289000	1292000	but I think it's accurate enough.
1292000	1299000	And, of course, eventually you've got Thomas Coon telling us that science itself is not so much a matter of rationality,
1299000	1308000	but a matter of putting on a particular set of spectacles or seeing a natural phenomena through a certain set of paradigms which could shift,
1308000	1312000	and the shift would be, as it were, a question of dark forces.
1312000	1318000	It'd be a question of social, political, other needs coming to mind, other forces coming to mind.
1318000	1322000	And that would change the concepts with which we thought about nature.
1322000	1333000	Well, I think all those are ways, if you see them together, the similarity I want to point out is that they're ways of undermining the sunny epistemological picture,
1333000	1339000	which perhaps the positivists were the last people to express.
1340000	1352000	I think against that background, it's possible to make good sense of some of the wilder sounding things that, for example, Richard Rorty,
1352000	1361000	who is, of course, I think a spokesman for a postmodernist climate, tries to present in his work.
1362000	1373000	Rorty is fond of saying that truth is a matter, well, he's not really fond of truth at all, but insofar as he'll use a notion,
1373000	1382000	he wants to say that proper discourse, something like true success in discourse, is a matter of coping, not copying.
1382000	1390000	The idea is going to be that the notion of representation is somehow transcendental.
1390000	1396000	The idea of language as representing the facts is somehow beyond our reach.
1396000	1405000	He often says that the question, does he love truth, is equivalent to the question, does he love God with all his heart and soul,
1405000	1408000	and that's a question which you can't know the answer to.
1408000	1410000	It's not a good question.
1411000	1421000	And this is part of his attempt, his campaign to replace the concept of representation or the concept of truth with a concept,
1421000	1425000	a more Darwinian concept like that of being adapted.
1425000	1432000	So discourse becomes not susceptible to much of truth and falsity as useful or not useful.
1433000	1440000	Also politically it becomes a question of whether a discourse is on the side of solidarity,
1440000	1450000	whether it's as it were politically on the side of getting consensus and getting agreement with other people as opposed to something else.
1450000	1458000	Now, Rorty obviously is coming at the end of the kind of pressures I've just been mentioning.
1458000	1466000	This is a philosophy you'd only get if you'd started to despair about any project of epistemology.
1466000	1475000	And what Quine, Sellers, Wittgenstein and Kuhn, amongst many others of course, were doing in my brief account,
1475000	1482000	was making us despair of any project of justificatory epistemology.
1483000	1490000	What I want to do in the rest of the talk is try to bring together what I said about minimalism
1490000	1498000	with what I've just done sympathetically, I hope, to place Rorty in a kind of post-epistemological climate
1498000	1508000	and one where he is responding to real problems, to real difficulties brought out by those great figures that I have mentioned.
1508000	1513000	Because on the one hand you've got sympathy I think, I've got sympathy with Rorty,
1513000	1522000	taking the problematic left us by people like Quine, Sellers, Wittgenstein and Kuhn,
1522000	1530000	taking that very seriously and trying to break out of the epistemological impasse that they leave
1530000	1537000	by in effect denying the subject of epistemology and doing that by denying the notion of representation.
1538000	1541000	That sounds sympathetic enough, it sounds like a good move.
1541000	1550000	On the other hand you get invoicing himself by denying truth, by saying that truth only belongs to metaphysical prigs,
1550000	1555000	by denying that we can make sense of Winston's predicament in 1984.
1555000	1565000	That is denying that Winston had a sensible thing to worry about when he worried about whether the party was in effect veiling
1566000	1571000	his capacity or undermining his capacity to get at the truth about anything.
1571000	1576000	And minimalism it seems ought to stop Rorty talking like that.
1576000	1588000	Because as I tried to explain earlier on, minimalism enables us to make perfect sense of Winston.
1588000	1591000	It makes perfect sense of the question, does he love truth?
1591000	1601000	And so it's very unclear why you should go Rorty's way, even as a way of expressing sympathy with the anti-epistemological
1601000	1607000	writings which undoubtedly form a large part of his background.
1607000	1618000	Well let me quote for you something, the kind of thing that Rorty likes to say and then I'll say how I want to resolve this apparent tension.
1618000	1626000	The apparent tension between sympathizing with Rorty, admiring him on the one hand for being a sensitive interpreter
1626000	1632000	of the epistemological condition we got into as a result of those writings,
1632000	1643000	versus thinking that he's just wrong about truth, that he's aligning himself with the old absolutist relativist kind of polarity
1643000	1646000	and that can be undermined by minimalism.
1646000	1649000	So what are we going to say about this?
1649000	1654000	Well here's Rorty talking about coping but not copying.
1654000	1660000	He says, there is no way in which tools can take one out of touch with reality.
1660000	1665000	No matter whether the tool is a hammer or a gun or a belief or a statement,
1665000	1670000	tool using is part of the interaction of an organism with its environment.
1670000	1675000	To see the employment of words as the use of tools to deal with the environment,
1675000	1680000	rather than as an attempt to represent the intrinsic nature of that environment,
1680000	1685000	is to repudiate the question of whether human minds are in touch with reality.
1685000	1689000	The question asked by the epistemological skeptic.
1689000	1698000	No organism, human or non-human, is ever more or less in touch with reality than any other organism.
1698000	1705000	Well that's obviously a pretty provocative thing to say because as we look round the coffee house,
1705000	1711000	we're able to see a lot of organisms which seem to be pretty out of touch with reality.
1711000	1714000	But you can see how Rorty gets to say it.
1714000	1721000	That is, epistemology leads us into the Quine cellars, Wittgenstein-Kloon impasse.
1721000	1725000	It's a no-no, it's a non-starter, we can't do anything with it.
1725000	1731000	Let's get rid of the notion of representation which the epistemologist is desperately trying to certify
1731000	1736000	and see words in a more Darwinian sense as tools we have for coping,
1736000	1740000	and then we leap free of the old problematic.
1740000	1744000	We change the subject as Rorty likes to put it.
1744000	1749000	So Rorty walks away from the traditional problems as he sees it.
1749000	1758000	And the walk away takes the form of junking a lot of the vocabulary, including the vocabulary of truth.
1758000	1767000	Here he is on the replacement of representation with a vocabulary of solidarity.
1767000	1772000	We understand knowledge best when we understand the social justification of belief
1772000	1777000	and thus have no need to view it as accuracy of representations.
1777000	1784000	Instead of seeking vertical relationships between language or ourselves as language users and the world,
1784000	1791000	we must concentrate upon horizontal or inferential processes whereby we advance and accept reasons from each other.
1791000	1804000	Justification becomes a social phenomenon rather than a transaction between an inverted commas knowing subject and, again, inverted commas reality.
1804000	1813000	Well, now that substitution, of course, coincides with realising that contingently and historically situated as we are,
1813000	1821000	any of the norms that govern the inferential relations that our peers will let us get away with are our norms.
1821000	1826000	So the inferences that we produce are our inferences, neither they nor anything else,
1826000	1834000	answers to the external world except in the most general sense that they enable us to cope.
1834000	1840000	And it's a foregone conclusion that a language will enable you to cope because if it doesn't enable you to cope,
1840000	1845000	you'll go to the wall and you won't be using it anymore.
1845000	1851000	And that's basically the line of thought that leads Rorty to his rather more flamboyant kind of assertion,
1851000	1857000	such as the one that truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with.
1857000	1863000	A remark that excited Putnam's particular anger because, as Putnam rightly pointed out,
1863000	1871000	there's more than a whiff of self-refutation in the air since the remark that truth is what your contemporaries let you get away with
1871000	1877000	wasn't one that Rorty's contemporaries let him get away with.
1878000	1882000	Well, of course, to many of us, this solution looks worse than the problem.
1882000	1889000	Whatever upper ear people like Wittgenstein left us in, it looks as though the cure is worse than the disease
1889000	1896000	if you get rid of the idea of languages, at least in part, there for representing the way of things.
1896000	1901000	So Rorty, of course, will say that shows a naive attachment to an old vocabulary
1901000	1908000	and it's part of his enterprise is to shake us up and to get us to abandon those thoughts.
1908000	1914000	But as I say, I'm more of a prig and more conservative and I want to keep hold of them.
1914000	1922000	Rorty has, I think, two devices for sort of softening you up to his point of view.
1922000	1926000	One is to insist that if you're still bothered about truth and objectivity,
1926000	1931000	and this is, of course, a line of thought familiar, at least since Barclay,
1931000	1936000	and always used by anti-realists or idealists against people with realist leanings,
1936000	1941000	that they're the charge that they're attempting to stand on their own shoulder
1941000	1946000	or adopt an Archimedean point outside their own best theory, outside their own world
1946000	1951000	to discover how well their theory is relating to reality
1951000	1956000	and pointing out that that point of view is mythical, is one of Rorty's prime weapons
1956000	1959000	and, of course, he's quite right about it.
1959000	1966000	The other, which is, I think, more interesting, though, is the idea that you'd only be a realist.
1966000	1974000	You'd only want to come back against his proposal to substitute talk of solidarity for talk of truth.
1974000	1976000	You'd only want to resist it.
1976000	1982000	If you had a fantastical idea of the world as itself demanding to be talked about
1982000	1989000	in one set of terms or another, as if the realist is involved in the very strange idea,
1989000	1994000	a naive idea, of the speaking world, the world which, as it were,
1994000	1999000	has its own privileged vocabulary or privileged discourse,
1999000	2003000	obviously here the concern ties in with the dislike of scientism
2003000	2008000	because people who perhaps think of the world as having a privileged voice
2008000	2012000	probably thinks that it's the voice of mathematics and the voice of physics.
2012000	2016000	And one of the things that Rorty might be doing is plugging into a sense
2016000	2021000	that at least other discourses have their own propriety.
2021000	2023000	But on the face of it, it's very strange.
2023000	2028000	It sounds as though you could be a card-carrying, paid-up believer in the notion of truth
2028000	2031000	without thinking any such thing.
2031000	2036000	If I'm interested in truth, as the minimalist construes it,
2036000	2041000	then I'm interested in the schema, I believe P if and only of P,
2041000	2044000	in maximizing the number of times that schema is satisfied
2044000	2047000	and minimizing the number of times that I flouted.
2047000	2050000	And it doesn't seem as though I'm interested in a talking world.
2050000	2054000	I'm interested in a whole succession of things, like whether penguins fly
2054000	2060000	or whether geese lay eggs or whether platypuses are mammals or whatever it might be.
2060000	2063000	And that doesn't require believing that the world talks.
2063000	2068000	It just requires the capacity to make judgments about particular issues
2068000	2071000	on particular occasions.
2071000	2074000	Well, I think that's fair enough.
2074000	2077000	There are other currents leading to Rorty,
2077000	2081000	some of which I don't have time to go into this afternoon.
2081000	2084000	One of them, of course, is the Salazian separation
2084000	2089000	of the space of causes from the space of reasons.
2089000	2095000	Rorty, the motivation behind thinking that believers in truth,
2095000	2099000	believers in epistemology, believers in objectivity,
2099000	2105000	are stuck in some kind of naive conception of a talking world.
2105000	2109000	I think the motivation behind believing that
2109000	2114000	is the Salazian separation of the space of causes from the space of reasons.
2114000	2118000	Rorty, like others like Brandon and McDowell, take that very seriously.
2118000	2124000	And they think that therefore all your transactions with the world are purely causal.
2124000	2131000	What enters your mind are just, as it were, energies from the flux.
2131000	2136000	What your mind then does with that includes the making of experience itself
2136000	2141000	and, of course, the making of perception and the making of judgment and so on.
2141000	2144000	But that takes us into the space of reasons
2144000	2147000	and the space of reasons is not to be confused
2147000	2152000	or even related to this space of causes.
2152000	2158000	The idea would be that if you have the old epistemology,
2158000	2161000	the old view of these things which Rorty is trying to get us away from,
2161000	2167000	it would be as if you thought that photons or other energies from the world
2167000	2169000	came bearing messages.
2169000	2173000	They came actually saying that there's a cat on the mat
2173000	2176000	or there's a cliff in front of you or whatever it is.
2176000	2184000	And the Salazian point is that they don't do that.
2184000	2187000	This is a very impressive philosophy
2187000	2193000	and I think Rorty has pursued it with considerable skill
2193000	2197000	and it has, of course, relationships with similar philosophies found
2197000	2200000	in writers like Robert Brandon, John McDowell,
2200000	2206000	although McDowell is, I think, a more awkward case to place,
2206000	2209000	and Donald Davidson.
2209000	2213000	When Davidson says that only a belief can justify another belief,
2213000	2218000	he's basically in exactly the same space as Rorty,
2218000	2227000	although, of course, Davidson doesn't draw the radical consequences from it.
2227000	2230000	How can we relate to this?
2230000	2237000	How can we get a better view of it in such a way that the tension I talked about disappears,
2237000	2242000	the tension being, remember, that we'll sympathise with Rorty
2242000	2246000	if we remember the difficulties of epistemology,
2246000	2256000	the difficulties heralded by Krine, Wittgenstein, Goodman, Kuhn, so on.
2256000	2261000	Whereas we won't sympathise with him if we remember minimalism,
2261000	2264000	because minimalism is going to keep us on all fours,
2264000	2266000	it's going to keep our feet on the ground,
2266000	2272000	and it's going to enable us to interpret things like he loves truth with all his heart and soul.
2272000	2274000	It's not going to be a transcendental remark,
2274000	2277000	which you get to by jumping outside your own skin,
2277000	2281000	it's going to be a perfectly ordinary, verifiable, empirical remark
2281000	2285000	about the person's concern for satisfying that schema
2285000	2287000	as often as possible.
2287000	2291000	Well, I think there are ways of attacking Rorty,
2291000	2296000	which I think don't meet their mark,
2296000	2298000	and it's very difficult to find one that does,
2298000	2303000	partly because, as it were, as a dialectical posture,
2303000	2307000	he's put himself in a rather enviable position.
2307000	2310000	I've been able to say that almost anything you say against him
2310000	2313000	just shows an attachment to a naive old vocabulary,
2313000	2317000	whereas his whole point is to get you to stop thinking in those terms.
2317000	2322000	And rather like David Lewis once said that he can't refute an incredulous stare,
2322000	2328000	I think one can't refute somebody walking away with his back to you.
2328000	2330000	So it is quite difficult,
2330000	2338000	but I think we can see reasons for thinking that Rorty has got something wrong.
2338000	2343000	Let me talk a little bit, then, about the Davidsonian side of it,
2343000	2348000	the thought that only a belief justifies another belief,
2348000	2352000	the thought that you need a total separation between the space of causes
2352000	2356000	and the space of reasons.
2356000	2359000	It seems to me that what's wrong with that,
2359000	2363000	Davidsonian slogan, and I'll bring this back to Rorty,
2363000	2370000	is that it's not, I mean, it's obviously not true that only a belief justifies another belief.
2370000	2376000	If you ask me why I'm justified in believing that there's butter in the fridge,
2376000	2380000	the kind of answer you're going to get will probably include something like,
2380000	2385000	I went and looked, or I listened to somebody who had gone and looked,
2385000	2390000	or I got this webcam trailed or trained on the fridge,
2390000	2397000	and look, you can see the butter for yourself, or something like that.
2397000	2401000	You won't hear me saying, oh, my justification for believing that there's butter in the fridge
2401000	2405000	is that I believe that there's butter and cheese in the fridge,
2405000	2411000	and a licensed influence in my society is from the presence of butter and cheese
2411000	2413000	to the presence of butter.
2413000	2415000	That's not the way it goes.
2415000	2419000	This justification, as it's bandied about in the marketplace,
2419000	2422000	is not a matter of what else you believe.
2422000	2425000	If you imagine a mind which had the, as it were,
2425000	2431000	a self-fertilizing property of just beliefs bubbled up within it,
2431000	2435000	although it was in no causal contact with an external world,
2435000	2437000	well, actually, those wouldn't be beliefs.
2437000	2443000	They wouldn't be concepts without intuitions in Kantian terms.
2443000	2448000	But playing along with the fantasy, that would be a self-contained mind,
2448000	2455000	a mind which was just the gifted with a surprising fertility in producing beliefs.
2455000	2459000	But it wouldn't be a mind that was justified in believing anything,
2459000	2462000	at least anything empirical, anything about the surrounding world,
2462000	2468000	precisely because it wouldn't be the subject of a set of procedures
2468000	2475000	which could be seen as making a belief more likely to be true than false,
2475000	2480000	making it more likely that you believe P if and only of P than the reverse.
2480000	2486000	What I think the Davidsonian slogan which he takes from Sellers,
2486000	2492000	he believes to be a kind of beefing up of something implicit in Sellers,
2492000	2496000	what I think it forgets is that the causal flux,
2496000	2501000	the things that cause you to believe things are not themselves transcendental,
2501000	2504000	they're not themselves outside the range of your beliefs.
2504000	2510000	It's part of your everyday belief system that you're caused to believe
2510000	2513000	that there's butter in the fridge, by the presence of butter in the fridge.
2513000	2519000	And furthermore, you can use that causal knowledge to put yourself in the way of causation,
2519000	2525000	which in turn brings it about that your beliefs are indeed genuinely responsive
2525000	2527000	to an external world.
2527000	2533000	And with the idea of responsiveness comes at least part of the idea of representation.
2533000	2542000	So I think what's happened here is that Rorty, Sellers, Davidson, people who think like that
2542000	2549000	have got themselves fundamentally into a position very like that which Barkley got into
2550000	2556000	when he was dissenting from Locke's epistemology.
2556000	2561000	That is a thinking that the only alternative to the Lockean idea of resemblance,
2561000	2566000	the transcendental possibility that your ideas resemble the external world,
2566000	2571000	the only decent alternative was to Locke yourself in the world of your ideas altogether
2571000	2574000	and let external reality disappear.
2575000	2582000	I want to argue for a much more human scale down, not transcendental,
2582000	2591000	re-injection of causation and responsiveness into the formation of beliefs in the first place.
2591000	2593000	And I believe this is true to count.
2593000	2600000	If we think about the speaking world element, I think we'll also see that Rorty has overplayed his hand.
2601000	2608000	Those of us who believe in truth and believe in representation don't, I think typically,
2608000	2613000	regard the world as demanding to be described in a certain way.
2613000	2618000	We may have reasons for privileging physics,
2618000	2626000	but those will be reasons that are simply derived from things like physics utility
2626000	2629000	or its fundamental place in explaining other things.
2629000	2635000	It won't derive from the thought that physics is God's language or the world's language.
2635000	2638000	You might have that thought, but you don't have to.
2638000	2644000	Suppose I want to convince you of the representational credentials of a map, of a landscape.
2644000	2648000	I'll say, look, here is the sign representing cliffs.
2648000	2652000	And you better jolly well play attention to that,
2652000	2657000	because, for example, if you don't, you'll fall over the cliffs.
2657000	2661000	If you're setting your compass bearing along there and you walk along there,
2661000	2664000	look out, you're going to come to cliffs.
2664000	2668000	Rorty will say that's an exercise of coping, of course.
2668000	2673000	The map has a use, it's got a utility, and he's all in favor of utility.
2673000	2677000	But then where's the contrast between coping and copying?
2677000	2681000	Where's the contrast between the map enabling you to cope
2681000	2684000	and the map representing the landscape?
2684000	2687000	There's no contrast at all, the map does both things
2687000	2692000	and furthermore, common sense, human common sense, not anything transcendental.
2692000	2695000	Nothing about standing on your own shoulders.
2695000	2698000	Human common sense enables you to relate them.
2698000	2703000	The map enables you to cope because it represents the lie of the land.
2703000	2708000	If it didn't represent the lie of the land, it would be a miracle that it's enabled you to cope.
2708000	2715000	The map says the way it represents it is, again, given by minimalism.
2715000	2719000	There'll be cliffs at point X if and only if the map says that they're cliffs at point X.
2719000	2722000	That's what it is for it to be a good map.
2722000	2727000	And you'll cope by expecting cliffs at point X better if you use the map
2727000	2733000	than if, for example, you form the belief that there are or are not cliffs there
2733000	2735000	in some random way.
2735000	2739000	The map increases your chance of getting that sort of thing right.
2739000	2744000	Well, those are very harmless platitudes about the representational properties of a map.
2744000	2750000	But I think they can actually be generalized to the representational properties of language in general.
2750000	2756000	What they do is tie the notion of representation to that of explanation,
2756000	2762000	partly to that of response, as in causal cases, but partly to that of representation.
2762000	2767000	My own favorite way, or it's only one way, I think, amongst many of cementing that relationship,
2767000	2776000	would be to give something like what Frank Ramsey, the great early 20th century Cambridge philosopher,
2776000	2780000	presented as a success semantics. That's a later title.
2780000	2782000	He didn't call it success semantics.
2782000	2789000	But the idea is that you can certify the representational power of a piece of vocabulary
2789000	2793000	or a symbol on a map or anything else.
2793000	2798000	If you can say that there's a convention or habit of acting upon it,
2798000	2801000	either in a single person or in a society,
2801000	2807000	and the explanation of the success of people who so act upon it is,
2807000	2812000	and then you'd discote and point to whatever is represented.
2812000	2815000	Let me give an example.
2815000	2824000	Suppose the map has a little symbol of a church at a certain point on the map,
2824000	2833000	and I say that symbol represents there being a church in little gidding, let's say, a village or something.
2833000	2840000	The idea behind a success semantics is that the representational property of that symbol on the map
2840000	2844000	is, as it were certified, or perhaps it could be analyzed, if you like, analysis,
2844000	2849000	into the idea that people acting upon that representation,
2849000	2853000	people acting upon the fact of that symbol being at that place on that map,
2853000	2857000	are typically successful in their actions when they are,
2857000	2861000	because of something about the place of the church.
2861000	2867000	That is, I go to the world and say that's why people who so act are successful.
2867000	2873000	And that's what it is for the symbol on the map to express the place of the church.
2873000	2878000	Now, I think such thoughts have a lot of steam in them and they've got a long way to go.
2878000	2883000	You can tie them to adaptationist evolutionary explanations of the arrival of symbolism,
2883000	2888000	or you can keep them free of that, they don't have to be tied into a teliosemantics,
2888000	2891000	but they can fit in well with it.
2891000	2895000	My point this afternoon isn't to try and defend such a semantics,
2895000	2899000	but it actually has quite interesting repercussions for issues about debates
2899000	2903000	about normativity and the reality of moral properties,
2903000	2907000	but I'll leave those and go into them in the discussion period.
2907000	2910000	My point this afternoon isn't to defend such a view.
2910000	2915000	My point is to say that it's a perfectly naturalized, non-transcendental way
2915000	2922000	of trying to bring together the space of causes and the space of reasons.
2922000	2927000	We're just trying to see concepts and reasoning as integrated
2927000	2930000	with the idea of ourselves as embodied creatures,
2930000	2937000	whose essential way of being is acting in a physical space which surrounds us.
2937000	2942000	And that, I think, is what a lot of postmodernism forgets.
2942000	2950000	Davidson, I think, went wrong by wondering what justifies a belief.
2950000	2954000	Now, first of all, he asked it as a very abstract question,
2954000	2956000	what justifies a belief?
2956000	2959000	Then you get an answer, another belief or something like that.
2959000	2963000	I think that's as bad as Pilate's question, what is truth?
2963000	2968000	If you want to know what justifies a belief, the right answer is which belief?
2968000	2972000	You tell me which belief you have, I'll tell you what I can about what would justify it
2972000	2974000	or what does justify it.
2974000	2979000	What I tell you may not be sufficient, but then we'll have to argue it case by case.
2979000	2986000	There's no general solution to the question of what justifies a belief.
2986000	2992000	And eventually, given the way we are, what justifies our beliefs is going to have to be,
2992000	2995000	have to relate to our embodiment in the world.
2995000	3000000	In saying that, incidentally, I find myself very close to some of the things
3000000	3003000	that John McDowell says in his book, Mind and World.
3003000	3007000	It's just that I think that the way that John works them out
3007000	3012000	is not actually correct in detail.
3012000	3016000	So we're not going to agree with the great postmodernist slogan
3016000	3020000	made famous by Jacques Derrida in the Apadao text.
3020000	3024000	There is plenty outside the text.
3024000	3027000	And I think learning that there's plenty outside the text
3027000	3031000	is actually a lesson we could have derived from Wittgenstein.
3031000	3036000	I think if you remember Wittgenstein, the emphasis throughout the later philosophy
3036000	3039000	is on our activities in the world.
3039000	3041000	And it's precisely our activities in the world,
3041000	3046000	which I think enable us to get away from the separation of mind from world,
3046000	3052000	which gave us the Rortian difficulties.
3052000	3056000	So none of that makes epistemology a walkover.
3056000	3061000	It doesn't enable us to turn the clock back to undo everything in cellars,
3061000	3064000	to undo everything in crime, to undo everything in Wittgenstein,
3064000	3066000	to undo everything in Kuhn.
3066000	3070000	It doesn't stop you, if you want to be paranoid,
3070000	3075000	from agreeing with the royal butler that there are dark forces at work
3075000	3077000	of which we know nothing.
3077000	3080000	And of course often, especially in moral and social and political contexts,
3080000	3083000	that's not a bad thing to worry about.
3083000	3087000	So I'm not being a Pollyanna here.
3087000	3092000	I'm not more optimistic about what James called the human serpent
3092000	3095000	than I think it deserves.
3095000	3099000	But what I am optimistic about is the possibility of a philosophy
3099000	3103000	which reintegrates truth and mind and world,
3103000	3108000	and which enables us to take off the postmodernist inverted commas
3108000	3115000	so we can talk without blushing of truth, reality, objectivity, reason, experience.
3115000	3117000	We might even talk about foundations,
3117000	3121000	although that I think would be the topic for another talk.
3121000	3123000	Well, thank you very much.
