Processing Overview for Joint Mathematics Meetings
============================
Checking Joint Mathematics Meetings/Terence Tao, ＂Machine Assisted Proof＂.txt
1. **Complex Projects**: Large language models and AI-assisted theorem provers can break down complex projects into smaller, more manageable pieces that individual humans or teams can work on independently.

2. **Human Intuition and AI**: While AI can generate ideas that resemble human intuition at a low level, it is not yet capable of discerning good ideas from bad ones without human guidance. Human intuition in the broader sense for coming up with proof concepts is unlikely to be automated in the near future.

3. **Formalization**: The process of formalizing proofs is still significantly slower than doing it by hand, but this gap is expected to close as technology advances. The ratio of time taken to formalize vs. doing it by hand could drop below one, meaning it could become faster to formalize proofs with AI assistance.

4. **Human-Understandable Proofs**: Even if a proof is initially generated by an AI in an incomprehensible form, humans can analyze and extract human-understandable proofs from it.

5. **Collaboration Structure**: The need for clear blueprints or structures in proofs is more for the benefit of human collaboration rather than the AI itself. It helps coordinate teams of people working on the same project by breaking down complex problems into smaller, self-contained tasks. This approach mirrors divisional labor in modern industries like factories.

6. **Future Outlook**: There's an expectation that AI will become increasingly adept at generating latex and Lean code for proofs, potentially even checking human work as a part of the process.

7. **Q&A Session**: The session concluded with an invitation to the audience to continue their questions in room 204, followed by thanks to Terry for the presentation.
