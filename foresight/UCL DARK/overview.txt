Checking UCL DARK/Sam Gershman - Using Video Games To Reverse Engineer Human Intelligence @ UCL DARK.txt
1. **Human-like Video Game Learning**: The presentation argues that human-like learning in video games involves building theories and using object-oriented relational representations, which are more efficient than just pattern recognition. Humans and theory-based reinforcement learning agents outperform deep Q networks (DQN) in playing games like "Frostbite" because they focus on relevant objects and interactions, while DQN tends to explore aimlessly.

2. **Theory-Based Reinforcement Learning**: The presentation suggests that a theory-based reinforcement learning agent, equipped with a proper description language for games, can play video games in a human-like manner, not just in terms of score but also in the way they approach and interact with the game environment.

3. **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**: The discussion emphasizes the importance of model-based reinforcement learning, which involves understanding the environment's dynamics to make informed decisions about future actions. This is contrasted with model-free methods like DQN, which do not explicitly consider the environment's model.

4. **Deep Learning and Scalability**: The presentation highlights that while theory-based approaches are promising, they need to be made scalable using deep learning techniques. Deep learning can enhance various aspects of the system, including pixel-to-symbol mappings, neural program search, and value approximation.

5. **Future Directions**: The presenter believes that integrating deep learning with theory-based reinforcement learning is crucial for advancing the field and making these approaches more practical for complex tasks. This could potentially lead to systems that can learn efficiently from high-dimensional data in a way that mimics human cognition.

6. **Conclusion**: The presentation concludes that to truly understand and replicate human-like learning in video games, we need to move beyond simple tabular representations and embrace more complex, theory-based models that can be made efficient with the help of deep learning. This approach could lead to systems that not only match human performance but also learn in ways that are similar to how humans do.
