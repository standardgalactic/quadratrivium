00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
How do we describe our prevailing economic system? It's quite interesting this because

00:05.280 --> 00:10.000
one of the facets particularly of British political debate is this kind of eye-rolling

00:10.000 --> 00:15.600
anti-intellectualism, I suppose, that if you try and describe the system in which we live,

00:15.600 --> 00:20.000
how it works, how it operates, you get this particularly within the British media who don't

00:20.000 --> 00:24.320
particularly like talking about ideas, which I would say helps protect the status quo.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.600
If you talk about this word beginning with N, neoliberalism, the eye-rolling starts.

00:29.600 --> 00:36.320
Oh, what is neoliberalism? It's not a thing. This is just some pretentious set of jargon

00:36.320 --> 00:42.720
that you devious leftists have come up with. So, given that nonsense, I'm particularly delighted

00:42.720 --> 00:47.440
to be joined by the incredible George Monbiot, who is one of our finest living journalists,

00:47.440 --> 00:52.640
and he's written this brilliant book with Peter Hutchison, who will talk about this.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.120
They've never met. This is brilliant. It's a book called The Secret History of Neoliberalism

00:57.120 --> 01:02.000
and How It Came to Control Your Life. Hello, George. How are you doing?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.520
Hello. Yeah, great. I'm lovely to talk to you.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.960
That's very lovely to talk to you always. Firstly, yeah, I'm just quite amused by the fact

01:10.960 --> 01:14.080
you've never met. Can you just explain? People might be listening. You've written a book with

01:14.080 --> 01:16.240
someone you've never met. It's fun. That's a fun idea. I like it.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.400
So, Peter is a filmmaker. He lives in California, as a lot of filmmakers do. I don't fly.

01:22.960 --> 01:29.200
So, the whole collaboration has been done remotely. It started off with him approaching me saying,

01:29.200 --> 01:34.000
could we make a film together about neoliberalism? Because this is something I've been writing about

01:34.000 --> 01:41.600
for, well, lots and lots of years, and trying to document, trying to pin down, trying to show

01:42.240 --> 01:48.640
exactly what the great majority of people have been missing and how we've been so thoroughly

01:48.640 --> 01:53.360
stitched up and also what we can do about it. And he said, look, this will make a great film.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.480
He made films like Rookquiem for the American Dream with Noam Chomsky, for instance, and

01:59.200 --> 02:05.760
it's a film in that sort of mold. And so, we agreed to do that. And we did all that remotely,

02:05.760 --> 02:12.560
where he got a remote camera operator in Britain to film me, and he directed down the line.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.960
And then he said, look, this will make a great book. We should do this together.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.840
And so, we just went ahead on the same principles. And it's been really amazing

02:23.840 --> 02:29.200
collaborating with a filmmaker, because what you've got there is a very, very tight editor with a

02:29.200 --> 02:36.320
very strong visual sense. And so, he really, he sort of gave the book its structure and its

02:36.320 --> 02:44.240
thrust, a lot of its pace, I think. And it's turned into a very short and terse and size book,

02:45.120 --> 02:51.440
whose aim really is to be understood by anyone. We're keeping it really simple,

02:53.600 --> 03:01.280
trying to just write it almost as if we were making a film. And with his influence and his sort

03:01.280 --> 03:07.840
of driving force behind this, I think we've succeeded in that and created something which is

03:08.800 --> 03:14.640
really readable and takes this extremely important subject to potentially a wider

03:14.640 --> 03:18.960
audience. I mean, there must have been a hundred books published on neoliberalism and some really

03:18.960 --> 03:26.560
great books, but most of them are this thick and very difficult to get through. So, we're

03:26.560 --> 03:31.120
trying to do the opposite. I think more than succeeded. It really is a riveting read. Look

03:31.120 --> 03:35.680
very, very pacey. It is like a film. And I think you're right. I think a lot of people,

03:35.680 --> 03:38.320
they're interested maybe in the idea of neoliberalism, but they probably find it a bit

03:38.320 --> 03:43.360
intimidating, particularly if they see a dense tone. But this really explains it very, very

03:43.360 --> 03:48.160
effectively indeed. So, just what the hell is neoliberalism? Because, you know, we've been,

03:48.160 --> 03:51.680
you've been in this game longer than I have, but you know the eye-rolling I'm talking about,

03:51.680 --> 03:56.800
you talk about neoliberalism. And you say, you know, in the Soviet Union, if the idea,

03:56.800 --> 04:01.440
if you couldn't describe the ideology that ruled us, and I suppose it benefits them to pretend

04:01.440 --> 04:04.960
there is no ideology, it's just what works. This is just a dynamic system. So, what is

04:05.040 --> 04:11.520
neoliberalism? It's much of a dominant ideology in our society as communism was in the Soviet

04:11.520 --> 04:17.040
Union. And as you say, it's just crazy that most people either aren't aware of it at all,

04:17.040 --> 04:24.080
or are incapable of defining it, or as you say, just dismiss it. If there's no such thing,

04:24.080 --> 04:29.520
you're just making this up. This is a boo word. This is a conspiracy fiction, whatever. And they'll

04:29.520 --> 04:34.960
throw anything they want at you to try to prevent people from getting to grips with,

04:34.960 --> 04:41.120
with what we're seeing here. And neoliberalism is an ideology whose name was given to it by

04:41.120 --> 04:47.600
the original ideologues, people like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, and others who

04:47.600 --> 04:56.000
originally met in 1938, to help capitalism solve its greatest problem. Capitalism's greatest problem,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.520
which it is always seeking to solve, is called democracy. And capitalism was getting along

05:01.520 --> 05:07.760
just fine before most adults led the vote. And when most adults led the vote, they started

05:07.760 --> 05:12.880
using it to say, well, you know, we don't want to be exploited. We don't want our labor captured

05:12.880 --> 05:19.520
and all the value pulled out of it and given to someone else. We don't want to be treated as

05:19.520 --> 05:25.440
modern serfs. We don't want our rivers polluted. We don't want our air polluted. We want to live

05:25.440 --> 05:30.560
in decent housing. In fact, we'd like publicly funded services as well. In fact, we'd also like a

05:30.560 --> 05:37.280
welfare state and economic safety net, all these things which are inimical to raw capitalism.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.880
And ever since then, capitalism has been trying to fix this problem. And it wasn't

05:44.880 --> 05:51.600
particularly good at it. But neoliberalism has given it the solution. And it's now become extremely

05:51.600 --> 05:58.000
good at fixing this problem and indeed at surviving and expanding even within the

05:58.000 --> 06:04.880
nominally democratic era. I mean, before talking about today, because you look through the history

06:04.880 --> 06:09.360
of how this develops. And I really, I find it fascinating back in, if we go back to the aftermath

06:09.360 --> 06:14.080
of World War II, when if you believed in what is now the central tennis of neoliberalism,

06:14.080 --> 06:19.840
it was a bleak moment. And it seemed as though laissez-faire capitalism was buried, you know,

06:19.920 --> 06:25.680
the experience of the Great Depression and then a genocide or war which tens of millions

06:25.680 --> 06:29.760
killed. And you couldn't really separate the two because fascism really exploited the despair

06:29.760 --> 06:36.240
that emerged, of course, because of the collapse, the effects of that system. And they met in a

06:36.240 --> 06:42.000
sleepy Swiss town on Pelerin to organize these economists. But I mean, at the time, they felt

06:42.000 --> 06:47.040
defeated. They were like, we're lost. And it's quite interesting what happens then because

06:47.840 --> 06:51.760
Milton Friedman says, the way you get changes through a crisis, but it depends on the ideas

06:51.760 --> 06:55.280
lying around. So they kind of, they had a don't mourn organized approach, didn't they really?

06:55.280 --> 07:00.720
But they didn't have collective power. As we would appeal to, they had very rich people who could

07:01.360 --> 07:07.440
bank from what's exactly right. Even so, there's a lot to learn from this movement and how it

07:07.440 --> 07:13.120
operated. There's a lot of strategy which we on the left can pick up and use quite effectively.

07:13.360 --> 07:19.440
And, you know, we have to understand how they organized, how they got together. So to begin

07:19.440 --> 07:25.680
with, they start to formulate an ideology, a coherent ideology, one which we can reasonably

07:25.680 --> 07:33.360
argue with, but, you know, it had the virtue of coherence and clarity. And effectively, as

07:33.360 --> 07:40.720
Haya Con von Mises conceived it, any form of collectivism would lead inevitably towards

07:40.720 --> 07:44.960
totalitarianism. It was one great slippery slump fallacy of that, if you're saying that,

07:44.960 --> 07:49.920
if you have a welfare state, if you have publicly funded services, you will end up with Stalin or

07:49.920 --> 07:58.400
Hitler. It's a historical inevitability that that's the way it's going to go. So we have to sweep

07:58.400 --> 08:05.600
the enabling state and all other impediments to capital out of the way to prevent us from ending

08:05.600 --> 08:10.960
up with totalitarianism. I mean, it was a hopefully staggeringly mistaken argument.

08:11.920 --> 08:18.640
But the sort of theoretical justification that they created was that there is a natural order

08:18.640 --> 08:24.560
of human life. There are the worthy people and there are the unworthy people. And the worthy

08:24.560 --> 08:31.360
people deserve what they get and the unworthy people deserve what they get as well. And what

08:31.360 --> 08:37.600
they get is distributed to them by this godlike force of the invisible hand of the market. It's

08:37.600 --> 08:46.240
a very Calvinist approach, effectively. It's basically Calvinism done by Eglomis. And this

08:46.240 --> 08:52.800
godlike force of the invisible hand, if all impediments are stripped away, we'll point to

08:53.440 --> 08:58.960
those who have the grunts of the invisible hand and we'll point to those who do not. And we can

08:58.960 --> 09:03.120
tell who the worthy are because they're going to be rich and we can tell who the unworthy are

09:03.120 --> 09:09.760
because they're going to be poor. And anything which inhibits the discovery of that natural order,

09:10.320 --> 09:17.600
such as taxation and redistribution, such as regulation, such as trade unions,

09:17.600 --> 09:22.960
such as protesters, such as, as we later discovered with them, political choice itself,

09:23.760 --> 09:31.200
inhibits the progress of humankind because that progress depends upon inequality. It depends upon

09:31.200 --> 09:37.120
the discovery of the natural order. It depends upon some people being as rich as they can ever

09:37.120 --> 09:43.200
become and other people remaining poor. And yet, at the heart of it, because it has to try to sell

09:43.200 --> 09:48.720
itself to the public, there's this massive contradiction which says that if some people

09:48.720 --> 09:53.120
are allowed to become tremendously rich, their wealth will trickle down and then everyone will

09:53.120 --> 09:57.760
become tremendously rich. And you say, now hang on a moment, I thought we were meant to have a

09:57.760 --> 10:02.720
distinction here between the very rich who deserve it and the very poor who don't. But it's just the

10:02.720 --> 10:09.200
first of a series of intensive contradictions within neoliberalism. Now, many people at the time

10:09.840 --> 10:15.680
saw this not just as a highly irrational and contradictory ideology, but also as an obscene

10:15.680 --> 10:25.440
one, one which was destined to return us to the worst excesses of capitalism slash feudalism slash

10:25.440 --> 10:32.160
erontia economy. And so, while the books sell quite well, because a lot of powerful interest

10:32.160 --> 10:40.560
got behind them and extracted by reader's digest in Hayek's case, put out to every worker at General

10:40.560 --> 10:47.280
Motors by the management, for example, the ideas remain very unpopular, except with one

10:47.280 --> 10:52.000
particular class of people who were the richest people on earth. And it was literally the richest

10:52.000 --> 10:58.880
people and corporations on earth got together and poured billions into this project and created

10:58.880 --> 11:06.160
what has been described as a neoliberal interdimensional, a global network of think tanks

11:06.160 --> 11:13.520
in particular, which are the 18th dogs of neoliberalism, these dark money lobby groups such as the

11:13.520 --> 11:21.760
Tufton Street junctings, academic institutions, such as in Chicago, Virginia, and many other places,

11:22.640 --> 11:30.720
tame journalists, tame government officials, and tame politicians. And by pouring money into this

11:30.720 --> 11:37.760
and by firing some very clever people to sell these outrageous ideas and to make them sound like

11:37.760 --> 11:45.040
common sense, they began to develop momentum. But even so, they knew they were in it for the long

11:45.040 --> 11:53.280
game. And as Milton Friedman, who you mentioned, said, you know, we waited. And when the time came,

11:53.840 --> 11:56.480
we were ready. And we could step right in.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.440
I mean, I really like firstly, the way that discussion of how

12:02.800 --> 12:05.760
neoliberalism helps rationalize and justify inequalities, whenever I wrote Charles the

12:05.760 --> 12:10.480
demonization working class a long time ago, 12 years ago, whatever, or 13 years ago, I said,

12:10.480 --> 12:14.720
demonization is the ideological backbone of an unequal society, because you have to

12:15.840 --> 12:19.840
inequality is so perverse, if you think about it long enough, but if you say this is just

12:19.840 --> 12:23.360
desserts, they're at the bottom because they're lazy, they're at the top because they work hard.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.760
And in terms of just that neoliberal international, those think tanks and all the rest,

12:27.760 --> 12:30.560
I think it's really fascinating. One thing I'm really interested in is you talk about,

12:31.360 --> 12:38.400
I guess, what it does to us. And, you know, often defenders of these ideas will often try and

12:38.400 --> 12:43.120
talk about human nature, and other than the fact we're social animals, who depend on cooperation

12:43.120 --> 12:48.080
innately, you know, I don't think that's there's much biological mileage in that we're infinitely

12:48.080 --> 12:53.280
malleable. But, but we can be changed, there's no question. And Margaret Thatcher famously said

12:53.280 --> 12:58.720
in 1981, economics are the method, the object is to change the heart and soul. So I'm just

12:58.720 --> 13:03.840
interested in what neoliberalism, what you talk about how what it's done to us, as people, and

13:03.840 --> 13:09.040
how this is not kind of an innate human nature thing, which is. So, so, so at the start of

13:09.040 --> 13:14.080
neoliberal ideology is this Hobbesian idea that we are fundamentally selfish and greedy.

13:15.040 --> 13:20.560
But they twist this to say, that's a good thing. We should mobilise this selfishness and greed.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.680
And by mobilising it, the rich get richer, and that trickles down and enriches everyone.

13:26.480 --> 13:31.120
So that the undeserving poor, oh, hang on a moment, they get some money too. Oh, well, never mind

13:31.120 --> 13:37.120
all of them. So, but the idea is that, you know, we are, we are the sort of homo economicus,

13:37.200 --> 13:44.240
self maximising creature, which is entirely motivated by transactional considerations,

13:44.240 --> 13:52.000
by instrumental drivers. But actually, all the evidence across social psychology,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.560
across neuroscience, across anthropology, and several other disciplines shows us that that's

13:56.560 --> 14:03.280
simply not true. We all have some selfishness and greed in this, absolutely. But those are not

14:03.520 --> 14:07.840
primary values. Those are not the dominant values for the great majority of people, the dominant

14:07.840 --> 14:15.360
values are empathy, altruism, family feeling, community feeling, the wish for a better world,

14:15.360 --> 14:22.640
not just for yourself, but also for other people. And yet we've been instilled in this notion

14:23.280 --> 14:29.840
that we are these greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. And that's reinforced by

14:29.840 --> 14:36.160
the fact that those who come to dominate us, particularly in the neoliberal, you tend to be

14:36.160 --> 14:40.960
greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. I need to put it crudely, we are a society of

14:40.960 --> 14:48.640
altruists, governed by psychopaths. And so that's one of the forces which sort of greatly misleads us

14:48.640 --> 14:54.320
about who we are and where we stand. But another one is as you alluded to, and talking about your

14:54.320 --> 15:01.280
brilliant book, Chaps, is this finger of blame. So just as a rich are told by neoliberalism,

15:01.280 --> 15:06.640
you are rich because you're brilliant, regardless of whether you inherited your money, you stole

15:06.640 --> 15:12.640
your money, regardless of your advantages of education, of class, of race, or whatever

15:13.600 --> 15:18.400
that you start off with, you know, you might start in your 100 meter race at 90 meters,

15:19.200 --> 15:25.600
90 meters down the track. But it's still all down to you that you've become so rich is this

15:25.600 --> 15:32.400
self attribution fallacy is at the heart of neoliberalism. But just as a rich are congratulated

15:32.400 --> 15:37.600
for their wealth, the poor are blamed for their poverty. And if you're poor, it's because you're

15:37.600 --> 15:44.560
unenterprising, it's because you're feckless. If your kid is fat, it's not because corporations

15:44.560 --> 15:49.520
are pushing junk food and the school is sold off, it's playing fields, it's because you're a bad

15:49.520 --> 15:58.320
parent. You're constantly sort of urged to internalize this notion of blame. And structural

15:59.040 --> 16:05.040
failure, systemic failure, these things are simply denied. They're simply airbrushed out

16:05.040 --> 16:11.280
of the picture. It's all about the individual. And another of Thatcher's famous quotes, of course,

16:11.280 --> 16:17.680
was that people talk about society, there is no such thing. There are men and women and their

16:17.680 --> 16:23.520
families, which kind of was a manifesto. That's how she wanted it. The whole thrust of neoliberalism

16:23.520 --> 16:30.560
and the way by which capitalism defeats democracy is to atomize in rule, is to tell us you're not

16:30.560 --> 16:35.440
citizens, you're consumers. And if you want change, just sit at home and buy a better brand of biscuits,

16:36.320 --> 16:39.680
which, of course, as we know, changes decisively nothing.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.040
Back in 2008, there was the grand financial crash. And we still live in the shadow of that

16:47.040 --> 16:51.680
financial crash. And I think a lot of people at the time, not even just on the left, I mean,

16:51.680 --> 16:55.440
the left was very fragmented. I think this is actually maybe partly answers the point with

16:55.440 --> 16:59.920
the Milton Friedman point about when you have a crisis, what it depends on the ideas lying around

16:59.920 --> 17:03.600
and I suppose balance of forces. But nonetheless, a lot of people at the time thought, wow, well,

17:03.680 --> 17:06.640
this is it for neoliberalism. There's not going to recover from this. Look at it.

17:08.160 --> 17:14.000
We can see what's happened with untrammeled free markets, greed, markets out of control.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.160
It's caused a catastrophe. It hasn't quite panned out, perhaps, as some of us might have hoped,

17:20.160 --> 17:27.200
from that rubble. And in fact, what we saw instead, Britain and elsewhere, was a doubling down on

17:27.200 --> 17:32.160
austerity rollback of the state. So a crisis of the private sector became a crisis of the public

17:32.240 --> 17:37.200
sector. It was state spending, which had caused the mess, not the markets out of control.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.440
What the hell is going on there? How have we ended up just in constant crisis in this economic

17:41.440 --> 17:47.680
system? And I'll be honest, George, looking at it still here. Yeah, no, it is. And it keeps failing.

17:47.680 --> 17:54.000
I mean, look at Liz Truss. She was the uber neoliberal. She just did it by the book. Here's

17:54.000 --> 17:59.680
what neoliberalism tells us will create tremendous wealth and success and prosperity. And we all

17:59.680 --> 18:06.400
saw the instant results. You know, it took one day for her mini budget to completely collapse and

18:06.400 --> 18:12.240
bring down many things with it and cause even greater suffering to the people of this country.

18:12.240 --> 18:19.680
So it keeps on failing and failing spectacularly, but it keeps on walking. It is the zombie doctrine.

18:19.680 --> 18:26.400
So why? Why is this? And I think it's because neoliberalism is something that we don't have.

18:27.120 --> 18:33.040
And that's something is a story, a particular kind of story. So it's our contention that

18:34.160 --> 18:41.760
political and religious change across millennia has always been accompanied by a particular

18:41.760 --> 18:49.520
narrative structure, which enables and empowers that change to happen. And there are many basic

18:49.520 --> 18:54.080
plots. Well, some people say there's just a few and some people say there's a lot. But anyway,

18:54.080 --> 18:59.440
one of them is always this basic plot, which is what I call the restoration story,

18:59.440 --> 19:05.840
which goes like this. Disorder reflects the land caused by powerful and nefarious people working

19:05.840 --> 19:11.360
against the interests of humanity. But the hero or heroes will confront that disorder

19:11.920 --> 19:17.600
against the odds overthrow those powerful and nefarious forces and restore harmony to the

19:17.600 --> 19:25.520
lalent. And that's the story Marx tells. It's a story that Keynes tells. It was a story that

19:25.520 --> 19:32.640
Marxism flashes told. And it's a story which perhaps for the first time ever quite consciously

19:32.640 --> 19:39.360
and deliberately, the neoliberals told, we understood the power of that narrative structure.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.600
And of course, you can slot into that narrative structure, whatever you want. So Keynes would

19:43.600 --> 19:54.320
say, you know, the powerful and nefarious forces were unsammled capitalists. And the hero of the

19:54.320 --> 20:00.240
story was the enabling state backed by the middle and working classes. And the neoliberals turned

20:00.240 --> 20:06.560
that exactly the other way around. The villain is the enabling state. And the hero is the

20:06.560 --> 20:15.920
entrepreneur fighting for freedom against this totalizing elective state, which is the great

20:15.920 --> 20:20.560
demon that has caused so much disorder. But the neoliberals, you know, they were very clever in

20:20.560 --> 20:28.960
saying, this is how the human mind works. This is what attracts us. This is what tells us who we are

20:28.960 --> 20:33.920
and where we stand, where we're going and what we're going to find when we get there. It is a

20:34.000 --> 20:39.280
story. And the story overrides everything. It doesn't matter how much data you've got. It

20:39.280 --> 20:45.040
doesn't matter how good your arguments are. It doesn't matter how consistent and rational they are.

20:45.040 --> 20:50.960
They can be completely inconsistent and rational and frankly bonkers, as some of the neoliberal

20:50.960 --> 20:57.040
tracks like Hayek's later book, The Constitution of Liberty are. But if there's a simple and

20:57.280 --> 21:04.240
coherent story that stitches it all together, that is what counts. Now, you know, when

21:05.600 --> 21:12.240
after the Great Depression, Hayek sat down and wrote what is in effect a restoration story

21:12.240 --> 21:17.840
through his general theory and further writings. And he did it sort of instinctively, or so it

21:17.840 --> 21:23.840
seems to me. But of course, he did understand narrative. He was connected with a lot of writers

21:24.800 --> 21:31.200
and he did it very well. And then when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the late 1970s, the

21:31.200 --> 21:36.400
neoliberals had been quite consciously and deliberately polishing this restoration story

21:36.400 --> 21:41.680
of their own. And as Friedman said, they could step straight in and tell that story. This is

21:41.680 --> 21:47.360
what's gone wrong. Here is where you stand. This is what we're going to do to get you out of it

21:47.360 --> 21:54.480
and get you to this promised land. And then when neoliberalism collapsed in 2008, we stepped forward

21:54.480 --> 22:01.280
with nothing. We had no new story. We had lots of brilliant ideas, lots of fantastic policies,

22:01.280 --> 22:07.520
lots of amazing schemes for doing this and for doing that and the rest of it. But we

22:07.520 --> 22:13.200
hadn't brought them together into a coherent narrative structure. And so people couldn't

22:13.200 --> 22:18.000
really hear what we were saying. It's a bit like trying to make a tapestry without a loom.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.040
You've got lots of amazing coloured threads. But where's the picture? Where is that a great big

22:25.040 --> 22:29.680
hanging where people can say, oh yeah, there's me in the picture. I can see myself there as part of

22:29.680 --> 22:38.080
this criminal. Unless you pull it all together into a coherent story, you can't reach across to people

22:38.080 --> 22:45.840
and you can't say, here is the answer. Before I ask, just in terms of, I like to always end on an

22:45.840 --> 22:50.560
optimistic note, given the world of which living, we've got ample material there, haven't we?

22:52.000 --> 22:58.640
It is just before I just lean into the bleakness first. At the moment, you can see and you talk

22:58.640 --> 23:03.760
about these right-wing authoritarian movements. We can look at the likes of the Bolsonaro's,

23:03.760 --> 23:11.520
obviously defeated, fortunately, but Bolsonaro is a moe, lives on. The Modi's, obviously there's

23:11.520 --> 23:16.160
entirely plausible Trump could become president. And to be honest, if you'd sped 10 years ago

23:16.160 --> 23:19.520
about the prospects of civil war in the United States, people think you're pretty wacky, but you

23:19.520 --> 23:26.000
can't rule out. The threat to democracy, however caveated US democracy happens to be right now,

23:26.000 --> 23:32.560
is real. And we can see across Europe the rise of, we've got Orban in Hungary, we've got all sorts

23:32.640 --> 23:36.400
of very unpleasant. You might look at this and think the likes are going out. How do you link

23:36.400 --> 23:44.000
these movements to neoliberalism? And are these morbid symptoms? How do you kind of analyse them?

23:44.880 --> 23:50.160
So one thing neoliberalism does is to create state failure. It's failure by design. The state is not

23:50.160 --> 23:55.200
supposed to work. I mean, the state is very powerful under neoliberalism because what makes it different

23:55.200 --> 24:02.480
from laissez-faire economics or classical liberalism, as it's sometimes called, is that it uses the

24:02.480 --> 24:08.160
state as a battering room deliberately to push democracy out of the way, to push trade unions,

24:08.160 --> 24:18.000
protesters, political choice, the administrative state out of the way through this often extreme

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
force. And then it leaves us, as Tony Judd pointed out in his last book, Il Faire's The Land,

24:24.720 --> 24:32.080
just with this authoritarian core, which, and all the state then has to offer us,

24:32.080 --> 24:40.960
is the demand for obedience and punishment if we step out of line. And so as neoliberalism

24:40.960 --> 24:46.000
captures parties across the political spectrum, which unfortunately we've also seen here in

24:46.000 --> 24:55.280
the UK for 45 years, and boy is it continuing, we end with A, a state which is unable to solve our

24:55.280 --> 25:02.000
problems and B, a lack of political choice, which is kind of ironic because neoliberalism is supposed

25:02.000 --> 25:06.080
to be all about choice, but as Margaret Thatcher kept saying, there is no alternative. You've

25:06.080 --> 25:14.000
got a full and free choice and there is no alternative. And we end up with a complete

25:14.000 --> 25:20.880
disillusionment with politics as usual. And then that creates an opening for the Orban's and the

25:20.880 --> 25:27.760
Trump's and the Netanyahu's and the Modi's and these other killer clowns, who then move into

25:27.760 --> 25:34.880
that vacuum and say, we stand apart from politics, we're the anti-politics people. We're not immersed

25:34.880 --> 25:41.760
in all that elite chatter going on above your heads. We are genuinely connected to you and they

25:41.760 --> 25:51.760
prove that connection by speaking in very simplistic and direct terms. And so they present themselves

25:51.760 --> 25:57.280
as the solution to the crises which have been caused by neoliberalism. But of course as soon as

25:57.280 --> 26:04.560
they get in, they massively ramp up all of those crises, the crises of corruption, of nepotism,

26:04.560 --> 26:10.880
of the sale of state assets, of the complete failure to meet the needs of the poor, of the

26:11.680 --> 26:15.520
massively escalating inequality, which always follows in their wake.

26:17.920 --> 26:25.040
Depressing, but there is always hope. You've been speaking about what you described here,

26:25.040 --> 26:31.520
again, as private sufficiency, public luxury for a long time. So in terms of you, and you know,

26:31.520 --> 26:34.800
this is important too because we can't obviously not, given I'm talking to you about the climate

26:34.800 --> 26:40.720
emergency as well and the obvious existential threat to humanity and a profit-driven system

26:40.720 --> 26:46.240
which prioritises profit over the futures of our last species, bigger problem. But how do you see

26:46.240 --> 26:50.080
that way forward? How do you sketch out this hopeful alternative to what we see there which is,

26:50.080 --> 26:55.920
as we discussed, right wing authoritarian movements which exploit the phase of neoliberalism and then

26:55.920 --> 27:02.160
double down on the very problems which they exploited? So most of the time, I think to most

27:02.160 --> 27:07.600
people, despair seems like the rational option. This is the obvious thing to do in a situation

27:07.600 --> 27:13.360
like this is to despair. Where's the hope? How can we possibly get out of this horrendous mess?

27:14.080 --> 27:20.960
But I think despair is the irrational response to this because despair is what people feel

27:20.960 --> 27:28.080
when they wrongly conceive society as a simple system. Now, one of the greatest failings of

27:28.080 --> 27:33.840
our education is that we are never, a great majority of people are never taught the principles of

27:33.840 --> 27:38.960
complex systems. Everything important to us is a complex system, the human brain, the human body,

27:38.960 --> 27:45.600
human society, the financial system, the economic system, every ecosystem, the atmosphere, the oceans,

27:45.600 --> 27:52.960
ice caps, the rest of it, they're all complex systems. And complex systems have very particular

27:52.960 --> 27:59.440
ways of operating. And they have these emergent adaptive characteristics and they have tipping

27:59.440 --> 28:06.320
points and they can very rapidly flip from one equilibrium state to another. And society is

28:06.320 --> 28:12.160
no different from those other complex systems. Society has two equilibrium states. One is called

28:12.160 --> 28:17.440
impossible and the other is called inevitable. And from the perspective of anything you want to

28:17.440 --> 28:23.200
see happen, it's always impossible. Votes for women, you have to be kidding. Independence for India,

28:23.200 --> 28:29.920
you're off your rocker. Civil rights, an end to apartheid, equal marriage legislation,

28:31.440 --> 28:36.720
sexual liberation, all of these things. But when you're pressing for them, it just seems

28:36.720 --> 28:41.760
impossible. You've got this massive brick wall in front of you, it can't happen. And then it happens

28:41.760 --> 28:46.720
and everyone says, well, that was inevitable, wasn't it? Yeah. And what's happened in this case,

28:46.720 --> 28:55.120
in these cases, is that there's been a tipping point. Now, the marriage equality legislation,

28:55.120 --> 29:02.000
I think it's a very good example of how that change happens. Because it starts as it always

29:02.000 --> 29:07.680
starts. And I think it was brilliantly done, really fantastic campaigning. It was very hard,

29:07.680 --> 29:13.840
it took a very long time. And started in a position where it was regarded as an absolutely

29:13.840 --> 29:18.560
horrific idea. You know, this is going to be the end of civilization, as we know, everyone was

29:18.560 --> 29:25.280
against it. All the religious organizations, nearly all the politicians, all the newspapers,

29:25.280 --> 29:31.280
the whole lot. And you start as you must always start by preaching to the choir. All my life,

29:31.280 --> 29:35.680
I've been told, don't preach to the choir. Sorry, but what else are we ever going to preach to?

29:37.520 --> 29:42.400
You preach some choir, but you make it a little bit bigger every time. You just expand the size

29:42.400 --> 29:47.360
of the choir. It's about concentric circles. And you push it, and you push it, and push it.

29:47.360 --> 29:53.600
Until eventually, you hit that tipping point, which some research suggests is about 25% of people.

29:54.160 --> 29:59.760
This whole sort of Oxford Union approach that, you know, you win an argument and you change

29:59.760 --> 30:05.360
things by persuading the person in the opposite corner. It's just complete nonsense. It's never

30:05.360 --> 30:10.800
worked that way. That is not how political change has ever happened. But because people think that's

30:10.800 --> 30:15.840
how political change happens, they think it can never happen. I will never persuade my grumpy

30:15.840 --> 30:20.480
neighbor who reads a daily mail. No, sorry, you don't have to. Persuasion is massively

30:20.480 --> 30:27.280
overeated as a political force. You persuade the choir, and you mobilize them, and you equip them,

30:27.840 --> 30:32.320
and they persuade a few people around them, and they persuade a few more until you reach that

30:32.960 --> 30:39.840
25% or so of society. And then suddenly, two things happen. One, the dynamics of the complex

30:39.840 --> 30:46.640
system kick in, and you can push it towards the sort of tipping point between those equilibrium

30:46.640 --> 30:52.400
states. But two, because we are the uber social mammal, and our whiskers are always twitching to

30:52.400 --> 30:58.320
see which way the social wind is blowing, we don't want to be left behind. And so you'll suddenly

30:58.320 --> 31:04.560
then have this flip, where it's not that everybody becomes the campaigner for your cause, it's just

31:04.560 --> 31:09.280
the opposition just drops away, because people don't want to feel that they're out of line with

31:09.280 --> 31:16.320
the times. And so what you then find is people who you know adamantly opposed to it say, well,

31:16.320 --> 31:21.680
of course, I've always supported marriage equality. After the war, everyone becomes a member of the

31:21.680 --> 31:29.600
resistance, right? And so you'll see these sort of sudden flips from what seemed to be an impossible

31:29.600 --> 31:38.480
situation to what then looks like an inevitable change. And we can trigger those, we can console

31:39.440 --> 31:45.520
those tippings by telling a powerful restoration story that incorporates our values.

31:47.600 --> 31:52.960
And it's very powerfully done in this book. And that's exactly what this book does. It reaches

31:52.960 --> 31:57.760
people who I think find this whole subject quite intimidating. It's written very beautifully,

31:57.760 --> 32:01.840
lots of clarity, but so much information, very educational, including for people who I think

32:02.160 --> 32:09.520
maybe read lots about neoliberalism. And it's really, even though it's often talking about

32:09.520 --> 32:12.880
very bleak things, it's full of the optimism for the reasons you talk about. It has a very

32:12.880 --> 32:18.720
practical way forward. And that's what we do need to talk about. So make sure you get a copy of

32:18.720 --> 32:22.000
The Invisible Doctrine, The Secret History of Neoliberalism and How It Came to Control Your

32:22.000 --> 32:27.920
Life by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, who is over in California. But they've both done a

32:27.920 --> 32:33.360
brilliant job, even though they've never met at weaving together this wonderful story. So do

32:33.360 --> 32:37.600

32:38.320 --> 32:42.480
leave your comments, love to read your comments. But George, thank you so much,

32:42.480 --> 32:47.520
