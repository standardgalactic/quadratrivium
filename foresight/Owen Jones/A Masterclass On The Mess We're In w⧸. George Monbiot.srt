1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
How do we describe our prevailing economic system? It's quite interesting this because

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,000
one of the facets particularly of British political debate is this kind of eye-rolling

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,600
anti-intellectualism, I suppose, that if you try and describe the system in which we live,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,000
how it works, how it operates, you get this particularly within the British media who don't

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
particularly like talking about ideas, which I would say helps protect the status quo.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,600
If you talk about this word beginning with N, neoliberalism, the eye-rolling starts.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,320
Oh, what is neoliberalism? It's not a thing. This is just some pretentious set of jargon

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,720
that you devious leftists have come up with. So, given that nonsense, I'm particularly delighted

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,440
to be joined by the incredible George Monbiot, who is one of our finest living journalists,

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,640
and he's written this brilliant book with Peter Hutchison, who will talk about this.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
They've never met. This is brilliant. It's a book called The Secret History of Neoliberalism

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,000
and How It Came to Control Your Life. Hello, George. How are you doing?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,520
Hello. Yeah, great. I'm lovely to talk to you.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,960
That's very lovely to talk to you always. Firstly, yeah, I'm just quite amused by the fact

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
you've never met. Can you just explain? People might be listening. You've written a book with

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
someone you've never met. It's fun. That's a fun idea. I like it.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,400
So, Peter is a filmmaker. He lives in California, as a lot of filmmakers do. I don't fly.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,200
So, the whole collaboration has been done remotely. It started off with him approaching me saying,

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
could we make a film together about neoliberalism? Because this is something I've been writing about

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,600
for, well, lots and lots of years, and trying to document, trying to pin down, trying to show

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,640
exactly what the great majority of people have been missing and how we've been so thoroughly

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,360
stitched up and also what we can do about it. And he said, look, this will make a great film.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,480
He made films like Rookquiem for the American Dream with Noam Chomsky, for instance, and

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,760
it's a film in that sort of mold. And so, we agreed to do that. And we did all that remotely,

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,560
where he got a remote camera operator in Britain to film me, and he directed down the line.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
And then he said, look, this will make a great book. We should do this together.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,840
And so, we just went ahead on the same principles. And it's been really amazing

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,200
collaborating with a filmmaker, because what you've got there is a very, very tight editor with a

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,320
very strong visual sense. And so, he really, he sort of gave the book its structure and its

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,240
thrust, a lot of its pace, I think. And it's turned into a very short and terse and size book,

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,440
whose aim really is to be understood by anyone. We're keeping it really simple,

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,280
trying to just write it almost as if we were making a film. And with his influence and his sort

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,840
of driving force behind this, I think we've succeeded in that and created something which is

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,640
really readable and takes this extremely important subject to potentially a wider

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,960
audience. I mean, there must have been a hundred books published on neoliberalism and some really

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,560
great books, but most of them are this thick and very difficult to get through. So, we're

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
trying to do the opposite. I think more than succeeded. It really is a riveting read. Look

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
very, very pacey. It is like a film. And I think you're right. I think a lot of people,

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
they're interested maybe in the idea of neoliberalism, but they probably find it a bit

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,360
intimidating, particularly if they see a dense tone. But this really explains it very, very

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,160
effectively indeed. So, just what the hell is neoliberalism? Because, you know, we've been,

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,680
you've been in this game longer than I have, but you know the eye-rolling I'm talking about,

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,800
you talk about neoliberalism. And you say, you know, in the Soviet Union, if the idea,

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,440
if you couldn't describe the ideology that ruled us, and I suppose it benefits them to pretend

45
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
there is no ideology, it's just what works. This is just a dynamic system. So, what is

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,520
neoliberalism? It's much of a dominant ideology in our society as communism was in the Soviet

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,040
Union. And as you say, it's just crazy that most people either aren't aware of it at all,

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,080
or are incapable of defining it, or as you say, just dismiss it. If there's no such thing,

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,520
you're just making this up. This is a boo word. This is a conspiracy fiction, whatever. And they'll

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,960
throw anything they want at you to try to prevent people from getting to grips with,

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,120
with what we're seeing here. And neoliberalism is an ideology whose name was given to it by

52
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,600
the original ideologues, people like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, and others who

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,000
originally met in 1938, to help capitalism solve its greatest problem. Capitalism's greatest problem,

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,520
which it is always seeking to solve, is called democracy. And capitalism was getting along

55
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,760
just fine before most adults led the vote. And when most adults led the vote, they started

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,880
using it to say, well, you know, we don't want to be exploited. We don't want our labor captured

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,520
and all the value pulled out of it and given to someone else. We don't want to be treated as

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
modern serfs. We don't want our rivers polluted. We don't want our air polluted. We want to live

59
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,560
in decent housing. In fact, we'd like publicly funded services as well. In fact, we'd also like a

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,280
welfare state and economic safety net, all these things which are inimical to raw capitalism.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,880
And ever since then, capitalism has been trying to fix this problem. And it wasn't

62
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,600
particularly good at it. But neoliberalism has given it the solution. And it's now become extremely

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,000
good at fixing this problem and indeed at surviving and expanding even within the

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,880
nominally democratic era. I mean, before talking about today, because you look through the history

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,360
of how this develops. And I really, I find it fascinating back in, if we go back to the aftermath

66
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,080
of World War II, when if you believed in what is now the central tennis of neoliberalism,

67
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,840
it was a bleak moment. And it seemed as though laissez-faire capitalism was buried, you know,

68
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,680
the experience of the Great Depression and then a genocide or war which tens of millions

69
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,760
killed. And you couldn't really separate the two because fascism really exploited the despair

70
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,240
that emerged, of course, because of the collapse, the effects of that system. And they met in a

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,000
sleepy Swiss town on Pelerin to organize these economists. But I mean, at the time, they felt

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,040
defeated. They were like, we're lost. And it's quite interesting what happens then because

73
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Milton Friedman says, the way you get changes through a crisis, but it depends on the ideas

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,280
lying around. So they kind of, they had a don't mourn organized approach, didn't they really?

75
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,720
But they didn't have collective power. As we would appeal to, they had very rich people who could

76
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,440
bank from what's exactly right. Even so, there's a lot to learn from this movement and how it

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,120
operated. There's a lot of strategy which we on the left can pick up and use quite effectively.

78
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,440
And, you know, we have to understand how they organized, how they got together. So to begin

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,680
with, they start to formulate an ideology, a coherent ideology, one which we can reasonably

80
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,360
argue with, but, you know, it had the virtue of coherence and clarity. And effectively, as

81
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,720
Haya Con von Mises conceived it, any form of collectivism would lead inevitably towards

82
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
totalitarianism. It was one great slippery slump fallacy of that, if you're saying that,

83
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,920
if you have a welfare state, if you have publicly funded services, you will end up with Stalin or

84
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:58,400
Hitler. It's a historical inevitability that that's the way it's going to go. So we have to sweep

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,600
the enabling state and all other impediments to capital out of the way to prevent us from ending

86
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,960
up with totalitarianism. I mean, it was a hopefully staggeringly mistaken argument.

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,640
But the sort of theoretical justification that they created was that there is a natural order

88
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,560
of human life. There are the worthy people and there are the unworthy people. And the worthy

89
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,360
people deserve what they get and the unworthy people deserve what they get as well. And what

90
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,600
they get is distributed to them by this godlike force of the invisible hand of the market. It's

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:46,240
a very Calvinist approach, effectively. It's basically Calvinism done by Eglomis. And this

92
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,800
godlike force of the invisible hand, if all impediments are stripped away, we'll point to

93
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,960
those who have the grunts of the invisible hand and we'll point to those who do not. And we can

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,120
tell who the worthy are because they're going to be rich and we can tell who the unworthy are

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,760
because they're going to be poor. And anything which inhibits the discovery of that natural order,

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,600
such as taxation and redistribution, such as regulation, such as trade unions,

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,960
such as protesters, such as, as we later discovered with them, political choice itself,

98
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,200
inhibits the progress of humankind because that progress depends upon inequality. It depends upon

99
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,120
the discovery of the natural order. It depends upon some people being as rich as they can ever

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,200
become and other people remaining poor. And yet, at the heart of it, because it has to try to sell

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,720
itself to the public, there's this massive contradiction which says that if some people

102
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
are allowed to become tremendously rich, their wealth will trickle down and then everyone will

103
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,760
become tremendously rich. And you say, now hang on a moment, I thought we were meant to have a

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
distinction here between the very rich who deserve it and the very poor who don't. But it's just the

105
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,200
first of a series of intensive contradictions within neoliberalism. Now, many people at the time

106
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,680
saw this not just as a highly irrational and contradictory ideology, but also as an obscene

107
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:25,440
one, one which was destined to return us to the worst excesses of capitalism slash feudalism slash

108
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,160
erontia economy. And so, while the books sell quite well, because a lot of powerful interest

109
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:40,560
got behind them and extracted by reader's digest in Hayek's case, put out to every worker at General

110
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Motors by the management, for example, the ideas remain very unpopular, except with one

111
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,000
particular class of people who were the richest people on earth. And it was literally the richest

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,880
people and corporations on earth got together and poured billions into this project and created

113
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,160
what has been described as a neoliberal interdimensional, a global network of think tanks

114
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,520
in particular, which are the 18th dogs of neoliberalism, these dark money lobby groups such as the

115
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Tufton Street junctings, academic institutions, such as in Chicago, Virginia, and many other places,

116
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:30,720
tame journalists, tame government officials, and tame politicians. And by pouring money into this

117
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,760
and by firing some very clever people to sell these outrageous ideas and to make them sound like

118
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,040
common sense, they began to develop momentum. But even so, they knew they were in it for the long

119
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:53,280
game. And as Milton Friedman, who you mentioned, said, you know, we waited. And when the time came,

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,480
we were ready. And we could step right in.

121
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I mean, I really like firstly, the way that discussion of how

122
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,760
neoliberalism helps rationalize and justify inequalities, whenever I wrote Charles the

123
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,480
demonization working class a long time ago, 12 years ago, whatever, or 13 years ago, I said,

124
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
demonization is the ideological backbone of an unequal society, because you have to

125
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,840
inequality is so perverse, if you think about it long enough, but if you say this is just

126
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,360
desserts, they're at the bottom because they're lazy, they're at the top because they work hard.

127
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
And in terms of just that neoliberal international, those think tanks and all the rest,

128
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
I think it's really fascinating. One thing I'm really interested in is you talk about,

129
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,400
I guess, what it does to us. And, you know, often defenders of these ideas will often try and

130
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,120
talk about human nature, and other than the fact we're social animals, who depend on cooperation

131
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,080
innately, you know, I don't think that's there's much biological mileage in that we're infinitely

132
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,280
malleable. But, but we can be changed, there's no question. And Margaret Thatcher famously said

133
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,720
in 1981, economics are the method, the object is to change the heart and soul. So I'm just

134
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,840
interested in what neoliberalism, what you talk about how what it's done to us, as people, and

135
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,040
how this is not kind of an innate human nature thing, which is. So, so, so at the start of

136
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,080
neoliberal ideology is this Hobbesian idea that we are fundamentally selfish and greedy.

137
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,560
But they twist this to say, that's a good thing. We should mobilise this selfishness and greed.

138
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
And by mobilising it, the rich get richer, and that trickles down and enriches everyone.

139
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,120
So that the undeserving poor, oh, hang on a moment, they get some money too. Oh, well, never mind

140
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,120
all of them. So, but the idea is that, you know, we are, we are the sort of homo economicus,

141
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,240
self maximising creature, which is entirely motivated by transactional considerations,

142
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,000
by instrumental drivers. But actually, all the evidence across social psychology,

143
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,560
across neuroscience, across anthropology, and several other disciplines shows us that that's

144
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,280
simply not true. We all have some selfishness and greed in this, absolutely. But those are not

145
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,840
primary values. Those are not the dominant values for the great majority of people, the dominant

146
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:15,360
values are empathy, altruism, family feeling, community feeling, the wish for a better world,

147
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,640
not just for yourself, but also for other people. And yet we've been instilled in this notion

148
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,840
that we are these greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. And that's reinforced by

149
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,160
the fact that those who come to dominate us, particularly in the neoliberal, you tend to be

150
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,960
greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. I need to put it crudely, we are a society of

151
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,640
altruists, governed by psychopaths. And so that's one of the forces which sort of greatly misleads us

152
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,320
about who we are and where we stand. But another one is as you alluded to, and talking about your

153
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,280
brilliant book, Chaps, is this finger of blame. So just as a rich are told by neoliberalism,

154
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,640
you are rich because you're brilliant, regardless of whether you inherited your money, you stole

155
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,640
your money, regardless of your advantages of education, of class, of race, or whatever

156
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,400
that you start off with, you know, you might start in your 100 meter race at 90 meters,

157
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,600
90 meters down the track. But it's still all down to you that you've become so rich is this

158
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,400
self attribution fallacy is at the heart of neoliberalism. But just as a rich are congratulated

159
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,600
for their wealth, the poor are blamed for their poverty. And if you're poor, it's because you're

160
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,560
unenterprising, it's because you're feckless. If your kid is fat, it's not because corporations

161
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,520
are pushing junk food and the school is sold off, it's playing fields, it's because you're a bad

162
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:58,320
parent. You're constantly sort of urged to internalize this notion of blame. And structural

163
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,040
failure, systemic failure, these things are simply denied. They're simply airbrushed out

164
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,280
of the picture. It's all about the individual. And another of Thatcher's famous quotes, of course,

165
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,680
was that people talk about society, there is no such thing. There are men and women and their

166
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,520
families, which kind of was a manifesto. That's how she wanted it. The whole thrust of neoliberalism

167
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,560
and the way by which capitalism defeats democracy is to atomize in rule, is to tell us you're not

168
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,440
citizens, you're consumers. And if you want change, just sit at home and buy a better brand of biscuits,

169
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
which, of course, as we know, changes decisively nothing.

170
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,040
Back in 2008, there was the grand financial crash. And we still live in the shadow of that

171
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,680
financial crash. And I think a lot of people at the time, not even just on the left, I mean,

172
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
the left was very fragmented. I think this is actually maybe partly answers the point with

173
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
the Milton Friedman point about when you have a crisis, what it depends on the ideas lying around

174
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,600
and I suppose balance of forces. But nonetheless, a lot of people at the time thought, wow, well,

175
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,640
this is it for neoliberalism. There's not going to recover from this. Look at it.

176
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,000
We can see what's happened with untrammeled free markets, greed, markets out of control.

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,160
It's caused a catastrophe. It hasn't quite panned out, perhaps, as some of us might have hoped,

178
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,200
from that rubble. And in fact, what we saw instead, Britain and elsewhere, was a doubling down on

179
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,160
austerity rollback of the state. So a crisis of the private sector became a crisis of the public

180
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,200
sector. It was state spending, which had caused the mess, not the markets out of control.

181
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,440
What the hell is going on there? How have we ended up just in constant crisis in this economic

182
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,680
system? And I'll be honest, George, looking at it still here. Yeah, no, it is. And it keeps failing.

183
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,000
I mean, look at Liz Truss. She was the uber neoliberal. She just did it by the book. Here's

184
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,680
what neoliberalism tells us will create tremendous wealth and success and prosperity. And we all

185
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,400
saw the instant results. You know, it took one day for her mini budget to completely collapse and

186
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,240
bring down many things with it and cause even greater suffering to the people of this country.

187
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,680
So it keeps on failing and failing spectacularly, but it keeps on walking. It is the zombie doctrine.

188
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,400
So why? Why is this? And I think it's because neoliberalism is something that we don't have.

189
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,040
And that's something is a story, a particular kind of story. So it's our contention that

190
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,760
political and religious change across millennia has always been accompanied by a particular

191
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:49,520
narrative structure, which enables and empowers that change to happen. And there are many basic

192
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,080
plots. Well, some people say there's just a few and some people say there's a lot. But anyway,

193
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,440
one of them is always this basic plot, which is what I call the restoration story,

194
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,840
which goes like this. Disorder reflects the land caused by powerful and nefarious people working

195
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,360
against the interests of humanity. But the hero or heroes will confront that disorder

196
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,600
against the odds overthrow those powerful and nefarious forces and restore harmony to the

197
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,520
lalent. And that's the story Marx tells. It's a story that Keynes tells. It was a story that

198
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,640
Marxism flashes told. And it's a story which perhaps for the first time ever quite consciously

199
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,360
and deliberately, the neoliberals told, we understood the power of that narrative structure.

200
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
And of course, you can slot into that narrative structure, whatever you want. So Keynes would

201
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:54,320
say, you know, the powerful and nefarious forces were unsammled capitalists. And the hero of the

202
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,240
story was the enabling state backed by the middle and working classes. And the neoliberals turned

203
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,560
that exactly the other way around. The villain is the enabling state. And the hero is the

204
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:15,920
entrepreneur fighting for freedom against this totalizing elective state, which is the great

205
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,560
demon that has caused so much disorder. But the neoliberals, you know, they were very clever in

206
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,960
saying, this is how the human mind works. This is what attracts us. This is what tells us who we are

207
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,920
and where we stand, where we're going and what we're going to find when we get there. It is a

208
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,280
story. And the story overrides everything. It doesn't matter how much data you've got. It

209
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,040
doesn't matter how good your arguments are. It doesn't matter how consistent and rational they are.

210
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,960
They can be completely inconsistent and rational and frankly bonkers, as some of the neoliberal

211
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,040
tracks like Hayek's later book, The Constitution of Liberty are. But if there's a simple and

212
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,240
coherent story that stitches it all together, that is what counts. Now, you know, when

213
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,240
after the Great Depression, Hayek sat down and wrote what is in effect a restoration story

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,840
through his general theory and further writings. And he did it sort of instinctively, or so it

215
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,840
seems to me. But of course, he did understand narrative. He was connected with a lot of writers

216
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,200
and he did it very well. And then when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the late 1970s, the

217
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,400
neoliberals had been quite consciously and deliberately polishing this restoration story

218
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,680
of their own. And as Friedman said, they could step straight in and tell that story. This is

219
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,360
what's gone wrong. Here is where you stand. This is what we're going to do to get you out of it

220
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,480
and get you to this promised land. And then when neoliberalism collapsed in 2008, we stepped forward

221
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,280
with nothing. We had no new story. We had lots of brilliant ideas, lots of fantastic policies,

222
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,520
lots of amazing schemes for doing this and for doing that and the rest of it. But we

223
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,200
hadn't brought them together into a coherent narrative structure. And so people couldn't

224
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
really hear what we were saying. It's a bit like trying to make a tapestry without a loom.

225
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,040
You've got lots of amazing coloured threads. But where's the picture? Where is that a great big

226
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,680
hanging where people can say, oh yeah, there's me in the picture. I can see myself there as part of

227
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:38,080
this criminal. Unless you pull it all together into a coherent story, you can't reach across to people

228
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,840
and you can't say, here is the answer. Before I ask, just in terms of, I like to always end on an

229
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,560
optimistic note, given the world of which living, we've got ample material there, haven't we?

230
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,640
It is just before I just lean into the bleakness first. At the moment, you can see and you talk

231
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,760
about these right-wing authoritarian movements. We can look at the likes of the Bolsonaro's,

232
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,520
obviously defeated, fortunately, but Bolsonaro is a moe, lives on. The Modi's, obviously there's

233
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,160
entirely plausible Trump could become president. And to be honest, if you'd sped 10 years ago

234
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,520
about the prospects of civil war in the United States, people think you're pretty wacky, but you

235
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,000
can't rule out. The threat to democracy, however caveated US democracy happens to be right now,

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,560
is real. And we can see across Europe the rise of, we've got Orban in Hungary, we've got all sorts

237
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
of very unpleasant. You might look at this and think the likes are going out. How do you link

238
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,000
these movements to neoliberalism? And are these morbid symptoms? How do you kind of analyse them?

239
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,160
So one thing neoliberalism does is to create state failure. It's failure by design. The state is not

240
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,200
supposed to work. I mean, the state is very powerful under neoliberalism because what makes it different

241
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,480
from laissez-faire economics or classical liberalism, as it's sometimes called, is that it uses the

242
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,160
state as a battering room deliberately to push democracy out of the way, to push trade unions,

243
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:18,000
protesters, political choice, the administrative state out of the way through this often extreme

244
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
force. And then it leaves us, as Tony Judd pointed out in his last book, Il Faire's The Land,

245
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:32,080
just with this authoritarian core, which, and all the state then has to offer us,

246
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,960
is the demand for obedience and punishment if we step out of line. And so as neoliberalism

247
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,000
captures parties across the political spectrum, which unfortunately we've also seen here in

248
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,280
the UK for 45 years, and boy is it continuing, we end with A, a state which is unable to solve our

249
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,000
problems and B, a lack of political choice, which is kind of ironic because neoliberalism is supposed

250
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,080
to be all about choice, but as Margaret Thatcher kept saying, there is no alternative. You've

251
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:14,000
got a full and free choice and there is no alternative. And we end up with a complete

252
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,880
disillusionment with politics as usual. And then that creates an opening for the Orban's and the

253
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,760
Trump's and the Netanyahu's and the Modi's and these other killer clowns, who then move into

254
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,880
that vacuum and say, we stand apart from politics, we're the anti-politics people. We're not immersed

255
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,760
in all that elite chatter going on above your heads. We are genuinely connected to you and they

256
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:51,760
prove that connection by speaking in very simplistic and direct terms. And so they present themselves

257
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,280
as the solution to the crises which have been caused by neoliberalism. But of course as soon as

258
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,560
they get in, they massively ramp up all of those crises, the crises of corruption, of nepotism,

259
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,880
of the sale of state assets, of the complete failure to meet the needs of the poor, of the

260
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,520
massively escalating inequality, which always follows in their wake.

261
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Depressing, but there is always hope. You've been speaking about what you described here,

262
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,520
again, as private sufficiency, public luxury for a long time. So in terms of you, and you know,

263
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,800
this is important too because we can't obviously not, given I'm talking to you about the climate

264
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,720
emergency as well and the obvious existential threat to humanity and a profit-driven system

265
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,240
which prioritises profit over the futures of our last species, bigger problem. But how do you see

266
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
that way forward? How do you sketch out this hopeful alternative to what we see there which is,

267
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,920
as we discussed, right wing authoritarian movements which exploit the phase of neoliberalism and then

268
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,160
double down on the very problems which they exploited? So most of the time, I think to most

269
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,600
people, despair seems like the rational option. This is the obvious thing to do in a situation

270
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,360
like this is to despair. Where's the hope? How can we possibly get out of this horrendous mess?

271
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,960
But I think despair is the irrational response to this because despair is what people feel

272
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,080
when they wrongly conceive society as a simple system. Now, one of the greatest failings of

273
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,840
our education is that we are never, a great majority of people are never taught the principles of

274
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,960
complex systems. Everything important to us is a complex system, the human brain, the human body,

275
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,600
human society, the financial system, the economic system, every ecosystem, the atmosphere, the oceans,

276
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,960
ice caps, the rest of it, they're all complex systems. And complex systems have very particular

277
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,440
ways of operating. And they have these emergent adaptive characteristics and they have tipping

278
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,320
points and they can very rapidly flip from one equilibrium state to another. And society is

279
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,160
no different from those other complex systems. Society has two equilibrium states. One is called

280
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,440
impossible and the other is called inevitable. And from the perspective of anything you want to

281
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,200
see happen, it's always impossible. Votes for women, you have to be kidding. Independence for India,

282
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,920
you're off your rocker. Civil rights, an end to apartheid, equal marriage legislation,

283
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,720
sexual liberation, all of these things. But when you're pressing for them, it just seems

284
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,760
impossible. You've got this massive brick wall in front of you, it can't happen. And then it happens

285
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,720
and everyone says, well, that was inevitable, wasn't it? Yeah. And what's happened in this case,

286
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:55,120
in these cases, is that there's been a tipping point. Now, the marriage equality legislation,

287
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,000
I think it's a very good example of how that change happens. Because it starts as it always

288
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,680
starts. And I think it was brilliantly done, really fantastic campaigning. It was very hard,

289
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,840
it took a very long time. And started in a position where it was regarded as an absolutely

290
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,560
horrific idea. You know, this is going to be the end of civilization, as we know, everyone was

291
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:25,280
against it. All the religious organizations, nearly all the politicians, all the newspapers,

292
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,280
the whole lot. And you start as you must always start by preaching to the choir. All my life,

293
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,680
I've been told, don't preach to the choir. Sorry, but what else are we ever going to preach to?

294
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,400
You preach some choir, but you make it a little bit bigger every time. You just expand the size

295
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,360
of the choir. It's about concentric circles. And you push it, and you push it, and push it.

296
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,600
Until eventually, you hit that tipping point, which some research suggests is about 25% of people.

297
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,760
This whole sort of Oxford Union approach that, you know, you win an argument and you change

298
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,360
things by persuading the person in the opposite corner. It's just complete nonsense. It's never

299
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,800
worked that way. That is not how political change has ever happened. But because people think that's

300
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,840
how political change happens, they think it can never happen. I will never persuade my grumpy

301
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,480
neighbor who reads a daily mail. No, sorry, you don't have to. Persuasion is massively

302
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,280
overeated as a political force. You persuade the choir, and you mobilize them, and you equip them,

303
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,320
and they persuade a few people around them, and they persuade a few more until you reach that

304
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,840
25% or so of society. And then suddenly, two things happen. One, the dynamics of the complex

305
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,640
system kick in, and you can push it towards the sort of tipping point between those equilibrium

306
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,400
states. But two, because we are the uber social mammal, and our whiskers are always twitching to

307
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,320
see which way the social wind is blowing, we don't want to be left behind. And so you'll suddenly

308
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,560
then have this flip, where it's not that everybody becomes the campaigner for your cause, it's just

309
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,280
the opposition just drops away, because people don't want to feel that they're out of line with

310
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,320
the times. And so what you then find is people who you know adamantly opposed to it say, well,

311
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,680
of course, I've always supported marriage equality. After the war, everyone becomes a member of the

312
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:29,600
resistance, right? And so you'll see these sort of sudden flips from what seemed to be an impossible

313
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:38,480
situation to what then looks like an inevitable change. And we can trigger those, we can console

314
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,520
those tippings by telling a powerful restoration story that incorporates our values.

315
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,960
And it's very powerfully done in this book. And that's exactly what this book does. It reaches

316
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,760
people who I think find this whole subject quite intimidating. It's written very beautifully,

317
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,840
lots of clarity, but so much information, very educational, including for people who I think

318
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,520
maybe read lots about neoliberalism. And it's really, even though it's often talking about

319
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,880
very bleak things, it's full of the optimism for the reasons you talk about. It has a very

320
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,720
practical way forward. And that's what we do need to talk about. So make sure you get a copy of

321
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
The Invisible Doctrine, The Secret History of Neoliberalism and How It Came to Control Your

322
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,920
Life by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, who is over in California. But they've both done a

323
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,360
brilliant job, even though they've never met at weaving together this wonderful story. So do

324
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,600
share this video, make sure everyone hear George's voice, obviously, press like, subscribe, hit the

325
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
leave your comments, love to read your comments. But George, thank you so much,

326
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,520
as ever, for your brilliant clarity and wisdom. Well, thanks, Owen, then thank you so much for

327
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
everything you do.
