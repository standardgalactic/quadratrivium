0	3840	How do we describe our prevailing economic system? It's quite interesting this because
5280	10000	one of the facets particularly of British political debate is this kind of eye-rolling
10000	15600	anti-intellectualism, I suppose, that if you try and describe the system in which we live,
15600	20000	how it works, how it operates, you get this particularly within the British media who don't
20000	24320	particularly like talking about ideas, which I would say helps protect the status quo.
25200	29600	If you talk about this word beginning with N, neoliberalism, the eye-rolling starts.
29600	36320	Oh, what is neoliberalism? It's not a thing. This is just some pretentious set of jargon
36320	42720	that you devious leftists have come up with. So, given that nonsense, I'm particularly delighted
42720	47440	to be joined by the incredible George Monbiot, who is one of our finest living journalists,
47440	52640	and he's written this brilliant book with Peter Hutchison, who will talk about this.
52640	57120	They've never met. This is brilliant. It's a book called The Secret History of Neoliberalism
57120	62000	and How It Came to Control Your Life. Hello, George. How are you doing?
62000	65520	Hello. Yeah, great. I'm lovely to talk to you.
66080	70960	That's very lovely to talk to you always. Firstly, yeah, I'm just quite amused by the fact
70960	74080	you've never met. Can you just explain? People might be listening. You've written a book with
74080	76240	someone you've never met. It's fun. That's a fun idea. I like it.
77280	82400	So, Peter is a filmmaker. He lives in California, as a lot of filmmakers do. I don't fly.
82960	89200	So, the whole collaboration has been done remotely. It started off with him approaching me saying,
89200	94000	could we make a film together about neoliberalism? Because this is something I've been writing about
94000	101600	for, well, lots and lots of years, and trying to document, trying to pin down, trying to show
102240	108640	exactly what the great majority of people have been missing and how we've been so thoroughly
108640	113360	stitched up and also what we can do about it. And he said, look, this will make a great film.
113360	118480	He made films like Rookquiem for the American Dream with Noam Chomsky, for instance, and
119200	125760	it's a film in that sort of mold. And so, we agreed to do that. And we did all that remotely,
125760	132560	where he got a remote camera operator in Britain to film me, and he directed down the line.
133120	136960	And then he said, look, this will make a great book. We should do this together.
138720	143840	And so, we just went ahead on the same principles. And it's been really amazing
143840	149200	collaborating with a filmmaker, because what you've got there is a very, very tight editor with a
149200	156320	very strong visual sense. And so, he really, he sort of gave the book its structure and its
156320	164240	thrust, a lot of its pace, I think. And it's turned into a very short and terse and size book,
165120	171440	whose aim really is to be understood by anyone. We're keeping it really simple,
173600	181280	trying to just write it almost as if we were making a film. And with his influence and his sort
181280	187840	of driving force behind this, I think we've succeeded in that and created something which is
188800	194640	really readable and takes this extremely important subject to potentially a wider
194640	198960	audience. I mean, there must have been a hundred books published on neoliberalism and some really
198960	206560	great books, but most of them are this thick and very difficult to get through. So, we're
206560	211120	trying to do the opposite. I think more than succeeded. It really is a riveting read. Look
211120	215680	very, very pacey. It is like a film. And I think you're right. I think a lot of people,
215680	218320	they're interested maybe in the idea of neoliberalism, but they probably find it a bit
218320	223360	intimidating, particularly if they see a dense tone. But this really explains it very, very
223360	228160	effectively indeed. So, just what the hell is neoliberalism? Because, you know, we've been,
228160	231680	you've been in this game longer than I have, but you know the eye-rolling I'm talking about,
231680	236800	you talk about neoliberalism. And you say, you know, in the Soviet Union, if the idea,
236800	241440	if you couldn't describe the ideology that ruled us, and I suppose it benefits them to pretend
241440	244960	there is no ideology, it's just what works. This is just a dynamic system. So, what is
245040	251520	neoliberalism? It's much of a dominant ideology in our society as communism was in the Soviet
251520	257040	Union. And as you say, it's just crazy that most people either aren't aware of it at all,
257040	264080	or are incapable of defining it, or as you say, just dismiss it. If there's no such thing,
264080	269520	you're just making this up. This is a boo word. This is a conspiracy fiction, whatever. And they'll
269520	274960	throw anything they want at you to try to prevent people from getting to grips with,
274960	281120	with what we're seeing here. And neoliberalism is an ideology whose name was given to it by
281120	287600	the original ideologues, people like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, and others who
287600	296000	originally met in 1938, to help capitalism solve its greatest problem. Capitalism's greatest problem,
296000	301520	which it is always seeking to solve, is called democracy. And capitalism was getting along
301520	307760	just fine before most adults led the vote. And when most adults led the vote, they started
307760	312880	using it to say, well, you know, we don't want to be exploited. We don't want our labor captured
312880	319520	and all the value pulled out of it and given to someone else. We don't want to be treated as
319520	325440	modern serfs. We don't want our rivers polluted. We don't want our air polluted. We want to live
325440	330560	in decent housing. In fact, we'd like publicly funded services as well. In fact, we'd also like a
330560	337280	welfare state and economic safety net, all these things which are inimical to raw capitalism.
338000	344880	And ever since then, capitalism has been trying to fix this problem. And it wasn't
344880	351600	particularly good at it. But neoliberalism has given it the solution. And it's now become extremely
351600	358000	good at fixing this problem and indeed at surviving and expanding even within the
358000	364880	nominally democratic era. I mean, before talking about today, because you look through the history
364880	369360	of how this develops. And I really, I find it fascinating back in, if we go back to the aftermath
369360	374080	of World War II, when if you believed in what is now the central tennis of neoliberalism,
374080	379840	it was a bleak moment. And it seemed as though laissez-faire capitalism was buried, you know,
379920	385680	the experience of the Great Depression and then a genocide or war which tens of millions
385680	389760	killed. And you couldn't really separate the two because fascism really exploited the despair
389760	396240	that emerged, of course, because of the collapse, the effects of that system. And they met in a
396240	402000	sleepy Swiss town on Pelerin to organize these economists. But I mean, at the time, they felt
402000	407040	defeated. They were like, we're lost. And it's quite interesting what happens then because
407840	411760	Milton Friedman says, the way you get changes through a crisis, but it depends on the ideas
411760	415280	lying around. So they kind of, they had a don't mourn organized approach, didn't they really?
415280	420720	But they didn't have collective power. As we would appeal to, they had very rich people who could
421360	427440	bank from what's exactly right. Even so, there's a lot to learn from this movement and how it
427440	433120	operated. There's a lot of strategy which we on the left can pick up and use quite effectively.
433360	439440	And, you know, we have to understand how they organized, how they got together. So to begin
439440	445680	with, they start to formulate an ideology, a coherent ideology, one which we can reasonably
445680	453360	argue with, but, you know, it had the virtue of coherence and clarity. And effectively, as
453360	460720	Haya Con von Mises conceived it, any form of collectivism would lead inevitably towards
460720	464960	totalitarianism. It was one great slippery slump fallacy of that, if you're saying that,
464960	469920	if you have a welfare state, if you have publicly funded services, you will end up with Stalin or
469920	478400	Hitler. It's a historical inevitability that that's the way it's going to go. So we have to sweep
478400	485600	the enabling state and all other impediments to capital out of the way to prevent us from ending
485600	490960	up with totalitarianism. I mean, it was a hopefully staggeringly mistaken argument.
491920	498640	But the sort of theoretical justification that they created was that there is a natural order
498640	504560	of human life. There are the worthy people and there are the unworthy people. And the worthy
504560	511360	people deserve what they get and the unworthy people deserve what they get as well. And what
511360	517600	they get is distributed to them by this godlike force of the invisible hand of the market. It's
517600	526240	a very Calvinist approach, effectively. It's basically Calvinism done by Eglomis. And this
526240	532800	godlike force of the invisible hand, if all impediments are stripped away, we'll point to
533440	538960	those who have the grunts of the invisible hand and we'll point to those who do not. And we can
538960	543120	tell who the worthy are because they're going to be rich and we can tell who the unworthy are
543120	549760	because they're going to be poor. And anything which inhibits the discovery of that natural order,
550320	557600	such as taxation and redistribution, such as regulation, such as trade unions,
557600	562960	such as protesters, such as, as we later discovered with them, political choice itself,
563760	571200	inhibits the progress of humankind because that progress depends upon inequality. It depends upon
571200	577120	the discovery of the natural order. It depends upon some people being as rich as they can ever
577120	583200	become and other people remaining poor. And yet, at the heart of it, because it has to try to sell
583200	588720	itself to the public, there's this massive contradiction which says that if some people
588720	593120	are allowed to become tremendously rich, their wealth will trickle down and then everyone will
593120	597760	become tremendously rich. And you say, now hang on a moment, I thought we were meant to have a
597760	602720	distinction here between the very rich who deserve it and the very poor who don't. But it's just the
602720	609200	first of a series of intensive contradictions within neoliberalism. Now, many people at the time
609840	615680	saw this not just as a highly irrational and contradictory ideology, but also as an obscene
615680	625440	one, one which was destined to return us to the worst excesses of capitalism slash feudalism slash
625440	632160	erontia economy. And so, while the books sell quite well, because a lot of powerful interest
632160	640560	got behind them and extracted by reader's digest in Hayek's case, put out to every worker at General
640560	647280	Motors by the management, for example, the ideas remain very unpopular, except with one
647280	652000	particular class of people who were the richest people on earth. And it was literally the richest
652000	658880	people and corporations on earth got together and poured billions into this project and created
658880	666160	what has been described as a neoliberal interdimensional, a global network of think tanks
666160	673520	in particular, which are the 18th dogs of neoliberalism, these dark money lobby groups such as the
673520	681760	Tufton Street junctings, academic institutions, such as in Chicago, Virginia, and many other places,
682640	690720	tame journalists, tame government officials, and tame politicians. And by pouring money into this
690720	697760	and by firing some very clever people to sell these outrageous ideas and to make them sound like
697760	705040	common sense, they began to develop momentum. But even so, they knew they were in it for the long
705040	713280	game. And as Milton Friedman, who you mentioned, said, you know, we waited. And when the time came,
713840	716480	we were ready. And we could step right in.
717440	721440	I mean, I really like firstly, the way that discussion of how
722800	725760	neoliberalism helps rationalize and justify inequalities, whenever I wrote Charles the
725760	730480	demonization working class a long time ago, 12 years ago, whatever, or 13 years ago, I said,
730480	734720	demonization is the ideological backbone of an unequal society, because you have to
735840	739840	inequality is so perverse, if you think about it long enough, but if you say this is just
739840	743360	desserts, they're at the bottom because they're lazy, they're at the top because they work hard.
744320	747760	And in terms of just that neoliberal international, those think tanks and all the rest,
747760	750560	I think it's really fascinating. One thing I'm really interested in is you talk about,
751360	758400	I guess, what it does to us. And, you know, often defenders of these ideas will often try and
758400	763120	talk about human nature, and other than the fact we're social animals, who depend on cooperation
763120	768080	innately, you know, I don't think that's there's much biological mileage in that we're infinitely
768080	773280	malleable. But, but we can be changed, there's no question. And Margaret Thatcher famously said
773280	778720	in 1981, economics are the method, the object is to change the heart and soul. So I'm just
778720	783840	interested in what neoliberalism, what you talk about how what it's done to us, as people, and
783840	789040	how this is not kind of an innate human nature thing, which is. So, so, so at the start of
789040	794080	neoliberal ideology is this Hobbesian idea that we are fundamentally selfish and greedy.
795040	800560	But they twist this to say, that's a good thing. We should mobilise this selfishness and greed.
801440	805680	And by mobilising it, the rich get richer, and that trickles down and enriches everyone.
806480	811120	So that the undeserving poor, oh, hang on a moment, they get some money too. Oh, well, never mind
811120	817120	all of them. So, but the idea is that, you know, we are, we are the sort of homo economicus,
817200	824240	self maximising creature, which is entirely motivated by transactional considerations,
824240	832000	by instrumental drivers. But actually, all the evidence across social psychology,
832000	836560	across neuroscience, across anthropology, and several other disciplines shows us that that's
836560	843280	simply not true. We all have some selfishness and greed in this, absolutely. But those are not
843520	847840	primary values. Those are not the dominant values for the great majority of people, the dominant
847840	855360	values are empathy, altruism, family feeling, community feeling, the wish for a better world,
855360	862640	not just for yourself, but also for other people. And yet we've been instilled in this notion
863280	869840	that we are these greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. And that's reinforced by
869840	876160	the fact that those who come to dominate us, particularly in the neoliberal, you tend to be
876160	880960	greedy, selfish, really quite unpleasant creatures. I need to put it crudely, we are a society of
880960	888640	altruists, governed by psychopaths. And so that's one of the forces which sort of greatly misleads us
888640	894320	about who we are and where we stand. But another one is as you alluded to, and talking about your
894320	901280	brilliant book, Chaps, is this finger of blame. So just as a rich are told by neoliberalism,
901280	906640	you are rich because you're brilliant, regardless of whether you inherited your money, you stole
906640	912640	your money, regardless of your advantages of education, of class, of race, or whatever
913600	918400	that you start off with, you know, you might start in your 100 meter race at 90 meters,
919200	925600	90 meters down the track. But it's still all down to you that you've become so rich is this
925600	932400	self attribution fallacy is at the heart of neoliberalism. But just as a rich are congratulated
932400	937600	for their wealth, the poor are blamed for their poverty. And if you're poor, it's because you're
937600	944560	unenterprising, it's because you're feckless. If your kid is fat, it's not because corporations
944560	949520	are pushing junk food and the school is sold off, it's playing fields, it's because you're a bad
949520	958320	parent. You're constantly sort of urged to internalize this notion of blame. And structural
959040	965040	failure, systemic failure, these things are simply denied. They're simply airbrushed out
965040	971280	of the picture. It's all about the individual. And another of Thatcher's famous quotes, of course,
971280	977680	was that people talk about society, there is no such thing. There are men and women and their
977680	983520	families, which kind of was a manifesto. That's how she wanted it. The whole thrust of neoliberalism
983520	990560	and the way by which capitalism defeats democracy is to atomize in rule, is to tell us you're not
990560	995440	citizens, you're consumers. And if you want change, just sit at home and buy a better brand of biscuits,
996320	999680	which, of course, as we know, changes decisively nothing.
1002320	1007040	Back in 2008, there was the grand financial crash. And we still live in the shadow of that
1007040	1011680	financial crash. And I think a lot of people at the time, not even just on the left, I mean,
1011680	1015440	the left was very fragmented. I think this is actually maybe partly answers the point with
1015440	1019920	the Milton Friedman point about when you have a crisis, what it depends on the ideas lying around
1019920	1023600	and I suppose balance of forces. But nonetheless, a lot of people at the time thought, wow, well,
1023680	1026640	this is it for neoliberalism. There's not going to recover from this. Look at it.
1028160	1034000	We can see what's happened with untrammeled free markets, greed, markets out of control.
1034000	1040160	It's caused a catastrophe. It hasn't quite panned out, perhaps, as some of us might have hoped,
1040160	1047200	from that rubble. And in fact, what we saw instead, Britain and elsewhere, was a doubling down on
1047200	1052160	austerity rollback of the state. So a crisis of the private sector became a crisis of the public
1052240	1057200	sector. It was state spending, which had caused the mess, not the markets out of control.
1057200	1061440	What the hell is going on there? How have we ended up just in constant crisis in this economic
1061440	1067680	system? And I'll be honest, George, looking at it still here. Yeah, no, it is. And it keeps failing.
1067680	1074000	I mean, look at Liz Truss. She was the uber neoliberal. She just did it by the book. Here's
1074000	1079680	what neoliberalism tells us will create tremendous wealth and success and prosperity. And we all
1079680	1086400	saw the instant results. You know, it took one day for her mini budget to completely collapse and
1086400	1092240	bring down many things with it and cause even greater suffering to the people of this country.
1092240	1099680	So it keeps on failing and failing spectacularly, but it keeps on walking. It is the zombie doctrine.
1099680	1106400	So why? Why is this? And I think it's because neoliberalism is something that we don't have.
1107120	1113040	And that's something is a story, a particular kind of story. So it's our contention that
1114160	1121760	political and religious change across millennia has always been accompanied by a particular
1121760	1129520	narrative structure, which enables and empowers that change to happen. And there are many basic
1129520	1134080	plots. Well, some people say there's just a few and some people say there's a lot. But anyway,
1134080	1139440	one of them is always this basic plot, which is what I call the restoration story,
1139440	1145840	which goes like this. Disorder reflects the land caused by powerful and nefarious people working
1145840	1151360	against the interests of humanity. But the hero or heroes will confront that disorder
1151920	1157600	against the odds overthrow those powerful and nefarious forces and restore harmony to the
1157600	1165520	lalent. And that's the story Marx tells. It's a story that Keynes tells. It was a story that
1165520	1172640	Marxism flashes told. And it's a story which perhaps for the first time ever quite consciously
1172640	1179360	and deliberately, the neoliberals told, we understood the power of that narrative structure.
1179360	1183600	And of course, you can slot into that narrative structure, whatever you want. So Keynes would
1183600	1194320	say, you know, the powerful and nefarious forces were unsammled capitalists. And the hero of the
1194320	1200240	story was the enabling state backed by the middle and working classes. And the neoliberals turned
1200240	1206560	that exactly the other way around. The villain is the enabling state. And the hero is the
1206560	1215920	entrepreneur fighting for freedom against this totalizing elective state, which is the great
1215920	1220560	demon that has caused so much disorder. But the neoliberals, you know, they were very clever in
1220560	1228960	saying, this is how the human mind works. This is what attracts us. This is what tells us who we are
1228960	1233920	and where we stand, where we're going and what we're going to find when we get there. It is a
1234000	1239280	story. And the story overrides everything. It doesn't matter how much data you've got. It
1239280	1245040	doesn't matter how good your arguments are. It doesn't matter how consistent and rational they are.
1245040	1250960	They can be completely inconsistent and rational and frankly bonkers, as some of the neoliberal
1250960	1257040	tracks like Hayek's later book, The Constitution of Liberty are. But if there's a simple and
1257280	1264240	coherent story that stitches it all together, that is what counts. Now, you know, when
1265600	1272240	after the Great Depression, Hayek sat down and wrote what is in effect a restoration story
1272240	1277840	through his general theory and further writings. And he did it sort of instinctively, or so it
1277840	1283840	seems to me. But of course, he did understand narrative. He was connected with a lot of writers
1284800	1291200	and he did it very well. And then when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the late 1970s, the
1291200	1296400	neoliberals had been quite consciously and deliberately polishing this restoration story
1296400	1301680	of their own. And as Friedman said, they could step straight in and tell that story. This is
1301680	1307360	what's gone wrong. Here is where you stand. This is what we're going to do to get you out of it
1307360	1314480	and get you to this promised land. And then when neoliberalism collapsed in 2008, we stepped forward
1314480	1321280	with nothing. We had no new story. We had lots of brilliant ideas, lots of fantastic policies,
1321280	1327520	lots of amazing schemes for doing this and for doing that and the rest of it. But we
1327520	1333200	hadn't brought them together into a coherent narrative structure. And so people couldn't
1333200	1338000	really hear what we were saying. It's a bit like trying to make a tapestry without a loom.
1338000	1345040	You've got lots of amazing coloured threads. But where's the picture? Where is that a great big
1345040	1349680	hanging where people can say, oh yeah, there's me in the picture. I can see myself there as part of
1349680	1358080	this criminal. Unless you pull it all together into a coherent story, you can't reach across to people
1358080	1365840	and you can't say, here is the answer. Before I ask, just in terms of, I like to always end on an
1365840	1370560	optimistic note, given the world of which living, we've got ample material there, haven't we?
1372000	1378640	It is just before I just lean into the bleakness first. At the moment, you can see and you talk
1378640	1383760	about these right-wing authoritarian movements. We can look at the likes of the Bolsonaro's,
1383760	1391520	obviously defeated, fortunately, but Bolsonaro is a moe, lives on. The Modi's, obviously there's
1391520	1396160	entirely plausible Trump could become president. And to be honest, if you'd sped 10 years ago
1396160	1399520	about the prospects of civil war in the United States, people think you're pretty wacky, but you
1399520	1406000	can't rule out. The threat to democracy, however caveated US democracy happens to be right now,
1406000	1412560	is real. And we can see across Europe the rise of, we've got Orban in Hungary, we've got all sorts
1412640	1416400	of very unpleasant. You might look at this and think the likes are going out. How do you link
1416400	1424000	these movements to neoliberalism? And are these morbid symptoms? How do you kind of analyse them?
1424880	1430160	So one thing neoliberalism does is to create state failure. It's failure by design. The state is not
1430160	1435200	supposed to work. I mean, the state is very powerful under neoliberalism because what makes it different
1435200	1442480	from laissez-faire economics or classical liberalism, as it's sometimes called, is that it uses the
1442480	1448160	state as a battering room deliberately to push democracy out of the way, to push trade unions,
1448160	1458000	protesters, political choice, the administrative state out of the way through this often extreme
1458000	1464000	force. And then it leaves us, as Tony Judd pointed out in his last book, Il Faire's The Land,
1464720	1472080	just with this authoritarian core, which, and all the state then has to offer us,
1472080	1480960	is the demand for obedience and punishment if we step out of line. And so as neoliberalism
1480960	1486000	captures parties across the political spectrum, which unfortunately we've also seen here in
1486000	1495280	the UK for 45 years, and boy is it continuing, we end with A, a state which is unable to solve our
1495280	1502000	problems and B, a lack of political choice, which is kind of ironic because neoliberalism is supposed
1502000	1506080	to be all about choice, but as Margaret Thatcher kept saying, there is no alternative. You've
1506080	1514000	got a full and free choice and there is no alternative. And we end up with a complete
1514000	1520880	disillusionment with politics as usual. And then that creates an opening for the Orban's and the
1520880	1527760	Trump's and the Netanyahu's and the Modi's and these other killer clowns, who then move into
1527760	1534880	that vacuum and say, we stand apart from politics, we're the anti-politics people. We're not immersed
1534880	1541760	in all that elite chatter going on above your heads. We are genuinely connected to you and they
1541760	1551760	prove that connection by speaking in very simplistic and direct terms. And so they present themselves
1551760	1557280	as the solution to the crises which have been caused by neoliberalism. But of course as soon as
1557280	1564560	they get in, they massively ramp up all of those crises, the crises of corruption, of nepotism,
1564560	1570880	of the sale of state assets, of the complete failure to meet the needs of the poor, of the
1571680	1575520	massively escalating inequality, which always follows in their wake.
1577920	1585040	Depressing, but there is always hope. You've been speaking about what you described here,
1585040	1591520	again, as private sufficiency, public luxury for a long time. So in terms of you, and you know,
1591520	1594800	this is important too because we can't obviously not, given I'm talking to you about the climate
1594800	1600720	emergency as well and the obvious existential threat to humanity and a profit-driven system
1600720	1606240	which prioritises profit over the futures of our last species, bigger problem. But how do you see
1606240	1610080	that way forward? How do you sketch out this hopeful alternative to what we see there which is,
1610080	1615920	as we discussed, right wing authoritarian movements which exploit the phase of neoliberalism and then
1615920	1622160	double down on the very problems which they exploited? So most of the time, I think to most
1622160	1627600	people, despair seems like the rational option. This is the obvious thing to do in a situation
1627600	1633360	like this is to despair. Where's the hope? How can we possibly get out of this horrendous mess?
1634080	1640960	But I think despair is the irrational response to this because despair is what people feel
1640960	1648080	when they wrongly conceive society as a simple system. Now, one of the greatest failings of
1648080	1653840	our education is that we are never, a great majority of people are never taught the principles of
1653840	1658960	complex systems. Everything important to us is a complex system, the human brain, the human body,
1658960	1665600	human society, the financial system, the economic system, every ecosystem, the atmosphere, the oceans,
1665600	1672960	ice caps, the rest of it, they're all complex systems. And complex systems have very particular
1672960	1679440	ways of operating. And they have these emergent adaptive characteristics and they have tipping
1679440	1686320	points and they can very rapidly flip from one equilibrium state to another. And society is
1686320	1692160	no different from those other complex systems. Society has two equilibrium states. One is called
1692160	1697440	impossible and the other is called inevitable. And from the perspective of anything you want to
1697440	1703200	see happen, it's always impossible. Votes for women, you have to be kidding. Independence for India,
1703200	1709920	you're off your rocker. Civil rights, an end to apartheid, equal marriage legislation,
1711440	1716720	sexual liberation, all of these things. But when you're pressing for them, it just seems
1716720	1721760	impossible. You've got this massive brick wall in front of you, it can't happen. And then it happens
1721760	1726720	and everyone says, well, that was inevitable, wasn't it? Yeah. And what's happened in this case,
1726720	1735120	in these cases, is that there's been a tipping point. Now, the marriage equality legislation,
1735120	1742000	I think it's a very good example of how that change happens. Because it starts as it always
1742000	1747680	starts. And I think it was brilliantly done, really fantastic campaigning. It was very hard,
1747680	1753840	it took a very long time. And started in a position where it was regarded as an absolutely
1753840	1758560	horrific idea. You know, this is going to be the end of civilization, as we know, everyone was
1758560	1765280	against it. All the religious organizations, nearly all the politicians, all the newspapers,
1765280	1771280	the whole lot. And you start as you must always start by preaching to the choir. All my life,
1771280	1775680	I've been told, don't preach to the choir. Sorry, but what else are we ever going to preach to?
1777520	1782400	You preach some choir, but you make it a little bit bigger every time. You just expand the size
1782400	1787360	of the choir. It's about concentric circles. And you push it, and you push it, and push it.
1787360	1793600	Until eventually, you hit that tipping point, which some research suggests is about 25% of people.
1794160	1799760	This whole sort of Oxford Union approach that, you know, you win an argument and you change
1799760	1805360	things by persuading the person in the opposite corner. It's just complete nonsense. It's never
1805360	1810800	worked that way. That is not how political change has ever happened. But because people think that's
1810800	1815840	how political change happens, they think it can never happen. I will never persuade my grumpy
1815840	1820480	neighbor who reads a daily mail. No, sorry, you don't have to. Persuasion is massively
1820480	1827280	overeated as a political force. You persuade the choir, and you mobilize them, and you equip them,
1827840	1832320	and they persuade a few people around them, and they persuade a few more until you reach that
1832960	1839840	25% or so of society. And then suddenly, two things happen. One, the dynamics of the complex
1839840	1846640	system kick in, and you can push it towards the sort of tipping point between those equilibrium
1846640	1852400	states. But two, because we are the uber social mammal, and our whiskers are always twitching to
1852400	1858320	see which way the social wind is blowing, we don't want to be left behind. And so you'll suddenly
1858320	1864560	then have this flip, where it's not that everybody becomes the campaigner for your cause, it's just
1864560	1869280	the opposition just drops away, because people don't want to feel that they're out of line with
1869280	1876320	the times. And so what you then find is people who you know adamantly opposed to it say, well,
1876320	1881680	of course, I've always supported marriage equality. After the war, everyone becomes a member of the
1881680	1889600	resistance, right? And so you'll see these sort of sudden flips from what seemed to be an impossible
1889600	1898480	situation to what then looks like an inevitable change. And we can trigger those, we can console
1899440	1905520	those tippings by telling a powerful restoration story that incorporates our values.
1907600	1912960	And it's very powerfully done in this book. And that's exactly what this book does. It reaches
1912960	1917760	people who I think find this whole subject quite intimidating. It's written very beautifully,
1917760	1921840	lots of clarity, but so much information, very educational, including for people who I think
1922160	1929520	maybe read lots about neoliberalism. And it's really, even though it's often talking about
1929520	1932880	very bleak things, it's full of the optimism for the reasons you talk about. It has a very
1932880	1938720	practical way forward. And that's what we do need to talk about. So make sure you get a copy of
1938720	1942000	The Invisible Doctrine, The Secret History of Neoliberalism and How It Came to Control Your
1942000	1947920	Life by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, who is over in California. But they've both done a
1947920	1953360	brilliant job, even though they've never met at weaving together this wonderful story. So do
1953360	1957600	share this video, make sure everyone hear George's voice, obviously, press like, subscribe, hit the
1958320	1962480	leave your comments, love to read your comments. But George, thank you so much,
1962480	1967520	as ever, for your brilliant clarity and wisdom. Well, thanks, Owen, then thank you so much for
1967520	1969520	everything you do.
