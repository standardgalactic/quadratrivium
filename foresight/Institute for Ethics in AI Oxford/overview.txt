1. The questioner is curious about whether neural networks follow the scientific method and if they do, how they align with the hypothesis-testing approach inherent in scientific inquiry. They also touch on the opacity of neural networks and wonder if this should lead to abandoning the scientific method.
   
2. Demis responds by emphasizing that while current AI systems are often considered "black boxes," there is a clear goal and effort to make them more transparent, similar to our understanding of the human brain. He points out that we have advanced tools like MRI machines for studying the brain, and we should aim for a comparable level of understanding for artificial neural networks.

3. Demis acknowledges the challenge of studying AI systems due to their dynamic nature, as they evolve over time. However, he believes that we are now reaching a point where current AI systems like large models (e.g., GPT-3) and AlphaFold are complex enough to warrant detailed study.

4. Demis anticipates that over the next decade, there will be significant advancements in understanding how these AI systems work, as researchers are starting to apply neuroscience techniques and analysis methods to artificial intelligence.

5. The questioner and the audience appreciate the lecture for providing insights into a future where AI can coexist with humanity beneficially, and Demis's company has been instrumental in shaping this vision.

In summary, the question addressed the alignment of neural networks with the scientific method, their transparency, and the implications for AI research. Demis's response highlights the importance of increasing the understanding of AI systems through neuroscience techniques and the expectation that we will gain more insights into these systems in the coming years. The overall sentiment is one of optimism for the future of AI and its potential to enhance human capabilities without oppression.
