1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Buzzfeed, with over 20 million subscribers and a wheelhouse of the internet's most

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,600
talented creators, it is simply astounding that a media company can go from having a

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,800
huge presence online to seemingly insignificant overnight.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,440
Whether you hate or love them, there is no denying that Buzzfeed was a media juggernaut

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,380
around 2016 producing some of the most viral videos and getting hordes of users to take

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,880
their quizzes.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,480
Gaining attention from the 20-something crowd, Buzzfeed was a force to be reckoned with,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,880
but with such a strong cold on the online community and their numbers reinforcing that,

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,080
how in the world did this massive enterprise lose their audience?

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Competition related.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
But, I'm sorry, I just don't buy this.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,680
Yes, it is true that competition and the algorithm can have an effect on viewership, but if individual

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,760
creators were to complain about this exact same thing, we'd be told the exact same thing.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,840
You need to change your content.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,720
The audience is just tired of what you're making.

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,320
So to understand what actually happened, we need to go back to the beginning.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,520
There was something very alluring about working for Buzzfeed around the mid-2010s, to young

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,360
millennials and even older Gen Z.

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,800
The company culture depicted in the content embodied everything they valued in a career.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,680
An office job didn't mean you had to be confined to a cubicle working on demoralizing tasks.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,080
Buzzfeed looked like it valued the creativity of young creators who knew the internet, allowing

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,240
them to produce unconventional content to comparison to legacy media.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,600
The environment was fun, with some offices featuring a myriad of snacks, beer on tap,

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
bean bags and those egg chairs.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,160
It was collaborative with open plan layouts and your coworkers around the same age as

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
you.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,880
At the same time, employees at the company didn't seem like they had to live the life

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
of a starving artist.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,600
They had things like paid holidays, a 401k plan with company match, dental and medical

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
benefits.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,040
This was a place where you could be a YouTuber without having to completely sacrifice your

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
free time.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,880
While the amenities are certainly enticing, I think a lot of what made this type of environment

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,040
appealing to young people is how innovative they seemed.

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,240
We are filming a Buzzfeed video.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,760
They represented a new generation of creators who didn't have to answer to the gatekeepers

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,600
of legacy media.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,440
Buzzfeed knew the internet, and this was very apparent in their origin story.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,200
If you had met Jonah Peretti before the launch of the billion dollar media company, you almost

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,320
wouldn't expect him to be its CEO.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,080
In 2001, while working on his master's thesis, Peretti did what any other grad student would

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
do.

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Rastinate.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,560
A friend of Peretti had told him that Nike launched a service where you could customize

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
your own shoes.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,760
I went and I think first tried a four letter word and it rejected it.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,320
And so I was trying to figure out how the system worked and just to clarify, you could

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,600
get any word you wanted printed on the Nike-ish, on the side of a pair of Nike-ish, right?

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah, although they had blacklisted a bunch of words, so I was trying to figure out which

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,400
words did they blacklist and then I put the word sweatshop in and it went through.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,400
So I was like, oh, I can get a pair of Nike's that say sweatshop under the swoosh.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,000
However, the next day, he received an email from a Nike rep that stated the word sweatshop

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
was inappropriate slang.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,320
And so I just responded to the email and said, no, it's in the dictionary, it means a shopper

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,240
factory where workers toil under unhealthy conditions, now can you send me the shoes?

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,360
And then they wrote back another excuse and we were having this back and forth, which

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,880
if you're procrastinating writing a paper, this is perfect, right?

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,480
You're just like back and forth.

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,200
And then eventually they said, we reserve the right to not put that in the shoe.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,520
You have to change the ID and I said, okay, I'll change the ID, but can you at least

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,960
send me a picture of the 10 year old Vietnamese girl who stitches the shoes together?

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,480
And then they didn't write back after that.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Today, a documented exchange like that posted on Twitter or TikTok would likely go viral

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,800
while the internet was a different place back in 2001.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,480
Virality didn't mean followers or views.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,040
YouTube didn't even exist back then.

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Instead, Reddy sent the emails between him and Nike to a few of his friends.

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,760
And then they forwarded it to a bunch of their friends, so on and so forth.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,800
Soon, he was getting thousands of responses from strangers, from death threats to marriage proposals.

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
He even landed in the inboxes of the activist community.

71
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,360
Reporters started calling him and somehow Jonah Peretti, a grad student who was just procrastinating,

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,080
who only had a surface understanding of sweatshops.

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,880
An undercover investigation by Seven News discovered factory workers being paid a pittance

74
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
and forced to live in squalor while Nike's stars had a fortune.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,800
Somehow, ended up on the Today show with Katie Couric and Nike's head of global PR.

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,320
Peretti was enthralled by the results and wondered if it was replicable,

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,400
if so, it would disrupt traditional media entirely.

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,200
But the experts he talked to were pessimistic.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,360
They attributed Peretti's short-lived fame to a fluke.

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,040
There was no formula to going viral.

81
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Desperate to prove them wrong, he launched other projects in an attempt to replicate his results,

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,840
one of which was the rejection hotline,

83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,040
which was a number you'd give to strangers hating on you that couldn't take no for an answer.

84
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,320
They'd be forwarded to an automated rejection message.

85
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,920
Welcome to the New York City rejection line, brought to you by rejectionline.com.

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Unfortunately, the person who gave you this number does not want to talk to you or speak to you again.

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,760
We would like to take this opportunity to officially reject you.

88
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,800
Our certified rejection specialists are waiting to serve you in your time of need.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,480
So his other project was a project called blackpeoplelovers.com

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,400
and it's a satirical website about those white friends who are kind of too proud

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,040
that they have black friends that it becomes racist again.

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
This one got them on Good Morning America to talk about race relations in America.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,240
These projects kind of seemed like something you'd find during BuzzFeed's peak in 2016.

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,360
Despite the naysayers, the formula of going viral was replicated and it was moving fast.

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
The noise Peretti was making caught the attention of retired executive Ken Lair and Ariana Huffington.

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,240
Impressed by his ideas about the internet, Lair and Huffington proposed to start an online news business with Peretti.

97
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,680
They knew news and he knew the internet and in 2005, they launched the Huffington Post.

98
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,160
During his time at Huffington Post, Peretti didn't have the freedom to experiment with this new distribution method

99
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
via the internet and viewers as much as he wanted.

100
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,200
So we started a side project called BuzzFeed Labs with John Johnson just one year later in 2006.

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,040
The growth was consistent, but it really took off when social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter became viable.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,440
BuzzFeed's formula turned out to be wildly effective on these platforms

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,280
because they weren't trying to usurp viewership from legacy media such as TV or newspapers.

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,480
Instead, they found a new demographic in need of entertainment.

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,280
Peretti coins this demo as the board at work network and the board in line network.

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,960
There's literally millions of board office workers

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,760
I don't want to work

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,120
who spend half of their day working and half of their day on Facebook, on Twitter, sharing media,

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,320
I am in each other, emailing each other, collectively that you can reach more people through the board at work network

110
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,040
than the BBC reaches or NBC or CVS or any of the major networks, literally hundreds of millions of people.

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Bam.

112
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,840
That initially weren't even aware that they were creating a network, but are now the biggest network in the world.

113
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,080
This network of board people was made possible with the rise of the internet and mobile devices.

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,120
These new consumers resulted in BuzzFeed having to take an alternative route in regards to the quality of content produced.

115
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,640
I think the biggest misconception people had was that the way to do it was to focus on quality,

116
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,960
that quality is all that matters.

117
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,200
If you make something that's really high quality, it'll be, it'll go viral.

118
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,760
And the truth is that quality helps you a lot, but there's tons of really high quality things that don't go anywhere and don't really spread much.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,160
So this new media company felt that views were great, but what's even better is shares.

120
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,840
How do we create content that is shareable?

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,880
If you think about the board in line and work network, these people aren't looking to consume media that's on par with movies or TV.

122
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,480
This requires way too much focus and time.

123
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,680
How can anyone in the world concentrate on a movie while in line?

124
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,880
Often, these viewers are looking for something that's interesting enough to catch your attention,

125
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,200
yet not too long or intellectually demanding that they risk getting distracted and being caught by their boss.

126
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,960
And so this pretty much explains the reduction in quality you usually associate BuzzFeed with.

127
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,880
The listicles, the cute animals, the quizzes.

128
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
Boy, are there quizzes life changing.

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:27,600
I found out tons of stuff I didn't know about myself, like what mood I was in.

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Never would have known that, how many kids I'll have, it seems important to know.

131
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,400
My inner LaCroix flavor.

132
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Of course, BuzzFeed did have a journalism portion for more serious stories.

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,360
This wasn't what they were popular for.

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,840
Lastly, BuzzFeed found that the board network tended to share content that facilitated social connection, a human fundamental need.

135
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,760
You don't tend to connect with someone by sharing the Wikipedia definition of a Basset Hound.

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,320
You show them a funny picture of your dog, then they may relate because their dog makes funny faces too.

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,560
When you look at these pictures of Basset Hounds running, this isn't what Larry and Sergey had in mind when they created Google.

138
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,200
Nobody types in, I want to see some pictures of Basset Hounds running unless they've already heard about them or discovered them somewhere else.

139
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,480
But Basset Hounds turn out to work very well on the social web because they're both cute and LOL.

140
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,560
And so here's a BuzzFeed post with over a million views.

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,040
And the reason people share it is because humor is inherently social.

142
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:32,160
While modern internet users may scoff at what was going viral in 2006, things that go viral now still follow the underlying formula BuzzFeed has been using.

143
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,600
Content for the board network that is reduced in quality that facilitates social connection.

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,160
While all of this was happening, there was something else that was making waves on the internet.

145
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,840
The rise of online video.

146
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,080
And Peretti and his team just couldn't pass up on this opportunity.

147
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,920
This is BuzzFeed motion pictures.

148
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,280
Opening up a studio in Los Angeles called BuzzFeed Motion Pictures and working with internet video legend, Zay Frank.

149
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,800
Words, words, words, words, words, words, words.

150
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,560
They launched their own YouTube channel in 2012.

151
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,440
With implementation of their formula to going viral, their success was wild.

152
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,160
Women became mermaids for a day, 17 million views.

153
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,960
I only said yes to my kids for a week and boyfriends stressed their girlfriends 18 million.

154
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,600
People try fire cupping therapy, 21 mil.

155
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,040
Exes get handcuffed for 24 hours, 24 million.

156
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,520
And like clockwork, these videos dominated YouTube.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,560
Obviously, financial resources are a huge part of why these videos did well.

158
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,960
But it's undeniable that other companies who sure may not have had as much financial backing as BuzzFeed,

159
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,760
but certainly had more than your average creator.

160
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,640
These media companies like Clever or Howcast still didn't have the fan-based BuzzFeed did.

161
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,400
So it isn't just about monetary advantage.

162
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,000
You've made a business out of going viral and what would you say the secret to that is?

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,520
I think not a lot of credit is given to these early video producers.

164
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Working on film sets for like the last week and a half means I'm just being fed like a

165
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,440
steady diet of pizza like every day, which is fine.

166
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,840
I have no problem with that.

167
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,000
It also means we're exhausted as f***.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,560
I felt like a lot of these guys made stuff that was authentic to them,

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,200
which was what allowed YouTube to emerge in the market in the first place.

170
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,120
Authenticity was a huge reason there was an audience for the kid who wanted to rant to the camera.

171
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
BuzzFeed videos were shot in various ways.

172
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,960
Some leaned towards a more vlog-style format.

173
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,200
Others looked like a highly produced reality TV show.

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,880
And many a blend of both.

175
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,080
But what tied viewers' favorites together was authenticity.

176
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,160
Even their skits exuded this level of authenticity and genuineness fit for YouTube.

177
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
And I know what you're thinking.

178
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Skits, that's the opposite of authenticity, that's acting.

179
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,640
But back when YouTubers did skits more, there was a certain way it was done.

180
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,080
When you would subscribe to sketch YouTubers like Ryan Kiga or Lilly Singh,

181
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,400
you weren't subscribing just to hear their opinion, you were subscribing for them.

182
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
You wanted to hear them not just talk about a topic,

183
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,000
but actually creatively convey their ideas through sketches, through skits.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,320
When very small, it's significant formatting choice,

185
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
where I could tell BuzzFeed knew what they were doing when it came to their skits.

186
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
Was their choice to use their real names in these videos?

187
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh my god, please.

188
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
I need you to watch my little brother.

189
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,680
They didn't format it like an acting thing like SNL or Mad TV.

190
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,440
This was what YouTubers did.

191
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
And BuzzFeed did the same.

192
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,960
Viewers would respond to this content the way they would an early Smosh video.

193
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:48,040
Viewers can expect more, and find new prices to fall, if we commit.

194
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,520
Investors were impressed by the digital outlet's massive success.

195
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,080
Unlike other internet companies, somehow, BuzzFeed was able to factory assemble authenticity at scale.

196
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
The investments started to pour in.

197
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,240
This would drastically affect the dynamics of the company.

198
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
We all got pins and buttons when we made good videos,

199
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,880
and that was sort of a weird cult-ish currency.

200
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,480
There's some great fucking company at work!

201
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,520
There was a pin that had some guy's face on it, or a YouTube hit.

202
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
There was a different kind of pin.

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,120
Based on benchmarks.

204
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,840
Yeah, for a Facebook hit.

205
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,960
One day they go, look at this beautiful hoodie, and everyone goes,

206
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,040
Oh, beautiful hoodie.

207
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
And they say, we've gotten one for all of you.

208
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,600
If you'd like to win it, you must get a video that gets to one million in one week.

209
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,360
It was kind of the cult at that level, because we really wanted buttons.

210
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,640
But BuzzFeed, it was like, oh, we're going to give you like,

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,680
let-a-me-buddy, or anything for making us millions of dollars.

212
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,200
Um, here's a button, and then everybody clapped.

213
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,240
And then, like, there were, I remember, like, some of the top producers who,

214
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,840
like, had, like, a whole jar full of, full of buttons, and I just go, God, like...

215
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,880
I want, I want that.

216
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
When you got your hoodie, though, it was like your SNL jacket.

217
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,560
It was like, welcome to the club, buddy.

218
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,680
And we all drank the fucking Kool-Aid.

219
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Big investments meant BuzzFeed needed to hit Lotus.

220
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,800
And I'm sure, while poorly executed, this was BuzzFeed's attempt at motivating its employees to do so.

221
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,920
The reality of running a media company where revenue is mostly reliant on ads

222
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,840
is you need to do well in viewership.

223
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,320
The end goal of views, however, additionally started to affect authenticity.

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
I just had a copy of another friend of ours who worked there.

225
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,680
She felt pressured to use her own set as a story for a video.

226
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
They were like, you have to make this personal, or it's not going to do well, it's not going to go well.

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,680
So she was like, I had processed that trauma.

228
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,280
I was like, I didn't want to talk to people about it.

229
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,280
I always felt this pressure between, it was my duty to make stuff that was really vulnerable

230
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,280
because the comments were all people being like, you know, I'm bisexual and I've never seen myself like this.

231
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
And thank you so much.

232
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
And so I was like, I have a duty to these young kids, but also I'm not ready to talk about it.

233
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,280
But I have to because I have a duty to these young kids who are now all looking up to me,

234
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,280
which is like hundreds of thousands of people when yesterday nobody was.

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Yeah.

236
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,280
And, and also like I have to make sure that the video does well and I have to like be in it.

237
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Also, I haven't spoken to my parents about this aspect of my life.

238
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Here we go.

239
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,280
The pressure to hit quotas created the section of video producers that, yes,

240
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
made content that was authentic to them.

241
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
But at the same time, these videos were life events.

242
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,280
They hadn't fully processed yet.

243
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,280
It's just that fine line that's so like toxic and hard is like when people feel that pressure.

244
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,280
And like sharing that I'm just like, God, I feel so bad because at the time,

245
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,280
like being a manager and like overseeing like a lot of the videos,

246
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
there's sometimes when you really want to be like, wait, like, should we producing this?

247
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Like, let's take a step back.

248
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Although trouble was beginning to brew in the background, the digital outlet didn't address it.

249
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,280
As the adoption of this approach actually resulted in a significant number of cast members achieving widespread success,

250
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,280
paving the way for some of the channel's most popular series.

251
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,280
We saw the rise of shows like the Try Guys.

252
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,280
As their name illustrates, it's simply a series about a group of guys who will pretty much try anything for your entertainment.

253
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Fans raved about Ladylike, which is a series similar to the Try Guys,

254
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,280
but featured a group of women and focus was more on attempting activities perceived as traditionally feminine.

255
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
You had worth it where the hosts would try dishes at different price points.

256
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Then you had unsolved in which cast members would discuss unsolved crimes or investigate alleged haunted locations.

257
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,280
A lot of cast members who were successful in their endeavors were awarded opportunities outside of the internet company.

258
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Streaming services bought their shows, they were featured on TV, and some even got the invite to meet up with big-time celebrities.

259
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:30,280
By 2016, they had become a juggernaut on YouTube, able to produce and outpace your average creator.

260
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:38,280
This newfound fame garnered by Buzzfeed cast members turned the company into a sought-out job for 20-something aspiring video producers.

261
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Everyone wanted to work here, and competition to get in was high.

262
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I think I applied five different times, and on the fifth try, things worked out.

263
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Buzzfeed was in my head at the time. They were a cool company.

264
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I agree during the mid-2010s, or somewhere in the mid-2010s, was when they were at their peak.

265
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I wanted to work there. I had a few friends who wanted to work there.

266
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:37,280
It was perceived as a good spot to work in media, especially because I think there was news that they just turned down an acquisition offer from Disney.

267
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
So I was like, okay, this place is, like, bumpin'.

268
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
When I first got to Buzzfeed, Buzzfeed was really exciting.

269
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Hi! This is exciting. Sort of a big event.

270
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Buzzfeed kind of felt like it was at the center of the universe, because we were doing more video impressions than anyone else.

271
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
This introduced yet another dynamic into the business.

272
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Many have been vocal about how the cutthroat nature to land a job at Buzzfeed led to a work environment that they claim is toxic.

273
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:26,280
The work environment at Buzzfeed was one of the most toxic, sick, and exploitive processes that I have ever been through.

274
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:36,280
And as a kid, when you're a young person working in entertainment, you don't get it.

275
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,280
They would do these videos, like people try X, right?

276
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Like, so someone came up with the great idea.

277
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Oh, you can drink your own piss. Let's have people drink their own urine for the first time.

278
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,280
The video gets approved by the higher-ups at Buzzfeed.

279
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Sure, it's a great video. Bear Grylls did it, right?

280
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Bear Grylls' drink is pissed. Let's have people drink piss.

281
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,280
So they staff it. They have Buzzfeeders who are willing to do it.

282
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,280
The Buzzfeeders drink their own piss. They film this video, they edit it, and they release it.

283
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I swear to God.

284
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
My piss look way more yellow.

285
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh my God. That's not unappetizing.

286
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
It's here. It's like staring me in the face.

287
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
And it's performing well, and then someone has an epiphany.

288
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Wait a minute.

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Every single person in this video is an intern.

290
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
There's not one full employee in this video.

291
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:50,280
All of these people in this video that just drank their own piss are in a competitive internship.

292
00:21:50,280 --> 00:22:11,280
So Buzzfeed, just unbeknowingly, forced interns in a competitive internship to drink their own piss for a shot at being hired at the company.

293
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,280
So it didn't sign any NDAs or anything?

294
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,280
No. I'm free to talk however you want.

295
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,280
My name is Aleister Bostwick.

296
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
My role at the company was a video producer, video journalist.

297
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I actually worked under Buzzfeed News.

298
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
And when did I work?

299
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Like 2015 to 2017-ish?

300
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
I want to preference.

301
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I am not hung up on this story. It does not bother me at all.

302
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,280
And I would never bring it up except for you seem to think it's relevant or interesting.

303
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,280
So I'll share it, which is very early into my time at Buzzfeed.

304
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Probably a month into working at Buzzfeed as an intern.

305
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Bear in mind I had just moved from Kansas, rural Kansas, in my car to New York City.

306
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I was 23 at the time. I was an intern being paid $15 an hour, living in East Harlem.

307
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
One month into this gig, I wanted to do really well. I was working really hard.

308
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I really wanted to get this job full-time.

309
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,280
And the Try Guys roll up to New York City because they're based out of Los Angeles.

310
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
And Keith wants to shoot this video in New York.

311
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,280
So I volunteer to help him on a shoot along with another producer.

312
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,280
And I'm essentially his cameraman for the day. It was a very long shoot.

313
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,280
And we go to the farmer's market in Union Square.

314
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,280
We go to some shops in Flatiron. He tries on some clothes.

315
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
We're going all up and downtown.

316
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Eventually we go up to Central Park.

317
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,280
We arrive at a lower boat house, which is you can rent some boats.

318
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,280
And on this boat where I'm filming him talk about something banal or entertaining,

319
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,280
I pop in a dip chewing tobacco because I'm from Kansas.

320
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm an unsophisticated hick.

321
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
It's a pinch between my cheek and gum gives me real tobacco pleasure.

322
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
And continue the film very seratiously.

323
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
We wrap the shoot probably around 7 p.m.

324
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Nothing.

325
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Seemed fine.

326
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Next day I come into the office. The Try Guys have left. Keith have left.

327
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
And my manager, when I was just an intern at the time, pulled me aside and he said,

328
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
hey, Keith complained about you.

329
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
He said that dipping was not BuzzFeed culture.

330
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
He doesn't think you're a good fit. It really bothered him.

331
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,280
And I was so stunned by that because he had never said anything to my face.

332
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,280
The entire 12 hour shoot.

333
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,280
And from the Midwest when you have a premiere, just confrontational.

334
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,280
And so I learned, oh, Keith is entertaining, but he's somewhat of a corporate weasel.

335
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,280
That he is willing to play pretend and be nice to my face for 12 hours.

336
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,280
So I help him out at $15 an hour.

337
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,280
And then complain behind my back to my manager without saying a word to me.

338
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,280
These cases could certainly be the result of a new company lacking proper structure

339
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,280
rather than being purposefully exploitative.

340
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Whatever the case, one thing is clear.

341
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,280
The results always end up negatively for newcomers.

342
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Former employee Will Neff has been vocal about his time at the company

343
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
and makes it very clear how the competitive nature to land a role at BuzzFeed

344
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
facilitated a toxic work environment.

345
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,280
There was an intense pressure for interns to perform at the expense of themselves

346
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
in order to impress their superiors.

347
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,280
He claims being put through long and extreme work hours.

348
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,280
Recalling a time where he got into a car accident on the way to do his interview

349
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,280
to be promoted to fellow, the next level to intern.

350
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Neff wanted the job so bad he chose to proceed directly to the scheduled interview

351
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
instead of going home.

352
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I have this interview still like, oh my God, oh my God.

353
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
My heart is just...

354
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,280
I was like so dialed in.

355
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,280
So dialed in and I was like, I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this.

356
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,280
And I was like, after the interview immediately I felt very sick.

357
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
And I started to ask, I was like, should I go home?

358
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I was just in a car crash.

359
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,280
And they were like, no, no, no, they need you for this vajazzling video, do that.

360
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,280
He showed up to the shoot in the now uploaded video called

361
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
People Get Vajazzles for the first time.

362
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
And this talent had to get their genitals waxed and cleaned

363
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,280
in order to be prepped for having crystals glued onto them.

364
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Yeah, that's the video.

365
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,280
This was filmed in a small room with a crew of around three, plus the technician,

366
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,280
plus the owner of the salon, watching.

367
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
The bottom half of cast members clothing removed.

368
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Nef makes it clear that this is a typical Buzzfeed video

369
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,280
and this was the kind of stuff he signed up for.

370
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Scribing himself as often playing the himbo, he'd be dramatic, chaotic,

371
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,280
and was comfortable wearing provocative or even no clothing on camera.

372
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,280
However, he does hint at the fact that people competing for job security

373
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,280
shouldn't be pressured to participate in this type of content.

374
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,280
And that Buzzfeed should have had some sort of checks and balances for this.

375
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
After his promotion to fellow was confirmed,

376
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Nef had to work hard into producing a video that showed his supervisors

377
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,280
he was able to garner massive viewership to hit quotas.

378
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Fortunately, an opportunity presented itself for him

379
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,280
to make a video with the renowned ensemble, The Try Guys.

380
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,280
The series was doing numbers, which meant whatever he made with them

381
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
would definitely do well.

382
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,280
And this would certainly impress his supervisors.

383
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
His pitch was equally as good.

384
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Try Guys create iconic Playboy centerfold covers.

385
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,280
The pitch was approved and the video was shot.

386
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
The guys did their thing posing in different famous Playboy poses.

387
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Typical Try Guys million-viewed idea.

388
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
This would be the video that would solidify Nef's chances

389
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,280
of being promoted from fellow and moving on to becoming full-time.

390
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Now at the time, Buzzfeed was in the middle of a move

391
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,280
in which employees were to pack up their belongings into boxes

392
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
and label them to be transported into another facility.

393
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Upon arrival at the new building, Nef discovered

394
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,280
that the hard drive from his box that contained the Try Guys footage was missing.

395
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,280
And I searched everywhere for this fucking hard drive.

396
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
I searched everywhere.

397
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
It had a Try Guys video on it.

398
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
This was a video that was going to take me to the next level.

399
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
And it was gone.

400
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,280
When I go to my bosses at the time, I tell them,

401
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm like, guys, I can't find my hard drive.

402
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,280
And it has three videos in progress on it.

403
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:42,280
And at that point, we had to turn over 1.5 videos every week.

404
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I was like, I need time to get back to doing what I was doing.

405
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,280
And they're like, no, you need to produce a video this week.

406
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
The show must go on!

407
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,280
So they just kept rolling.

408
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,280
And they blamed me for this equipment being lost.

409
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,280
They blamed me for this video going missing.

410
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Even though it was the only piece of equipment in the move that disappeared.

411
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,280
And to this day, I have no idea what happened to this piece of equipment.

412
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,280
This was only one of many things in which Neff claims was done to undermine his prospects for success.

413
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,280
He also, for some reason, was not able to book interns to help him with a lot of other productions,

414
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
even though other fellows were able to.

415
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:34,280
He began scrambling to make videos that showed his bosses that he could produce the metrics they needed.

416
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Upon the conclusion of his time as fellow, Neff did not attain the coveted transition to becoming a full-time employee.

417
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:52,280
The thing that made me sure that someone had it out for me was on the way out,

418
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I turned my email address over and give all my equipment back.

419
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
And I say goodbye to everybody.

420
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,280
And a lot of people are shocked that I'm leaving.

421
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Two days later, I get a call from Cody and he's like, dude, I got to talk to you about something.

422
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I was like, yeah, what is it?

423
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:24,280
And he was like, I'm going over your final credit card statement.

424
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Now they gave us credit cards to be able to produce content, right?

425
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Going over your final credit card statement.

426
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Did you buy a new iPhone on your credit card the week you were leaving?

427
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,280
And I was like, what? No.

428
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:59,280
If that had been anybody but Cody, I would have been because someone took my credit card after I turned it in and bought a cell phone on them.

429
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Just to further incriminate and disenfranchise me to the company.

430
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,280
But Cody was an absolute homie and he was my friend and I don't think he believed it for a moment.

431
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
And so I left the company.

432
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
It was the end of my tenure.

433
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,280
It was the end of my time at BuzzFeed.

434
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:25,280
The only logical conclusion as to why I think BuzzFeed didn't address this growing problem is I got cocky.

435
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Despite this growing number of people feeling like the work environment was unsustainable or perhaps just a new restructuring needed to happen with leadership,

436
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:45,280
the company was probably counting on the fact that they could easily replace them with another aspiring young filmmaker looking for exposure.

437
00:31:45,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Even if one of their heavy hitters were to burn out, maybe at that point they felt like it didn't matter that their reach was already so big it'd be impossible to fail.

438
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Another element that made the digital outlets content successful was their ability to use identity to create shareable content.

439
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,280
They found that users were cognizant that the content they shared was a reflection of their identity.

440
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:23,280
In other words, users were sharing things that they thought made them look good or showcased a part of their personality they wanted to express.

441
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Sometimes people will say, oh, well, if you want to make something really viral, why don't you just post porn or something?

442
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,280
But porn isn't viral because people don't want to share email porn to all their friends.

443
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,280
Maybe people will click on it or search for it.

444
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:47,280
They certainly do, but it's not usually viral because it doesn't tap into the social side of human nature of wanting to share things and pass things along.

445
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
People share stuff because it's about them.

446
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Some primetime show that every 80% of people sort of like doesn't get shared at all on the web,

447
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,280
but something that only 10% of people feel passionate about gets shared a lot.

448
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Given how strongly people identify with political stances and social issues, content in this genre has always been among the most shared.

449
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Now BuzzFeed has released a number of videos that truly highlighted a number of social injustices many were ignorant of.

450
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:27,280
However, when meeting viewership quota became more and more important, video producers were incentivized to make more content in this area simply because they knew it would get more views.

451
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,280
This is how, in my opinion, you got content like women trying pan spreading for a week.

452
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Man spreading is when a man spreads his physical body to take up as much space as humanly possible.

453
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:46,280
The people around you are relegated to a very small portion, but the key to man spreading is not noticing.

454
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:59,280
You have a naturally progressive employees that know their audience is progressive by this point and then can lean hard into that identity to get more views.

455
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:08,280
So you know, okay, what we want to do is we want to lean into our own audience but also trigger the conservatives.

456
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Just as there's the kind of like trigger the libs meme, the people at BuzzFeed were certainly well aware that they were triggering the conservatives by doing catchy, ridiculous things like women try man-spanning.

457
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Like there is some meta-self-awareness when I was there at BuzzFeed that they knew they were needling, that they would get hate and get reaction, but that's fine because ultimately what you want is views, you just want engagement.

458
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Content like this seemed to function in a way that it received the outrage click of a usually conservative leaning individual while simultaneously capturing the click of a liberal leaning person interested in taking down the patriarchy.

459
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,280
The video did well because of this view-wise.

460
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,280
But it got so much backlash. The comments are turned off.

461
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:06,280
And I think that's because even for someone who is liberal, this typically isn't the issue to prioritize. No one is out on the streets protesting this.

462
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I think what's annoying about these I tried videos, at least to me, is that it seems like all of them can be boiled down to somebody saying, I'm going to do blank for a week.

463
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:22,280
And they'll proceed to film themselves before doing said thing and after to tell us how they feel before and after doing it, but rarely ever show us them actually doing what's in the title.

464
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,280
I think they do it on purpose because if they were to actually show the footage of them doing it, it just makes you realize how dumb it is.

465
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Man-spreading for a week is just watching somebody sit obnoxiously on a bus.

466
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
And half the time they weren't even really man-spreading.

467
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,280
They were just taking up as many seats as possible, trying to attach some deeper meaning to it.

468
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Like you were just annoying for a week.

469
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,280
But this formula in communicating social issues was the way to meet their quota.

470
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:59,280
The most interesting one to me was I went down to Mexico to kind of report and cover the way the United States handles deportation on the border.

471
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Like what happens when illegal immigrants or whatever term we want to use cross the border, get caught by ICE, and then are not granted asylum and they're just deported.

472
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Like what does that look like?

473
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Do you remember how well that video did in terms of views?

474
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Yeah, terribly. Nobody cared.

475
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:33,280
The system in place at BuzzFeed discouraged, certainly taking topical risks outside of tried and true methods.

476
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:42,280
And so you got the videos like we painted with our period blood that captured individuals all over the political spectrum, for different reasons of course.

477
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
We all leaned into the fact that it smelled awful.

478
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Oh, it smells.

479
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Can you smell it?

480
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
It hit over here, yeah, it did.

481
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Its intent supposedly was to normalize periods, but I think it's done the opposite.

482
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,280
But I guess a view is a view is a view.

483
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,280
As is the natural progression of anything that is commodified and turned into a business.

484
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,280
BuzzFeed inadvertently helped to create the aesthetic of left leaning progressive values.

485
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,280
They turned it into a brand pushing its core ideological principles into the background.

486
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,280
A fan life on social media was a glorified and romanticized version of camping.

487
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,280
BuzzFeed was this when it came to left leaning political issues.

488
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
It was very akin to an influencer lifestyle.

489
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Some have claimed that this service level aesthetic was seeping into company culture.

490
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Timothy Jonay was hired by the digital outlet to grow and manage a number of the company's social media accounts.

491
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I didn't even remember applying and they're like, hey, it's BuzzFeed.

492
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Can you come in tomorrow?

493
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
And I was like, I already gave up on my Hollywood dream.

494
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I'm going home.

495
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
And they're like, no, we're really serious.

496
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
And I'm like, I had been looking for jobs for like six months.

497
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I couldn't find anything out here.

498
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Loved everything I did.

499
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,280
They loved my work on Twitter and YouTube.

500
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,280
And they hired me right away.

501
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,280
It was easy to discount his abilities as he was an unlikely candidate for the job based on his appearance.

502
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,280
What does a trap rapper from Alaska know about growing social media?

503
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
But he did well.

504
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,280
In just six months, he helped to grow the outlets Instagram and Twitter for tasty BuzzFeed's food show.

505
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Jonay also appeared as a regular in a number of the outlets videos.

506
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
He fit right in.

507
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,280
However, as BuzzFeed shifted its identity from cute pet videos and relatable content to one of left leaning politics,

508
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,280
and remember not actual left leaning, more like the aesthetic of left leaning.

509
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Employees who did not fit this culture are ostracized, he claims.

510
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Including himself.

511
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Jonay recalls a time where he was talking to a colleague about the new Justin Bieber album.

512
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Dude, that new Justin Bieber album is dope.

513
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I have to admit, I love Justin Bieber.

514
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
He is totally my spirit animal.

515
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:14,280
His colleague promptly interjected, scolding him about the phrase spirit animal due to it appropriating Native American culture.

516
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Jonay tells Yahoo News, there were several instances like this that pushed him further and further right,

517
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
to the point where he eventually came forward in support of Trump.

518
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,280
In the office, he would wear a MAGA hat and even got Trump tattooed on his body.

519
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Subsequently, he found himself subjected to ridicule.

520
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,280
He became the guy no one wanted to talk to.

521
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Yeah, when I came out that I supported Trump, I was treated like I had leprosy or something.

522
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:52,280
They stopped inviting me to meetings, and then shortly I quit because it was just so tough for me to even be at that office.

523
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,280
You would probably know Timothy Jonay today as Baked Alaska.

524
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,280
The guy who not only publishes far right controversial content on socials,

525
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,280
but was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, participating in the capital rights.

526
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Colleagues of his, such as Wilnef, believed that the Buzzfeed work environment did indeed have a hand at radicalizing Jonay.

527
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,280
To be clear, this isn't supposed to be a sob story about someone who was ousted for their differing political ideology.

528
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,280
If you're familiar with the Baked Alaska brand, it's possible there may have been some provoking and back and forth we aren't privy to.

529
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Where I believe he was radicalized is how he saw the relationship between politics and viral content.

530
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Jonay learned at Buzzfeed that if you leaned into an identity that not necessarily focused too much on its core values, the internet would reward you.

531
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:58,280
In a New York Times article by Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed News, Smith kind of confirms this point, calling the story of Baked Alaska something different.

532
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,280
The sort of social media power that we help sharpen at Buzzfeed, that can exert an almost irresistible gravitational pull.

533
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:18,280
If you haven't had the experience of posting something on social media that goes truly viral, you may not understand its profound emotional attraction.

534
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:25,280
You're suddenly the center of a digital universe, getting more attention from more people than you've ever had.

535
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,280
The rush of affirmation can be giddy and addictive.

536
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,280
And if you have little else to hold on to, you can lose yourself.

537
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Jonay took what he had learned at the digital outlet, and he did the same with right-leaning values.

538
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Smith is sure to separate the company's actions in Jonay, though, stating,

539
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Of course, using the aesthetic of a political ideology is the best way to get an idea to spread via the internet.

540
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,280
But we don't go as far as Jonay, because we're a news organization.

541
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:25,280
His story leaves me wondering, what's Sheriff Blaine, those of us who pioneered the use of social media to deliver information deserve at this moment?

542
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Did we, along with the creators of those platforms, help open Andorra's box?

543
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Buzzfeed had really benefited tremendously from being early adapters of BLM and a lot of progressive movements, but they were doing it in a totally performative way.

544
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Thank you so much.

545
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,280
And then they make this video, like, I think it's like 20 things all black people do.

546
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,280
And the thing was, our checks and balances for making these videos was like one black person.

547
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,280
And if they were like, yeah, that's cool, the video would get made.

548
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
So they got this, like, sign off from one black person.

549
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
The video was tremendously offensive.

550
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,280
It basically talked about, like, black people hoarding shoes and stuff like that.

551
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,280
And so black Twitter was like, wait a minute, what the f... this isn't bull...

552
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Why do we call each other the N-word, but get vehemently upset when a white person uses the N-word?

553
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Why can't I love school and also be black?

554
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:46,280
And then that's like when Buzzfeed and kind of the progressive movement had this splinter where the progressive movement realized like, oh, Buzzfeed is dead, they don't give a f...

555
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
They're just making these videos to get views.

556
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:58,280
And they went to Twitter to apologize for putting that video out saying that, uh, saying something like, uh, we made a mistake and we want to get another chance at earning the black people's trust.

557
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,280
For Buzzfeed, when I first was brought on back, during my first interview, it was strictly for diversity.

558
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,280
Then when I was applying to stay at Buzzfeed, it was for their diversity team.

559
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:26,280
So I come thinking, I'm ready to do diversity, I've got so many ideas down, and then I am told, surprise, our diversity team is drastically cut and we have a place for you, Steph.

560
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,280
We're gonna punt you on the short, scripted, dark comedy team.

561
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Like, what?

562
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,280
At the end of the day, they didn't want more diversity, they want more viral hits, they want more things that would get views.

563
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,280
When they even said, we don't really know where we would place you, I was like, I don't know where you would place me either.

564
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:53,280
I don't think they're wrong for wanting what they want, which is quantity and viral hits, and I don't think I'm wrong for wanting what I want, which is quality and representation.

565
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Buzzfeed, at the end of the day, is a company, and just like any other company, they don't always punt moral values first, they put getting money first.

566
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,280
Because you can't make a living on moral values, unfortunately.

567
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:24,280
When I spoke to former employees for this video, I felt a lot of them had good intentions and truly wanted to produce content that promoted progressive values and not just the surface level image of it for views.

568
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,280
However, I don't know if that matters.

569
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:41,280
In combination with the algorithm and perhaps a video producer feeling the pressure of having to hit a quota, videos like this would get views, and outshined other videos where those core values were clear.

570
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:50,280
But eventually, that made Buzzfeed's core fanbase lose trust with them.

571
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:57,280
And so tweets like this one from the writing department of Buzzfeed Canada would really throw people off of what Buzzfeed's intentions were.

572
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Would you like to write long form for at Buzzfeed Canada? Well, you can.

573
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:10,280
We want pitches for your Canada-centric essays and reporting. What particularly like to hear from you if you are not white and not male.

574
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:19,280
The internet erupted with widespread criticism directed at the digital media outlet, with many accusing the company of promoting racist and sexist hiring practices.

575
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,280
The tweets then doubled down. If you're a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white men, I don't care about you.

576
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Go write for McLean's. Then the random pinned tweet, yo, these pale demons, nothing.

577
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:40,280
Almost all responses were in agreement that it is okay to specifically hire a writer based on the type of content you are looking for.

578
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:50,280
If, for example, you were looking for someone to write a memoir or op-ed about growing up as an Asian American, you are likely going to get few applications from someone who is white.

579
00:46:50,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Whether this be a ploy to solidify that Buzzfeed aesthetic and garner further attention, or if this employee truly meant what they posted, is unclear.

580
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Regardless, the resulting controversy was just one of many incidences that significantly tarnished Buzzfeed's reputation.

581
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:17,280
Making viewers question whether or not they really believe the progressive ideals their content conveyed.

582
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:26,280
And to be clear, it's not really about the joke, if you can call it that. If you watch Stand Up or any other comedy podcasts, they still make these types of jokes.

583
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:37,280
Watch TikTok. They do these and no one really cares. It's just something about those tweets seem to, I don't know, pandering to hostile?

584
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Buzzfeed was crumbling. While they were losing audience trust, the demand for creating a high volume of content began to take a toll on one of the company's main components of their formula. Authenticity.

585
00:47:50,280 --> 00:48:02,280
I did send you a screenshot of a Slack I discovered deep within my computer's hard drive from 2016-2017. Everybody was fudging. The concept's a little bit.

586
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:09,280
I think in the screenshot it shows that the producer's reaching out because he needs people to appear in a Lunchable video. People try Lunchables for the first time.

587
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:17,280
Presenting Lunchables Pizza. Three real crusts with all the toppings. Fun to make and eat.

588
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:27,280
It's like, yo, can you be in my video? Like, have you tried Lunchables? If you haven't. Or if you have, it's all good. Just lie and I'm responding like, it's all good. I've been here a long time. I know how it goes.

589
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:36,280
So there's a mutual understanding of the facade that we're presenting to the audience.

590
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:49,280
The understanding was the pressure to get videos out consistently with a format that once discovered works. Like, these people try some new product they haven't tried before.

591
00:48:49,280 --> 00:49:04,280
These people do something they haven't done before to just run that paradigm into the ground at whatever kind of a cost. You know, whether we're embellishing or there's some hyperbole about who or hasn't tried X or Y in the format.

592
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:15,280
So be it as long as the video is entertaining. But it was never, I don't think explicitly stated to do that, nor was the intent to deliberately mislead any audience.

593
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:25,280
It was a function of the environment people found themselves in Buzzfeed, which was the pressure to produce content.

594
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:34,280
And although their intent wasn't to mislead their audience, I think deep down viewers knew some of these reactions were too over the top.

595
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,280
First food ever. Here I go.

596
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:50,280
That wasn't bad.

597
00:49:50,280 --> 00:50:00,280
Oh my God. Did I just, did I seriously just watch a minute and 25 seconds of this video to hear someone describe a blueberry as not bad?

598
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Just this is content, baby. This is what it's all about.

599
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Which is why viewership for this type of content seem to diminish, yet the format has still been popular on other channels.

600
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Eventually, their high quota would burn out their top talent as well.

601
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Leaving Buzzfeed.

602
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,280
And I'm leaving Buzzfeed for the first time.

603
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,280
I'm going to be talking about why I left Buzzfeed.

604
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,280
Why I left Buzzfeed.

605
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,280
Why I left Buzzfeed.

606
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,280
I left Buzzfeed video.

607
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,280
Anytime a video from like a video producer, a major one would drop like why I left Buzzfeed.

608
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,280
There would always be like rumblings about it on like Slack or maybe even in person.

609
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,280
There was a common theme as to why these creators have decided to leave their job.

610
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,280
To Buzzfeed, in a lot of cases, quantity trumps quality.

611
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,280
They would rather have more videos than fewer good videos.

612
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,280
And the reasoning behind this, I think, is just that the more videos you make, the more money you make generally.

613
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
And there was also a focus on virality.

614
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,280
The videos you make are expected to go viral.

615
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Not all of them, but ideally a lot of them.

616
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,280
There were, there was like pretty high quotas.

617
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,280
And so that meant that you had to be filming a lot and you had to be coming up with new ideas and new content had to be put out.

618
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,280
And so those demands kind of were rising as time went on.

619
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:50,280
But the amount of resources that we were allotted and the amount of faith that it seemed like leaders of the company had in us really seemed to go downhill.

620
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,280
So you're sort of in a situation where a lot is being asked of you.

621
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:01,280
And it sort of feels like the end goal keeps moving further and further away.

622
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Well, there might be some truth to that.

623
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:36,280
The themes in the why I left BuzzFeed content still explain exactly why the channel you knew in 2016 was bound to fail.

624
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,280
It wasn't just the demanding workload.

625
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,280
When you work for a company and make videos, everything that you make, that company owns.

626
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,280
So for instance, you might have heard about some people being let go from BuzzFeed.

627
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:57,280
And those people, the characters and the videos that they, the series that they created while at BuzzFeed, they'll never be able to make that series ever again.

628
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,280
And that's because that is BuzzFeed's intellectual property.

629
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
And that began to scare me.

630
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,280
BuzzFeed said, even that stuff, that's ours.

631
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Do I give them my best ideas?

632
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,280
Later in life, I may want to use those ideas for something and I won't be able to.

633
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,280
And that started worrying me more and more.

634
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,280
It is true that this is the standard at most media companies.

635
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Imagine being a writer for a Marvel movie knowing the weaknesses and strengths of the script.

636
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,280
So you write something else based on the same framework and sell it to DC.

637
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,280
It makes sense for them to have it written in their contract to avoid this type of competition.

638
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:56,280
However, what makes the situation unique from that example is that one of the content these creators produced was based on their real selves.

639
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,280
As we previously mentioned, authenticity is what does numbers on YouTube.

640
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,280
So of course, this was the type of videos they made.

641
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:11,280
For a company to own the IP of something based on yourself, rendering it illegal for you to produce content surrounding you,

642
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,280
is understandable why there would be apprehension in such a scenario.

643
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:22,280
Some creators, specifically Gabby and Allison, for example, they were put in a weird position where they were told,

644
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:29,280
you can't make videos outside of BuzzFeed if you want to work for BuzzFeed or there was some Catch-22 about it,

645
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,280
so they ended up leaving BuzzFeed.

646
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,280
And then for other employees, they were let go for doing outside work.

647
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:44,280
Why do I think so many people left BuzzFeed around 2017 comes to pretty easy, ultimately, simple answers,

648
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,280
which is that the demands of BuzzFeed were pretty strict.

649
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,280
You had hard quotas, you were not paid very much,

650
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:58,280
and by 2017, BuzzFeed had a large enough reputation that you could take your marketable skills,

651
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,280
the fact that you had worked at BuzzFeed, and get a higher salary somewhere else.

652
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:08,280
And I can also then say, why I left BuzzFeed video, and I can generate lots of views,

653
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,280
so it's either the pivoting to another company where they can make more money,

654
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,280
because BuzzFeed didn't pay a lot of money, or they wanted to branch out on their own.

655
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
They felt like they had built up a large enough audience by using BuzzFeed as the vehicle

656
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,280
that they were going to leave now, on top, and then create a why I left BuzzFeed video.

657
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,280
By 2020, many of BuzzFeed's most watched talent had left to go in a different direction.

658
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:36,280
Hosts of Unsolved and one of two of the leads of the show worth that launched the YouTube channel Watcher.

659
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,280
The Try Guys also doing their own thing.

660
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,280
Some shows like Ladylike even disbanded for more mysterious reasons not announced to the public.

661
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Other individuals landed more mainstream jobs.

662
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Devin Little from Ladylike jumped ship for NBC after working at BuzzFeed for five years.

663
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:00,280
Quinta Brunson went on to create Abbott Elementary, which has been nominated for a number of awards.

664
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,280
These members left the digital media company simply because it was more website to being independent.

665
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,280
I think they weren't built at that point for what we were doing,

666
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:16,280
and the reason to leave is because I felt like we were in a box and the box was too small for what we were doing.

667
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:23,280
We had desires to explore this property in a million different directions.

668
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Despite the lack of bad blood, their departure from their on-camera roles also resulted in the departure of their fans.

669
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Viewers came for the authenticity, exuded by a lot of these shows, and once that was gone, they left as well.

670
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,280
In the last couple of minutes, we've learned BuzzFeed has decided to shut down its newsroom.

671
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,280
Yeah, Jose, this is no doubt a rough day for the news business.

672
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,280
So in an email sent to BuzzFeed employees, CEO Jonah Peretti laid out the cuts and the implications there.

673
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,280
BuzzFeed will lay off about 15% of its staff.

674
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:43,280
I think that it doesn't come as a total surprise because the newsroom has been downsizing for several years now.

675
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,280
I reported last week that investors were pushing BuzzFeed to shut down its newsroom then,

676
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,280
and CEO Jonah Peretti fought to keep it alive in many ways, echoing those sentiments today.

677
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,280
If you're a millennial, an end of the end of an era.

678
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,280
So many things have happened since BuzzFeed's peak in 2016.

679
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,280
They've had several layoffs.

680
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:13,280
Former employees sued the digital outlet, alleging they were not permitted to sell their shares for a higher price after the IPO.

681
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:20,280
He had the wife guy cheating on his wife, which I guess technically isn't BuzzFeed, but many people seem to associate to.

682
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,280
Ned Fulmer is no longer working with the Try Guys.

683
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Their news division officially shut down, and despite their millions of subscribers,

684
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,280
a lot of their channels today continue to look like ghost towns, with no recent uploads.

685
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:42,280
We see, once again, changes. The audience is changing, and their habits are changing.

686
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:52,280
So the audience is spending more time on social platforms that involve video, like TikTok and Instagram.

687
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,280
And whereas before, they would be on Twitter, they would be on Facebook and link out,

688
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,280
now they are kind of trapped in those platforms, happily trapped in those platforms,

689
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,280
and it's really hard to fight to get content there.

690
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Talent was dropping faster than they could do so.

691
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:15,280
Whether you think BuzzFeed's work environment was exploitative or not, the bottom line was that their way of doing things,

692
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,280
their system pushed away many of their top performing creators.

693
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,280
Instead of investing in these individuals, paying them more so they stay,

694
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:31,280
I think they took them for granted and likely felt they were replaceable due to their massive reach.

695
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,280
It's true, the BuzzFeed had the formula for virality, but they hardly knew anything about sustainability.

696
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
If you look at the series Unsolved, for instance, which BuzzFeed owns the IP of,

697
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,280
it hardly has any of the attention of when it was hosted by the original duo.

698
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,280
A lot of the comments also express how much they miss the original hosts.

699
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,280
It's not because the new cast is talentless, it's just that what separates YouTube from TV

700
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,280
is the fact that viewers develop the sort of parasocial friendship for creators.

701
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,280
We aren't always watching a video for the idea itself, but for the creator.

702
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,280
Whether it be mundane, like trying different brands of water or grandiose,

703
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:19,280
like competing in a challenge for thousands of dollars, we want to see how XYZ YouTuber reacts.

704
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,280
To turn creativity into a business is a very delicate thing to do,

705
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,280
and I don't know if, I don't know who has done it right at that scale.

706
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,280
At that scale, it's very complicated to do, and I think even at the scales that we're doing it at,

707
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:40,280
it's super complicated to turn just like loose fun creativity into a P&L that works.

708
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,280
I can't imagine what it's like to run a company that's entire business model

709
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,280
is based off of the economics of the internet.

710
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,280
You look at the YouTube channels of many former BuzzFeed employees, for instance,

711
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,280
and their fanbase, unlike the company, is still strong.

712
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,280
How BuzzFeed lost their audience was failing to meet the needs of the people that helped build them.

713
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,280
Of course, if you have the means to do so, as you know, as I posted before,

714
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,280
sponsorships are rare on this channel because sometimes they just don't like the topics that I post.

715
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,280
Either way, thank you for watching. That's the end of the video.

716
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,280
I will see you guys next time. Stay safe.
