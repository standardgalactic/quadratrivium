0	4560	Buzzfeed, with over 20 million subscribers and a wheelhouse of the internet's most
4560	8600	talented creators, it is simply astounding that a media company can go from having a
8600	11800	huge presence online to seemingly insignificant overnight.
11800	16440	Whether you hate or love them, there is no denying that Buzzfeed was a media juggernaut
16440	21380	around 2016 producing some of the most viral videos and getting hordes of users to take
21380	22880	their quizzes.
22880	27480	Gaining attention from the 20-something crowd, Buzzfeed was a force to be reckoned with,
27480	31880	but with such a strong cold on the online community and their numbers reinforcing that,
31880	36080	how in the world did this massive enterprise lose their audience?
58480	60480	Competition related.
60480	63480	But, I'm sorry, I just don't buy this.
63480	69680	Yes, it is true that competition and the algorithm can have an effect on viewership, but if individual
69680	74760	creators were to complain about this exact same thing, we'd be told the exact same thing.
74760	76840	You need to change your content.
76840	80720	The audience is just tired of what you're making.
80720	87320	So to understand what actually happened, we need to go back to the beginning.
87320	91520	There was something very alluring about working for Buzzfeed around the mid-2010s, to young
91520	94360	millennials and even older Gen Z.
94360	98800	The company culture depicted in the content embodied everything they valued in a career.
98800	104680	An office job didn't mean you had to be confined to a cubicle working on demoralizing tasks.
104680	109080	Buzzfeed looked like it valued the creativity of young creators who knew the internet, allowing
109080	113240	them to produce unconventional content to comparison to legacy media.
113240	118600	The environment was fun, with some offices featuring a myriad of snacks, beer on tap,
118600	120800	bean bags and those egg chairs.
120800	125160	It was collaborative with open plan layouts and your coworkers around the same age as
125160	126160	you.
126160	129880	At the same time, employees at the company didn't seem like they had to live the life
129880	131160	of a starving artist.
131160	136600	They had things like paid holidays, a 401k plan with company match, dental and medical
136600	138000	benefits.
138000	142040	This was a place where you could be a YouTuber without having to completely sacrifice your
142040	143040	free time.
143040	147880	While the amenities are certainly enticing, I think a lot of what made this type of environment
147880	152040	appealing to young people is how innovative they seemed.
152040	155240	We are filming a Buzzfeed video.
155240	161760	They represented a new generation of creators who didn't have to answer to the gatekeepers
161760	163600	of legacy media.
163600	168440	Buzzfeed knew the internet, and this was very apparent in their origin story.
173040	178200	If you had met Jonah Peretti before the launch of the billion dollar media company, you almost
178200	180320	wouldn't expect him to be its CEO.
180320	185080	In 2001, while working on his master's thesis, Peretti did what any other grad student would
185080	186080	do.
186080	187080	Rastinate.
187080	190560	A friend of Peretti had told him that Nike launched a service where you could customize
190560	191560	your own shoes.
191560	195760	I went and I think first tried a four letter word and it rejected it.
195760	199320	And so I was trying to figure out how the system worked and just to clarify, you could
199320	204600	get any word you wanted printed on the Nike-ish, on the side of a pair of Nike-ish, right?
204600	207480	Yeah, although they had blacklisted a bunch of words, so I was trying to figure out which
207480	213400	words did they blacklist and then I put the word sweatshop in and it went through.
213400	217400	So I was like, oh, I can get a pair of Nike's that say sweatshop under the swoosh.
217400	222000	However, the next day, he received an email from a Nike rep that stated the word sweatshop
222000	223920	was inappropriate slang.
223920	227320	And so I just responded to the email and said, no, it's in the dictionary, it means a shopper
227320	233240	factory where workers toil under unhealthy conditions, now can you send me the shoes?
233240	236360	And then they wrote back another excuse and we were having this back and forth, which
236360	238880	if you're procrastinating writing a paper, this is perfect, right?
238880	241480	You're just like back and forth.
241480	244200	And then eventually they said, we reserve the right to not put that in the shoe.
244200	247520	You have to change the ID and I said, okay, I'll change the ID, but can you at least
247520	250960	send me a picture of the 10 year old Vietnamese girl who stitches the shoes together?
250960	252480	And then they didn't write back after that.
252480	257040	Today, a documented exchange like that posted on Twitter or TikTok would likely go viral
257080	259800	while the internet was a different place back in 2001.
259800	262480	Virality didn't mean followers or views.
262480	265040	YouTube didn't even exist back then.
265040	269440	Instead, Reddy sent the emails between him and Nike to a few of his friends.
269440	274760	And then they forwarded it to a bunch of their friends, so on and so forth.
274760	280800	Soon, he was getting thousands of responses from strangers, from death threats to marriage proposals.
280800	284080	He even landed in the inboxes of the activist community.
284080	290360	Reporters started calling him and somehow Jonah Peretti, a grad student who was just procrastinating,
290360	293080	who only had a surface understanding of sweatshops.
293080	298880	An undercover investigation by Seven News discovered factory workers being paid a pittance
298880	302880	and forced to live in squalor while Nike's stars had a fortune.
302880	308800	Somehow, ended up on the Today show with Katie Couric and Nike's head of global PR.
308800	312320	Peretti was enthralled by the results and wondered if it was replicable,
312360	315400	if so, it would disrupt traditional media entirely.
315400	318200	But the experts he talked to were pessimistic.
318200	321360	They attributed Peretti's short-lived fame to a fluke.
321360	324040	There was no formula to going viral.
324040	329040	Desperate to prove them wrong, he launched other projects in an attempt to replicate his results,
329040	330840	one of which was the rejection hotline,
330840	335040	which was a number you'd give to strangers hating on you that couldn't take no for an answer.
335040	338320	They'd be forwarded to an automated rejection message.
338320	343920	Welcome to the New York City rejection line, brought to you by rejectionline.com.
343920	349120	Unfortunately, the person who gave you this number does not want to talk to you or speak to you again.
349120	352760	We would like to take this opportunity to officially reject you.
352760	357800	Our certified rejection specialists are waiting to serve you in your time of need.
357800	361480	So his other project was a project called blackpeoplelovers.com
361480	365400	and it's a satirical website about those white friends who are kind of too proud
365400	368040	that they have black friends that it becomes racist again.
368080	372400	This one got them on Good Morning America to talk about race relations in America.
372400	378240	These projects kind of seemed like something you'd find during BuzzFeed's peak in 2016.
378240	383360	Despite the naysayers, the formula of going viral was replicated and it was moving fast.
383360	388880	The noise Peretti was making caught the attention of retired executive Ken Lair and Ariana Huffington.
388880	395240	Impressed by his ideas about the internet, Lair and Huffington proposed to start an online news business with Peretti.
395240	400680	They knew news and he knew the internet and in 2005, they launched the Huffington Post.
410840	416160	During his time at Huffington Post, Peretti didn't have the freedom to experiment with this new distribution method
416160	418720	via the internet and viewers as much as he wanted.
418720	425200	So we started a side project called BuzzFeed Labs with John Johnson just one year later in 2006.
425400	431040	The growth was consistent, but it really took off when social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter became viable.
431640	435440	BuzzFeed's formula turned out to be wildly effective on these platforms
435440	441280	because they weren't trying to usurp viewership from legacy media such as TV or newspapers.
441280	446480	Instead, they found a new demographic in need of entertainment.
446480	452280	Peretti coins this demo as the board at work network and the board in line network.
452360	454960	There's literally millions of board office workers
454960	456760	I don't want to work
456760	462120	who spend half of their day working and half of their day on Facebook, on Twitter, sharing media,
462120	468320	I am in each other, emailing each other, collectively that you can reach more people through the board at work network
468320	474040	than the BBC reaches or NBC or CVS or any of the major networks, literally hundreds of millions of people.
474840	475840	Bam.
478440	483840	That initially weren't even aware that they were creating a network, but are now the biggest network in the world.
483840	490080	This network of board people was made possible with the rise of the internet and mobile devices.
490080	497120	These new consumers resulted in BuzzFeed having to take an alternative route in regards to the quality of content produced.
498120	502640	I think the biggest misconception people had was that the way to do it was to focus on quality,
502640	503960	that quality is all that matters.
503960	508200	If you make something that's really high quality, it'll be, it'll go viral.
508200	515760	And the truth is that quality helps you a lot, but there's tons of really high quality things that don't go anywhere and don't really spread much.
515760	520160	So this new media company felt that views were great, but what's even better is shares.
520160	523840	How do we create content that is shareable?
523840	529880	If you think about the board in line and work network, these people aren't looking to consume media that's on par with movies or TV.
529880	532480	This requires way too much focus and time.
532480	536680	How can anyone in the world concentrate on a movie while in line?
536680	541880	Often, these viewers are looking for something that's interesting enough to catch your attention,
541880	548200	yet not too long or intellectually demanding that they risk getting distracted and being caught by their boss.
548200	552960	And so this pretty much explains the reduction in quality you usually associate BuzzFeed with.
552960	556880	The listicles, the cute animals, the quizzes.
556880	558800	Boy, are there quizzes life changing.
558800	567600	I found out tons of stuff I didn't know about myself, like what mood I was in.
567600	573960	Never would have known that, how many kids I'll have, it seems important to know.
573960	576400	My inner LaCroix flavor.
576400	580400	Of course, BuzzFeed did have a journalism portion for more serious stories.
580400	582360	This wasn't what they were popular for.
582360	589840	Lastly, BuzzFeed found that the board network tended to share content that facilitated social connection, a human fundamental need.
589840	593760	You don't tend to connect with someone by sharing the Wikipedia definition of a Basset Hound.
593760	598320	You show them a funny picture of your dog, then they may relate because their dog makes funny faces too.
598320	603560	When you look at these pictures of Basset Hounds running, this isn't what Larry and Sergey had in mind when they created Google.
603560	609200	Nobody types in, I want to see some pictures of Basset Hounds running unless they've already heard about them or discovered them somewhere else.
609200	614480	But Basset Hounds turn out to work very well on the social web because they're both cute and LOL.
614480	617560	And so here's a BuzzFeed post with over a million views.
617560	623040	And the reason people share it is because humor is inherently social.
623040	632160	While modern internet users may scoff at what was going viral in 2006, things that go viral now still follow the underlying formula BuzzFeed has been using.
632160	637600	Content for the board network that is reduced in quality that facilitates social connection.
643040	647160	While all of this was happening, there was something else that was making waves on the internet.
647160	649840	The rise of online video.
649840	653080	And Peretti and his team just couldn't pass up on this opportunity.
653080	654920	This is BuzzFeed motion pictures.
654920	660280	Opening up a studio in Los Angeles called BuzzFeed Motion Pictures and working with internet video legend, Zay Frank.
660440	662800	Words, words, words, words, words, words, words.
662800	665560	They launched their own YouTube channel in 2012.
665560	670440	With implementation of their formula to going viral, their success was wild.
670440	673160	Women became mermaids for a day, 17 million views.
673160	677960	I only said yes to my kids for a week and boyfriends stressed their girlfriends 18 million.
677960	680600	People try fire cupping therapy, 21 mil.
680600	684040	Exes get handcuffed for 24 hours, 24 million.
684040	688520	And like clockwork, these videos dominated YouTube.
688520	692560	Obviously, financial resources are a huge part of why these videos did well.
692560	697960	But it's undeniable that other companies who sure may not have had as much financial backing as BuzzFeed,
697960	700760	but certainly had more than your average creator.
700760	707640	These media companies like Clever or Howcast still didn't have the fan-based BuzzFeed did.
707640	710400	So it isn't just about monetary advantage.
710400	717000	You've made a business out of going viral and what would you say the secret to that is?
717000	720520	I think not a lot of credit is given to these early video producers.
720520	725400	Working on film sets for like the last week and a half means I'm just being fed like a
725400	728440	steady diet of pizza like every day, which is fine.
728440	730840	I have no problem with that.
730840	733000	It also means we're exhausted as f***.
733000	736560	I felt like a lot of these guys made stuff that was authentic to them,
736560	740200	which was what allowed YouTube to emerge in the market in the first place.
740200	746120	Authenticity was a huge reason there was an audience for the kid who wanted to rant to the camera.
746120	748360	BuzzFeed videos were shot in various ways.
748360	750960	Some leaned towards a more vlog-style format.
750960	754200	Others looked like a highly produced reality TV show.
754200	755880	And many a blend of both.
755880	762080	But what tied viewers' favorites together was authenticity.
762080	767160	Even their skits exuded this level of authenticity and genuineness fit for YouTube.
767160	768400	And I know what you're thinking.
768400	772040	Skits, that's the opposite of authenticity, that's acting.
772040	776640	But back when YouTubers did skits more, there was a certain way it was done.
776640	781080	When you would subscribe to sketch YouTubers like Ryan Kiga or Lilly Singh,
781080	786400	you weren't subscribing just to hear their opinion, you were subscribing for them.
786400	789200	You wanted to hear them not just talk about a topic,
789200	795000	but actually creatively convey their ideas through sketches, through skits.
795000	798320	When very small, it's significant formatting choice,
798320	802480	where I could tell BuzzFeed knew what they were doing when it came to their skits.
802480	805760	Was their choice to use their real names in these videos?
805760	807120	Oh my god, please.
807120	808880	I need you to watch my little brother.
808880	812680	They didn't format it like an acting thing like SNL or Mad TV.
812680	814440	This was what YouTubers did.
814440	816600	And BuzzFeed did the same.
816600	820960	Viewers would respond to this content the way they would an early Smosh video.
821800	828040	Viewers can expect more, and find new prices to fall, if we commit.
828040	831520	Investors were impressed by the digital outlet's massive success.
831520	839080	Unlike other internet companies, somehow, BuzzFeed was able to factory assemble authenticity at scale.
839080	842080	The investments started to pour in.
842080	846240	This would drastically affect the dynamics of the company.
846240	849120	We all got pins and buttons when we made good videos,
849120	851880	and that was sort of a weird cult-ish currency.
851880	854480	There's some great fucking company at work!
854480	858520	There was a pin that had some guy's face on it, or a YouTube hit.
858520	860080	There was a different kind of pin.
860080	861120	Based on benchmarks.
861120	862840	Yeah, for a Facebook hit.
862840	865960	One day they go, look at this beautiful hoodie, and everyone goes,
865960	867040	Oh, beautiful hoodie.
867040	869360	And they say, we've gotten one for all of you.
869360	875600	If you'd like to win it, you must get a video that gets to one million in one week.
875600	879360	It was kind of the cult at that level, because we really wanted buttons.
879360	882640	But BuzzFeed, it was like, oh, we're going to give you like,
882640	886680	let-a-me-buddy, or anything for making us millions of dollars.
886680	889200	Um, here's a button, and then everybody clapped.
890200	894240	And then, like, there were, I remember, like, some of the top producers who,
894240	899840	like, had, like, a whole jar full of, full of buttons, and I just go, God, like...
901080	902880	I want, I want that.
902880	905920	When you got your hoodie, though, it was like your SNL jacket.
905920	907560	It was like, welcome to the club, buddy.
907560	909680	And we all drank the fucking Kool-Aid.
912200	915640	Big investments meant BuzzFeed needed to hit Lotus.
915640	921800	And I'm sure, while poorly executed, this was BuzzFeed's attempt at motivating its employees to do so.
921800	925920	The reality of running a media company where revenue is mostly reliant on ads
925920	928840	is you need to do well in viewership.
928840	933320	The end goal of views, however, additionally started to affect authenticity.
937120	940320	I just had a copy of another friend of ours who worked there.
940320	945680	She felt pressured to use her own set as a story for a video.
945680	950000	They were like, you have to make this personal, or it's not going to do well, it's not going to go well.
950000	952680	So she was like, I had processed that trauma.
952680	955280	I was like, I didn't want to talk to people about it.
956280	962280	I always felt this pressure between, it was my duty to make stuff that was really vulnerable
962280	968280	because the comments were all people being like, you know, I'm bisexual and I've never seen myself like this.
968280	969280	And thank you so much.
969280	974280	And so I was like, I have a duty to these young kids, but also I'm not ready to talk about it.
974280	978280	But I have to because I have a duty to these young kids who are now all looking up to me,
978280	982280	which is like hundreds of thousands of people when yesterday nobody was.
982280	983280	Yeah.
983280	989280	And, and also like I have to make sure that the video does well and I have to like be in it.
989280	992280	Also, I haven't spoken to my parents about this aspect of my life.
992280	993280	Here we go.
996280	1001280	The pressure to hit quotas created the section of video producers that, yes,
1001280	1004280	made content that was authentic to them.
1004280	1008280	But at the same time, these videos were life events.
1008280	1011280	They hadn't fully processed yet.
1011280	1017280	It's just that fine line that's so like toxic and hard is like when people feel that pressure.
1017280	1021280	And like sharing that I'm just like, God, I feel so bad because at the time,
1021280	1026280	like being a manager and like overseeing like a lot of the videos,
1026280	1030280	there's sometimes when you really want to be like, wait, like, should we producing this?
1030280	1033280	Like, let's take a step back.
1034280	1039280	Although trouble was beginning to brew in the background, the digital outlet didn't address it.
1039280	1046280	As the adoption of this approach actually resulted in a significant number of cast members achieving widespread success,
1046280	1049280	paving the way for some of the channel's most popular series.
1049280	1052280	We saw the rise of shows like the Try Guys.
1052280	1057280	As their name illustrates, it's simply a series about a group of guys who will pretty much try anything for your entertainment.
1057280	1061280	Fans raved about Ladylike, which is a series similar to the Try Guys,
1061280	1067280	but featured a group of women and focus was more on attempting activities perceived as traditionally feminine.
1067280	1071280	You had worth it where the hosts would try dishes at different price points.
1071280	1079280	Then you had unsolved in which cast members would discuss unsolved crimes or investigate alleged haunted locations.
1089280	1094280	A lot of cast members who were successful in their endeavors were awarded opportunities outside of the internet company.
1094280	1102280	Streaming services bought their shows, they were featured on TV, and some even got the invite to meet up with big-time celebrities.
1102280	1110280	By 2016, they had become a juggernaut on YouTube, able to produce and outpace your average creator.
1110280	1118280	This newfound fame garnered by Buzzfeed cast members turned the company into a sought-out job for 20-something aspiring video producers.
1118280	1123280	Everyone wanted to work here, and competition to get in was high.
1148280	1155280	I think I applied five different times, and on the fifth try, things worked out.
1155280	1160280	Buzzfeed was in my head at the time. They were a cool company.
1160280	1166280	I agree during the mid-2010s, or somewhere in the mid-2010s, was when they were at their peak.
1166280	1169280	I wanted to work there. I had a few friends who wanted to work there.
1169280	1177280	It was perceived as a good spot to work in media, especially because I think there was news that they just turned down an acquisition offer from Disney.
1177280	1181280	So I was like, okay, this place is, like, bumpin'.
1181280	1185280	When I first got to Buzzfeed, Buzzfeed was really exciting.
1185280	1191280	Hi! This is exciting. Sort of a big event.
1191280	1201280	Buzzfeed kind of felt like it was at the center of the universe, because we were doing more video impressions than anyone else.
1201280	1204280	This introduced yet another dynamic into the business.
1204280	1214280	Many have been vocal about how the cutthroat nature to land a job at Buzzfeed led to a work environment that they claim is toxic.
1214280	1226280	The work environment at Buzzfeed was one of the most toxic, sick, and exploitive processes that I have ever been through.
1226280	1236280	And as a kid, when you're a young person working in entertainment, you don't get it.
1236280	1240280	They would do these videos, like people try X, right?
1240280	1244280	Like, so someone came up with the great idea.
1244280	1252280	Oh, you can drink your own piss. Let's have people drink their own urine for the first time.
1252280	1256280	The video gets approved by the higher-ups at Buzzfeed.
1256280	1259280	Sure, it's a great video. Bear Grylls did it, right?
1259280	1262280	Bear Grylls' drink is pissed. Let's have people drink piss.
1262280	1267280	So they staff it. They have Buzzfeeders who are willing to do it.
1267280	1274280	The Buzzfeeders drink their own piss. They film this video, they edit it, and they release it.
1274280	1275280	I swear to God.
1275280	1277280	My piss look way more yellow.
1277280	1281280	Oh my God. That's not unappetizing.
1281280	1285280	It's here. It's like staring me in the face.
1285280	1289280	And it's performing well, and then someone has an epiphany.
1289280	1291280	Wait a minute.
1291280	1295280	Every single person in this video is an intern.
1295280	1299280	There's not one full employee in this video.
1299280	1310280	All of these people in this video that just drank their own piss are in a competitive internship.
1310280	1331280	So Buzzfeed, just unbeknowingly, forced interns in a competitive internship to drink their own piss for a shot at being hired at the company.
1331280	1334280	So it didn't sign any NDAs or anything?
1334280	1338280	No. I'm free to talk however you want.
1338280	1341280	My name is Aleister Bostwick.
1341280	1344280	My role at the company was a video producer, video journalist.
1344280	1347280	I actually worked under Buzzfeed News.
1347280	1349280	And when did I work?
1349280	1352280	Like 2015 to 2017-ish?
1352280	1354280	I want to preference.
1354280	1357280	I am not hung up on this story. It does not bother me at all.
1357280	1362280	And I would never bring it up except for you seem to think it's relevant or interesting.
1362280	1367280	So I'll share it, which is very early into my time at Buzzfeed.
1367280	1370280	Probably a month into working at Buzzfeed as an intern.
1370280	1376280	Bear in mind I had just moved from Kansas, rural Kansas, in my car to New York City.
1376280	1382280	I was 23 at the time. I was an intern being paid $15 an hour, living in East Harlem.
1382280	1386280	One month into this gig, I wanted to do really well. I was working really hard.
1386280	1388280	I really wanted to get this job full-time.
1388280	1392280	And the Try Guys roll up to New York City because they're based out of Los Angeles.
1392280	1395280	And Keith wants to shoot this video in New York.
1395280	1398280	So I volunteer to help him on a shoot along with another producer.
1398280	1402280	And I'm essentially his cameraman for the day. It was a very long shoot.
1402280	1406280	And we go to the farmer's market in Union Square.
1406280	1409280	We go to some shops in Flatiron. He tries on some clothes.
1409280	1411280	We're going all up and downtown.
1411280	1413280	Eventually we go up to Central Park.
1413280	1416280	We arrive at a lower boat house, which is you can rent some boats.
1416280	1421280	And on this boat where I'm filming him talk about something banal or entertaining,
1421280	1425280	I pop in a dip chewing tobacco because I'm from Kansas.
1425280	1427280	I'm an unsophisticated hick.
1427280	1430280	It's a pinch between my cheek and gum gives me real tobacco pleasure.
1430280	1432280	And continue the film very seratiously.
1432280	1435280	We wrap the shoot probably around 7 p.m.
1435280	1437280	Nothing.
1437280	1439280	Seemed fine.
1439280	1442280	Next day I come into the office. The Try Guys have left. Keith have left.
1442280	1445280	And my manager, when I was just an intern at the time, pulled me aside and he said,
1445280	1448280	hey, Keith complained about you.
1448280	1451280	He said that dipping was not BuzzFeed culture.
1451280	1454280	He doesn't think you're a good fit. It really bothered him.
1454280	1457280	And I was so stunned by that because he had never said anything to my face.
1457280	1460280	The entire 12 hour shoot.
1460280	1463280	And from the Midwest when you have a premiere, just confrontational.
1463280	1469280	And so I learned, oh, Keith is entertaining, but he's somewhat of a corporate weasel.
1469280	1474280	That he is willing to play pretend and be nice to my face for 12 hours.
1474280	1477280	So I help him out at $15 an hour.
1477280	1482280	And then complain behind my back to my manager without saying a word to me.
1485280	1489280	These cases could certainly be the result of a new company lacking proper structure
1489280	1492280	rather than being purposefully exploitative.
1492280	1494280	Whatever the case, one thing is clear.
1494280	1498280	The results always end up negatively for newcomers.
1498280	1501280	Former employee Will Neff has been vocal about his time at the company
1501280	1504280	and makes it very clear how the competitive nature to land a role at BuzzFeed
1504280	1507280	facilitated a toxic work environment.
1507280	1511280	There was an intense pressure for interns to perform at the expense of themselves
1511280	1514280	in order to impress their superiors.
1514280	1517280	He claims being put through long and extreme work hours.
1517280	1521280	Recalling a time where he got into a car accident on the way to do his interview
1521280	1524280	to be promoted to fellow, the next level to intern.
1532280	1537280	Neff wanted the job so bad he chose to proceed directly to the scheduled interview
1537280	1540280	instead of going home.
1540280	1545280	I have this interview still like, oh my God, oh my God.
1545280	1547280	My heart is just...
1547280	1550280	I was like so dialed in.
1550280	1554280	So dialed in and I was like, I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this.
1554280	1559280	And I was like, after the interview immediately I felt very sick.
1560280	1562280	And I started to ask, I was like, should I go home?
1562280	1564280	I was just in a car crash.
1564280	1568280	And they were like, no, no, no, they need you for this vajazzling video, do that.
1568280	1571280	He showed up to the shoot in the now uploaded video called
1571280	1574280	People Get Vajazzles for the first time.
1574280	1577280	And this talent had to get their genitals waxed and cleaned
1577280	1581280	in order to be prepped for having crystals glued onto them.
1581280	1583280	Yeah, that's the video.
1583280	1587280	This was filmed in a small room with a crew of around three, plus the technician,
1587280	1590280	plus the owner of the salon, watching.
1590280	1593280	The bottom half of cast members clothing removed.
1593280	1596280	Nef makes it clear that this is a typical Buzzfeed video
1596280	1599280	and this was the kind of stuff he signed up for.
1599280	1603280	Scribing himself as often playing the himbo, he'd be dramatic, chaotic,
1603280	1607280	and was comfortable wearing provocative or even no clothing on camera.
1607280	1611280	However, he does hint at the fact that people competing for job security
1611280	1615280	shouldn't be pressured to participate in this type of content.
1615280	1621280	And that Buzzfeed should have had some sort of checks and balances for this.
1621280	1623280	After his promotion to fellow was confirmed,
1623280	1627280	Nef had to work hard into producing a video that showed his supervisors
1627280	1631280	he was able to garner massive viewership to hit quotas.
1631280	1635280	Fortunately, an opportunity presented itself for him
1635280	1639280	to make a video with the renowned ensemble, The Try Guys.
1639280	1643280	The series was doing numbers, which meant whatever he made with them
1643280	1645280	would definitely do well.
1645280	1648280	And this would certainly impress his supervisors.
1648280	1650280	His pitch was equally as good.
1650280	1654280	Try Guys create iconic Playboy centerfold covers.
1654280	1657280	The pitch was approved and the video was shot.
1657280	1661280	The guys did their thing posing in different famous Playboy poses.
1661280	1664280	Typical Try Guys million-viewed idea.
1664280	1667280	This would be the video that would solidify Nef's chances
1667280	1671280	of being promoted from fellow and moving on to becoming full-time.
1671280	1674280	Now at the time, Buzzfeed was in the middle of a move
1674280	1677280	in which employees were to pack up their belongings into boxes
1677280	1680280	and label them to be transported into another facility.
1680280	1683280	Upon arrival at the new building, Nef discovered
1683280	1687280	that the hard drive from his box that contained the Try Guys footage was missing.
1687280	1692280	And I searched everywhere for this fucking hard drive.
1692280	1694280	I searched everywhere.
1694280	1697280	It had a Try Guys video on it.
1697280	1701280	This was a video that was going to take me to the next level.
1701280	1703280	And it was gone.
1703280	1706280	When I go to my bosses at the time, I tell them,
1706280	1710280	I'm like, guys, I can't find my hard drive.
1710280	1715280	And it has three videos in progress on it.
1715280	1722280	And at that point, we had to turn over 1.5 videos every week.
1722280	1727280	I was like, I need time to get back to doing what I was doing.
1727280	1730280	And they're like, no, you need to produce a video this week.
1730280	1732280	The show must go on!
1732280	1735280	So they just kept rolling.
1735280	1738280	And they blamed me for this equipment being lost.
1738280	1742280	They blamed me for this video going missing.
1742280	1747280	Even though it was the only piece of equipment in the move that disappeared.
1747280	1754280	And to this day, I have no idea what happened to this piece of equipment.
1754280	1760280	This was only one of many things in which Neff claims was done to undermine his prospects for success.
1760280	1765280	He also, for some reason, was not able to book interns to help him with a lot of other productions,
1765280	1767280	even though other fellows were able to.
1767280	1774280	He began scrambling to make videos that showed his bosses that he could produce the metrics they needed.
1774280	1784280	Upon the conclusion of his time as fellow, Neff did not attain the coveted transition to becoming a full-time employee.
1784280	1792280	The thing that made me sure that someone had it out for me was on the way out,
1792280	1797280	I turned my email address over and give all my equipment back.
1797280	1799280	And I say goodbye to everybody.
1799280	1802280	And a lot of people are shocked that I'm leaving.
1803280	1812280	Two days later, I get a call from Cody and he's like, dude, I got to talk to you about something.
1812280	1814280	I was like, yeah, what is it?
1814280	1824280	And he was like, I'm going over your final credit card statement.
1824280	1828280	Now they gave us credit cards to be able to produce content, right?
1828280	1831280	Going over your final credit card statement.
1831280	1841280	Did you buy a new iPhone on your credit card the week you were leaving?
1841280	1848280	And I was like, what? No.
1848280	1859280	If that had been anybody but Cody, I would have been because someone took my credit card after I turned it in and bought a cell phone on them.
1859280	1865280	Just to further incriminate and disenfranchise me to the company.
1865280	1871280	But Cody was an absolute homie and he was my friend and I don't think he believed it for a moment.
1871280	1873280	And so I left the company.
1873280	1875280	It was the end of my tenure.
1875280	1878280	It was the end of my time at BuzzFeed.
1878280	1885280	The only logical conclusion as to why I think BuzzFeed didn't address this growing problem is I got cocky.
1885280	1895280	Despite this growing number of people feeling like the work environment was unsustainable or perhaps just a new restructuring needed to happen with leadership,
1895280	1905280	the company was probably counting on the fact that they could easily replace them with another aspiring young filmmaker looking for exposure.
1905280	1920280	Even if one of their heavy hitters were to burn out, maybe at that point they felt like it didn't matter that their reach was already so big it'd be impossible to fail.
1920280	1927280	Another element that made the digital outlets content successful was their ability to use identity to create shareable content.
1927280	1933280	They found that users were cognizant that the content they shared was a reflection of their identity.
1933280	1943280	In other words, users were sharing things that they thought made them look good or showcased a part of their personality they wanted to express.
1943280	1948280	Sometimes people will say, oh, well, if you want to make something really viral, why don't you just post porn or something?
1948280	1952280	But porn isn't viral because people don't want to share email porn to all their friends.
1952280	1955280	Maybe people will click on it or search for it.
1955280	1967280	They certainly do, but it's not usually viral because it doesn't tap into the social side of human nature of wanting to share things and pass things along.
1967280	1969280	People share stuff because it's about them.
1969280	1974280	Some primetime show that every 80% of people sort of like doesn't get shared at all on the web,
1974280	1978280	but something that only 10% of people feel passionate about gets shared a lot.
1978280	1986280	Given how strongly people identify with political stances and social issues, content in this genre has always been among the most shared.
1986280	1993280	Now BuzzFeed has released a number of videos that truly highlighted a number of social injustices many were ignorant of.
1993280	2007280	However, when meeting viewership quota became more and more important, video producers were incentivized to make more content in this area simply because they knew it would get more views.
2007280	2012280	This is how, in my opinion, you got content like women trying pan spreading for a week.
2012280	2019280	Man spreading is when a man spreads his physical body to take up as much space as humanly possible.
2019280	2026280	The people around you are relegated to a very small portion, but the key to man spreading is not noticing.
2027280	2039280	You have a naturally progressive employees that know their audience is progressive by this point and then can lean hard into that identity to get more views.
2039280	2048280	So you know, okay, what we want to do is we want to lean into our own audience but also trigger the conservatives.
2048280	2059280	Just as there's the kind of like trigger the libs meme, the people at BuzzFeed were certainly well aware that they were triggering the conservatives by doing catchy, ridiculous things like women try man-spanning.
2059280	2073280	Like there is some meta-self-awareness when I was there at BuzzFeed that they knew they were needling, that they would get hate and get reaction, but that's fine because ultimately what you want is views, you just want engagement.
2074280	2088280	Content like this seemed to function in a way that it received the outrage click of a usually conservative leaning individual while simultaneously capturing the click of a liberal leaning person interested in taking down the patriarchy.
2088280	2092280	The video did well because of this view-wise.
2092280	2097280	But it got so much backlash. The comments are turned off.
2097280	2106280	And I think that's because even for someone who is liberal, this typically isn't the issue to prioritize. No one is out on the streets protesting this.
2106280	2113280	I think what's annoying about these I tried videos, at least to me, is that it seems like all of them can be boiled down to somebody saying, I'm going to do blank for a week.
2113280	2122280	And they'll proceed to film themselves before doing said thing and after to tell us how they feel before and after doing it, but rarely ever show us them actually doing what's in the title.
2122280	2127280	I think they do it on purpose because if they were to actually show the footage of them doing it, it just makes you realize how dumb it is.
2127280	2131280	Man-spreading for a week is just watching somebody sit obnoxiously on a bus.
2131280	2133280	And half the time they weren't even really man-spreading.
2133280	2137280	They were just taking up as many seats as possible, trying to attach some deeper meaning to it.
2137280	2139280	Like you were just annoying for a week.
2139280	2146280	But this formula in communicating social issues was the way to meet their quota.
2146280	2159280	The most interesting one to me was I went down to Mexico to kind of report and cover the way the United States handles deportation on the border.
2159280	2169280	Like what happens when illegal immigrants or whatever term we want to use cross the border, get caught by ICE, and then are not granted asylum and they're just deported.
2169280	2170280	Like what does that look like?
2170280	2174280	Do you remember how well that video did in terms of views?
2174280	2181280	Yeah, terribly. Nobody cared.
2181280	2193280	The system in place at BuzzFeed discouraged, certainly taking topical risks outside of tried and true methods.
2193280	2202280	And so you got the videos like we painted with our period blood that captured individuals all over the political spectrum, for different reasons of course.
2202280	2205280	We all leaned into the fact that it smelled awful.
2205280	2206280	Oh, it smells.
2206280	2208280	Can you smell it?
2208280	2210280	It hit over here, yeah, it did.
2210280	2216280	Its intent supposedly was to normalize periods, but I think it's done the opposite.
2216280	2222280	But I guess a view is a view is a view.
2222280	2227280	As is the natural progression of anything that is commodified and turned into a business.
2227280	2234280	BuzzFeed inadvertently helped to create the aesthetic of left leaning progressive values.
2234280	2240280	They turned it into a brand pushing its core ideological principles into the background.
2240280	2244280	A fan life on social media was a glorified and romanticized version of camping.
2244280	2249280	BuzzFeed was this when it came to left leaning political issues.
2249280	2252280	It was very akin to an influencer lifestyle.
2252280	2259280	Some have claimed that this service level aesthetic was seeping into company culture.
2259280	2265280	Timothy Jonay was hired by the digital outlet to grow and manage a number of the company's social media accounts.
2265280	2268280	I didn't even remember applying and they're like, hey, it's BuzzFeed.
2268280	2270280	Can you come in tomorrow?
2270280	2273280	And I was like, I already gave up on my Hollywood dream.
2273280	2274280	I'm going home.
2274280	2276280	And they're like, no, we're really serious.
2276280	2280280	And I'm like, I had been looking for jobs for like six months.
2280280	2281280	I couldn't find anything out here.
2281280	2282280	Loved everything I did.
2282280	2285280	They loved my work on Twitter and YouTube.
2285280	2288280	And they hired me right away.
2288280	2294280	It was easy to discount his abilities as he was an unlikely candidate for the job based on his appearance.
2294280	2298280	What does a trap rapper from Alaska know about growing social media?
2298280	2300280	But he did well.
2300280	2306280	In just six months, he helped to grow the outlets Instagram and Twitter for tasty BuzzFeed's food show.
2306280	2310280	Jonay also appeared as a regular in a number of the outlets videos.
2310280	2312280	He fit right in.
2312280	2319280	However, as BuzzFeed shifted its identity from cute pet videos and relatable content to one of left leaning politics,
2319280	2324280	and remember not actual left leaning, more like the aesthetic of left leaning.
2324280	2329280	Employees who did not fit this culture are ostracized, he claims.
2329280	2332280	Including himself.
2332280	2337280	Jonay recalls a time where he was talking to a colleague about the new Justin Bieber album.
2337280	2340280	Dude, that new Justin Bieber album is dope.
2340280	2342280	I have to admit, I love Justin Bieber.
2342280	2344280	He is totally my spirit animal.
2344280	2354280	His colleague promptly interjected, scolding him about the phrase spirit animal due to it appropriating Native American culture.
2354280	2361280	Jonay tells Yahoo News, there were several instances like this that pushed him further and further right,
2361280	2365280	to the point where he eventually came forward in support of Trump.
2365280	2370280	In the office, he would wear a MAGA hat and even got Trump tattooed on his body.
2370280	2373280	Subsequently, he found himself subjected to ridicule.
2373280	2377280	He became the guy no one wanted to talk to.
2377280	2383280	Yeah, when I came out that I supported Trump, I was treated like I had leprosy or something.
2383280	2392280	They stopped inviting me to meetings, and then shortly I quit because it was just so tough for me to even be at that office.
2392280	2396280	You would probably know Timothy Jonay today as Baked Alaska.
2396280	2401280	The guy who not only publishes far right controversial content on socials,
2401280	2406280	but was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, participating in the capital rights.
2406280	2414280	Colleagues of his, such as Wilnef, believed that the Buzzfeed work environment did indeed have a hand at radicalizing Jonay.
2417280	2423280	To be clear, this isn't supposed to be a sob story about someone who was ousted for their differing political ideology.
2423280	2430280	If you're familiar with the Baked Alaska brand, it's possible there may have been some provoking and back and forth we aren't privy to.
2431280	2437280	Where I believe he was radicalized is how he saw the relationship between politics and viral content.
2437280	2447280	Jonay learned at Buzzfeed that if you leaned into an identity that not necessarily focused too much on its core values, the internet would reward you.
2447280	2458280	In a New York Times article by Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed News, Smith kind of confirms this point, calling the story of Baked Alaska something different.
2459280	2467280	The sort of social media power that we help sharpen at Buzzfeed, that can exert an almost irresistible gravitational pull.
2467280	2478280	If you haven't had the experience of posting something on social media that goes truly viral, you may not understand its profound emotional attraction.
2478280	2485280	You're suddenly the center of a digital universe, getting more attention from more people than you've ever had.
2485280	2490280	The rush of affirmation can be giddy and addictive.
2490280	2494280	And if you have little else to hold on to, you can lose yourself.
2500280	2506280	Jonay took what he had learned at the digital outlet, and he did the same with right-leaning values.
2506280	2511280	Smith is sure to separate the company's actions in Jonay, though, stating,
2524280	2530280	Of course, using the aesthetic of a political ideology is the best way to get an idea to spread via the internet.
2530280	2535280	But we don't go as far as Jonay, because we're a news organization.
2535280	2545280	His story leaves me wondering, what's Sheriff Blaine, those of us who pioneered the use of social media to deliver information deserve at this moment?
2547280	2553280	Did we, along with the creators of those platforms, help open Andorra's box?
2554280	2573280	Buzzfeed had really benefited tremendously from being early adapters of BLM and a lot of progressive movements, but they were doing it in a totally performative way.
2575280	2577280	Thank you so much.
2577280	2581280	And then they make this video, like, I think it's like 20 things all black people do.
2581280	2587280	And the thing was, our checks and balances for making these videos was like one black person.
2587280	2590280	And if they were like, yeah, that's cool, the video would get made.
2590280	2592280	So they got this, like, sign off from one black person.
2592280	2594280	The video was tremendously offensive.
2594280	2599280	It basically talked about, like, black people hoarding shoes and stuff like that.
2599280	2604280	And so black Twitter was like, wait a minute, what the f... this isn't bull...
2605280	2609280	Why do we call each other the N-word, but get vehemently upset when a white person uses the N-word?
2609280	2612280	Why can't I love school and also be black?
2614280	2626280	And then that's like when Buzzfeed and kind of the progressive movement had this splinter where the progressive movement realized like, oh, Buzzfeed is dead, they don't give a f...
2626280	2628280	They're just making these videos to get views.
2628280	2638280	And they went to Twitter to apologize for putting that video out saying that, uh, saying something like, uh, we made a mistake and we want to get another chance at earning the black people's trust.
2642280	2648280	For Buzzfeed, when I first was brought on back, during my first interview, it was strictly for diversity.
2648280	2653280	Then when I was applying to stay at Buzzfeed, it was for their diversity team.
2653280	2666280	So I come thinking, I'm ready to do diversity, I've got so many ideas down, and then I am told, surprise, our diversity team is drastically cut and we have a place for you, Steph.
2666280	2671280	We're gonna punt you on the short, scripted, dark comedy team.
2671280	2672280	Like, what?
2672280	2678280	At the end of the day, they didn't want more diversity, they want more viral hits, they want more things that would get views.
2678280	2684280	When they even said, we don't really know where we would place you, I was like, I don't know where you would place me either.
2684280	2693280	I don't think they're wrong for wanting what they want, which is quantity and viral hits, and I don't think I'm wrong for wanting what I want, which is quality and representation.
2693280	2705280	Buzzfeed, at the end of the day, is a company, and just like any other company, they don't always punt moral values first, they put getting money first.
2705280	2712280	Because you can't make a living on moral values, unfortunately.
2712280	2724280	When I spoke to former employees for this video, I felt a lot of them had good intentions and truly wanted to produce content that promoted progressive values and not just the surface level image of it for views.
2724280	2728280	However, I don't know if that matters.
2728280	2741280	In combination with the algorithm and perhaps a video producer feeling the pressure of having to hit a quota, videos like this would get views, and outshined other videos where those core values were clear.
2741280	2750280	But eventually, that made Buzzfeed's core fanbase lose trust with them.
2750280	2757280	And so tweets like this one from the writing department of Buzzfeed Canada would really throw people off of what Buzzfeed's intentions were.
2757280	2761280	Would you like to write long form for at Buzzfeed Canada? Well, you can.
2761280	2770280	We want pitches for your Canada-centric essays and reporting. What particularly like to hear from you if you are not white and not male.
2770280	2779280	The internet erupted with widespread criticism directed at the digital media outlet, with many accusing the company of promoting racist and sexist hiring practices.
2779280	2786280	The tweets then doubled down. If you're a white man upset that we are looking mostly for non-white men, I don't care about you.
2786280	2793280	Go write for McLean's. Then the random pinned tweet, yo, these pale demons, nothing.
2793280	2800280	Almost all responses were in agreement that it is okay to specifically hire a writer based on the type of content you are looking for.
2800280	2810280	If, for example, you were looking for someone to write a memoir or op-ed about growing up as an Asian American, you are likely going to get few applications from someone who is white.
2810280	2821280	Whether this be a ploy to solidify that Buzzfeed aesthetic and garner further attention, or if this employee truly meant what they posted, is unclear.
2821280	2829280	Regardless, the resulting controversy was just one of many incidences that significantly tarnished Buzzfeed's reputation.
2829280	2837280	Making viewers question whether or not they really believe the progressive ideals their content conveyed.
2837280	2846280	And to be clear, it's not really about the joke, if you can call it that. If you watch Stand Up or any other comedy podcasts, they still make these types of jokes.
2846280	2857280	Watch TikTok. They do these and no one really cares. It's just something about those tweets seem to, I don't know, pandering to hostile?
2857280	2870280	Buzzfeed was crumbling. While they were losing audience trust, the demand for creating a high volume of content began to take a toll on one of the company's main components of their formula. Authenticity.
2870280	2882280	I did send you a screenshot of a Slack I discovered deep within my computer's hard drive from 2016-2017. Everybody was fudging. The concept's a little bit.
2882280	2889280	I think in the screenshot it shows that the producer's reaching out because he needs people to appear in a Lunchable video. People try Lunchables for the first time.
2889280	2897280	Presenting Lunchables Pizza. Three real crusts with all the toppings. Fun to make and eat.
2897280	2907280	It's like, yo, can you be in my video? Like, have you tried Lunchables? If you haven't. Or if you have, it's all good. Just lie and I'm responding like, it's all good. I've been here a long time. I know how it goes.
2907280	2916280	So there's a mutual understanding of the facade that we're presenting to the audience.
2916280	2929280	The understanding was the pressure to get videos out consistently with a format that once discovered works. Like, these people try some new product they haven't tried before.
2929280	2944280	These people do something they haven't done before to just run that paradigm into the ground at whatever kind of a cost. You know, whether we're embellishing or there's some hyperbole about who or hasn't tried X or Y in the format.
2944280	2955280	So be it as long as the video is entertaining. But it was never, I don't think explicitly stated to do that, nor was the intent to deliberately mislead any audience.
2955280	2965280	It was a function of the environment people found themselves in Buzzfeed, which was the pressure to produce content.
2965280	2974280	And although their intent wasn't to mislead their audience, I think deep down viewers knew some of these reactions were too over the top.
2975280	2978280	First food ever. Here I go.
2978280	2990280	That wasn't bad.
2990280	3000280	Oh my God. Did I just, did I seriously just watch a minute and 25 seconds of this video to hear someone describe a blueberry as not bad?
3000280	3004280	Just this is content, baby. This is what it's all about.
3004280	3012280	Which is why viewership for this type of content seem to diminish, yet the format has still been popular on other channels.
3012280	3017280	Eventually, their high quota would burn out their top talent as well.
3035280	3036280	Leaving Buzzfeed.
3036280	3038280	And I'm leaving Buzzfeed for the first time.
3038280	3040280	I'm going to be talking about why I left Buzzfeed.
3040280	3042280	Why I left Buzzfeed.
3042280	3043280	Why I left Buzzfeed.
3043280	3045280	I left Buzzfeed video.
3047280	3052280	Anytime a video from like a video producer, a major one would drop like why I left Buzzfeed.
3052280	3056280	There would always be like rumblings about it on like Slack or maybe even in person.
3056280	3060280	There was a common theme as to why these creators have decided to leave their job.
3061280	3066280	To Buzzfeed, in a lot of cases, quantity trumps quality.
3066280	3070280	They would rather have more videos than fewer good videos.
3070280	3075280	And the reasoning behind this, I think, is just that the more videos you make, the more money you make generally.
3075280	3077280	And there was also a focus on virality.
3077280	3080280	The videos you make are expected to go viral.
3080280	3083280	Not all of them, but ideally a lot of them.
3084280	3089280	There were, there was like pretty high quotas.
3089280	3095280	And so that meant that you had to be filming a lot and you had to be coming up with new ideas and new content had to be put out.
3095280	3100280	And so those demands kind of were rising as time went on.
3100280	3110280	But the amount of resources that we were allotted and the amount of faith that it seemed like leaders of the company had in us really seemed to go downhill.
3110280	3114280	So you're sort of in a situation where a lot is being asked of you.
3114280	3121280	And it sort of feels like the end goal keeps moving further and further away.
3141280	3147280	Well, there might be some truth to that.
3147280	3156280	The themes in the why I left BuzzFeed content still explain exactly why the channel you knew in 2016 was bound to fail.
3156280	3162280	It wasn't just the demanding workload.
3162280	3166280	When you work for a company and make videos, everything that you make, that company owns.
3166280	3170280	So for instance, you might have heard about some people being let go from BuzzFeed.
3170280	3177280	And those people, the characters and the videos that they, the series that they created while at BuzzFeed, they'll never be able to make that series ever again.
3177280	3181280	And that's because that is BuzzFeed's intellectual property.
3181280	3183280	And that began to scare me.
3196280	3200280	BuzzFeed said, even that stuff, that's ours.
3200280	3202280	Do I give them my best ideas?
3202280	3207280	Later in life, I may want to use those ideas for something and I won't be able to.
3207280	3211280	And that started worrying me more and more.
3211280	3215280	It is true that this is the standard at most media companies.
3215280	3220280	Imagine being a writer for a Marvel movie knowing the weaknesses and strengths of the script.
3220280	3224280	So you write something else based on the same framework and sell it to DC.
3224280	3229280	It makes sense for them to have it written in their contract to avoid this type of competition.
3229280	3236280	However, what makes the situation unique from that example is that one of the content these creators produced was based on their real selves.
3236280	3241280	As we previously mentioned, authenticity is what does numbers on YouTube.
3241280	3244280	So of course, this was the type of videos they made.
3244280	3251280	For a company to own the IP of something based on yourself, rendering it illegal for you to produce content surrounding you,
3251280	3256280	is understandable why there would be apprehension in such a scenario.
3256280	3262280	Some creators, specifically Gabby and Allison, for example, they were put in a weird position where they were told,
3262280	3269280	you can't make videos outside of BuzzFeed if you want to work for BuzzFeed or there was some Catch-22 about it,
3269280	3271280	so they ended up leaving BuzzFeed.
3271280	3275280	And then for other employees, they were let go for doing outside work.
3275280	3284280	Why do I think so many people left BuzzFeed around 2017 comes to pretty easy, ultimately, simple answers,
3284280	3288280	which is that the demands of BuzzFeed were pretty strict.
3288280	3291280	You had hard quotas, you were not paid very much,
3291280	3298280	and by 2017, BuzzFeed had a large enough reputation that you could take your marketable skills,
3298280	3302280	the fact that you had worked at BuzzFeed, and get a higher salary somewhere else.
3302280	3308280	And I can also then say, why I left BuzzFeed video, and I can generate lots of views,
3308280	3311280	so it's either the pivoting to another company where they can make more money,
3311280	3315280	because BuzzFeed didn't pay a lot of money, or they wanted to branch out on their own.
3315280	3319280	They felt like they had built up a large enough audience by using BuzzFeed as the vehicle
3319280	3324280	that they were going to leave now, on top, and then create a why I left BuzzFeed video.
3324280	3329280	By 2020, many of BuzzFeed's most watched talent had left to go in a different direction.
3329280	3336280	Hosts of Unsolved and one of two of the leads of the show worth that launched the YouTube channel Watcher.
3336280	3339280	The Try Guys also doing their own thing.
3339280	3345280	Some shows like Ladylike even disbanded for more mysterious reasons not announced to the public.
3345280	3348280	Other individuals landed more mainstream jobs.
3348280	3354280	Devin Little from Ladylike jumped ship for NBC after working at BuzzFeed for five years.
3354280	3360280	Quinta Brunson went on to create Abbott Elementary, which has been nominated for a number of awards.
3360280	3366280	These members left the digital media company simply because it was more website to being independent.
3366280	3370280	I think they weren't built at that point for what we were doing,
3370280	3376280	and the reason to leave is because I felt like we were in a box and the box was too small for what we were doing.
3376280	3383280	We had desires to explore this property in a million different directions.
3383280	3390280	Despite the lack of bad blood, their departure from their on-camera roles also resulted in the departure of their fans.
3413280	3438280	Viewers came for the authenticity, exuded by a lot of these shows, and once that was gone, they left as well.
3438280	3443280	In the last couple of minutes, we've learned BuzzFeed has decided to shut down its newsroom.
3443280	3446280	Yeah, Jose, this is no doubt a rough day for the news business.
3446280	3452280	So in an email sent to BuzzFeed employees, CEO Jonah Peretti laid out the cuts and the implications there.
3452280	3455280	BuzzFeed will lay off about 15% of its staff.
3455280	3463280	I think that it doesn't come as a total surprise because the newsroom has been downsizing for several years now.
3463280	3469280	I reported last week that investors were pushing BuzzFeed to shut down its newsroom then,
3469280	3475280	and CEO Jonah Peretti fought to keep it alive in many ways, echoing those sentiments today.
3475280	3481280	If you're a millennial, an end of the end of an era.
3481280	3484280	So many things have happened since BuzzFeed's peak in 2016.
3484280	3486280	They've had several layoffs.
3486280	3493280	Former employees sued the digital outlet, alleging they were not permitted to sell their shares for a higher price after the IPO.
3493280	3500280	He had the wife guy cheating on his wife, which I guess technically isn't BuzzFeed, but many people seem to associate to.
3500280	3504280	Ned Fulmer is no longer working with the Try Guys.
3504280	3509280	Their news division officially shut down, and despite their millions of subscribers,
3509280	3515280	a lot of their channels today continue to look like ghost towns, with no recent uploads.
3516280	3522280	We see, once again, changes. The audience is changing, and their habits are changing.
3522280	3532280	So the audience is spending more time on social platforms that involve video, like TikTok and Instagram.
3532280	3537280	And whereas before, they would be on Twitter, they would be on Facebook and link out,
3537280	3542280	now they are kind of trapped in those platforms, happily trapped in those platforms,
3542280	3545280	and it's really hard to fight to get content there.
3545280	3548280	Talent was dropping faster than they could do so.
3548280	3555280	Whether you think BuzzFeed's work environment was exploitative or not, the bottom line was that their way of doing things,
3555280	3561280	their system pushed away many of their top performing creators.
3561280	3565280	Instead of investing in these individuals, paying them more so they stay,
3565280	3571280	I think they took them for granted and likely felt they were replaceable due to their massive reach.
3571280	3577280	It's true, the BuzzFeed had the formula for virality, but they hardly knew anything about sustainability.
3577280	3582280	If you look at the series Unsolved, for instance, which BuzzFeed owns the IP of,
3582280	3586280	it hardly has any of the attention of when it was hosted by the original duo.
3586280	3591280	A lot of the comments also express how much they miss the original hosts.
3591280	3597280	It's not because the new cast is talentless, it's just that what separates YouTube from TV
3597280	3602280	is the fact that viewers develop the sort of parasocial friendship for creators.
3602280	3607280	We aren't always watching a video for the idea itself, but for the creator.
3607280	3612280	Whether it be mundane, like trying different brands of water or grandiose,
3612280	3619280	like competing in a challenge for thousands of dollars, we want to see how XYZ YouTuber reacts.
3619280	3623280	To turn creativity into a business is a very delicate thing to do,
3623280	3628280	and I don't know if, I don't know who has done it right at that scale.
3628280	3632280	At that scale, it's very complicated to do, and I think even at the scales that we're doing it at,
3632280	3640280	it's super complicated to turn just like loose fun creativity into a P&L that works.
3640280	3644280	I can't imagine what it's like to run a company that's entire business model
3644280	3647280	is based off of the economics of the internet.
3647280	3651280	You look at the YouTube channels of many former BuzzFeed employees, for instance,
3651280	3655280	and their fanbase, unlike the company, is still strong.
3655280	3661280	How BuzzFeed lost their audience was failing to meet the needs of the people that helped build them.
3682280	3686280	Of course, if you have the means to do so, as you know, as I posted before,
3686280	3692280	sponsorships are rare on this channel because sometimes they just don't like the topics that I post.
3692280	3695280	Either way, thank you for watching. That's the end of the video.
3695280	3697280	I will see you guys next time. Stay safe.
