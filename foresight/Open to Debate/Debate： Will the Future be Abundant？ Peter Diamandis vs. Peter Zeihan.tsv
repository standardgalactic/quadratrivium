0	22560	Hello everybody and welcome to Open to Debate. I'm Zania Wicked, your guest moderator for
22560	26920	today. Having spent a number of years in the policy domain, including the State Department
26920	31680	and the White House, I now make my living by trying to ask the right questions, either
31680	37400	as a moderator or coach, in order to bring clarity and direction to people and organisations.
37400	45000	And my job today is to do just that on the topic of will the future be abundant. In 2011,
45000	49400	the Pew Research Centre conducted a study that showed, for the first time, that more
49400	53480	Americans thought that their children were going to be worse off themselves than thought
53480	60120	otherwise. That trend has continued. Imprinted in our basic genetic makeup is the commitment
60120	65680	to ensure the propagation of the species, and not just its continuation, but in such a way
65680	71400	that we are healthier and happier. And it's in this context that I can't think of a more
71400	76560	important question to answer than whether the future will be abundant or not. What world
76560	82080	are we leaving for our children, for our species? This is not about whether we are optimists
82080	87280	or pessimists, nor is it about the political oscillations that consume the papers every
87280	95840	day. This is about understanding the underlying trend line. Is the future going to be abundant?
95840	100400	As a former policymaker, it's a vital question to answer, one that drives behaviours, our
100400	104800	own, that of our businesses, our societies and our governments. It is one that should
104800	110280	drive our international relations. So, to talk us through the dynamics, and to answer
110280	115560	the question of will the future be abundant, we have two Peters. Let's get into it and
115560	122760	meet our debaters. Arguing yes, the future will be abundant, Peter Diamandis, founder
122760	128760	and executive chairman of XPRIZE Foundation, and author of Abundance, The Future is Better
128760	133880	Than You Think, and The Future is Faster Than You Think. Welcome, Peter.
133880	139480	A pleasure to be here. Good to be here. And arguing no to the question, will the future
139480	144720	be abundant, is geopolitical strategist and author of The End of the World is Just the
144720	151440	Beginning, Peter Zahan. Welcome, Peter. Great to be here. Now, because we have two Peters
151440	156840	debating with us today, I'm going to be referring to each of you as Peter D and Peter Z, to
156840	163760	try and minimise some confusion. Before we get started, I just want to take a quick sense
163760	169440	of what motivates you both to make this argument. So, I'm going to ask you each to take the
169440	174400	30 seconds and tell us why you're here today. Peter D, what are the stakes for you in this
174400	181520	argument? An individual's mindset is probably the single most important tool they have to
181520	187440	solving problems and creating a better world. And our inherent mindset that we evolved over
187440	194000	100,000 years is one of fear and scarcity. But that doesn't put you in a very good position
194000	199420	to solve problems. Having an abundance mindset, optimistic mindset is probably the most important
199420	205520	thing for delivering a future for our children that is better than our past. And so, my mission
205520	212180	here is to give people a clear understanding of why the future is extraordinarily abundant
212180	218760	and why they're more empowered than ever before to create that future. Phenomenal. It's about
218760	224580	mindset. And Peter Z, the same question for you. Why did you show up? We've been living
224580	228700	through one of the most atypical periods in human history, and a lot of us have drawn
228780	234140	linear forecasts as to where that takes us. That's never been true and it's not true now. We're
234140	239420	entering a period of extreme change, and my goal is to get people to understand the size of the
239420	244700	icebergs ahead of us and where they are so we can navigate around them. The future isn't necessarily
244700	250220	dark, but that doesn't mean there's going to be anything we can predict. Okay, so this goes to
250220	255580	the core, both of you. So let's get to our opening statements. We want each of you to take a few
255580	262540	minutes to explain your position. Peter D, you're first and you're arguing yes to the question,
262540	265100	will the future be abundant? Tell us why.
268620	275100	Exponential technologies, and I define those as computation, sensors, networks, AI, robotics,
275100	282700	3D printing, AR, VR, blockchain, biotech, are technologies that are making those things that
282700	291020	used to be scarce more and more abundant. And so we're living in a world where technology is
291020	297100	transforming scarcity into abundance at an extraordinary rate. Everything that we used to
297100	303900	view as scarce, access to food, water, energy, healthcare, education, is blossoming. Now to
303900	310060	be clear, we are living during a time that is chaotic and unpredictable and sometimes downright
310060	316060	scary. I don't deny that at all. We humans like going to sleep and waking up in the morning,
316060	321180	knowing that the world is the same as it was the night before. And it's not. It's changing at an
321180	327980	accelerating rate. And we're not arguing that there are issues, there will be issues for sure.
328540	335100	But even as it's changing at this accelerating rate, what is happening is those things that used
335100	343260	to be scarce are becoming abundant. And so if we look at this, and I believe in what's called
343260	352220	data-driven optimism, there is a huge amount of data that drives towards this vision that abundance
352220	359660	is in fact the future. So first of all, global life expectancy has more than doubled over the last
359660	369660	70 years, from roughly 40 years old to now hitting 75. Global child mortality has precipitously
369660	376940	dropped from 43% in the 1800s down to under 4% today. Maternal mortality rates, women dying in
376940	386220	pregnancy, over the last 20 years alone has dropped 34%. Cancer deaths have reduced by a third over the
386220	394620	last 20 years. You may not believe this, but even democracy has blossomed over the last century. In
394620	405740	1900, about 1% of countries had universal voting rights. Today, it's 96%. Extreme poverty has plummeted
406780	414140	from 95% extreme poverty in the world down to under 10% today. Literacy rights have skyrocketed,
414220	420620	mobile phone uses, we have some 8 billion mobile phones. The poorest on the planet now have
420620	426940	most advanced technology for communications and access to knowledge. We have 5 billion internet
426940	435260	connected individuals. Access to electricity has exploded. We have swatter safety. We have more
435260	442860	access to food. And so the question is, why is this happening? Why are we seeing this incredible
442860	449020	abundance in access that people have? And it's not that we humans have gotten smarter, we don't
449020	456460	have better forms of government or better politicians. It is the technology. Technology is a
456460	463740	scarcity, is a resource liberating force. It transforms scarcity into abundance over and over
463740	469100	again, right? We used to go kill whales to get whale oil to light our nights. Then we ravaged
469100	474540	mountain sides. Then we drilled kilometers under the ground to get access to oil. And now we have
474540	479660	8,000 times more energy hitting the surface of the earth from the sun than we consume as a
479660	487180	species in a year. Energy will become squanderable abundance, right? And that tips water and that
487180	496540	tips health. And so all of these things are increasing abundance. I have zero question.
496620	503180	Now, and by the way, anybody who wants access to this data, if you go to diamandis.com backslash
503180	510700	data, I have 50 charts showing over the last decades and century this increasing access to
510700	516780	abundance. So it's not about creating a world of luxury for everybody, but it's about creating a
516780	529580	world of possibility for everybody. And you're muted, senior. Peter, absolutely perfect. Thank
529580	535260	you so much. And now let's hear from Peter Z. You're answering no to the question, will the
535260	541020	future be abundant? Tell us why. Peter D is absolutely correct. The world of the last 75,
541020	545500	80 years has gotten better and better and better and better. But it's important to understand
545500	550540	why we've been able to go down this technological path. We've had three things going on.
551260	556460	First of all, we had globalization. At the end of World War II, the Americans found themselves
556460	562940	facing off against Stalin on the plains of Europe. And it was a war we knew we could not win. We knew
562940	568700	we needed tens of millions of people to stand not behind us or with us, but in front of us to serve
568700	574380	as cannon fodder. And that meant bribing them. And our bribe was globalization. We used our
574380	579660	navy to open the seas so that anyone could go anywhere and interface with any partner and access
579660	585660	any commodity in any product and sell into any market. If in exchange, you would join us against
585660	591500	the Soviets and it worked and it generated the greatest prosperity and security the world has
591500	598060	ever seen. But the Cold War ended in 92. And ever since then, the United States in a series of ever
598060	603900	more nationalist political contests has elected the guy who wants to do away with it faster.
604380	609260	And the biggest difference between Trump and Biden when it comes to international economics
609260	615420	is that Biden was able to hire a grammar checker. The road hasn't changed. And this is a very strongly
615420	622220	bipartisan issue. And we're moving away from the generations of security and economic growth that
622220	626860	gave us the ability to go down to this technological path. Then there's demographics.
628220	633660	Pre-Stalin, we all lived on farms where kids were free labor. So you'd have as many of them as you
633660	639260	could put up with plus one because that's how you found out it was too many. But then Stalin
639260	643500	brought us globalization and industrialization and urbanization and all the new industrial
643500	649340	jobs were in town. So we moved in to take them. Well, in town, kids aren't free labor. They're
649340	654700	just a source of migraine. So you just fast forward 30 years to the 70s to the 90s. We entered
654700	659660	this weird period where we had huge numbers of young workers and huge amounts of consumption
659660	664620	because of it, but not a lot of kids that we had to spend money on. It was demographically
664620	669500	speaking a moment in time. You fast forward another 20 years to the 2000s and the 2010s,
669500	674940	and we now have lots of mature workers who are over 40 but not yet retired. People were at the
674940	680060	height of their income, but their expenses were under control. So we saw a huge tax base, huge
680060	685500	infrastructure spending, lots of production, lots of investment, which generated, among other things,
685500	691340	the tech boom that brought us the world we're in now. But this too is only a moment in time.
692140	700780	And in the 2020s, we're now aging out. Whether it's Spain or Italy or Germany or Japan or Korea
700780	706540	or Taiwan or China or Thailand, this is the end of the road because that bulge now hits mass
706540	711100	retirement. And we have to come up with something that works without investment or consumption or
711100	717180	production. And we're not going to get that first right on our first try. And then finally, there's
717180	722380	China. China is a country that exists because of globalization and demographic change. It's
722380	728140	utterly dependent upon globalization for access to raw materials and access to markets. But it's
728140	733900	also the fastest urbanizing country in history, which means it's the fastest aging population
733900	739260	in history. And they've already aged so quickly and so far that consumption led growth or cost
739260	744220	competitive production has already faded into memory. Their birth rate fell by more in the last
744220	749660	six years than it did among European Jews during the Holocaust. So even repopulation is now
749660	755180	statistically impossible. And China will cease to exist as a unified industrialized political
755180	761980	economy within 10 years. Major shifts in economic models take at least a couple of decades, and
761980	768380	they are messy. The shift from imperialism to globalization, for example, took the better
768380	774780	part of five decades and gave us two world wars and the Great Depression. So no, abundance is not
774780	782700	the word that I would use to describe the future. We've passed that already. We just heard opening
782700	789820	statements from ex-prize founder Peter Diamandis and geopolitical strategist Peter Zahan. And I
789820	797660	want to trans summarize those briefly. Peter D, you argued yes to the question of will the future
797660	807180	be abundant. Your principal points were that exponential technology changes are making scarce
807180	814700	things more abundant. Technology is moving scarcity into abundance at an incredible rate.
815820	821260	You acknowledge the fact that we're living in a frightening time and that the world is changing
821260	830780	at an accelerated rate. But you gave us some statistics that emphasize your optimism. You
830780	839340	talked about the doubling of global life expectancy over 40 years, the lowering by a huge factor of
839340	846220	child mortality and maternal mortality, the blossoming of democracy despite what it might feel like,
846220	851980	the tumbling of extreme poverty and more. And you asked the question, why is this happening?
852940	860700	And your answer was technology is a resource liberating force and that energy will be a
860700	871340	squanderable abundance. Arguing no to the question was Peter Z. And Peter Z, you acknowledge the
871340	877900	fact that the world has got better, but you thought it was important to understand why it had gotten
877900	883340	better over the last century or so. And you said there were three reasons for that. The first was
883340	891660	globalization. You described following the Second World War the fact that we had bribed the world
891660	900060	through globalization and generated incredible security through that globalization. The second
900060	907180	reason that you put for why things have gotten better are demographics. You described the pre-Stalin
907180	914220	period when people lived in farms and subsequently moved to the towns. And there were huge numbers of
914220	920140	resources in those people. You fasted forward through a couple of decades and a couple of decades
920140	929180	and moments in time where there was abundance of people as in the last 20 years. But you talked about
929180	937020	as we move into the 2020s, we're now aging out in your words. You've got a population bubble
937020	943660	that is hitting mass retirement. We need to come up with a solution and we're not going to do that
943660	951660	on our first try. And then the third reason you laid out was around China. The fastest urbanizing
951660	959500	country in history that is now aging. You described China as a country that will cease to exist
959500	968300	in it as a unified industrialized economy in the next decade. You talked about those three factors,
968300	973660	globalization, demographics, and China being on a positive trajectory and now hitting a negative
973660	982700	trajectory. And the major shifts in systems that we need to manage this
983900	991180	never go smoothly and we're going to get it wrong. So that is why the future is not going to be abundant.
994620	1001820	So let me pick up and ask you both a few questions and pick up where you left off.
1001820	1007980	The first question, and this is for both of you, abundant for whom? How do imbalances and
1007980	1013660	inequities factor into your thinking? Does it matter where you sit? What nationality? What country?
1013660	1017660	What ethnic or socio-economic group? And maybe I'll start with you, Peter D.
1021100	1026940	It matters in the beginning, but it doesn't at the end. In the beginning, when the first mobile
1026940	1033020	phones cost a million dollars in New York, Manhattan for the Wall Street, traders and they
1033020	1039500	worked very poorly. That's the way it was. Towards the end, now there are $40 handsets and
1039500	1043980	they're available to billions of people and they work incredibly well. And not only do they work
1043980	1052140	incredibly well, on this handset which every child on the planet has access to comes the world's
1052140	1057020	information, two-way video conferencing for free libraries of books, entertainment, knowledge,
1057020	1062700	information that were neither available to the heads of nations 20 years ago are now available
1062700	1069820	to the poorest. There are eight billion handsets on the planet. So what we see is technology is a
1069820	1077820	democratizing and demonetizing force. And so, you know, things do begin when they work poorly.
1077820	1083580	They're available to the richest who take the risk and eventually they rapidly demonetize and
1083580	1090220	democratize and are accessible to everyone. We're seeing this on communications. We're seeing this
1090220	1095900	on energy. We're seeing this even in artificial intelligence, right? All the AI systems that
1095900	1100860	we're seeing coming out of Google and different parts of the world are available for free to
1100860	1110620	anyone with a handset. Again, amazing. And so, I believe that this is a force and it's a non-stoppable
1110620	1116060	force and it is what is causing increasing abundance. Whether or not it's used for negative
1116060	1120540	purposes or positive purposes is a different issue. The question we're asking here is it
1120540	1124380	will it be abundant? And yes, these things are abundant across the board.
1124380	1133260	Bundled across the board. A lot of people have described technologies like AI as things that
1133260	1140700	increase inequality. So I just want to quickly, quick follow up with you, Peter. What's your
1140700	1145420	argument to people who say that actually these technologies are increasing inequality rather
1145420	1151980	than decreasing? And then I'll come to you, Peter. Peter Z. Again, my comment is in the beginning
1151980	1158940	they're accessible to a smaller group, but we've seen over and over again these technologies become
1159500	1165500	demonetized and democratized. I talk about the six D's of exponential. When you digitize anything,
1165500	1170940	in the early days of its growth, it's deceptive. 30 doublings later, it's a billion fold bigger
1170940	1175820	and it's disruptive. And it's dematerializing, demonetizing, and democratizing. We've seen
1175820	1183660	this over and over again across every technology. AI is going to be ultimately the best educating
1183660	1189180	system, the best healthcare system will be available to the poorest child and the wealthiest child
1189180	1196460	delivered by AI platforms. Okay, thank you. Peter Z. The question abundant for whom?
1199180	1204860	Geographic factors and demographic factors are not the same everywhere. Some countries are aging
1204860	1210140	faster than others. Others have better borders and better economic geography. And as a rule, gross
1210140	1216060	oversimplification, the Western Hemisphere looks pretty good. They, in many cases, industrialized
1216060	1221260	on a slower rate or from a later start. So their birth rates haven't fallen nearly as much. And what
1221260	1226620	I outlined in my opener is less true for them with the United States being one of the youngest
1226620	1231580	demographies in the world as well as Mexico. So we have a transition period here that's going to be
1231580	1235500	a half a century as opposed to what they're going to have to do in Europe, which is going to be in
1235500	1240140	less than a decade. That buys us a lot of time to figure out the details. It also means that we
1240140	1245500	have the ability of expanding our supply chains to make up for those that fall. But when it comes to
1245500	1253580	technology at its core, the demographic structure is everything. Developing new technologies requires
1253580	1258300	a huge number of people in their 20s and their 30s who are social, who are integrated, who can work
1258300	1264460	as a team and can imagine the future and then figure out how to operationalize it and then figure
1264460	1269980	out how to mass manufacture it. The problem with this process is that every step up until mass
1269980	1276460	manufactured generates no income. And that means you have to have a huge amount of capital to push
1276460	1283100	this whole process forward. Now in the 2000s and the 2010s, we had exactly that world. We had the
1283100	1288860	millennials, which were many, and we had the boomers who were nearing retirement but had not yet
1288860	1293500	retired. So they had their life accumulation of savings, which pushed down capital costs for
1293500	1298380	everybody. That's one of the reasons why growth these last 25 years has been so robust. Lots of
1298380	1304620	young smart people, lots of money for them to do things with. Well, that's over. As of December
1304620	1308700	of last year, half of the world's baby boomers had already retired and they'd liquidated their
1308700	1312940	savings. And so we've seen capital costs triple. They're going to triple again in the next few
1312940	1318620	years. And the oldest baby boomer, sorry millennial, I'm sorry, the oldest millennial, sorry millennials,
1319580	1325580	turns 45 next year. They're no longer the young bucks and the next generation down is small and
1325580	1330940	to be perfectly blunt kind of antisocial. So the environment that has allowed us to push the
1330940	1336460	technological envelopes so far, so fast, so consistently, it's already behind us. And we're
1336460	1341020	already seeing those adjustments throughout the tech space with layoffs, with shutdowns,
1341020	1346460	with focusing more on manufacturing now, rather than idea generation, because we're realizing
1346460	1354220	we're losing China at the same time. So the risk here isn't that we're not going to push the envelope
1354220	1358140	forward. I'd say that's almost impossible. The risk here is we're going to lose too much of where
1358140	1363100	we have and we backslide a little bit. And we're going to find out the answer to that question
1363100	1368860	in just the next five years about whether or not we can retool fast enough. North America
1368860	1372940	basically needs to double the size of the industrial plant. And if we fail that,
1373820	1380300	then we lose a lot of what we already have. I can see that Peter Dee disagrees. So Peter
1380300	1386780	Dee, back to you. I vehemently disagree. Yeah, so this is so wrong in my opinion.
1387740	1395180	What's happening is we have more individuals, more empowered with technology than ever before.
1395180	1400780	We have created an interconnected globe where people have gigabit bandwidth anywhere on the
1400780	1407340	planet. They now have the ability to use AI to code at a speed like never before. The cost is
1407340	1413340	demonetizing of the ability to innovate and create, right? It used to be that it would cost you
1413420	1419980	$100 million to sequence a genome. It's now down to 200 bucks. Your ability to code used to
1419980	1427420	require a massive amount of education. Now you can code just by explaining through natural language
1427420	1433580	what you want. So the speed of innovation is exploding onto the scene. And the number of
1433580	1439420	individuals who've got access to this technology is greater than any time ever in human history.
1439420	1446060	And entrepreneurs that used to require 50 or 100 or 200 people to create a company
1446060	1451260	are now creating a company that's delivering a valuable asset or resource with two or three
1451260	1458460	people. So I think we're seeing a Cambrian explosion of innovation by no means a decrease,
1458460	1466140	and it's going to be accelerating. I'm going to move us on. What I took away from this little bit
1466140	1473820	was Peter Z. You're saying that the world is aging, and so the ratios are changing. And Peter D,
1473820	1478460	you're saying, yeah, but all of those people who weren't part of the system and weren't productive
1478460	1486700	are now part of all $8.1 billion, $8.2 billion are enabled productive. Okay, enabled. I like it,
1486700	1490540	caveat. Let me ask you another question. Again, maybe I'll start with Peter Z this time.
1491340	1500940	Tell me in 30 seconds what you think the future looks like in, say, 2050, and maybe take an American,
1500940	1506460	a standard American, what do you think life looks like? And then I'm going to come to you, Peter Z,
1506460	1513900	for your view as well. I think we're going to make it over the hump. I think we're going to succeed in
1513900	1517420	doubling the size of the industrial plant. And I think we're going to make it through to when the
1517420	1521900	millennials' kids enter the market and rebalance our demographics here. I don't think it's going
1521900	1526860	to take till 2050. I think 2040 will be plenty of time. And we will have a system where we are
1526860	1531180	largely immune to international shocks, and we have local workers serving local markets using
1531180	1536220	local resources. And getting there is going to be the fastest economic growth in the history of
1536220	1540860	Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It's not a good story. It's a great story. It's a story of
1540860	1546460	growth. But I wouldn't call it abundant. It will be driven by a breakdown of the old system.
1548220	1555500	Okay. So Peter Z, 2050 looks good. It's much more localized, but it's an ugly way to get there.
1555500	1564060	Peter D. So I'm going to agree with Peter Z and a lot of that. And I do think 2040,
1564060	1569100	it's hard to predict beyond 2040, honestly. We're going to be in the next 20 years,
1569100	1573740	we're going to be adding healthy decades on to the human lifespan. And that's one of areas that
1573740	1580540	I'm focused on, fingers crossed, and about to launch a massive XPRIZE in that area. But we're
1580540	1586540	going to add 20 healthy years. The study done out of Harvard London School of Business in Oxford
1586540	1594140	said that for every healthy year you add to the lifespan of humanity, it's worth $38 trillion
1594140	1601660	to the global economy. So we have more people living longer, healthier lives. It's positive on
1601660	1607260	both sides of the equation, more empowered than ever before. We're going to see AI have the most
1607260	1612460	disruptive and most reinventive impact. There are going to be two kinds of companies at the
1612460	1617420	end of this decade, those fully utilizing AI and those out of business. It's going to be that black
1617420	1625100	and white. And so we're going to see AI as the closest analogy for me is Jarvis from Ironman,
1625980	1631340	where it's your partner, it's your co-pilot, it's your inspiration, it's your collaborator.
1631660	1638300	Across everything, allowing you to fulfill your dreams, giving you access to not information
1638300	1644460	but knowledge. I'm going to come back to productivity towards the end of this time,
1644460	1649340	but I want to move on to climate. And Peter Dee, I want to turn to you first and say,
1650780	1656860	aren't we using up the Earth's resources? Will there ever be a tipping point at which we can't
1656860	1663740	multiply them or become sufficiently efficient or productive to deliver more with less? Is science
1663740	1677420	going to allow this? This idea that we are scarcity-bound, again, is built into our old brain
1677420	1683420	that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years. We're living, again, in a world where technology
1683420	1689180	liberates resources. So again, we used to kill whales to get whale oil. Now we're on the verge
1689180	1695580	of fusion, which will give us near infinite energy. We still have an oil economy and we will for the
1695580	1700300	next 20 or 30 years. There's no issue about that, but we're going to be increasing the amount of
1700300	1707500	resources available to us. We're about to launch a very large XPRIZE for large-scale desalination.
1708060	1715340	We fight over water. 97.5% of the water on the planet is salt, 2% is ice, and we fight over
1715340	1721100	a half a percent of the water on this planet. But there's an abundance-minded way of thinking about
1721100	1725340	it. There's plenty of water. We live on a water planet. It's just not a usable form. That's where
1725340	1731900	technology comes in to capture trillions of tons of water out of the atmosphere. We call it rain
1732620	1739900	or desalinate water out of the oceans. What other resources do we consider scarce? Because
1739900	1746300	I can show you the technologies that can make it abundant. I'll just say for climate real quick,
1747100	1754220	our ability to bring the earth back into balance is something fundamentally critical,
1754220	1760140	and I think I would rather be fighting that battle today with the tech we have versus 20 or 30 years
1760220	1767660	ago. Peter Z, do you want to come back on that? By the way, you don't need my permission to push
1767660	1772940	back on one another, but I have a feeling, Peter Z, there might be something you want to answer to
1772940	1777500	that one. Well, you know, me and Peter D were both such shrinking violets. Thank you for unleashing.
1777500	1782940	I noticed that, really. You're very well behaved, both of you. Go ahead, Peter Z.
1783740	1787900	Sure. Climate change is definitely a big issue. Anyone who thinks they can predict it on a zip
1787900	1792540	code by zip code basis, I think is a little crazy because our math just isn't that good yet.
1792540	1798460	My concern isn't, on this topic, isn't so much that we don't have the tools. It's that we don't
1798460	1803260	have the tools, yeah, to deal with it yet. I think a best example I can give you is what it takes to
1803260	1809260	put up a solar panel. Aluminum is the most energy intensive of the primary industries that we have,
1809260	1815820	if you look at steel and fertilizer and the rest. Taking raw silicon and turning it into a finished
1815820	1822780	silicon panel requires seven times the energy that it takes to make the same volume of aluminum.
1823820	1828460	We're probably going to lose most of our capacity to produce polysilicon at scale
1828460	1835820	when the Chinese break down. The issue here is ultimately out of timeframes. How long does it
1835820	1841020	take to build the industrial plant? How long does it take to apply the technology? The issue that
1841020	1846540	Peter D and I have always struggled with is whether or not we've already passed the point of no
1846540	1851100	return on these technologies and we no longer need the old system to push it forward, or whether we
1851100	1856940	do need time to move it forward. I think the best example I can give you there of where we haven't
1856940	1863900	crossed the Rubicon yet is AI. AI chips are all three nanometer or smaller. They all come from the
1863900	1869580	same city in Taiwan, but that makes it sound a lot simpler than it is. There are 9,000 companies
1869580	1874540	that are involved in the manufacturing system to allow those fabrication plants to work,
1874540	1879180	and over half of them only produce one product for one customer and they have no competition
1879180	1883980	anywhere else in the world. So if you peel out any small section of the global system that's
1883980	1889420	technologically oriented, like say Germany, which is any severe demographic collapse right now,
1890300	1897100	we lose the ability to make those chips at all, or certainly at scale. Now we can rebuild that
1897100	1903820	ecosystem, but it takes time. So everything that Peter D said about productivity, I agree. The question
1903820	1911580	is whether that's this decade, the next decade, or the decade after. Okay, I'm going to go back.
1911580	1917420	We've got so much to cover in so little time, so I'm going to ask for quite snappy responses if I
1917420	1924860	can get from you. I want to come back to you, Peter D. I love it. I'm coming back. I want to go back
1924860	1931820	to you, Peter D. There's a war in Ukraine. We've got a growing conflict in the Middle East.
1932940	1938620	Peter Z has already bought up China and his view that China is my language, not yours, Peter Z,
1938620	1945100	but effectively in decline and over the next decade. We have a vulnerable Taiwan. I haven't
1945100	1954060	even talked about Iran and Russia. Are we on the verge of a great powers war? And does that, how does
1954860	1963900	this conflict affect your assessment? There's no question that there's lots of reasons to be
1963900	1973020	scared, concerned, frightful, and so forth. What I draw confidence from is history as well as a
1973020	1979580	projected future. You know, if you ask anybody, you know, would you rather live in the year 1900
1979580	1985420	or the year 2023? If you truly understood what life was like in 1900, where you were working
1985420	1991100	80-hour work weeks, your 12-year-old kids were in the factories, you were dead by 40 from tuberculosis,
1991900	1998700	you'd have to answer, I'd rather live today. And so the world has gotten extraordinarily better
1998700	2003980	by almost every measure, not every measure, but by almost every measure over the last 123 years.
2004860	2009820	And over that 123 years, we've also seen World War I, World War II, the Spanish
2009820	2017340	Flu, the Vietnam War, 150 million people died needlessly in those conflicts, and yet the world
2017340	2025820	has gotten extraordinarily better. This is not a straight and linear path. It has got ups and
2025820	2030940	downs, ups and downs, but what I truly believe is, yes, we're going to have these problems,
2030940	2037180	and we're going to overcome them. And the number one way to allow people to become more peaceful
2038380	2045660	is to give them access to prosperity. And technology does that. If you have access to all
2045660	2049420	of, you know, if your kids have access to the food, water, energy, health, care, education,
2051420	2054540	they're not going to want to go kill themselves and put on a suicide vest.
2055100	2063420	You've just silenced me for one moment. Thank you for that image.
2064620	2069980	Peter Z, I'm going to come back to you for one final quick question before I get back
2069980	2075100	to this issue of time that we keep coming up with. And I want to talk to you about population,
2075100	2082220	because that's one of the big issues that you've put on the table. Thomas Malthus back in 1798
2082300	2085420	predicted the population growth would outstrip food production.
2086700	2090620	Since then, numerous other scientists and experts have said similarly,
2091580	2097740	including most notably Paul Ehrlich and his wife in the population bomb in the late 60s.
2097740	2101900	They've all been wrong. Why is this moment different?
2103260	2107900	Industrialization. Industrialization plus technology introduced us to this very
2107900	2112140	simple concept called synthetic fertilizer. And it was applied at scale. And we were able to
2112140	2117500	put it on geographies that without it could not grow food, things like the Brazilian Serato,
2117500	2123500	for example. And that effectively increased the amount of land that we could cultivate by a factor
2123500	2130700	of three. And that's what's kept us all alive. As long as there is no disruption to the synthetic
2130700	2136460	fertilizer supply chain, we're good. China is where the single largest source of phosphate
2136460	2141900	comes from Belarus and Russia. The single largest source of potash and nitrogen is a natural gas
2141900	2145340	derivative. And we're going to lose access to a lot of that from the Russian space in the Middle
2145340	2152940	East as well. So we're going to have to hack the genome of plants in order to grow more food with
2152940	2159020	less fertilizer. And it is a race against time, whether we can figure out a way to improve yields
2159020	2165580	on the genetic side faster than we lose the ability to produce it on the synthetic fertilizer side.
2165660	2170300	And I do not have enough confidence to tell you how we're going to come down on that race.
2172460	2177660	So time is a big issue here, not just because our clock is ticking. So I'm going to come back to
2177660	2182220	you both with one last question that's on time. We've talked a lot about time as a macro sense,
2182220	2189900	but I want to talk about time in a micro sense. Peter Dee, in your 2012 book, Abundance, you
2189900	2197420	quote Matt Ridley that, and I love this, save time is the best definition of prosperity.
2198620	2202780	You give a whole host of examples of how time has been saved. You've done that today as well.
2203580	2208300	But many would argue today that time is an increasingly rare commodity. Expectations of
2208300	2215580	what we achieve in any moment has multiplied many times over. So I'd love to get from both of you
2215580	2221980	what do you say to this argument about time and prosperity? And you both have about 25 seconds
2221980	2232460	to do it. So maybe Peter Z, start with you. So save time is the best definition of prosperity.
2232460	2238300	So for you, Peter Z, what do you say to the argument that actually time is shrinking, in fact?
2240060	2244380	Electrification. Electrification allowed us to push back the night that gave us the
2244380	2248060	woman's rights movement, because all of a sudden women could have time to do things that were not
2248060	2255660	related to the household. Holding those advantages is our single biggest challenge. If we lose China,
2255660	2261500	if we lose the capital that comes from a positive demographic structure, our ability to hold the
2261500	2269020	line on industrialization itself is at risk. And electrification requires globalization,
2269020	2274860	and we could see a significant regression in the next 15 years as we lose the ability to do that
2274860	2280620	at scale on a planet-wide basis. And an asteroid could strike us and we'd all be dead. But the
2280620	2286300	fact of the matter is, you know, every human on the planet has one thing in common, 24 hours in
2286300	2291100	a day, seven days in a week, and how you use that time that differentiates wealth and capabilities.
2291100	2296780	And, you know, Google saved us from going to the libraries. ChatGPT is now giving us increased,
2296780	2302460	you know, so yes, we are resetting our expected performance per unit time,
2303260	2308620	and it's exploding onto the world, right? And so our ability to solve problems, to create new
2308620	2316700	products, to create additional prosperity is increasing at an exponential rate because of
2316700	2321740	these technologies. And these technologies enable us to solve the problems, you know, whether it's
2321740	2329180	labor from robots or AI, you know, I would rather bet on today than any time in human history.
2329900	2333900	We're going to bring some other voices in, some members of the audience.
2333900	2339500	Up first, we have Alexa Mikhail of Fortune Magazine. Alexa, welcome. What's your question for the
2339500	2347820	debaters? Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, so, Peter D, I'll start with you. You know,
2347900	2355180	you mentioned that in advances in technology and research has really expanded, you know,
2355180	2360700	not just health, not just lifespan, but health span, and we're going to have these 20 extra years.
2360700	2364620	So I kind of want to talk about what those years are really going to look like and what it's going
2364620	2371100	to sort of mean to age, to age in this country, given that, you know, this is sort of uncharted
2371100	2376780	territory, especially that I think people would argue that, you know, people are also, you know,
2376860	2382540	aging into poverty. People are dealing with caregiving duties. And so what's that going to
2382540	2388300	look like? Yeah, it's a challenge, Alexa, because people are probably not saving enough money for
2388300	2395260	those extra years. You know, the reality is people retire because of one of three reasons,
2395260	2404460	either they're in pain, they're either low on energy or they're forced to retire. But what happens
2404460	2410140	at 65 or 70, if at the top of your game, we've got all the energy, all the capabilities, everything
2410140	2418700	you've ever had and more, I think it's going to be a boom for global GDP if we allow people to
2418700	2423980	continue working. I think we're going to enter a new period of life where you're starting your next
2423980	2429340	startup, you're getting your next university degree, you're exploring the world even more.
2429340	2437660	You know, we shut down people's earning capacity at 65. Why? What if they don't have to? I think
2437660	2445660	it's a huge economic window of opportunity that is coming. We obviously need to change the, oh, sorry.
2446540	2450540	I was going to say, Alexa, do you have a, go ahead, Peter, but I think Alexa also had a
2450540	2454220	separate question for you. But Peter, if you want to respond quickly, go ahead.
2455260	2458060	I was just going to say, we obviously have to change the political incentives right now and
2458060	2462780	that requires reform of a lot of programs that encourage people to stop even before 65. And
2462780	2467180	from a medical point of view, the technology to watch is biologics, because if we can figure out
2467180	2473580	a way to make people productive without the mental degradation, that obviously moves the metrics on
2473580	2481340	a lot of this. Alex, you had a question for Peter Z, too. Yeah, thank you. I mean, I think you touched
2481340	2485660	on it a little bit, but given, you know, that you talked about mass retirement and people also
2485660	2490940	involuntary retirement as well, and just thinking about, in your mind, kind of similar to what I
2490940	2495660	asked for your D, sort of, what do you hope to envision about this, as we're going to be living
2495660	2500780	longer? I think of all the technologies that are on the table that are about to be manifested,
2500780	2506060	you know, which is, I'm stepping into Peter D's world here a little bit. Keeping mental
2506060	2512540	acuity firm throughout your 60s and 70s is the single most important one, because if you can
2512540	2518780	do that, we get an extra group of people, roughly 70 million in the United States, who can be part
2518780	2523260	of whatever the future solution and struggles are, as opposed to being part of the problem.
2523980	2527340	And that is one of the very few technologies that I'm, like, watching very, very closely,
2527340	2530780	because it looks like it's right at the cusp, and we might be able to tip that
2530780	2534700	into usefulness within the next 24 months. And that's very good. Pushing hard. Pushing hard. Yeah.
2534700	2540780	Please, please, please continue. Thank you. I'm hearing some positivity here. Thanks so much,
2541020	2547660	Alexa. Next, I want to invite Diane Francis to our stage. Diane is from the National Post.
2547660	2552940	Diane, what question do you have for the debaters? Well, I think this is a marvelous
2552940	2561260	said debate. I really enjoyed it. Am I on mute? We can hear you. Go right ahead. Great. Great
2561260	2569580	debate. Here's my question. Human nature. Malevolent usage, lack of regulation, anti-regulation,
2570540	2575900	ignorance, and, and algorithms in the form of very dangerous religions and theologies.
2576460	2583500	What, you know, tech can't solve that, in fact, could be, and is being utilized to a bigger,
2583500	2591100	worse extent than before. I'd like you to comment on that as well. I'll jump in. And you're absolutely
2591100	2596300	right. There's no question that we're going to see malevolent use of AI. And it's my biggest
2596300	2601580	concern over the next one to five years. I think we're going to see the election be patient zero
2602220	2610620	in this situation. I think on the flip side, what's going on is what I would call loss of privacy
2611180	2617660	is going to be a countervailing force. It's hard to hide things more than ever before. So our,
2617660	2623180	you know, it's going to be a white hat, black hat race in terms of AI being used to help determine
2623820	2631260	malevolent AI's usage. And one question to ask everybody listening is, do you believe that
2631260	2638380	human nature is ultimately good or bad? I believe it is ultimately good. And I believe that an
2638380	2643260	entrepreneur, and this is my mission is to inspire and guide entrepreneurs to create a hopeful,
2643260	2647900	compelling, and abundant future for humanity. That's my massive transformative purpose. I say it
2647900	2653580	every morning. It drives all of my organizations and my companies. Entrepreneurs are individuals
2653580	2660060	who find problems and fix problems. And so, you know, the world's largest problems are the world's
2660060	2665580	biggest business opportunities. So when you see a problem, it's an entrepreneurial opportunity.
2665580	2670300	And I think we have more positive mind than entrepreneurs trying to find and slay and solve
2670300	2679820	problems than any time ever in human history. Peter Z, I think that question was also framed
2679820	2684380	at you, wasn't it, Diane? Absolutely. Sure. Let me give you the bad and then the good. First
2684380	2688860	the bad. We've got two major powers, the Russians and the Chinese, who are going to vanish from the
2688860	2693020	world over the course of the next generation or two. The question is whether it happens fast or
2693020	2696940	slow. And when countries feel they're in a corner and they have nothing to lose, the chances of
2696940	2701820	them doing something that they normally wouldn't consider, of course, rises very high. But let
2701820	2707580	me give you two examples of why I don't think that their decline is going to be catastrophic
2707580	2713900	for the rest of us. In the case of China, they don't command the top technology. They import
2713900	2719420	all the server time, they import all the chips that are necessary for them to access AI at scale.
2719420	2723660	And we're already in the early stages of the Biden administration and whoever follows Biden,
2723660	2728620	probably working to build a wall in that space. That limits the damage that can be done from a
2728620	2736780	strategic point of view. The Russians, back in 1987, when the KGB realized that the end was
2736780	2741900	nigh, and remember back in the late 80s, the KGB controlled the Politburo. They basically
2741900	2745500	had a meeting where they decided whether or not they wanted to spread nuclear weapons around
2745500	2750300	the world and salt the earth to destroy whatever the West might do next. And they decided the
2750380	2759580	answer was no. Even in the darkest hour for a lot of these countries, the desire to end the human
2759580	2765260	condition just doesn't exist. That doesn't mean they die quietly. That doesn't mean there aren't
2765260	2772540	problems. And we are still cleaning up the mess from the Soviet disintegration. But it does mean
2772540	2780860	there are limits. I am far more concerned about powerful individuals that maybe don't have restrictions
2780860	2784860	on their actions than I am about powerful countries that are getting desperate. And that's a different
2784860	2791740	sort of problem. Peter D, I think you've just come up with a great suggestion of another debate,
2791740	2796300	which is are people inherently good or bad? And if open to debate haven't done it yet,
2797180	2801100	we'll make sure they do. Great question, Diane. Do you have a follow-up?
2802300	2808700	No, I think that the organizational aptitude of human beings, unless it's taken over by tech,
2808700	2814700	and then I want to know who controls that fact, has been a constant historical disappointment.
2814700	2822140	Not just politically, but in terms of parenting, in terms of financial moving forward. This is a
2822140	2828620	huge issue. And putting the hands of powerful, increasingly powerful tech into people that
2828620	2834540	may not be good is something that I don't see talked enough about. There was a warning letter
2834540	2840460	about the AI chatbot. Nothing is moving. And any jurisdictions as to how to try and look at
2840460	2846220	what problems they've raised. So I just wondered, how optimistic are you, Peter? Because you're
2846220	2859340	my optimist. I am clear that these are really serious issues. I was just on stage in Saudi
2859340	2867900	and Riyadh at FII, heading their AI resolutions. And I think ultimately, artificial intelligence
2867900	2875260	has the ability to deliver extraordinary abundance for humanity. But talking about time frames,
2875340	2880940	as Peter Z said, this is the 10-year out time frame. There are going to be challenges and
2880940	2886300	issues in the near term. It's the one to five-year period that I'm concerned about navigating that
2887100	2895340	and allowing humanity to adjust to it. It is transformative change. And I think we humans
2895340	2899820	do not like change. We like waking up in the morning and knowing that the world was the same
2899820	2904300	as it was when we went to sleep, no matter what condition we're in. And we are in an accelerating
2904300	2908780	period of change. And it is creating more abundance, which is the topic here.
2910060	2916940	I think you can be a little bit more optimistic, Ms. Francis. We have a little bit more time than
2916940	2920860	I think most people think. If we have a problem with the chip production, which I think we're
2920860	2924300	going to, that buys us a few more years right there. And the fact that we're already having
2924300	2927980	these discussions, I mean, think about everything that is going on in the American Congress right
2927980	2933980	now. What a mess it is. They still found a time over the last several weeks to have an open session
2933980	2939820	about the ethics of artificial intelligence. So unlike previous technological revolutions,
2939820	2945180	where we come very late to the game, we're discussing this one as it unfolds. It doesn't
2945180	2948780	mean we're going to get it right on the first try, but we're at least not going into it blind.
2951180	2957580	So what I love about where this conversation is going is I almost hear like the two of you have
2958220	2964380	flipped a little bit your views. But let's bring on. Thank you so much, Diane, for your questions.
2964380	2970700	Let's bring on Andy Wang to the stage. Andy is the host of the podcast called Inspired Money.
2970700	2978620	Andy, welcome. Go ahead with your question. Thank you, Zanya. From an investor's perspective,
2978620	2983660	there are always growth opportunities. And at the same time, other areas that are contracting,
2983740	2990380	I'd like to hear from both Peter D. and Peter Z. Given your respective outlooks, what areas might
2990380	2995900	be beneficiaries of major trends over the next couple of decades? Are there companies, sectors,
2995900	3000060	or geographic regions where investors should look for opportunities?
3004060	3012780	Why don't I do Peter? Okay. So Andy, I'm investing my money, my venture fund money,
3012780	3021420	my time in two areas. Healthspan, healthcare, biotech. I think people would give an extraordinary
3021420	3027820	amount of their wealth to add 20 plus healthy years. And AI, I think those are the two largest
3027820	3033740	markets on the planet. And they're going to transform every single thing that we have and we do.
3035260	3041340	What's on the downside? Any company that is not an exponential organization that is born
3043500	3048060	more than 30 years ago are going to be outcompeted, outthought, and actually
3048060	3050140	massively disrupted what's coming down the pipe?
3053100	3057100	I think we need to focus on the scarcity in order to have the opportunity to turn it into
3057100	3063100	abundance. So number one, we need to diversify the semiconductor supply chain for the best chips.
3063100	3069020	Right now, we are incredibly fragile in that and anything breaks anywhere and the whole thing stops.
3069020	3073260	Building that will take years, but it's certainly within our technical capacity to do it and the
3073260	3080220	benefits I agree with Peter D are so outsized. It's totally worth our time. Second, if agriculture
3080220	3085500	goes the way I'm fearing, we need a drastic increase in production. The two ways to do that,
3085500	3091180	ironically, are both related to AI. One is automating farming to a degree so that each individual
3091180	3096380	plant gets individual attention. That requires AI and the tractor in order to put pesticides,
3096380	3100060	fertilizers, water, whatever it happens to be on a plant-by-plant basis. I call it digital
3100060	3106300	gardening. And the other aspect is hacking the genome of absolutely everything. We've been
3106300	3112140	moving in that direction for 30 years. 10 years ago, corn plants were 13 feet tall. Now they're
3112140	3118460	closer to five, but they generate three times as many kernels as the old system did. We need more
3118460	3124140	of that because if we can't provide broadcast agriculture for a place like Brazil, then places
3124140	3130540	like Illinois need at least double input to prevent a billion people from starving. This can
3130540	3137580	probably all be done in less than a decade, but chop chop. I agree 100% with you, Peter. It is,
3137580	3144300	we're seeing incredible, we're seeing a new species of rice that are able to have multiple
3145980	3152540	crops per planting. And for those who are concerned about GMO, listen, GMO has never killed anybody,
3152540	3157100	but I can guarantee you it's saved hundreds of millions of lives. I'm less interested in rice
3157820	3161260	soy, I think is the one that's going to be the real game changer because it's a protein plant
3161260	3165660	instead of a starch plant. We also have vertical farming and cultivated meats coming online. The
3165660	3170700	idea that we have to eat food the way it's always been produced, in the words grow an entire cow to
3170700	3177180	get access to meat, is going to be seen as insane in the future. Why not just grow the protein that
3177180	3182540	you need to make a good burger? That's a full topic for a whole other debate. I agree.
3187340	3193260	Thanks so much, Andy. Really grateful for your question. I've got a question for the two of you,
3193260	3199500	if I may, which is what's the one argument, and maybe we'll start with Peter Z. What's the one
3199500	3208620	argument from your colleague that you agree or disagree most with and why? Well, you know,
3208620	3214140	we actually don't disagree on what technology can do. We don't disagree really on what the
3214140	3219100	pace of technology can exchange or it can achieve. Our big disagreement is whether the system we're
3219100	3223580	in today is sustainable in the near-term future or not, or if we have to go through a bit of a
3223580	3228540	drop before we start back up. I would argue that demographics very clearly means that we're going
3228620	3232940	to have to take a breather here. I don't see a way around that. I don't see how manufacturing supply
3232940	3238460	chains that allow technology to apply to scale can continue this decade without a massive reorganization.
3239260	3246700	But on the rest of this, I'm with him. Excellent. Peter D. Yeah, I have to say,
3246700	3254220	I agree with much of what Peter Z has said here. The only thing I would say is it's a linear
3254220	3260220	extrapolation to believe that re-engineering the supply chain will take as long as it has,
3260860	3267260	because we've got capabilities coming from AI that are going to help us much more rapidly
3267260	3271900	re-engineer. We have even talked about quantum technologies coming down the pike that are going
3271900	3278620	to be impacting material science and biology in an extraordinary fashion. So I think if we were
3278620	3284220	going to try and re-replicate the old school system we've developed over the industrial
3284220	3290860	military complex of the last century, yeah, it will take many, many decades. But I think we have
3290860	3298140	shortcuts to be had based upon technology. Having said that, yes, there are supply chain issues.
3298140	3302060	We saw that during COVID, which can be put us in a precarious situation.
3302620	3308060	Let me give you an example to show you the promise in the peril. Textiles. Very unsexy
3308060	3312940	technology was the root of industrialization over a century ago. The model has always been the same
3312940	3317340	and up until the 90s in the United States, it was women in Appalachia with snowing machines.
3317340	3321740	Well, then we got NAFTA and the model moved to Mexico where the women with the sewing machines
3321740	3325420	were cheaper. And then we had the WTO where it moved to India and China where the women with
3325420	3329820	the sewing machines were cheaper. Then we had COVID and suddenly we didn't have clothes.
3330780	3335420	So some enterprising folks in North Carolina built some facilities that are two acres under
3335420	3341020	one roof that take raw cotton, clean it, turn it into thread and then yarn and then cloth and then
3341020	3347740	close. And the end product is cheaper than what you get out of Bangladesh per unit. And these places
3347740	3354540	have a staff of two. We had no idea we could do that until we were pushed and we found out we had
3354540	3360540	to. We're going to find things like that as we reindustrialize, but we're not going to know what
3360540	3366620	they are until they happen. But you're making the exact point I want to make. A company variant
3366620	3373180	3D that's here in Malibu is 3D printing clothing at an extraordinary rate in a lights out scenario.
3373180	3379420	And I think this is what entrepreneurs do. They demonetize and democratize. And I think anybody
3379420	3383500	listening to this, you know, there are massive opportunities to get ahead of the curve.
3386140	3390540	We've only got about two minutes left and I want to bring in what is a great question from one of
3390540	3395260	our audience, which is about the political system. And I want to give it to both of you.
3395260	3401180	Perhaps start with you, Peter Z, because you've given us the kind of almost apocalyptic view
3401900	3406860	in the short term. How has our political system contributed to accelerating abundance?
3407820	3413580	And is it a quip? Do you agree, first of all, and is it a quip to continue to do so? And then
3413580	3415900	I'll come back to you with the same question, Peter Z.
3419420	3423500	An understanding of where we are. We have a first past the post electoral system,
3423500	3427740	which means we have two very big tent parties with lots of factions. And the factions move
3427740	3431980	around over time as technology and demographics and geopolitics shift. And if you think in the
3431980	3436620	last 40 years, a lot's gone down, it would make sense for us to rearrange our system now.
3437180	3443340	This is the seventh time we have done this. We will get through it. Doesn't mean you're going
3443340	3447980	to like what it looks like on the other side. But at moments of transition like this, we get two
3447980	3452940	things. Personalities from the outside that just stir the pot, we've seen plenty of those,
3453660	3459180	and civil society takes over the governmental process because the government becomes
3459260	3467820	unable to do it itself. So that second piece, that's social media. That's the Elon Musk's
3467820	3471340	of the world. We might not like it every day, but you got to admit the situation's become a
3471340	3475260	lot more dynamic and there are a lot more decision makers out there when it comes to
3475260	3481660	economic and technological trends. It's loud. It's messy, but I'd argue it's taken us in the right
3481660	3491660	direction. Okay, Peter Dee. Zinnia, I count on entrepreneurship and capitalism to solve problems.
3491660	3498380	I never depend on the government. Period. End of statement. That was a beautiful brief answer.
3498380	3504380	Okay, we are outsourcing our governance is what I hear almost from both of you, actually.
3505020	3513260	Now's the time to bring it home with closing remarks. I'm going to go to you, Peter Dee, first.
3513260	3519180	You have the floor. Leave us with a reason to believe that yes is the answer to the question,
3519180	3526620	will the future be abundant? Okay, I built an AI model called Peterbot,
3527180	3532700	and I'm going to ask Peterbot to go ahead and respond to Peter Zion. Peterbot, would you?
3533500	3538300	Peter Zion's assertion that we are returning to a world resembling pre-World War Two
3538300	3544220	is overly pessimistic. The world today is vastly different with exponential technologies
3544220	3549020	driving progress. Let's focus on leveraging these capabilities to create a future that
3549020	3554780	surpasses any previous era. I understand Peter's concerns about a pricier and slower world,
3554780	3560300	but I see this as a temporary transition. I believe in the potential of technology to solve
3560300	3565820	global challenges. History shows that advancements have consistently improved our lives.
3565820	3572380	Let's dive into a few concrete examples. One, energy. We're witnessing a global shift towards
3572380	3577900	renewable energy sources like solar and wind, with costs plummeting and installations surging
3577900	3584540	worldwide. Two, transportation. Electric vehicles are gaining traction, with major automakers
3584540	3590620	investing heavily. Additionally, we're seeing advancements in autonomous vehicles, hyperloop
3590620	3597500	technology, and even flying taxis. Three, education. Online learning platforms are democratizing
3597500	3603980	education, allowing people worldwide to access high quality educational resources. Virtual reality
3603980	3608780	and augmented reality are transforming the learning experience. These examples illustrate
3608780	3614140	how innovation and technology are reshaping various sectors, creating opportunities for positive
3614140	3621500	change and a brighter future. You can access peterbot.ai. You can ask it questions about
3623020	3629260	its train of my books and my blogs. I believe in data-driven optimism, and the data has been
3629260	3636140	consistent up and to the right for the past century. Technology, which has made that transition,
3636140	3643100	is not slowing down. It's accelerating. Is there danger out there? Of course. Do I believe in
3643180	3649020	entrepreneurs and individuals to find and solve problems more than ever before? I think they're
3649020	3657100	the only ones who do. Is the world becoming more abundant? 100%. It is becoming abundant in terms
3657100	3666380	of access to all the fundamentals. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Peter Bot. Now, Peter Z.,
3666380	3671740	you have the final word. You're a butthole, please. Tell us why you answer no to the question,
3671740	3677980	will the future be abundant? We don't have the redundancy yet. We don't have the resiliency yet.
3677980	3682780	And if things go with demographics in China and globalization the way I'm anticipating,
3682780	3689260	we don't have that in finance or industrial materials or manufacturing or above all agriculture.
3689260	3697580	And until we do, people are going to get left behind at scale. Hopefully, over the next 20 years,
3697580	3702700	we can work out the kinks of this transition and not lose a lot of what we've achieved in the last
3702700	3709020	century. But if you look back on the two millennia of history before 1900, that suggests that
3710860	3716540	unlocking that potential is a lot more difficult than it seems to us at the moment we're in now.
3719020	3722860	That was a very quick wrap up. Thank you so much, Peter. That's confidence.
3723660	3730380	No, that's, you know what? That's confidence. I like it. That concludes our debate. I'd really
3730380	3738140	like to both thank, I will say all three of you, Peter, Peter Barton, Peter, for showing up and
3738140	3743420	for approaching this debate with an open mind. We really appreciate you bringing the thoughtful
