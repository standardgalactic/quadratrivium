00:00.000 --> 00:22.560
Hello everybody and welcome to Open to Debate. I'm Zania Wicked, your guest moderator for

00:22.560 --> 00:26.920
today. Having spent a number of years in the policy domain, including the State Department

00:26.920 --> 00:31.680
and the White House, I now make my living by trying to ask the right questions, either

00:31.680 --> 00:37.400
as a moderator or coach, in order to bring clarity and direction to people and organisations.

00:37.400 --> 00:45.000
And my job today is to do just that on the topic of will the future be abundant. In 2011,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.400
the Pew Research Centre conducted a study that showed, for the first time, that more

00:49.400 --> 00:53.480
Americans thought that their children were going to be worse off themselves than thought

00:53.480 --> 01:00.120
otherwise. That trend has continued. Imprinted in our basic genetic makeup is the commitment

01:00.120 --> 01:05.680
to ensure the propagation of the species, and not just its continuation, but in such a way

01:05.680 --> 01:11.400
that we are healthier and happier. And it's in this context that I can't think of a more

01:11.400 --> 01:16.560
important question to answer than whether the future will be abundant or not. What world

01:16.560 --> 01:22.080
are we leaving for our children, for our species? This is not about whether we are optimists

01:22.080 --> 01:27.280
or pessimists, nor is it about the political oscillations that consume the papers every

01:27.280 --> 01:35.840
day. This is about understanding the underlying trend line. Is the future going to be abundant?

01:35.840 --> 01:40.400
As a former policymaker, it's a vital question to answer, one that drives behaviours, our

01:40.400 --> 01:44.800
own, that of our businesses, our societies and our governments. It is one that should

01:44.800 --> 01:50.280
drive our international relations. So, to talk us through the dynamics, and to answer

01:50.280 --> 01:55.560
the question of will the future be abundant, we have two Peters. Let's get into it and

01:55.560 --> 02:02.760
meet our debaters. Arguing yes, the future will be abundant, Peter Diamandis, founder

02:02.760 --> 02:08.760
and executive chairman of XPRIZE Foundation, and author of Abundance, The Future is Better

02:08.760 --> 02:13.880
Than You Think, and The Future is Faster Than You Think. Welcome, Peter.

02:13.880 --> 02:19.480
A pleasure to be here. Good to be here. And arguing no to the question, will the future

02:19.480 --> 02:24.720
be abundant, is geopolitical strategist and author of The End of the World is Just the

02:24.720 --> 02:31.440
Beginning, Peter Zahan. Welcome, Peter. Great to be here. Now, because we have two Peters

02:31.440 --> 02:36.840
debating with us today, I'm going to be referring to each of you as Peter D and Peter Z, to

02:36.840 --> 02:43.760
try and minimise some confusion. Before we get started, I just want to take a quick sense

02:43.760 --> 02:49.440
of what motivates you both to make this argument. So, I'm going to ask you each to take the

02:49.440 --> 02:54.400
30 seconds and tell us why you're here today. Peter D, what are the stakes for you in this

02:54.400 --> 03:01.520
argument? An individual's mindset is probably the single most important tool they have to

03:01.520 --> 03:07.440
solving problems and creating a better world. And our inherent mindset that we evolved over

03:07.440 --> 03:14.000
100,000 years is one of fear and scarcity. But that doesn't put you in a very good position

03:14.000 --> 03:19.420
to solve problems. Having an abundance mindset, optimistic mindset is probably the most important

03:19.420 --> 03:25.520
thing for delivering a future for our children that is better than our past. And so, my mission

03:25.520 --> 03:32.180
here is to give people a clear understanding of why the future is extraordinarily abundant

03:32.180 --> 03:38.760
and why they're more empowered than ever before to create that future. Phenomenal. It's about

03:38.760 --> 03:44.580
mindset. And Peter Z, the same question for you. Why did you show up? We've been living

03:44.580 --> 03:48.700
through one of the most atypical periods in human history, and a lot of us have drawn

03:48.780 --> 03:54.140
linear forecasts as to where that takes us. That's never been true and it's not true now. We're

03:54.140 --> 03:59.420
entering a period of extreme change, and my goal is to get people to understand the size of the

03:59.420 --> 04:04.700
icebergs ahead of us and where they are so we can navigate around them. The future isn't necessarily

04:04.700 --> 04:10.220
dark, but that doesn't mean there's going to be anything we can predict. Okay, so this goes to

04:10.220 --> 04:15.580
the core, both of you. So let's get to our opening statements. We want each of you to take a few

04:15.580 --> 04:22.540
minutes to explain your position. Peter D, you're first and you're arguing yes to the question,

04:22.540 --> 04:25.100
will the future be abundant? Tell us why.

04:28.620 --> 04:35.100
Exponential technologies, and I define those as computation, sensors, networks, AI, robotics,

04:35.100 --> 04:42.700
3D printing, AR, VR, blockchain, biotech, are technologies that are making those things that

04:42.700 --> 04:51.020
used to be scarce more and more abundant. And so we're living in a world where technology is

04:51.020 --> 04:57.100
transforming scarcity into abundance at an extraordinary rate. Everything that we used to

04:57.100 --> 05:03.900
view as scarce, access to food, water, energy, healthcare, education, is blossoming. Now to

05:03.900 --> 05:10.060
be clear, we are living during a time that is chaotic and unpredictable and sometimes downright

05:10.060 --> 05:16.060
scary. I don't deny that at all. We humans like going to sleep and waking up in the morning,

05:16.060 --> 05:21.180
knowing that the world is the same as it was the night before. And it's not. It's changing at an

05:21.180 --> 05:27.980
accelerating rate. And we're not arguing that there are issues, there will be issues for sure.

05:28.540 --> 05:35.100
But even as it's changing at this accelerating rate, what is happening is those things that used

05:35.100 --> 05:43.260
to be scarce are becoming abundant. And so if we look at this, and I believe in what's called

05:43.260 --> 05:52.220
data-driven optimism, there is a huge amount of data that drives towards this vision that abundance

05:52.220 --> 05:59.660
is in fact the future. So first of all, global life expectancy has more than doubled over the last

05:59.660 --> 06:09.660
70 years, from roughly 40 years old to now hitting 75. Global child mortality has precipitously

06:09.660 --> 06:16.940
dropped from 43% in the 1800s down to under 4% today. Maternal mortality rates, women dying in

06:16.940 --> 06:26.220
pregnancy, over the last 20 years alone has dropped 34%. Cancer deaths have reduced by a third over the

06:26.220 --> 06:34.620
last 20 years. You may not believe this, but even democracy has blossomed over the last century. In

06:34.620 --> 06:45.740
1900, about 1% of countries had universal voting rights. Today, it's 96%. Extreme poverty has plummeted

06:46.780 --> 06:54.140
from 95% extreme poverty in the world down to under 10% today. Literacy rights have skyrocketed,

06:54.220 --> 07:00.620
mobile phone uses, we have some 8 billion mobile phones. The poorest on the planet now have

07:00.620 --> 07:06.940
most advanced technology for communications and access to knowledge. We have 5 billion internet

07:06.940 --> 07:15.260
connected individuals. Access to electricity has exploded. We have swatter safety. We have more

07:15.260 --> 07:22.860
access to food. And so the question is, why is this happening? Why are we seeing this incredible

07:22.860 --> 07:29.020
abundance in access that people have? And it's not that we humans have gotten smarter, we don't

07:29.020 --> 07:36.460
have better forms of government or better politicians. It is the technology. Technology is a

07:36.460 --> 07:43.740
scarcity, is a resource liberating force. It transforms scarcity into abundance over and over

07:43.740 --> 07:49.100
again, right? We used to go kill whales to get whale oil to light our nights. Then we ravaged

07:49.100 --> 07:54.540
mountain sides. Then we drilled kilometers under the ground to get access to oil. And now we have

07:54.540 --> 07:59.660
8,000 times more energy hitting the surface of the earth from the sun than we consume as a

07:59.660 --> 08:07.180
species in a year. Energy will become squanderable abundance, right? And that tips water and that

08:07.180 --> 08:16.540
tips health. And so all of these things are increasing abundance. I have zero question.

08:16.620 --> 08:23.180
Now, and by the way, anybody who wants access to this data, if you go to diamandis.com backslash

08:23.180 --> 08:30.700
data, I have 50 charts showing over the last decades and century this increasing access to

08:30.700 --> 08:36.780
abundance. So it's not about creating a world of luxury for everybody, but it's about creating a

08:36.780 --> 08:49.580
world of possibility for everybody. And you're muted, senior. Peter, absolutely perfect. Thank

08:49.580 --> 08:55.260
you so much. And now let's hear from Peter Z. You're answering no to the question, will the

08:55.260 --> 09:01.020
future be abundant? Tell us why. Peter D is absolutely correct. The world of the last 75,

09:01.020 --> 09:05.500
80 years has gotten better and better and better and better. But it's important to understand

09:05.500 --> 09:10.540
why we've been able to go down this technological path. We've had three things going on.

09:11.260 --> 09:16.460
First of all, we had globalization. At the end of World War II, the Americans found themselves

09:16.460 --> 09:22.940
facing off against Stalin on the plains of Europe. And it was a war we knew we could not win. We knew

09:22.940 --> 09:28.700
we needed tens of millions of people to stand not behind us or with us, but in front of us to serve

09:28.700 --> 09:34.380
as cannon fodder. And that meant bribing them. And our bribe was globalization. We used our

09:34.380 --> 09:39.660
navy to open the seas so that anyone could go anywhere and interface with any partner and access

09:39.660 --> 09:45.660
any commodity in any product and sell into any market. If in exchange, you would join us against

09:45.660 --> 09:51.500
the Soviets and it worked and it generated the greatest prosperity and security the world has

09:51.500 --> 09:58.060
ever seen. But the Cold War ended in 92. And ever since then, the United States in a series of ever

09:58.060 --> 10:03.900
more nationalist political contests has elected the guy who wants to do away with it faster.

10:04.380 --> 10:09.260
And the biggest difference between Trump and Biden when it comes to international economics

10:09.260 --> 10:15.420
is that Biden was able to hire a grammar checker. The road hasn't changed. And this is a very strongly

10:15.420 --> 10:22.220
bipartisan issue. And we're moving away from the generations of security and economic growth that

10:22.220 --> 10:26.860
gave us the ability to go down to this technological path. Then there's demographics.

10:28.220 --> 10:33.660
Pre-Stalin, we all lived on farms where kids were free labor. So you'd have as many of them as you

10:33.660 --> 10:39.260
could put up with plus one because that's how you found out it was too many. But then Stalin

10:39.260 --> 10:43.500
brought us globalization and industrialization and urbanization and all the new industrial

10:43.500 --> 10:49.340
jobs were in town. So we moved in to take them. Well, in town, kids aren't free labor. They're

10:49.340 --> 10:54.700
just a source of migraine. So you just fast forward 30 years to the 70s to the 90s. We entered

10:54.700 --> 10:59.660
this weird period where we had huge numbers of young workers and huge amounts of consumption

10:59.660 --> 11:04.620
because of it, but not a lot of kids that we had to spend money on. It was demographically

11:04.620 --> 11:09.500
speaking a moment in time. You fast forward another 20 years to the 2000s and the 2010s,

11:09.500 --> 11:14.940
and we now have lots of mature workers who are over 40 but not yet retired. People were at the

11:14.940 --> 11:20.060
height of their income, but their expenses were under control. So we saw a huge tax base, huge

11:20.060 --> 11:25.500
infrastructure spending, lots of production, lots of investment, which generated, among other things,

11:25.500 --> 11:31.340
the tech boom that brought us the world we're in now. But this too is only a moment in time.

11:32.140 --> 11:40.780
And in the 2020s, we're now aging out. Whether it's Spain or Italy or Germany or Japan or Korea

11:40.780 --> 11:46.540
or Taiwan or China or Thailand, this is the end of the road because that bulge now hits mass

11:46.540 --> 11:51.100
retirement. And we have to come up with something that works without investment or consumption or

11:51.100 --> 11:57.180
production. And we're not going to get that first right on our first try. And then finally, there's

11:57.180 --> 12:02.380
China. China is a country that exists because of globalization and demographic change. It's

12:02.380 --> 12:08.140
utterly dependent upon globalization for access to raw materials and access to markets. But it's

12:08.140 --> 12:13.900
also the fastest urbanizing country in history, which means it's the fastest aging population

12:13.900 --> 12:19.260
in history. And they've already aged so quickly and so far that consumption led growth or cost

12:19.260 --> 12:24.220
competitive production has already faded into memory. Their birth rate fell by more in the last

12:24.220 --> 12:29.660
six years than it did among European Jews during the Holocaust. So even repopulation is now

12:29.660 --> 12:35.180
statistically impossible. And China will cease to exist as a unified industrialized political

12:35.180 --> 12:41.980
economy within 10 years. Major shifts in economic models take at least a couple of decades, and

12:41.980 --> 12:48.380
they are messy. The shift from imperialism to globalization, for example, took the better

12:48.380 --> 12:54.780
part of five decades and gave us two world wars and the Great Depression. So no, abundance is not

12:54.780 --> 13:02.700
the word that I would use to describe the future. We've passed that already. We just heard opening

13:02.700 --> 13:09.820
statements from ex-prize founder Peter Diamandis and geopolitical strategist Peter Zahan. And I

13:09.820 --> 13:17.660
want to trans summarize those briefly. Peter D, you argued yes to the question of will the future

13:17.660 --> 13:27.180
be abundant. Your principal points were that exponential technology changes are making scarce

13:27.180 --> 13:34.700
things more abundant. Technology is moving scarcity into abundance at an incredible rate.

13:35.820 --> 13:41.260
You acknowledge the fact that we're living in a frightening time and that the world is changing

13:41.260 --> 13:50.780
at an accelerated rate. But you gave us some statistics that emphasize your optimism. You

13:50.780 --> 13:59.340
talked about the doubling of global life expectancy over 40 years, the lowering by a huge factor of

13:59.340 --> 14:06.220
child mortality and maternal mortality, the blossoming of democracy despite what it might feel like,

14:06.220 --> 14:11.980
the tumbling of extreme poverty and more. And you asked the question, why is this happening?

14:12.940 --> 14:20.700
And your answer was technology is a resource liberating force and that energy will be a

14:20.700 --> 14:31.340
squanderable abundance. Arguing no to the question was Peter Z. And Peter Z, you acknowledge the

14:31.340 --> 14:37.900
fact that the world has got better, but you thought it was important to understand why it had gotten

14:37.900 --> 14:43.340
better over the last century or so. And you said there were three reasons for that. The first was

14:43.340 --> 14:51.660
globalization. You described following the Second World War the fact that we had bribed the world

14:51.660 --> 15:00.060
through globalization and generated incredible security through that globalization. The second

15:00.060 --> 15:07.180
reason that you put for why things have gotten better are demographics. You described the pre-Stalin

15:07.180 --> 15:14.220
period when people lived in farms and subsequently moved to the towns. And there were huge numbers of

15:14.220 --> 15:20.140
resources in those people. You fasted forward through a couple of decades and a couple of decades

15:20.140 --> 15:29.180
and moments in time where there was abundance of people as in the last 20 years. But you talked about

15:29.180 --> 15:37.020
as we move into the 2020s, we're now aging out in your words. You've got a population bubble

15:37.020 --> 15:43.660
that is hitting mass retirement. We need to come up with a solution and we're not going to do that

15:43.660 --> 15:51.660
on our first try. And then the third reason you laid out was around China. The fastest urbanizing

15:51.660 --> 15:59.500
country in history that is now aging. You described China as a country that will cease to exist

15:59.500 --> 16:08.300
in it as a unified industrialized economy in the next decade. You talked about those three factors,

16:08.300 --> 16:13.660
globalization, demographics, and China being on a positive trajectory and now hitting a negative

16:13.660 --> 16:22.700
trajectory. And the major shifts in systems that we need to manage this

16:23.900 --> 16:31.180
never go smoothly and we're going to get it wrong. So that is why the future is not going to be abundant.

16:34.620 --> 16:41.820
So let me pick up and ask you both a few questions and pick up where you left off.

16:41.820 --> 16:47.980
The first question, and this is for both of you, abundant for whom? How do imbalances and

16:47.980 --> 16:53.660
inequities factor into your thinking? Does it matter where you sit? What nationality? What country?

16:53.660 --> 16:57.660
What ethnic or socio-economic group? And maybe I'll start with you, Peter D.

17:01.100 --> 17:06.940
It matters in the beginning, but it doesn't at the end. In the beginning, when the first mobile

17:06.940 --> 17:13.020
phones cost a million dollars in New York, Manhattan for the Wall Street, traders and they

17:13.020 --> 17:19.500
worked very poorly. That's the way it was. Towards the end, now there are $40 handsets and

17:19.500 --> 17:23.980
they're available to billions of people and they work incredibly well. And not only do they work

17:23.980 --> 17:32.140
incredibly well, on this handset which every child on the planet has access to comes the world's

17:32.140 --> 17:37.020
information, two-way video conferencing for free libraries of books, entertainment, knowledge,

17:37.020 --> 17:42.700
information that were neither available to the heads of nations 20 years ago are now available

17:42.700 --> 17:49.820
to the poorest. There are eight billion handsets on the planet. So what we see is technology is a

17:49.820 --> 17:57.820
democratizing and demonetizing force. And so, you know, things do begin when they work poorly.

17:57.820 --> 18:03.580
They're available to the richest who take the risk and eventually they rapidly demonetize and

18:03.580 --> 18:10.220
democratize and are accessible to everyone. We're seeing this on communications. We're seeing this

18:10.220 --> 18:15.900
on energy. We're seeing this even in artificial intelligence, right? All the AI systems that

18:15.900 --> 18:20.860
we're seeing coming out of Google and different parts of the world are available for free to

18:20.860 --> 18:30.620
anyone with a handset. Again, amazing. And so, I believe that this is a force and it's a non-stoppable

18:30.620 --> 18:36.060
force and it is what is causing increasing abundance. Whether or not it's used for negative

18:36.060 --> 18:40.540
purposes or positive purposes is a different issue. The question we're asking here is it

18:40.540 --> 18:44.380
will it be abundant? And yes, these things are abundant across the board.

18:44.380 --> 18:53.260
Bundled across the board. A lot of people have described technologies like AI as things that

18:53.260 --> 19:00.700
increase inequality. So I just want to quickly, quick follow up with you, Peter. What's your

19:00.700 --> 19:05.420
argument to people who say that actually these technologies are increasing inequality rather

19:05.420 --> 19:11.980
than decreasing? And then I'll come to you, Peter. Peter Z. Again, my comment is in the beginning

19:11.980 --> 19:18.940
they're accessible to a smaller group, but we've seen over and over again these technologies become

19:19.500 --> 19:25.500
demonetized and democratized. I talk about the six D's of exponential. When you digitize anything,

19:25.500 --> 19:30.940
in the early days of its growth, it's deceptive. 30 doublings later, it's a billion fold bigger

19:30.940 --> 19:35.820
and it's disruptive. And it's dematerializing, demonetizing, and democratizing. We've seen

19:35.820 --> 19:43.660
this over and over again across every technology. AI is going to be ultimately the best educating

19:43.660 --> 19:49.180
system, the best healthcare system will be available to the poorest child and the wealthiest child

19:49.180 --> 19:56.460
delivered by AI platforms. Okay, thank you. Peter Z. The question abundant for whom?

19:59.180 --> 20:04.860
Geographic factors and demographic factors are not the same everywhere. Some countries are aging

20:04.860 --> 20:10.140
faster than others. Others have better borders and better economic geography. And as a rule, gross

20:10.140 --> 20:16.060
oversimplification, the Western Hemisphere looks pretty good. They, in many cases, industrialized

20:16.060 --> 20:21.260
on a slower rate or from a later start. So their birth rates haven't fallen nearly as much. And what

20:21.260 --> 20:26.620
I outlined in my opener is less true for them with the United States being one of the youngest

20:26.620 --> 20:31.580
demographies in the world as well as Mexico. So we have a transition period here that's going to be

20:31.580 --> 20:35.500
a half a century as opposed to what they're going to have to do in Europe, which is going to be in

20:35.500 --> 20:40.140
less than a decade. That buys us a lot of time to figure out the details. It also means that we

20:40.140 --> 20:45.500
have the ability of expanding our supply chains to make up for those that fall. But when it comes to

20:45.500 --> 20:53.580
technology at its core, the demographic structure is everything. Developing new technologies requires

20:53.580 --> 20:58.300
a huge number of people in their 20s and their 30s who are social, who are integrated, who can work

20:58.300 --> 21:04.460
as a team and can imagine the future and then figure out how to operationalize it and then figure

21:04.460 --> 21:09.980
out how to mass manufacture it. The problem with this process is that every step up until mass

21:09.980 --> 21:16.460
manufactured generates no income. And that means you have to have a huge amount of capital to push

21:16.460 --> 21:23.100
this whole process forward. Now in the 2000s and the 2010s, we had exactly that world. We had the

21:23.100 --> 21:28.860
millennials, which were many, and we had the boomers who were nearing retirement but had not yet

21:28.860 --> 21:33.500
retired. So they had their life accumulation of savings, which pushed down capital costs for

21:33.500 --> 21:38.380
everybody. That's one of the reasons why growth these last 25 years has been so robust. Lots of

21:38.380 --> 21:44.620
young smart people, lots of money for them to do things with. Well, that's over. As of December

21:44.620 --> 21:48.700
of last year, half of the world's baby boomers had already retired and they'd liquidated their

21:48.700 --> 21:52.940
savings. And so we've seen capital costs triple. They're going to triple again in the next few

21:52.940 --> 21:58.620
years. And the oldest baby boomer, sorry millennial, I'm sorry, the oldest millennial, sorry millennials,

21:59.580 --> 22:05.580
turns 45 next year. They're no longer the young bucks and the next generation down is small and

22:05.580 --> 22:10.940
to be perfectly blunt kind of antisocial. So the environment that has allowed us to push the

22:10.940 --> 22:16.460
technological envelopes so far, so fast, so consistently, it's already behind us. And we're

22:16.460 --> 22:21.020
already seeing those adjustments throughout the tech space with layoffs, with shutdowns,

22:21.020 --> 22:26.460
with focusing more on manufacturing now, rather than idea generation, because we're realizing

22:26.460 --> 22:34.220
we're losing China at the same time. So the risk here isn't that we're not going to push the envelope

22:34.220 --> 22:38.140
forward. I'd say that's almost impossible. The risk here is we're going to lose too much of where

22:38.140 --> 22:43.100
we have and we backslide a little bit. And we're going to find out the answer to that question

22:43.100 --> 22:48.860
in just the next five years about whether or not we can retool fast enough. North America

22:48.860 --> 22:52.940
basically needs to double the size of the industrial plant. And if we fail that,

22:53.820 --> 23:00.300
then we lose a lot of what we already have. I can see that Peter Dee disagrees. So Peter

23:00.300 --> 23:06.780
Dee, back to you. I vehemently disagree. Yeah, so this is so wrong in my opinion.

23:07.740 --> 23:15.180
What's happening is we have more individuals, more empowered with technology than ever before.

23:15.180 --> 23:20.780
We have created an interconnected globe where people have gigabit bandwidth anywhere on the

23:20.780 --> 23:27.340
planet. They now have the ability to use AI to code at a speed like never before. The cost is

23:27.340 --> 23:33.340
demonetizing of the ability to innovate and create, right? It used to be that it would cost you

23:33.420 --> 23:39.980
$100 million to sequence a genome. It's now down to 200 bucks. Your ability to code used to

23:39.980 --> 23:47.420
require a massive amount of education. Now you can code just by explaining through natural language

23:47.420 --> 23:53.580
what you want. So the speed of innovation is exploding onto the scene. And the number of

23:53.580 --> 23:59.420
individuals who've got access to this technology is greater than any time ever in human history.

23:59.420 --> 24:06.060
And entrepreneurs that used to require 50 or 100 or 200 people to create a company

24:06.060 --> 24:11.260
are now creating a company that's delivering a valuable asset or resource with two or three

24:11.260 --> 24:18.460
people. So I think we're seeing a Cambrian explosion of innovation by no means a decrease,

24:18.460 --> 24:26.140
and it's going to be accelerating. I'm going to move us on. What I took away from this little bit

24:26.140 --> 24:33.820
was Peter Z. You're saying that the world is aging, and so the ratios are changing. And Peter D,

24:33.820 --> 24:38.460
you're saying, yeah, but all of those people who weren't part of the system and weren't productive

24:38.460 --> 24:46.700
are now part of all $8.1 billion, $8.2 billion are enabled productive. Okay, enabled. I like it,

24:46.700 --> 24:50.540
caveat. Let me ask you another question. Again, maybe I'll start with Peter Z this time.

24:51.340 --> 25:00.940
Tell me in 30 seconds what you think the future looks like in, say, 2050, and maybe take an American,

25:00.940 --> 25:06.460
a standard American, what do you think life looks like? And then I'm going to come to you, Peter Z,

25:06.460 --> 25:13.900
for your view as well. I think we're going to make it over the hump. I think we're going to succeed in

25:13.900 --> 25:17.420
doubling the size of the industrial plant. And I think we're going to make it through to when the

25:17.420 --> 25:21.900
millennials' kids enter the market and rebalance our demographics here. I don't think it's going

25:21.900 --> 25:26.860
to take till 2050. I think 2040 will be plenty of time. And we will have a system where we are

25:26.860 --> 25:31.180
largely immune to international shocks, and we have local workers serving local markets using

25:31.180 --> 25:36.220
local resources. And getting there is going to be the fastest economic growth in the history of

25:36.220 --> 25:40.860
Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It's not a good story. It's a great story. It's a story of

25:40.860 --> 25:46.460
growth. But I wouldn't call it abundant. It will be driven by a breakdown of the old system.

25:48.220 --> 25:55.500
Okay. So Peter Z, 2050 looks good. It's much more localized, but it's an ugly way to get there.

25:55.500 --> 26:04.060
Peter D. So I'm going to agree with Peter Z and a lot of that. And I do think 2040,

26:04.060 --> 26:09.100
it's hard to predict beyond 2040, honestly. We're going to be in the next 20 years,

26:09.100 --> 26:13.740
we're going to be adding healthy decades on to the human lifespan. And that's one of areas that

26:13.740 --> 26:20.540
I'm focused on, fingers crossed, and about to launch a massive XPRIZE in that area. But we're

26:20.540 --> 26:26.540
going to add 20 healthy years. The study done out of Harvard London School of Business in Oxford

26:26.540 --> 26:34.140
said that for every healthy year you add to the lifespan of humanity, it's worth $38 trillion

26:34.140 --> 26:41.660
to the global economy. So we have more people living longer, healthier lives. It's positive on

26:41.660 --> 26:47.260
both sides of the equation, more empowered than ever before. We're going to see AI have the most

26:47.260 --> 26:52.460
disruptive and most reinventive impact. There are going to be two kinds of companies at the

26:52.460 --> 26:57.420
end of this decade, those fully utilizing AI and those out of business. It's going to be that black

26:57.420 --> 27:05.100
and white. And so we're going to see AI as the closest analogy for me is Jarvis from Ironman,

27:05.980 --> 27:11.340
where it's your partner, it's your co-pilot, it's your inspiration, it's your collaborator.

27:11.660 --> 27:18.300
Across everything, allowing you to fulfill your dreams, giving you access to not information

27:18.300 --> 27:24.460
but knowledge. I'm going to come back to productivity towards the end of this time,

27:24.460 --> 27:29.340
but I want to move on to climate. And Peter Dee, I want to turn to you first and say,

27:30.780 --> 27:36.860
aren't we using up the Earth's resources? Will there ever be a tipping point at which we can't

27:36.860 --> 27:43.740
multiply them or become sufficiently efficient or productive to deliver more with less? Is science

27:43.740 --> 27:57.420
going to allow this? This idea that we are scarcity-bound, again, is built into our old brain

27:57.420 --> 28:03.420
that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years. We're living, again, in a world where technology

28:03.420 --> 28:09.180
liberates resources. So again, we used to kill whales to get whale oil. Now we're on the verge

28:09.180 --> 28:15.580
of fusion, which will give us near infinite energy. We still have an oil economy and we will for the

28:15.580 --> 28:20.300
next 20 or 30 years. There's no issue about that, but we're going to be increasing the amount of

28:20.300 --> 28:27.500
resources available to us. We're about to launch a very large XPRIZE for large-scale desalination.

28:28.060 --> 28:35.340
We fight over water. 97.5% of the water on the planet is salt, 2% is ice, and we fight over

28:35.340 --> 28:41.100
a half a percent of the water on this planet. But there's an abundance-minded way of thinking about

28:41.100 --> 28:45.340
it. There's plenty of water. We live on a water planet. It's just not a usable form. That's where

28:45.340 --> 28:51.900
technology comes in to capture trillions of tons of water out of the atmosphere. We call it rain

28:52.620 --> 28:59.900
or desalinate water out of the oceans. What other resources do we consider scarce? Because

28:59.900 --> 29:06.300
I can show you the technologies that can make it abundant. I'll just say for climate real quick,

29:07.100 --> 29:14.220
our ability to bring the earth back into balance is something fundamentally critical,

29:14.220 --> 29:20.140
and I think I would rather be fighting that battle today with the tech we have versus 20 or 30 years

29:20.220 --> 29:27.660
ago. Peter Z, do you want to come back on that? By the way, you don't need my permission to push

29:27.660 --> 29:32.940
back on one another, but I have a feeling, Peter Z, there might be something you want to answer to

29:32.940 --> 29:37.500
that one. Well, you know, me and Peter D were both such shrinking violets. Thank you for unleashing.

29:37.500 --> 29:42.940
I noticed that, really. You're very well behaved, both of you. Go ahead, Peter Z.

29:43.740 --> 29:47.900
Sure. Climate change is definitely a big issue. Anyone who thinks they can predict it on a zip

29:47.900 --> 29:52.540
code by zip code basis, I think is a little crazy because our math just isn't that good yet.

29:52.540 --> 29:58.460
My concern isn't, on this topic, isn't so much that we don't have the tools. It's that we don't

29:58.460 --> 30:03.260
have the tools, yeah, to deal with it yet. I think a best example I can give you is what it takes to

30:03.260 --> 30:09.260
put up a solar panel. Aluminum is the most energy intensive of the primary industries that we have,

30:09.260 --> 30:15.820
if you look at steel and fertilizer and the rest. Taking raw silicon and turning it into a finished

30:15.820 --> 30:22.780
silicon panel requires seven times the energy that it takes to make the same volume of aluminum.

30:23.820 --> 30:28.460
We're probably going to lose most of our capacity to produce polysilicon at scale

30:28.460 --> 30:35.820
when the Chinese break down. The issue here is ultimately out of timeframes. How long does it

30:35.820 --> 30:41.020
take to build the industrial plant? How long does it take to apply the technology? The issue that

30:41.020 --> 30:46.540
Peter D and I have always struggled with is whether or not we've already passed the point of no

30:46.540 --> 30:51.100
return on these technologies and we no longer need the old system to push it forward, or whether we

30:51.100 --> 30:56.940
do need time to move it forward. I think the best example I can give you there of where we haven't

30:56.940 --> 31:03.900
crossed the Rubicon yet is AI. AI chips are all three nanometer or smaller. They all come from the

31:03.900 --> 31:09.580
same city in Taiwan, but that makes it sound a lot simpler than it is. There are 9,000 companies

31:09.580 --> 31:14.540
that are involved in the manufacturing system to allow those fabrication plants to work,

31:14.540 --> 31:19.180
and over half of them only produce one product for one customer and they have no competition

31:19.180 --> 31:23.980
anywhere else in the world. So if you peel out any small section of the global system that's

31:23.980 --> 31:29.420
technologically oriented, like say Germany, which is any severe demographic collapse right now,

31:30.300 --> 31:37.100
we lose the ability to make those chips at all, or certainly at scale. Now we can rebuild that

31:37.100 --> 31:43.820
ecosystem, but it takes time. So everything that Peter D said about productivity, I agree. The question

31:43.820 --> 31:51.580
is whether that's this decade, the next decade, or the decade after. Okay, I'm going to go back.

31:51.580 --> 31:57.420
We've got so much to cover in so little time, so I'm going to ask for quite snappy responses if I

31:57.420 --> 32:04.860
can get from you. I want to come back to you, Peter D. I love it. I'm coming back. I want to go back

32:04.860 --> 32:11.820
to you, Peter D. There's a war in Ukraine. We've got a growing conflict in the Middle East.

32:12.940 --> 32:18.620
Peter Z has already bought up China and his view that China is my language, not yours, Peter Z,

32:18.620 --> 32:25.100
but effectively in decline and over the next decade. We have a vulnerable Taiwan. I haven't

32:25.100 --> 32:34.060
even talked about Iran and Russia. Are we on the verge of a great powers war? And does that, how does

32:34.860 --> 32:43.900
this conflict affect your assessment? There's no question that there's lots of reasons to be

32:43.900 --> 32:53.020
scared, concerned, frightful, and so forth. What I draw confidence from is history as well as a

32:53.020 --> 32:59.580
projected future. You know, if you ask anybody, you know, would you rather live in the year 1900

32:59.580 --> 33:05.420
or the year 2023? If you truly understood what life was like in 1900, where you were working

33:05.420 --> 33:11.100
80-hour work weeks, your 12-year-old kids were in the factories, you were dead by 40 from tuberculosis,

33:11.900 --> 33:18.700
you'd have to answer, I'd rather live today. And so the world has gotten extraordinarily better

33:18.700 --> 33:23.980
by almost every measure, not every measure, but by almost every measure over the last 123 years.

33:24.860 --> 33:29.820
And over that 123 years, we've also seen World War I, World War II, the Spanish

33:29.820 --> 33:37.340
Flu, the Vietnam War, 150 million people died needlessly in those conflicts, and yet the world

33:37.340 --> 33:45.820
has gotten extraordinarily better. This is not a straight and linear path. It has got ups and

33:45.820 --> 33:50.940
downs, ups and downs, but what I truly believe is, yes, we're going to have these problems,

33:50.940 --> 33:57.180
and we're going to overcome them. And the number one way to allow people to become more peaceful

33:58.380 --> 34:05.660
is to give them access to prosperity. And technology does that. If you have access to all

34:05.660 --> 34:09.420
of, you know, if your kids have access to the food, water, energy, health, care, education,

34:11.420 --> 34:14.540
they're not going to want to go kill themselves and put on a suicide vest.

34:15.100 --> 34:23.420
You've just silenced me for one moment. Thank you for that image.

34:24.620 --> 34:29.980
Peter Z, I'm going to come back to you for one final quick question before I get back

34:29.980 --> 34:35.100
to this issue of time that we keep coming up with. And I want to talk to you about population,

34:35.100 --> 34:42.220
because that's one of the big issues that you've put on the table. Thomas Malthus back in 1798

34:42.300 --> 34:45.420
predicted the population growth would outstrip food production.

34:46.700 --> 34:50.620
Since then, numerous other scientists and experts have said similarly,

34:51.580 --> 34:57.740
including most notably Paul Ehrlich and his wife in the population bomb in the late 60s.

34:57.740 --> 35:01.900
They've all been wrong. Why is this moment different?

35:03.260 --> 35:07.900
Industrialization. Industrialization plus technology introduced us to this very

35:07.900 --> 35:12.140
simple concept called synthetic fertilizer. And it was applied at scale. And we were able to

35:12.140 --> 35:17.500
put it on geographies that without it could not grow food, things like the Brazilian Serato,

35:17.500 --> 35:23.500
for example. And that effectively increased the amount of land that we could cultivate by a factor

35:23.500 --> 35:30.700
of three. And that's what's kept us all alive. As long as there is no disruption to the synthetic

35:30.700 --> 35:36.460
fertilizer supply chain, we're good. China is where the single largest source of phosphate

35:36.460 --> 35:41.900
comes from Belarus and Russia. The single largest source of potash and nitrogen is a natural gas

35:41.900 --> 35:45.340
derivative. And we're going to lose access to a lot of that from the Russian space in the Middle

35:45.340 --> 35:52.940
East as well. So we're going to have to hack the genome of plants in order to grow more food with

35:52.940 --> 35:59.020
less fertilizer. And it is a race against time, whether we can figure out a way to improve yields

35:59.020 --> 36:05.580
on the genetic side faster than we lose the ability to produce it on the synthetic fertilizer side.

36:05.660 --> 36:10.300
And I do not have enough confidence to tell you how we're going to come down on that race.

36:12.460 --> 36:17.660
So time is a big issue here, not just because our clock is ticking. So I'm going to come back to

36:17.660 --> 36:22.220
you both with one last question that's on time. We've talked a lot about time as a macro sense,

36:22.220 --> 36:29.900
but I want to talk about time in a micro sense. Peter Dee, in your 2012 book, Abundance, you

36:29.900 --> 36:37.420
quote Matt Ridley that, and I love this, save time is the best definition of prosperity.

36:38.620 --> 36:42.780
You give a whole host of examples of how time has been saved. You've done that today as well.

36:43.580 --> 36:48.300
But many would argue today that time is an increasingly rare commodity. Expectations of

36:48.300 --> 36:55.580
what we achieve in any moment has multiplied many times over. So I'd love to get from both of you

36:55.580 --> 37:01.980
what do you say to this argument about time and prosperity? And you both have about 25 seconds

37:01.980 --> 37:12.460
to do it. So maybe Peter Z, start with you. So save time is the best definition of prosperity.

37:12.460 --> 37:18.300
So for you, Peter Z, what do you say to the argument that actually time is shrinking, in fact?

37:20.060 --> 37:24.380
Electrification. Electrification allowed us to push back the night that gave us the

37:24.380 --> 37:28.060
woman's rights movement, because all of a sudden women could have time to do things that were not

37:28.060 --> 37:35.660
related to the household. Holding those advantages is our single biggest challenge. If we lose China,

37:35.660 --> 37:41.500
if we lose the capital that comes from a positive demographic structure, our ability to hold the

37:41.500 --> 37:49.020
line on industrialization itself is at risk. And electrification requires globalization,

37:49.020 --> 37:54.860
and we could see a significant regression in the next 15 years as we lose the ability to do that

37:54.860 --> 38:00.620
at scale on a planet-wide basis. And an asteroid could strike us and we'd all be dead. But the

38:00.620 --> 38:06.300
fact of the matter is, you know, every human on the planet has one thing in common, 24 hours in

38:06.300 --> 38:11.100
a day, seven days in a week, and how you use that time that differentiates wealth and capabilities.

38:11.100 --> 38:16.780
And, you know, Google saved us from going to the libraries. ChatGPT is now giving us increased,

38:16.780 --> 38:22.460
you know, so yes, we are resetting our expected performance per unit time,

38:23.260 --> 38:28.620
and it's exploding onto the world, right? And so our ability to solve problems, to create new

38:28.620 --> 38:36.700
products, to create additional prosperity is increasing at an exponential rate because of

38:36.700 --> 38:41.740
these technologies. And these technologies enable us to solve the problems, you know, whether it's

38:41.740 --> 38:49.180
labor from robots or AI, you know, I would rather bet on today than any time in human history.

38:49.900 --> 38:53.900
We're going to bring some other voices in, some members of the audience.

38:53.900 --> 38:59.500
Up first, we have Alexa Mikhail of Fortune Magazine. Alexa, welcome. What's your question for the

38:59.500 --> 39:07.820
debaters? Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, so, Peter D, I'll start with you. You know,

39:07.900 --> 39:15.180
you mentioned that in advances in technology and research has really expanded, you know,

39:15.180 --> 39:20.700
not just health, not just lifespan, but health span, and we're going to have these 20 extra years.

39:20.700 --> 39:24.620
So I kind of want to talk about what those years are really going to look like and what it's going

39:24.620 --> 39:31.100
to sort of mean to age, to age in this country, given that, you know, this is sort of uncharted

39:31.100 --> 39:36.780
territory, especially that I think people would argue that, you know, people are also, you know,

39:36.860 --> 39:42.540
aging into poverty. People are dealing with caregiving duties. And so what's that going to

39:42.540 --> 39:48.300
look like? Yeah, it's a challenge, Alexa, because people are probably not saving enough money for

39:48.300 --> 39:55.260
those extra years. You know, the reality is people retire because of one of three reasons,

39:55.260 --> 40:04.460
either they're in pain, they're either low on energy or they're forced to retire. But what happens

40:04.460 --> 40:10.140
at 65 or 70, if at the top of your game, we've got all the energy, all the capabilities, everything

40:10.140 --> 40:18.700
you've ever had and more, I think it's going to be a boom for global GDP if we allow people to

40:18.700 --> 40:23.980
continue working. I think we're going to enter a new period of life where you're starting your next

40:23.980 --> 40:29.340
startup, you're getting your next university degree, you're exploring the world even more.

40:29.340 --> 40:37.660
You know, we shut down people's earning capacity at 65. Why? What if they don't have to? I think

40:37.660 --> 40:45.660
it's a huge economic window of opportunity that is coming. We obviously need to change the, oh, sorry.

40:46.540 --> 40:50.540
I was going to say, Alexa, do you have a, go ahead, Peter, but I think Alexa also had a

40:50.540 --> 40:54.220
separate question for you. But Peter, if you want to respond quickly, go ahead.

40:55.260 --> 40:58.060
I was just going to say, we obviously have to change the political incentives right now and

40:58.060 --> 41:02.780
that requires reform of a lot of programs that encourage people to stop even before 65. And

41:02.780 --> 41:07.180
from a medical point of view, the technology to watch is biologics, because if we can figure out

41:07.180 --> 41:13.580
a way to make people productive without the mental degradation, that obviously moves the metrics on

41:13.580 --> 41:21.340
a lot of this. Alex, you had a question for Peter Z, too. Yeah, thank you. I mean, I think you touched

41:21.340 --> 41:25.660
on it a little bit, but given, you know, that you talked about mass retirement and people also

41:25.660 --> 41:30.940
involuntary retirement as well, and just thinking about, in your mind, kind of similar to what I

41:30.940 --> 41:35.660
asked for your D, sort of, what do you hope to envision about this, as we're going to be living

41:35.660 --> 41:40.780
longer? I think of all the technologies that are on the table that are about to be manifested,

41:40.780 --> 41:46.060
you know, which is, I'm stepping into Peter D's world here a little bit. Keeping mental

41:46.060 --> 41:52.540
acuity firm throughout your 60s and 70s is the single most important one, because if you can

41:52.540 --> 41:58.780
do that, we get an extra group of people, roughly 70 million in the United States, who can be part

41:58.780 --> 42:03.260
of whatever the future solution and struggles are, as opposed to being part of the problem.

42:03.980 --> 42:07.340
And that is one of the very few technologies that I'm, like, watching very, very closely,

42:07.340 --> 42:10.780
because it looks like it's right at the cusp, and we might be able to tip that

42:10.780 --> 42:14.700
into usefulness within the next 24 months. And that's very good. Pushing hard. Pushing hard. Yeah.

42:14.700 --> 42:20.780
Please, please, please continue. Thank you. I'm hearing some positivity here. Thanks so much,

42:21.020 --> 42:27.660
Alexa. Next, I want to invite Diane Francis to our stage. Diane is from the National Post.

42:27.660 --> 42:32.940
Diane, what question do you have for the debaters? Well, I think this is a marvelous

42:32.940 --> 42:41.260
said debate. I really enjoyed it. Am I on mute? We can hear you. Go right ahead. Great. Great

42:41.260 --> 42:49.580
debate. Here's my question. Human nature. Malevolent usage, lack of regulation, anti-regulation,

42:50.540 --> 42:55.900
ignorance, and, and algorithms in the form of very dangerous religions and theologies.

42:56.460 --> 43:03.500
What, you know, tech can't solve that, in fact, could be, and is being utilized to a bigger,

43:03.500 --> 43:11.100
worse extent than before. I'd like you to comment on that as well. I'll jump in. And you're absolutely

43:11.100 --> 43:16.300
right. There's no question that we're going to see malevolent use of AI. And it's my biggest

43:16.300 --> 43:21.580
concern over the next one to five years. I think we're going to see the election be patient zero

43:22.220 --> 43:30.620
in this situation. I think on the flip side, what's going on is what I would call loss of privacy

43:31.180 --> 43:37.660
is going to be a countervailing force. It's hard to hide things more than ever before. So our,

43:37.660 --> 43:43.180
you know, it's going to be a white hat, black hat race in terms of AI being used to help determine

43:43.820 --> 43:51.260
malevolent AI's usage. And one question to ask everybody listening is, do you believe that

43:51.260 --> 43:58.380
human nature is ultimately good or bad? I believe it is ultimately good. And I believe that an

43:58.380 --> 44:03.260
entrepreneur, and this is my mission is to inspire and guide entrepreneurs to create a hopeful,

44:03.260 --> 44:07.900
compelling, and abundant future for humanity. That's my massive transformative purpose. I say it

44:07.900 --> 44:13.580
every morning. It drives all of my organizations and my companies. Entrepreneurs are individuals

44:13.580 --> 44:20.060
who find problems and fix problems. And so, you know, the world's largest problems are the world's

44:20.060 --> 44:25.580
biggest business opportunities. So when you see a problem, it's an entrepreneurial opportunity.

44:25.580 --> 44:30.300
And I think we have more positive mind than entrepreneurs trying to find and slay and solve

44:30.300 --> 44:39.820
problems than any time ever in human history. Peter Z, I think that question was also framed

44:39.820 --> 44:44.380
at you, wasn't it, Diane? Absolutely. Sure. Let me give you the bad and then the good. First

44:44.380 --> 44:48.860
the bad. We've got two major powers, the Russians and the Chinese, who are going to vanish from the

44:48.860 --> 44:53.020
world over the course of the next generation or two. The question is whether it happens fast or

44:53.020 --> 44:56.940
slow. And when countries feel they're in a corner and they have nothing to lose, the chances of

44:56.940 --> 45:01.820
them doing something that they normally wouldn't consider, of course, rises very high. But let

45:01.820 --> 45:07.580
me give you two examples of why I don't think that their decline is going to be catastrophic

45:07.580 --> 45:13.900
for the rest of us. In the case of China, they don't command the top technology. They import

45:13.900 --> 45:19.420
all the server time, they import all the chips that are necessary for them to access AI at scale.

45:19.420 --> 45:23.660
And we're already in the early stages of the Biden administration and whoever follows Biden,

45:23.660 --> 45:28.620
probably working to build a wall in that space. That limits the damage that can be done from a

45:28.620 --> 45:36.780
strategic point of view. The Russians, back in 1987, when the KGB realized that the end was

45:36.780 --> 45:41.900
nigh, and remember back in the late 80s, the KGB controlled the Politburo. They basically

45:41.900 --> 45:45.500
had a meeting where they decided whether or not they wanted to spread nuclear weapons around

45:45.500 --> 45:50.300
the world and salt the earth to destroy whatever the West might do next. And they decided the

45:50.380 --> 45:59.580
answer was no. Even in the darkest hour for a lot of these countries, the desire to end the human

45:59.580 --> 46:05.260
condition just doesn't exist. That doesn't mean they die quietly. That doesn't mean there aren't

46:05.260 --> 46:12.540
problems. And we are still cleaning up the mess from the Soviet disintegration. But it does mean

46:12.540 --> 46:20.860
there are limits. I am far more concerned about powerful individuals that maybe don't have restrictions

46:20.860 --> 46:24.860
on their actions than I am about powerful countries that are getting desperate. And that's a different

46:24.860 --> 46:31.740
sort of problem. Peter D, I think you've just come up with a great suggestion of another debate,

46:31.740 --> 46:36.300
which is are people inherently good or bad? And if open to debate haven't done it yet,

46:37.180 --> 46:41.100
we'll make sure they do. Great question, Diane. Do you have a follow-up?

46:42.300 --> 46:48.700
No, I think that the organizational aptitude of human beings, unless it's taken over by tech,

46:48.700 --> 46:54.700
and then I want to know who controls that fact, has been a constant historical disappointment.

46:54.700 --> 47:02.140
Not just politically, but in terms of parenting, in terms of financial moving forward. This is a

47:02.140 --> 47:08.620
huge issue. And putting the hands of powerful, increasingly powerful tech into people that

47:08.620 --> 47:14.540
may not be good is something that I don't see talked enough about. There was a warning letter

47:14.540 --> 47:20.460
about the AI chatbot. Nothing is moving. And any jurisdictions as to how to try and look at

47:20.460 --> 47:26.220
what problems they've raised. So I just wondered, how optimistic are you, Peter? Because you're

47:26.220 --> 47:39.340
my optimist. I am clear that these are really serious issues. I was just on stage in Saudi

47:39.340 --> 47:47.900
and Riyadh at FII, heading their AI resolutions. And I think ultimately, artificial intelligence

47:47.900 --> 47:55.260
has the ability to deliver extraordinary abundance for humanity. But talking about time frames,

47:55.340 --> 48:00.940
as Peter Z said, this is the 10-year out time frame. There are going to be challenges and

48:00.940 --> 48:06.300
issues in the near term. It's the one to five-year period that I'm concerned about navigating that

48:07.100 --> 48:15.340
and allowing humanity to adjust to it. It is transformative change. And I think we humans

48:15.340 --> 48:19.820
do not like change. We like waking up in the morning and knowing that the world was the same

48:19.820 --> 48:24.300
as it was when we went to sleep, no matter what condition we're in. And we are in an accelerating

48:24.300 --> 48:28.780
period of change. And it is creating more abundance, which is the topic here.

48:30.060 --> 48:36.940
I think you can be a little bit more optimistic, Ms. Francis. We have a little bit more time than

48:36.940 --> 48:40.860
I think most people think. If we have a problem with the chip production, which I think we're

48:40.860 --> 48:44.300
going to, that buys us a few more years right there. And the fact that we're already having

48:44.300 --> 48:47.980
these discussions, I mean, think about everything that is going on in the American Congress right

48:47.980 --> 48:53.980
now. What a mess it is. They still found a time over the last several weeks to have an open session

48:53.980 --> 48:59.820
about the ethics of artificial intelligence. So unlike previous technological revolutions,

48:59.820 --> 49:05.180
where we come very late to the game, we're discussing this one as it unfolds. It doesn't

49:05.180 --> 49:08.780
mean we're going to get it right on the first try, but we're at least not going into it blind.

49:11.180 --> 49:17.580
So what I love about where this conversation is going is I almost hear like the two of you have

49:18.220 --> 49:24.380
flipped a little bit your views. But let's bring on. Thank you so much, Diane, for your questions.

49:24.380 --> 49:30.700
Let's bring on Andy Wang to the stage. Andy is the host of the podcast called Inspired Money.

49:30.700 --> 49:38.620
Andy, welcome. Go ahead with your question. Thank you, Zanya. From an investor's perspective,

49:38.620 --> 49:43.660
there are always growth opportunities. And at the same time, other areas that are contracting,

49:43.740 --> 49:50.380
I'd like to hear from both Peter D. and Peter Z. Given your respective outlooks, what areas might

49:50.380 --> 49:55.900
be beneficiaries of major trends over the next couple of decades? Are there companies, sectors,

49:55.900 --> 50:00.060
or geographic regions where investors should look for opportunities?

50:04.060 --> 50:12.780
Why don't I do Peter? Okay. So Andy, I'm investing my money, my venture fund money,

50:12.780 --> 50:21.420
my time in two areas. Healthspan, healthcare, biotech. I think people would give an extraordinary

50:21.420 --> 50:27.820
amount of their wealth to add 20 plus healthy years. And AI, I think those are the two largest

50:27.820 --> 50:33.740
markets on the planet. And they're going to transform every single thing that we have and we do.

50:35.260 --> 50:41.340
What's on the downside? Any company that is not an exponential organization that is born

50:43.500 --> 50:48.060
more than 30 years ago are going to be outcompeted, outthought, and actually

50:48.060 --> 50:50.140
massively disrupted what's coming down the pipe?

50:53.100 --> 50:57.100
I think we need to focus on the scarcity in order to have the opportunity to turn it into

50:57.100 --> 51:03.100
abundance. So number one, we need to diversify the semiconductor supply chain for the best chips.

51:03.100 --> 51:09.020
Right now, we are incredibly fragile in that and anything breaks anywhere and the whole thing stops.

51:09.020 --> 51:13.260
Building that will take years, but it's certainly within our technical capacity to do it and the

51:13.260 --> 51:20.220
benefits I agree with Peter D are so outsized. It's totally worth our time. Second, if agriculture

51:20.220 --> 51:25.500
goes the way I'm fearing, we need a drastic increase in production. The two ways to do that,

51:25.500 --> 51:31.180
ironically, are both related to AI. One is automating farming to a degree so that each individual

51:31.180 --> 51:36.380
plant gets individual attention. That requires AI and the tractor in order to put pesticides,

51:36.380 --> 51:40.060
fertilizers, water, whatever it happens to be on a plant-by-plant basis. I call it digital

51:40.060 --> 51:46.300
gardening. And the other aspect is hacking the genome of absolutely everything. We've been

51:46.300 --> 51:52.140
moving in that direction for 30 years. 10 years ago, corn plants were 13 feet tall. Now they're

51:52.140 --> 51:58.460
closer to five, but they generate three times as many kernels as the old system did. We need more

51:58.460 --> 52:04.140
of that because if we can't provide broadcast agriculture for a place like Brazil, then places

52:04.140 --> 52:10.540
like Illinois need at least double input to prevent a billion people from starving. This can

52:10.540 --> 52:17.580
probably all be done in less than a decade, but chop chop. I agree 100% with you, Peter. It is,

52:17.580 --> 52:24.300
we're seeing incredible, we're seeing a new species of rice that are able to have multiple

52:25.980 --> 52:32.540
crops per planting. And for those who are concerned about GMO, listen, GMO has never killed anybody,

52:32.540 --> 52:37.100
but I can guarantee you it's saved hundreds of millions of lives. I'm less interested in rice

52:37.820 --> 52:41.260
soy, I think is the one that's going to be the real game changer because it's a protein plant

52:41.260 --> 52:45.660
instead of a starch plant. We also have vertical farming and cultivated meats coming online. The

52:45.660 --> 52:50.700
idea that we have to eat food the way it's always been produced, in the words grow an entire cow to

52:50.700 --> 52:57.180
get access to meat, is going to be seen as insane in the future. Why not just grow the protein that

52:57.180 --> 53:02.540
you need to make a good burger? That's a full topic for a whole other debate. I agree.

53:07.340 --> 53:13.260
Thanks so much, Andy. Really grateful for your question. I've got a question for the two of you,

53:13.260 --> 53:19.500
if I may, which is what's the one argument, and maybe we'll start with Peter Z. What's the one

53:19.500 --> 53:28.620
argument from your colleague that you agree or disagree most with and why? Well, you know,

53:28.620 --> 53:34.140
we actually don't disagree on what technology can do. We don't disagree really on what the

53:34.140 --> 53:39.100
pace of technology can exchange or it can achieve. Our big disagreement is whether the system we're

53:39.100 --> 53:43.580
in today is sustainable in the near-term future or not, or if we have to go through a bit of a

53:43.580 --> 53:48.540
drop before we start back up. I would argue that demographics very clearly means that we're going

53:48.620 --> 53:52.940
to have to take a breather here. I don't see a way around that. I don't see how manufacturing supply

53:52.940 --> 53:58.460
chains that allow technology to apply to scale can continue this decade without a massive reorganization.

53:59.260 --> 54:06.700
But on the rest of this, I'm with him. Excellent. Peter D. Yeah, I have to say,

54:06.700 --> 54:14.220
I agree with much of what Peter Z has said here. The only thing I would say is it's a linear

54:14.220 --> 54:20.220
extrapolation to believe that re-engineering the supply chain will take as long as it has,

54:20.860 --> 54:27.260
because we've got capabilities coming from AI that are going to help us much more rapidly

54:27.260 --> 54:31.900
re-engineer. We have even talked about quantum technologies coming down the pike that are going

54:31.900 --> 54:38.620
to be impacting material science and biology in an extraordinary fashion. So I think if we were

54:38.620 --> 54:44.220
going to try and re-replicate the old school system we've developed over the industrial

54:44.220 --> 54:50.860
military complex of the last century, yeah, it will take many, many decades. But I think we have

54:50.860 --> 54:58.140
shortcuts to be had based upon technology. Having said that, yes, there are supply chain issues.

54:58.140 --> 55:02.060
We saw that during COVID, which can be put us in a precarious situation.

55:02.620 --> 55:08.060
Let me give you an example to show you the promise in the peril. Textiles. Very unsexy

55:08.060 --> 55:12.940
technology was the root of industrialization over a century ago. The model has always been the same

55:12.940 --> 55:17.340
and up until the 90s in the United States, it was women in Appalachia with snowing machines.

55:17.340 --> 55:21.740
Well, then we got NAFTA and the model moved to Mexico where the women with the sewing machines

55:21.740 --> 55:25.420
were cheaper. And then we had the WTO where it moved to India and China where the women with

55:25.420 --> 55:29.820
the sewing machines were cheaper. Then we had COVID and suddenly we didn't have clothes.

55:30.780 --> 55:35.420
So some enterprising folks in North Carolina built some facilities that are two acres under

55:35.420 --> 55:41.020
one roof that take raw cotton, clean it, turn it into thread and then yarn and then cloth and then

55:41.020 --> 55:47.740
close. And the end product is cheaper than what you get out of Bangladesh per unit. And these places

55:47.740 --> 55:54.540
have a staff of two. We had no idea we could do that until we were pushed and we found out we had

55:54.540 --> 56:00.540
to. We're going to find things like that as we reindustrialize, but we're not going to know what

56:00.540 --> 56:06.620
they are until they happen. But you're making the exact point I want to make. A company variant

56:06.620 --> 56:13.180
3D that's here in Malibu is 3D printing clothing at an extraordinary rate in a lights out scenario.

56:13.180 --> 56:19.420
And I think this is what entrepreneurs do. They demonetize and democratize. And I think anybody

56:19.420 --> 56:23.500
listening to this, you know, there are massive opportunities to get ahead of the curve.

56:26.140 --> 56:30.540
We've only got about two minutes left and I want to bring in what is a great question from one of

56:30.540 --> 56:35.260
our audience, which is about the political system. And I want to give it to both of you.

56:35.260 --> 56:41.180
Perhaps start with you, Peter Z, because you've given us the kind of almost apocalyptic view

56:41.900 --> 56:46.860
in the short term. How has our political system contributed to accelerating abundance?

56:47.820 --> 56:53.580
And is it a quip? Do you agree, first of all, and is it a quip to continue to do so? And then

56:53.580 --> 56:55.900
I'll come back to you with the same question, Peter Z.

56:59.420 --> 57:03.500
An understanding of where we are. We have a first past the post electoral system,

57:03.500 --> 57:07.740
which means we have two very big tent parties with lots of factions. And the factions move

57:07.740 --> 57:11.980
around over time as technology and demographics and geopolitics shift. And if you think in the

57:11.980 --> 57:16.620
last 40 years, a lot's gone down, it would make sense for us to rearrange our system now.

57:17.180 --> 57:23.340
This is the seventh time we have done this. We will get through it. Doesn't mean you're going

57:23.340 --> 57:27.980
to like what it looks like on the other side. But at moments of transition like this, we get two

57:27.980 --> 57:32.940
things. Personalities from the outside that just stir the pot, we've seen plenty of those,

57:33.660 --> 57:39.180
and civil society takes over the governmental process because the government becomes

57:39.260 --> 57:47.820
unable to do it itself. So that second piece, that's social media. That's the Elon Musk's

57:47.820 --> 57:51.340
of the world. We might not like it every day, but you got to admit the situation's become a

57:51.340 --> 57:55.260
lot more dynamic and there are a lot more decision makers out there when it comes to

57:55.260 --> 58:01.660
economic and technological trends. It's loud. It's messy, but I'd argue it's taken us in the right

58:01.660 --> 58:11.660
direction. Okay, Peter Dee. Zinnia, I count on entrepreneurship and capitalism to solve problems.

58:11.660 --> 58:18.380
I never depend on the government. Period. End of statement. That was a beautiful brief answer.

58:18.380 --> 58:24.380
Okay, we are outsourcing our governance is what I hear almost from both of you, actually.

58:25.020 --> 58:33.260
Now's the time to bring it home with closing remarks. I'm going to go to you, Peter Dee, first.

58:33.260 --> 58:39.180
You have the floor. Leave us with a reason to believe that yes is the answer to the question,

58:39.180 --> 58:46.620
will the future be abundant? Okay, I built an AI model called Peterbot,

58:47.180 --> 58:52.700
and I'm going to ask Peterbot to go ahead and respond to Peter Zion. Peterbot, would you?

58:53.500 --> 58:58.300
Peter Zion's assertion that we are returning to a world resembling pre-World War Two

58:58.300 --> 59:04.220
is overly pessimistic. The world today is vastly different with exponential technologies

59:04.220 --> 59:09.020
driving progress. Let's focus on leveraging these capabilities to create a future that

59:09.020 --> 59:14.780
surpasses any previous era. I understand Peter's concerns about a pricier and slower world,

59:14.780 --> 59:20.300
but I see this as a temporary transition. I believe in the potential of technology to solve

59:20.300 --> 59:25.820
global challenges. History shows that advancements have consistently improved our lives.

59:25.820 --> 59:32.380
Let's dive into a few concrete examples. One, energy. We're witnessing a global shift towards

59:32.380 --> 59:37.900
renewable energy sources like solar and wind, with costs plummeting and installations surging

59:37.900 --> 59:44.540
worldwide. Two, transportation. Electric vehicles are gaining traction, with major automakers

59:44.540 --> 59:50.620
investing heavily. Additionally, we're seeing advancements in autonomous vehicles, hyperloop

59:50.620 --> 59:57.500
technology, and even flying taxis. Three, education. Online learning platforms are democratizing

59:57.500 --> 01:00:03.980
education, allowing people worldwide to access high quality educational resources. Virtual reality

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.780
and augmented reality are transforming the learning experience. These examples illustrate

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:14.140
how innovation and technology are reshaping various sectors, creating opportunities for positive

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:21.500
change and a brighter future. You can access peterbot.ai. You can ask it questions about

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:29.260
its train of my books and my blogs. I believe in data-driven optimism, and the data has been

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:36.140
consistent up and to the right for the past century. Technology, which has made that transition,

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:43.100
is not slowing down. It's accelerating. Is there danger out there? Of course. Do I believe in

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:49.020
entrepreneurs and individuals to find and solve problems more than ever before? I think they're

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:57.100
the only ones who do. Is the world becoming more abundant? 100%. It is becoming abundant in terms

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:06.380
of access to all the fundamentals. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Peter Bot. Now, Peter Z.,

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.740
you have the final word. You're a butthole, please. Tell us why you answer no to the question,

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:17.980
will the future be abundant? We don't have the redundancy yet. We don't have the resiliency yet.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.780
And if things go with demographics in China and globalization the way I'm anticipating,

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:29.260
we don't have that in finance or industrial materials or manufacturing or above all agriculture.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:37.580
And until we do, people are going to get left behind at scale. Hopefully, over the next 20 years,

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.700
we can work out the kinks of this transition and not lose a lot of what we've achieved in the last

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:49.020
century. But if you look back on the two millennia of history before 1900, that suggests that

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:56.540
unlocking that potential is a lot more difficult than it seems to us at the moment we're in now.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.860
That was a very quick wrap up. Thank you so much, Peter. That's confidence.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:10.380
No, that's, you know what? That's confidence. I like it. That concludes our debate. I'd really

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:18.140
like to both thank, I will say all three of you, Peter, Peter Barton, Peter, for showing up and

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:23.420
