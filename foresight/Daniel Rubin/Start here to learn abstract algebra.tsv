0	8000	All right, everybody. Today, I'm really excited to tell you about a fantastic math book, a book I've been meaning to talk about for a while.
8000	14000	It is my recommendation for how to get started in the subject of abstract algebra.
14000	19000	It is Galois Theory by Harold M. Edwards.
19000	23000	Now, I can already hear the shouting of my detractors.
23000	32000	Let me tell you this is a very unique book, a very different book from a regular treatment of this subject and the subject of algebra generally.
32000	38000	And I understand it is one thing for me to tell you about what I think is great about this book and to recommend it.
38000	46000	It's altogether another thing for me to suggest this is where students ought to get their start in the subject of algebra.
46000	52000	And I really am saying, even to professors and people who sit on curriculum committees,
52000	60000	I think there is something very seriously wrong with the standard way that abstract algebra is taught to math majors.
60000	66000	I think students are being done a real disservice with the standard groups, rings and fields approach.
66000	73000	I think you could begin with a course taught along the lines of this book and it would be a much better approach to algebra.
73000	76000	It's maybe not the only way of doing it, but it is a very good way of doing it.
76000	80000	Let me start with three things you might notice about this book right off the bat.
80000	86000	First of all, it is not a very thick book. This is not one of those giant tomes of algebra.
86000	91000	This is a very manageable book that you can actually read start to finish.
91000	98000	And an instructor could cover this entire book in a semester, probably with some time left over for additional topics.
98000	107000	Second, this book belongs to Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics series, but it is not just for graduate students.
107000	112000	I'm going to tell you why I think this book is not only appropriate, but it's actually my preferred way to get started.
112000	117000	So don't worry about that at all. It's just the series to which this book belongs.
117000	121000	All it amounts to is not my favorite type setting, but that's fine.
121000	127000	And the third thing is that this book is not called Abstract Algebra, Modern Algebra, Higher Algebra.
127000	128000	It's called Galois Theory.
129000	138000	A Galois theory is a theory that relates the solutions of polynomials to this hidden symmetries that their roots possess.
138000	146000	It is named in honor of Everest Galois, who developed this whole theory completely on his own and was never recognized for it in his short life.
146000	153000	He was killed in a duel at age 20 very tragically, but people came to recognize the importance of his work afterwards.
153000	157000	And it is the foundation of a lot of modern algebra.
157000	167000	But you may know that Galois theory is typically taught in a second semester of undergraduate abstract algebra if it is covered at all.
167000	174000	And so why am I saying this is the book to get started and not a book which actually has algebra in the title?
174000	178000	And the answer, you can start to get a sense of the answer if you read.
178000	179000	What is this book about?
179000	187000	On the back it says, this book is an introduction to Galois theory along the lines of Galois actual memoir.
187000	190000	And he talks about the antecedents of Galois theory.
190000	199000	These names, Gauss Lagrange, Vandermonde Newton, even back to the ancient Babylonians are explained to put Galois main ideas in their historical setting.
199000	202000	And that is the main crux of it.
202000	209000	One of the things that makes this book special is this is a historically minded treatment of this subject.
209000	214000	And if you pay attention to this channel, you know that is an approach that I really like.
214000	219000	It's not just because I like history, but it's because this is how I like to understand math.
219000	224000	And I'm going to try to tell you why I think this is a very concrete and good way of understanding the subject.
224000	230000	But at least you can see if he starts all the way back, the ancient Babylonians and works his way forward through history.
230000	236000	How could this possibly be something that comes later, comes only as you're a graduate student.
236000	245000	All of this material in this book came well before the theory was rewritten in the way that you will see in most other algebra textbooks.
245000	246000	And this is something great.
246000	251000	That's true of a lot of the books of this fantastic author Harold M. Edwards.
251000	253000	What are the prerequisites for this book?
253000	256000	Actually, in terms of content, the prerequisites are pretty minimal.
256000	265000	Really, high school algebra and having some curiosity about if you know how to solve quadratic equations, what happens for higher degree.
265000	272000	But as Edwards says in the preface, he has assumed a certain degree of mathematical experience.
272000	274000	You need to be able to compute.
274000	277000	You need to be able to give an argument.
278000	288000	And so although this book doesn't actually require a whole lot of content knowledge, it doesn't make it easy, but it is manageable.
288000	295000	All right, so let's look at the content of this book.
295000	300000	So the first thing you'll notice is that the book doesn't actually have chapters.
300000	306000	It is arranged in terms of sections, each of which is very short and usually contains just one idea.
306000	310000	But the sections are grouped together in a way that they end in an exercise set.
310000	313000	So there are eight exercise sets in the book.
313000	316000	So you may hear me refer to these as chapters.
316000	320000	The only difference is that these chapters are not modular.
320000	323000	You really have to go from start to finish.
323000	329000	The first 30 sections are algebra before Galois and up to Galois.
329000	332000	So in the beginning, there are some historical remarks.
332000	338000	There is the solution of quadratic equations even from the time of the Babylonians.
338000	346000	From there, you have to go to the 16th century and he describes the methods of solution of the cubic and then the solution of the quartic
346000	351000	and what people tried on the quintic and how those same methods didn't seem to work.
351000	358000	And then you get into the first key technique that will be used throughout the book, these expressions in terms of symmetric polynomials.
358000	363000	The second chapter is about the work of Lagrange and Vandermonde.
363000	372000	This is already 200 years after Cardano with their own way of trying to work out what was going on in those earlier methods.
372000	374000	Could they generalize?
374000	378000	And then there is a chapter on cyclotomic equations, the roots of unity.
378000	382000	Can you write the roots of unity in terms of radicals?
382000	384000	And this is mostly work of Gauss.
384000	393000	Cyclotomic equations play a central role in the theory in this book because if you're interested in, can you solve an equation by radicals?
393000	397000	It's assumed you can include roots of unity in that solution.
397000	404000	And then there is this discussion of Lagrange's idea of what's something called a resolvent and Galois' resolvent.
404000	407000	This is what begins the Galois part of this book.
407000	416000	And the rest of the book is pretty much a kind of expanded explanation or commentary on Galois' paper.
416000	421000	The revolutionary paper that he wrote and was still adding to the night before he died.
421000	427000	Really great general theorems here about constructing simple algebraic extensions.
427000	431000	How do you know that there is a root anyway?
431000	434000	This is the beginning of Galois' work.
434000	441000	And then these chapters five and six may be the heart of the matter here.
441000	447000	There is the introduction of the idea of a group, which you could say is due to Galois.
447000	453000	You'll see Galois' idea of a group is not exactly what we think of as a group today.
453000	461000	But it captures the key idea because in the sixth chapter you can see if an equation is solvable by radicals,
461000	466000	then there's some interesting structure to its Galois group when you reduce that group as normal.
466000	470000	And that was the key thing that Galois discovered.
470000	476000	Now this seventh chapter is really interesting on splitting fields.
476000	480000	This is a somewhat philosophically-binded chapter.
480000	485000	Edwards makes the case that for the foundations of this theory you would need to know
485000	490000	what tells you that there exists roots in the first place.
490000	493000	How do you know when you have a theory about permuting roots?
493000	495000	Well, what is it that you're talking about?
495000	499000	And he argues that the fundamental theorem of algebra due to Gauss,
499000	504000	that every polynomial over the complex numbers splits over the complex numbers,
504000	509000	is not really the right foundation for this theory for a couple of reasons.
509000	513000	Actually, it has to do with algebraic constructions of a splitting field,
513000	520000	and that has to do with the theorem that was proven earlier that constructs simple algebraic extensions
520000	524000	and having a factorization method for field extensions.
524000	527000	So this is a really interesting addition to the theory.
527000	530000	It's something I hadn't really thought about in this way.
530000	531000	It's good material.
531000	535000	This is the only material in the book that actually comes from after Galois.
535000	537000	This is a few decades later.
537000	542000	And then the final chapter of the book, this review of Galois theory,
542000	544000	is about the fundamental theorem.
544000	553000	The fundamental relationship in Galois theory is this correspondence between the subfields of an extension
553000	556000	and the subgroups of the Galois group that fix them.
556000	562000	And then this correspondence is used to address some of the other issues in the book
562000	568000	and this issue of solvable equations of prime degree, which was in Galois' original memoir,
568000	574000	maybe a little bit esoteric, but also it fills in the proof of this Lemma II,
574000	577000	which was part of the theory of cyclatomic equations.
577000	581000	So everything is all wrapped up very nicely and neatly at the end of this book.
581000	588000	And then there are three appendices, and the first one is Galois' actual memoir.
588000	591000	So you can see, here is Edwards' translation.
591000	594000	This is what Galois actually wrote.
594000	596000	And it's really fascinating.
596000	599000	Well, it is difficult for a modern audience to read.
599000	603000	You can see why you need this whole book to make sense of this.
603000	609000	But you can see such a thing like here in Proposition 2,
609000	614000	here is how the idea of a normal subgroup, these groups will have the remarkable property
614000	618000	that one will pass from one to the other and applying the same substitution of letters
618000	620000	to all the permutations of the first.
620000	621000	What does that mean?
621000	632000	Well, in the text, here Edwards explains this is what Galois meant by that,
632000	638000	and this is the discovery of the key property of normal subgroups.
638000	642000	That's just a really interesting historical thing to have there.
643000	650000	But then it's really nice to have this synopsis and some material on groups
650000	657000	that sort of ties this material together and puts it in maybe a more standard formulation
657000	659000	than what is in the rest of the book.
659000	662000	Just a really solid course on Galois theory.
662000	668000	So there are lots of really good exercises in this book.
668000	670000	What do I mean by good exercises?
670000	674000	They are good in the sense that they are worthy results
674000	680000	and they typically involve good practice in the techniques of the theory,
680000	682000	so you really learn the theory by doing them.
682000	689000	Exercises are a very good mix of computational problems and theoretical ones.
689000	693000	My one issue with these exercises, and I did a bunch of them before this review,
693000	696000	is that a few of them, and there's no warning which ones,
696000	703000	a few of them are quite hard in the sense that they go beyond the methods demonstrated in the text
703000	706000	or they are quite involved and the answers are very long,
706000	708000	and I'll just point out a couple of them.
708000	713000	So for example, it is left completely as an exercise to the reader
713000	717000	to prove that every prime has a primitive root.
717000	720000	This is such an important theorem, and of course you should prove it,
720000	724000	and the methods go a little bit maybe beyond what's in the book to do it,
724000	728000	and I'll mention two other really important exercises as well.
728000	735000	Here you are asked in these two exercises to essentially give the connection
735000	740000	between Galois's method of solving equations to the earlier methods,
740000	745000	and that's really important, but you will see the answers are quite long.
745000	748000	But that's the other thing about this book.
748000	751000	There are answers to all of the exercises,
751000	754000	which is really incredible to see in a book,
754000	757000	and fortunately, so it's really nice to have,
757000	760000	especially for the computational ones and for the more theoretical ones,
760000	763000	it's really more like a hint, generalized outline.
763000	767000	It doesn't invalidate the use of this book for student exercises,
767000	771000	and this book has another feature, which I've actually never seen in a book before.
771000	774000	This is really something here.
774000	778000	It has this feature, list of exercises,
778000	779000	and what is it?
779000	782000	This is, I imagine this must be for an instructor.
782000	785000	It actually, so that you don't have to read the exercises,
785000	789000	it gives a description of every exercise, what it's getting at,
789000	793000	so an instructor can know maybe which ones to assign.
793000	798000	This one has to do with the construction of a regular pentagon, et cetera, et cetera.
798000	802000	I've never seen this before, as I said, but that's really convenient.
802000	806000	What may not be apparent if you are not already a mathematician,
806000	811000	if you're not an expert, this is a very, very different treatment of this subject.
811000	813000	It's a different treatment of Galois theory,
813000	818000	and certainly it's a different approach to the whole subject of algebra in many ways.
818000	823000	In some simple ways, first of all, there is some non-standard terminology in this book,
823000	828000	the terminology of Galois Resolvent, Galois' original definition of a group.
828000	832000	It's not what you will find in other books, and that is an issue,
832000	837000	although Edwards does eventually connect it to more standard notions.
837000	841000	And of course, you will notice if you look at the text,
841000	845000	there is a lot of text in this book.
845000	849000	It is not just definition theorem proof.
849000	854000	There is a lot written out, it's more written like a lecture.
854000	856000	In part, this is a matter of style,
856000	864000	and in part, this is because the book takes a problem-solving approach to mathematics
864000	867000	as opposed to a theory-building approach.
867000	875000	The standard approach to algebra is to introduce students to the various abstract structures
875000	879000	that the theory is built on, and you will learn in the abstract a theory of groups,
879000	883000	a theory of rings, and a theory of fields, and that is not the approach in this book.
883000	887000	This book takes the approach of what is the story?
887000	893000	There is a constant through-line in this book of the problem at hand is to solve polynomial equations,
893000	899000	a certain kind of polynomial equation, and you just do whatever you have to do in order to solve it.
899000	907000	So that is why, for example, when the issue becomes constructing a simple algebraic extension,
907000	912000	the text makes clear what is the problem at hand, what you would have to do,
912000	917000	as you work through the problem and you need to deal with some critical distinction,
917000	920000	that's when the distinction is introduced.
920000	927000	So issues about rings and fields that you would learn, it takes a whole semester to learn abstractly on their own,
927000	929000	and maybe not know why they're important.
929000	933000	Well, when they become important in the course of this book, that's when they're introduced.
933000	941000	So here you see the Euclidean algorithm being introduced when he wants to prove this theorem on simple algebraic extensions.
941000	945000	Clearly, I prefer this problem-solving approach.
945000	950000	I find it much more concrete, far more motivated, and it is how mathematics was actually done.
950000	958000	If you go through a regular course on algebra and then Galois theory, it will probably be a complete mystery to you
958000	964000	how this teenager came up with this whole theory and revolutionized the whole subject.
964000	968000	But if you read this book, you will learn the subject in a way that makes you say,
968000	970000	Oh, that makes a lot of sense.
970000	980000	It'll be very clear why you are doing what you are doing and the emphasis is on techniques rather than remembering definitions.
980000	982000	This is not how I learned the subject.
982000	986000	I learned the subject from a bunch of other much more standard books,
986000	991000	and I really wish I had discovered this earlier, but I love this book now.
991000	993000	Where do you go after this book?
993000	997000	This does not really replace a full year of algebra.
997000	999000	It does not cover everything.
999000	1005000	It does not cover, for example, some of the structure theorems of finite groups or the Silo theorems,
1005000	1009000	that sort of thing, which is often covered in a first semester in algebra.
1009000	1014000	But I think after this book, now you actually have a reason to study these objects.
1014000	1019000	And so there are lots of different directions you can go after this book, even with a more standard text.
1019000	1022000	I will talk about some other good algebra books later.
1022000	1027000	Now, this book was actually originally intended, as he says in the preface,
1027000	1031000	as just a section of his other book for Ma's last theorem,
1031000	1033000	a genetic approach to algebraic number theory.
1033000	1038000	And that is a fantastic follow up for people who are interested in number theory,
1038000	1040000	which you can read after this book.
1040000	1044000	Other directions might be in the direction of representation theory and matrix groups.
1044000	1048000	I hope this kind of discussion about books is helpful to you.
1048000	1050000	I've provided some links in the description.
1050000	1053000	If you want to learn more about the history of algebra,
1053000	1056000	there is a great book by Vendor Verden, History of Algebra.
1056000	1059000	And that goes into some things that are not discussed in this book.
1059000	1064000	For example, Abel's Proof of the Insolubility of the Quintic, which actually came before.
1064000	1068000	Galois's explanation and the work of Ruffini as well.
1068000	1074000	It's hard to actually learn math from a book that's really about the history of math.
1074000	1077000	Either there's too much history or it's intended for experts.
1077000	1082000	But Harold M. Edwards has done The Math World a great service
1082000	1086000	by writing these books that are really intended for students
1086000	1090000	and contain a motivated historical presentation.
1090000	1096000	The whole book is actually infused with an attitude of setting the record straight.
1096000	1102000	A kind of zeal both for the real way that things are done and making it concrete
1102000	1109000	and exposing the absurdity of the philosophy of the Berbaki growth and deep group
1109000	1112000	that has written this kind of revisionist mathematics
1112000	1114000	and these highly general abstract texts
1114000	1119000	and thinks that if you only studied things in the appropriate generality
1119000	1121000	then the solutions would pop out.
1121000	1125000	Of course, this book shows that's not how it happened at all,
1125000	1127000	certainly in the case of this subject.
1127000	1132000	And I think this book can teach a lot of people, a lot of algebra
1132000	1136000	that is very hard to obscure if you try to do it a different way.
1136000	1138000	Alright, thanks a lot.
