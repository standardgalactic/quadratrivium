1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right, everybody. Today, I'm really excited to tell you about a fantastic math book, a book I've been meaning to talk about for a while.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is my recommendation for how to get started in the subject of abstract algebra.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It is Galois Theory by Harold M. Edwards.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, I can already hear the shouting of my detractors.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let me tell you this is a very unique book, a very different book from a regular treatment of this subject and the subject of algebra generally.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And I understand it is one thing for me to tell you about what I think is great about this book and to recommend it.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's altogether another thing for me to suggest this is where students ought to get their start in the subject of algebra.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I really am saying, even to professors and people who sit on curriculum committees,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think there is something very seriously wrong with the standard way that abstract algebra is taught to math majors.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think students are being done a real disservice with the standard groups, rings and fields approach.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think you could begin with a course taught along the lines of this book and it would be a much better approach to algebra.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's maybe not the only way of doing it, but it is a very good way of doing it.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let me start with three things you might notice about this book right off the bat.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First of all, it is not a very thick book. This is not one of those giant tomes of algebra.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is a very manageable book that you can actually read start to finish.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And an instructor could cover this entire book in a semester, probably with some time left over for additional topics.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Second, this book belongs to Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics series, but it is not just for graduate students.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to tell you why I think this book is not only appropriate, but it's actually my preferred way to get started.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So don't worry about that at all. It's just the series to which this book belongs.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All it amounts to is not my favorite type setting, but that's fine.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the third thing is that this book is not called Abstract Algebra, Modern Algebra, Higher Algebra.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's called Galois Theory.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A Galois theory is a theory that relates the solutions of polynomials to this hidden symmetries that their roots possess.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is named in honor of Everest Galois, who developed this whole theory completely on his own and was never recognized for it in his short life.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He was killed in a duel at age 20 very tragically, but people came to recognize the importance of his work afterwards.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And it is the foundation of a lot of modern algebra.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But you may know that Galois theory is typically taught in a second semester of undergraduate abstract algebra if it is covered at all.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And so why am I saying this is the book to get started and not a book which actually has algebra in the title?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And the answer, you can start to get a sense of the answer if you read.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What is this book about?

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
On the back it says, this book is an introduction to Galois theory along the lines of Galois actual memoir.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And he talks about the antecedents of Galois theory.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
These names, Gauss Lagrange, Vandermonde Newton, even back to the ancient Babylonians are explained to put Galois main ideas in their historical setting.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And that is the main crux of it.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One of the things that makes this book special is this is a historically minded treatment of this subject.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And if you pay attention to this channel, you know that is an approach that I really like.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not just because I like history, but it's because this is how I like to understand math.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I'm going to try to tell you why I think this is a very concrete and good way of understanding the subject.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But at least you can see if he starts all the way back, the ancient Babylonians and works his way forward through history.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How could this possibly be something that comes later, comes only as you're a graduate student.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All of this material in this book came well before the theory was rewritten in the way that you will see in most other algebra textbooks.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And this is something great.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's true of a lot of the books of this fantastic author Harold M. Edwards.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are the prerequisites for this book?

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Actually, in terms of content, the prerequisites are pretty minimal.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really, high school algebra and having some curiosity about if you know how to solve quadratic equations, what happens for higher degree.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But as Edwards says in the preface, he has assumed a certain degree of mathematical experience.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You need to be able to compute.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You need to be able to give an argument.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And so although this book doesn't actually require a whole lot of content knowledge, it doesn't make it easy, but it is manageable.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right, so let's look at the content of this book.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So the first thing you'll notice is that the book doesn't actually have chapters.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It is arranged in terms of sections, each of which is very short and usually contains just one idea.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But the sections are grouped together in a way that they end in an exercise set.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So there are eight exercise sets in the book.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So you may hear me refer to these as chapters.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The only difference is that these chapters are not modular.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You really have to go from start to finish.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The first 30 sections are algebra before Galois and up to Galois.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So in the beginning, there are some historical remarks.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There is the solution of quadratic equations even from the time of the Babylonians.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
From there, you have to go to the 16th century and he describes the methods of solution of the cubic and then the solution of the quartic

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and what people tried on the quintic and how those same methods didn't seem to work.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And then you get into the first key technique that will be used throughout the book, these expressions in terms of symmetric polynomials.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The second chapter is about the work of Lagrange and Vandermonde.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is already 200 years after Cardano with their own way of trying to work out what was going on in those earlier methods.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Could they generalize?

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then there is a chapter on cyclotomic equations, the roots of unity.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you write the roots of unity in terms of radicals?

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And this is mostly work of Gauss.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cyclotomic equations play a central role in the theory in this book because if you're interested in, can you solve an equation by radicals?

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's assumed you can include roots of unity in that solution.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And then there is this discussion of Lagrange's idea of what's something called a resolvent and Galois' resolvent.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is what begins the Galois part of this book.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And the rest of the book is pretty much a kind of expanded explanation or commentary on Galois' paper.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The revolutionary paper that he wrote and was still adding to the night before he died.

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Really great general theorems here about constructing simple algebraic extensions.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How do you know that there is a root anyway?

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is the beginning of Galois' work.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then these chapters five and six may be the heart of the matter here.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There is the introduction of the idea of a group, which you could say is due to Galois.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You'll see Galois' idea of a group is not exactly what we think of as a group today.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But it captures the key idea because in the sixth chapter you can see if an equation is solvable by radicals,

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
then there's some interesting structure to its Galois group when you reduce that group as normal.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And that was the key thing that Galois discovered.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now this seventh chapter is really interesting on splitting fields.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a somewhat philosophically-binded chapter.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Edwards makes the case that for the foundations of this theory you would need to know

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
what tells you that there exists roots in the first place.

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How do you know when you have a theory about permuting roots?

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, what is it that you're talking about?

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And he argues that the fundamental theorem of algebra due to Gauss,

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that every polynomial over the complex numbers splits over the complex numbers,

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is not really the right foundation for this theory for a couple of reasons.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Actually, it has to do with algebraic constructions of a splitting field,

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and that has to do with the theorem that was proven earlier that constructs simple algebraic extensions

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and having a factorization method for field extensions.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So this is a really interesting addition to the theory.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's something I hadn't really thought about in this way.

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's good material.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the only material in the book that actually comes from after Galois.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is a few decades later.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And then the final chapter of the book, this review of Galois theory,

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is about the fundamental theorem.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The fundamental relationship in Galois theory is this correspondence between the subfields of an extension

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and the subgroups of the Galois group that fix them.

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And then this correspondence is used to address some of the other issues in the book

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and this issue of solvable equations of prime degree, which was in Galois' original memoir,

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
maybe a little bit esoteric, but also it fills in the proof of this Lemma II,

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
which was part of the theory of cyclatomic equations.

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So everything is all wrapped up very nicely and neatly at the end of this book.

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then there are three appendices, and the first one is Galois' actual memoir.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you can see, here is Edwards' translation.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is what Galois actually wrote.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it's really fascinating.

116
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, it is difficult for a modern audience to read.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can see why you need this whole book to make sense of this.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But you can see such a thing like here in Proposition 2,

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
here is how the idea of a normal subgroup, these groups will have the remarkable property

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that one will pass from one to the other and applying the same substitution of letters

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to all the permutations of the first.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What does that mean?

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, in the text, here Edwards explains this is what Galois meant by that,

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and this is the discovery of the key property of normal subgroups.

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's just a really interesting historical thing to have there.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But then it's really nice to have this synopsis and some material on groups

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that sort of ties this material together and puts it in maybe a more standard formulation

128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
than what is in the rest of the book.

129
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just a really solid course on Galois theory.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So there are lots of really good exercises in this book.

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What do I mean by good exercises?

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They are good in the sense that they are worthy results

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and they typically involve good practice in the techniques of the theory,

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
so you really learn the theory by doing them.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Exercises are a very good mix of computational problems and theoretical ones.

136
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
My one issue with these exercises, and I did a bunch of them before this review,

137
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
is that a few of them, and there's no warning which ones,

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a few of them are quite hard in the sense that they go beyond the methods demonstrated in the text

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or they are quite involved and the answers are very long,

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and I'll just point out a couple of them.

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So for example, it is left completely as an exercise to the reader

142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
to prove that every prime has a primitive root.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is such an important theorem, and of course you should prove it,

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and the methods go a little bit maybe beyond what's in the book to do it,

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and I'll mention two other really important exercises as well.

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Here you are asked in these two exercises to essentially give the connection

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
between Galois's method of solving equations to the earlier methods,

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and that's really important, but you will see the answers are quite long.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But that's the other thing about this book.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There are answers to all of the exercises,

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
which is really incredible to see in a book,

152
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and fortunately, so it's really nice to have,

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
especially for the computational ones and for the more theoretical ones,

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
it's really more like a hint, generalized outline.

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It doesn't invalidate the use of this book for student exercises,

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and this book has another feature, which I've actually never seen in a book before.

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is really something here.

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It has this feature, list of exercises,

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and what is it?

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is, I imagine this must be for an instructor.

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It actually, so that you don't have to read the exercises,

162
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it gives a description of every exercise, what it's getting at,

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so an instructor can know maybe which ones to assign.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This one has to do with the construction of a regular pentagon, et cetera, et cetera.

165
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've never seen this before, as I said, but that's really convenient.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What may not be apparent if you are not already a mathematician,

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
if you're not an expert, this is a very, very different treatment of this subject.

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a different treatment of Galois theory,

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and certainly it's a different approach to the whole subject of algebra in many ways.

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
In some simple ways, first of all, there is some non-standard terminology in this book,

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the terminology of Galois Resolvent, Galois' original definition of a group.

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's not what you will find in other books, and that is an issue,

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
although Edwards does eventually connect it to more standard notions.

174
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And of course, you will notice if you look at the text,

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
there is a lot of text in this book.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It is not just definition theorem proof.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There is a lot written out, it's more written like a lecture.

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In part, this is a matter of style,

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and in part, this is because the book takes a problem-solving approach to mathematics

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
as opposed to a theory-building approach.

181
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The standard approach to algebra is to introduce students to the various abstract structures

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that the theory is built on, and you will learn in the abstract a theory of groups,

183
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
a theory of rings, and a theory of fields, and that is not the approach in this book.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This book takes the approach of what is the story?

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There is a constant through-line in this book of the problem at hand is to solve polynomial equations,

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a certain kind of polynomial equation, and you just do whatever you have to do in order to solve it.

187
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So that is why, for example, when the issue becomes constructing a simple algebraic extension,

188
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the text makes clear what is the problem at hand, what you would have to do,

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
as you work through the problem and you need to deal with some critical distinction,

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that's when the distinction is introduced.

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So issues about rings and fields that you would learn, it takes a whole semester to learn abstractly on their own,

192
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and maybe not know why they're important.

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, when they become important in the course of this book, that's when they're introduced.

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So here you see the Euclidean algorithm being introduced when he wants to prove this theorem on simple algebraic extensions.

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Clearly, I prefer this problem-solving approach.

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I find it much more concrete, far more motivated, and it is how mathematics was actually done.

197
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you go through a regular course on algebra and then Galois theory, it will probably be a complete mystery to you

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
how this teenager came up with this whole theory and revolutionized the whole subject.

199
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But if you read this book, you will learn the subject in a way that makes you say,

200
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It'll be very clear why you are doing what you are doing and the emphasis is on techniques rather than remembering definitions.

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is not how I learned the subject.

203
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I learned the subject from a bunch of other much more standard books,

204
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and I really wish I had discovered this earlier, but I love this book now.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where do you go after this book?

206
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This does not really replace a full year of algebra.

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It does not cover everything.

208
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It does not cover, for example, some of the structure theorems of finite groups or the Silo theorems,

209
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that sort of thing, which is often covered in a first semester in algebra.

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But I think after this book, now you actually have a reason to study these objects.

211
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And so there are lots of different directions you can go after this book, even with a more standard text.

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will talk about some other good algebra books later.

213
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Now, this book was actually originally intended, as he says in the preface,

214
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
as just a section of his other book for Ma's last theorem,

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
a genetic approach to algebraic number theory.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And that is a fantastic follow up for people who are interested in number theory,

217
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
which you can read after this book.

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Other directions might be in the direction of representation theory and matrix groups.

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I hope this kind of discussion about books is helpful to you.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've provided some links in the description.

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If you want to learn more about the history of algebra,

222
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
there is a great book by Vendor Verden, History of Algebra.

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And that goes into some things that are not discussed in this book.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For example, Abel's Proof of the Insolubility of the Quintic, which actually came before.

225
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Galois's explanation and the work of Ruffini as well.

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's hard to actually learn math from a book that's really about the history of math.

227
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Either there's too much history or it's intended for experts.

228
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But Harold M. Edwards has done The Math World a great service

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
by writing these books that are really intended for students

230
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and contain a motivated historical presentation.

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The whole book is actually infused with an attitude of setting the record straight.

232
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A kind of zeal both for the real way that things are done and making it concrete

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and exposing the absurdity of the philosophy of the Berbaki growth and deep group

234
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that has written this kind of revisionist mathematics

235
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and these highly general abstract texts

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and thinks that if you only studied things in the appropriate generality

237
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
then the solutions would pop out.

238
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Of course, this book shows that's not how it happened at all,

239
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
certainly in the case of this subject.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And I think this book can teach a lot of people, a lot of algebra

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that is very hard to obscure if you try to do it a different way.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Alright, thanks a lot.
