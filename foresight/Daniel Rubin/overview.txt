1. **Historical Context**: John Napier, a Scottish landowner and mathematician, is credited with inventing logarithms in 1614, which revolutionized mathematics, science, and astronomy. His work paved the way for modern calculus and physics.

2. **Logarithm Construction**: Napier's logarithms were based on a decreasing geometric progression starting from 10 raised to the 7th power (10^7), with each subsequent term being one-third of the previous. He considered the sine values as lengths that could be mapped onto a logarithmic scale.

3. **Napier's Logarithm Formula**: Napier's formula for the logarithm of x to base 10 (log10 x) was:
   \[ \text{Log10}(x) = \frac{\text{Log10}(10^7)}{7} \times \log_{10^7}(x) \]

4. **Practical Application**: Napier's logarithms made it much easier to perform complex calculations, such as those required for navigation and astronomical observations, by transforming multiplication into addition on a logarithmic scale.

5. **Improvements by Briggs**: Henry Briggs later worked with Napier to create tables with a base of 10, which were more practical due to the simplicity of dividing by 2 versus multiplying by 1.5 approximately five times in long division.

6. **Slide Rule**: William Autrid was inspired by Napier's tables to invent the first slide rule in 1622, a tool that remained indispensable for calculations until the advent of electronic calculators.

7. **Euler and E**: The constant 'e', which is the base of natural logarithms, was fully characterized by Leonhard Euler. Its role was not explicitly defined by Napier, but it emerged as a fundamental constant in the 18th century.

8. **Spherical Trigonometry**: Napier's interest in logarithms was driven by the need to solve problems in spherical trigonometry, which is essential for astronomy and navigation. The spherical law of cosines involves products of sine or cosine values and was a key motivation for creating logarithm tables.

In summary, John Napier's invention of logarithms was a foundational step in the development of modern mathematics and science, enabling more efficient calculations and facilitating advances in fields such as navigation, astronomy, and physics. His work laid the groundwork for the concept of exponentials and natural logarithms, which are central to calculus and differential equations.

Checking Daniel Rubin/Start here to learn abstract algebra.txt
1. "Elementary Principles of Algebra" by B. L. van der Waerden is a problem-solving oriented book that approaches algebra from the perspective of solving polynomial equations, particularly focusing on Galois theory. It takes a concrete and motivated approach, introducing abstract concepts only when necessary to solve problems, which is a departure from the standard approach of teaching abstract structures like groups, rings, and fields first.

2. The book's story-centric approach makes it more accessible for students who may find traditional algebra texts difficult to understand, especially in understanding the historical context and the development of the subject matter by figures like Galois.

3. While the book does not cover everything typically found in a first semester of algebra, such as structure theorems of finite groups or the Solvable theorem, it provides a strong foundation that can motivate further study in more traditional texts.

4. The book was initially part of another work by van der Waerden on algebraic number theory, "Modern Algebraic Theory," and its focus on solving polynomial equations makes it particularly suitable for students interested in the historical development of algebra.

5. After completing this book, students can explore other areas of algebra such as representation theory, matrix groups, or delve deeper into the history of algebra with Vandiver's "History of Algebra."

6. The book also serves to correct what it sees as a misguided focus on overly general and abstract concepts at the expense of understanding how these concepts arise naturally from concrete problems.

7. For students who prefer a problem-solving approach and want to understand why and how mathematicians think about and solve algebraic problems, this book is an excellent resource. It provides a clear reason for studying the objects of algebra, such as groups, rings, and fields, once they become relevant to solving these problems.

8. The book's emphasis on techniques rather than rote memorization makes it stand out from other more standard texts and can lead to a deeper understanding of algebraic concepts.
