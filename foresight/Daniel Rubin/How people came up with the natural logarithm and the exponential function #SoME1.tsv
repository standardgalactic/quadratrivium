0	4480	Hey everyone, it's time for more tricky parts of calculus.
4480	9160	This episode is about the history of the functions e to the x and log x.
9160	13680	In the last episode, I introduced the exponential function and the logarithm and gave the best
13680	16400	ways to rigorously establish their properties.
16400	19760	There was a lot of great math in that episode, check it out if you haven't seen it, but
19760	24240	a lot of it was from Euler's treatment of these functions from 1748, and some of the
24240	26200	arguments were even from the 19th century.
26200	31920	What I didn't discuss was how people came up with these functions in the first place.
31920	36080	The short answer is that in the reverse of the way these functions are typically introduced
36080	40660	to students today, the natural logarithm preceded the standard exponential function.
40660	45840	We can date the natural logarithm precisely to 1614 in the modern era when it was introduced
45840	48440	by a Scotsman named John Napier.
48440	52640	I want to explain what Napier was trying to do and how he worked out the properties of
52640	56720	the logarithm, but I also want to discuss how people might have developed the theory
56720	61040	of these functions and see if history can tell us why this theory was developed when
61040	63480	it was and not at some other time.
63480	65640	It's really a fascinating story.
65640	69880	So I'll start with this puzzling observation.
69880	73960	Trigonometry is very old, dating back to the time when civilizations first needed enough
73960	79920	of a grasp of astronomy to work out a regular solar calendar about 4,000 years ago.
79920	85200	But although the exponential function is newer, the most common application of exponentiation,
85200	88120	compound interest, is older than trigonometry.
88120	91040	In fact, it's much, much older.
91040	95360	There's evidence of primitive banks in the very first cities with agriculture going back
95360	99560	about 10,000 years to the period called the Neolithic.
99560	103520	These were cities like Jericho, Tel Caramel, and Katal Hoiak.
103520	106320	Here's a map of cities from this period.
106320	112640	Banking predates money to times when banks lent and stored seeds, animals, and grain.
112640	114320	Banking predates writing.
114320	118480	In fact, there's almost certainly banking which provided a need for symbols for goods,
118480	120020	quantities, names, and dates.
120020	124720	We know that the earliest banks issued clay tokens representing quantities of stuff.
124720	129640	We have examples of these tokens with writing from about 3,000 BC.
129640	134160	Did these early banks charge compound interest on loans or give interest to depositors?
134160	138720	That's unclear, though in the kinds of circumstances we're familiar with, compound interest is needed
138720	145040	to provide the right incentives for all parties, so probably at some point they must have.
145040	150920	The earliest written record of compound interest that we have is an incredible artifact.
150920	155160	It's actually a cone made of clay with a cuneiform inscription.
155160	160480	Today it's in the Yale Babylonian Collection, dating from about 2,400 BC.
160480	165480	That makes it about 600 years older than the Plympton 322 tablet on the banner of my channel
165480	168080	that contains the earliest trig table.
168080	173160	It's also our oldest record of a long war with border disputes and diplomatic alliances.
173160	179280	It records the victory of Enmetena of Lagash over the rival city of Umma, two cities on
179280	182560	the Tigris River in what is today southern Iraq.
182560	188400	Apparently, Umma had taken from Lagash a valuable strip of fertile land some two generations
188400	189400	before.
189400	195160	The army of Lagash killed the leader of Umma, and Enmetena demanded that his conquered foes
195160	199880	repay the value of the land they had taken with interest.
199880	205960	The land produced one guru of barley in their units, so at the rather high rate of one-third
205960	212520	or 33 and a third percent interest compounded annually for 55 years and a few months, he
212520	218320	arrived at the round figure of 8.64 million guru.
218320	219960	Here you can see what the writing looks like.
219960	225360	I'm fairly sure that here in the fourth column it says one guru in this box, and down in
225360	230380	this box these circles indicate the really big number of guru.
230380	235480	Some sources translate these circles as 40 times 60 squared, which is 144,000 instead
235480	240960	of 8.64 million, which is 40 times 60 cubed, but the larger figure is more consistent with
240960	243520	the timeline and known interest rate.
243520	250000	In any case, 8.64 million guru converted to our units is 128 billion bushels of barley
250000	255280	of almost 800 times what the United States produces in a year today.
255280	261440	Of course the debt was not repaid, as it might have taken them millions of years to do so.
261440	266840	What happened was that Umma eventually rose up and conquered Lagash instead, killing Enmetena's
266840	271640	son, and the feud might have gone on and on, except all the Sumerian cities were conquered
271640	275760	by Sargon the Great of Akkad in the 2330s.
275760	280080	Maybe what this example shows is that people did not like compound interest.
280080	284560	Compound interest was the subject of endless political battles across time and civilizations.
284560	286360	Often it was outlawed.
286360	289840	Inscriptions tell us that the Bronze Age states of Egypt, Babylon, and the Hittites
289840	292200	had state mandated insurance rates.
292200	295720	But apparently compound interest was bad for the little guy.
295720	299760	If you're wondering like I was, why didn't regular people benefit from compound interest
299760	304040	on their savings, the answer seems to be a combination that often banks served only
304040	308640	the very wealthy, and that at various times instead of offering interest, banks charged
308640	312600	depositors a fraction of their money just to hold it, possibly because the world was
312600	313600	so precarious.
313600	317080	There's evidence of a 160th charge in Babylon.
317080	320640	So compound interest only favored creditors.
320640	324520	All the western monotheistic religions from the periods that followed had injunctions
324520	328920	against usury, usually defined as lending with interest, though sometimes interpreted
328920	331200	as lending at too high a rate.
331200	337360	And of course compound interest was especially evil, as it was thought of as interest on interest.
337360	341480	Ancient Rome had an extensive banking and credit system with interest rates set by the
341480	345680	state, but it was simple interest, not compound interest, which was outlawed, and the rates
345680	350080	seemed to have been set to be easy to calculate, not based on economics.
350080	354160	Rome's collapse made banks disappear for hundreds of years, but banks sprang up again
354160	358560	in Italy as early as the time of the Crusades, and they usually found ways around the laws
358560	359920	against usury.
359920	364600	But compound interest was only made legal in England in 1545, and then revoked and then
364600	368480	allowed again, so that's why we find the first book on the mathematics of compound
368480	373880	interest, Richard Witt's Arithmetical Questions, appearing in 1613.
373880	378440	It contains tables very similar to the logarithmic tables I'm going to talk about by Napier and
378440	382280	Burgey from about the same time, completely independently.
382280	385600	But the issue of compounding more and more frequently wasn't asked, and only seems to
385640	392560	have been brought up in 1683 by Jacob Bernoulli, as mentioned in the previous episode.
392560	397000	As an aside, the ancient economy and ancient banking are huge and fascinating topics I
397000	399480	really would like to know more about as a mathematician.
399480	403440	There are so many problems people in the past had to solve that we solved with math, so
403440	406960	I wonder if they knew more math than we'd give them credit for, or if they had some
406960	408920	completely different way of doing business.
408920	410200	How did they price insurance?
410200	411320	Did they keep statistics?
411320	412320	That sort of thing.
412320	416480	I'd love if anyone can point me in the right direction.
416480	421720	So I think it's also worth noting, exponential growth is part of the cultural lexicon today,
421720	423640	but it certainly wasn't in history.
423640	429120	Some of our best examples of exponential growth, like population growth, or growth in GDP,
429120	433000	or progress in technology, exemplified by something like Moore's Law, which observed
433000	438080	that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit tended to double about every two years.
438080	442720	Probably were not features of human society prior to the Industrial Revolution.
442720	446400	Here's a graph of the human population over time.
446400	453160	The average rate of growth from 10,000 BC to 1700 was 0.04 percent, an imperceptible
453160	456280	rate even if they had kept records, which they did not.
456280	462200	I suspect that, to the extent anyone thought about it, life appeared more cyclical than
462200	463200	progressive.
463200	467080	There were periods of growth and periods of stagnation and death.
467080	470160	This attitude was explicit in the writings of ancient Egypt.
470160	474440	By the way, the population is not growing exponentially now.
474440	479440	Growth has actually slowed to being approximately linear, albeit with large slope.
479440	484200	Of course, also no one observed the growth of bacteria until the invention of the microscope
484200	490760	in the 1670s, and radioactive decay is even later.
490760	495680	What about physical phenomena involving exponentials, like the phenomenon of terminal velocity,
495680	500440	whereby a falling object encountering air resistance proportional to its velocity converges
500440	502960	exponentially to a limiting speed?
502960	507600	Both the mathematics and the experimental apparatus to observe such a phenomenon were
507600	511400	out of reach at the time of Napier's discovery.
511400	516200	Galileo at that time was just realizing that falling objects covered a distance growing
516200	521760	quadratically in time, which he confirmed by setting flags along a track at square intervals,
521760	525760	and as a ball rolled down, it made a steady rhythm of ticks.
525760	530480	With the parabola for the basic model for the path of projectiles, eventually people
530480	536240	observed that cannons, that is, once the cannons were powerful enough for drag to be significant,
536240	541520	did not shoot as far as predicted, which required a theory of drag.
541520	546320	Newton considered the equation of an object whose motion is resisted by a drag force proportional
546320	550320	to its velocity in the Principia, published in 1687.
550320	555400	At the start of book two, he correctly derives the geometric decay and gives an account of
555400	556400	terminal velocity.
556400	561260	Here's an even simpler equation of drag without the constant force of gravity, x double dot
561260	566680	equals minus kx dot, or v dot equals minus kv.
566680	570480	Today we would solve this differential equation using the fundamental theorem of calculus
570480	573560	and our knowledge of the logarithm and exponential.
573560	575600	Newton's account is very different.
575600	581320	In his view, the equation v dot equals minus kv means that in each of any number of very
581320	586560	small equal increments of time, the change in velocity is proportional to the instantaneous
586560	588600	velocity.
588600	594360	Since you can show that if a sequence of values a, b, c, d is in constant proportion to their
594360	600280	differences, they are proportional to each other, the velocity must obey a geometric
600280	603600	progression in equal intervals of time.
603600	608640	This is actually the same argument that Napier gave 70 years earlier when introducing the
608640	610200	logarithm.
610200	615320	But at no point does Newton use terminology or notation for the exponential or the logarithm.
615320	620320	He does mention how the velocity and time are related to the lengths on the x-axis and
620320	625560	areas under the graph of a hyperbola defined by those lengths, as discovered by St. Vincent
625560	629000	in the 1640s, more on him later.
629000	634080	In 1701, Newton posited a similar equation in connection with his law of cooling.
634080	638840	So these investigations would have led to the exponential, but they required the development
638840	643280	of calculus to be further along, and it's worth noting something that the ancients observed
643280	647920	that the motion of the stars was more regular and perfectly circular than anything observed
647920	653400	on Earth, hence the greater attention to and progress in astronomy before the advent of
653400	659080	Newton's laws, though that's not how physics is taught today.
659080	663040	There's another field of investigation that might have led to the exponential in the 16th
663040	665240	century, gambling.
665240	668880	Gambling was always around, but it received a major boon from the ability to manufacture
668880	673480	more regular dice and the invention of the printing press for playing cards.
673480	677880	Many of the top mathematicians of the early modern period were gamblers, Cardano, Fermat,
677880	678880	Pascal, Demouave.
678880	683320	Here's a popular problem in gambling circles from the 1500s or even earlier.
683320	689480	One bets his friend 100 duckets that he will throw aces, or snake eyes, on two dice in
689480	691020	some number of attempts.
691020	694760	What number of attempts makes this a fair bet?
694760	699760	If P is the chance of rolling two ones, one in 36, and the chance of failure is Q equals
699760	705480	one minus P equals 35 over 36, then people realize that the fair number of tries n was
705480	710280	when Q to the n equals one half, or as close to it as one could get with a whole number
710280	711280	n.
711280	716480	Today we'd throw into a calculator n equals minus log 2 over log Q, but they didn't have
716480	718680	calculators or logs yet.
718680	722920	People did compute tables and use some laws of exponents to approximate the right number
722920	724800	of tries.
724800	729400	Here the thrower has the advantage for the first time at 25 tries.
729400	733000	Here's a way to approximate the right number more easily.
733000	739560	Set P over Q equals one over R, so the equation we have to solve is Q to the minus n, which
739560	743520	is one plus one over R to the n equals two.
743520	747600	Now suppose we approximate the expression involving R and n by looking in the limit as
747600	752920	P goes to zero, so R goes to infinity and n goes to infinity so that the ratio n over
752920	757720	R is fixed to be some value, say m.
757720	762560	Then by carefully examining the limit of the binomial coefficients, you get the power series
762560	768540	we recognize as the exponential, the sum of m to the k over k factorial.
768540	772300	If this analysis had been done by Cardano, it might have been the starting point for
772300	778380	the exponential, but instead it waited until Du Moivre in 1711, who referred to this result
778380	784300	as the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is m, because logarithms have been around almost
784300	788740	100 years, but it was before Euler's work on the exponential function.
788740	796980	In any case, you get the solution by taking hyperbolic logarithms m equals log 2 or n equals
796980	802740	log 2 times Q over P, which is about 24.3 in this case, which is good enough to find
802740	804820	the right number of tries.
804820	810420	What about how many tries before it's a fair bet to throw snake eyes twice or three times?
810420	817620	For C successes, you can set the failure probability that of getting 0, 1, 2, or up to C minus
817620	820260	1 successes to one-half.
820260	824980	Again you can take limits to get a transcendental equation for m involving the exponential function
824980	827640	and the truncation of its power series.
827640	831340	This was also done by Du Moivre in the same work, essentially finding that the limit of
831340	835340	the binomial distribution when the success rate goes to 0, but the tries increase so
835340	840060	that np over q is constant, is what we call the Poisson distribution.
840060	845580	This result is named for Poisson, who would not even be born for another 70 years.
845580	849300	That's the first appearance of exponentials in probability.
849300	852900	Du Moivre also established the convergence of the binomial in the case of trials going
852900	857980	to infinity with fixed success rate to the normal distribution e to the minus x squared,
857980	860560	maybe a later episode on this.
860560	864860	Also exponentials come up if you analyze the so-called martingale betting strategy.
864860	869940	I'll link below to a great recent number file video on this, but it seems this strategy
869940	875180	was only discussed at the end of the 18th century.
875180	880500	So here's another particularly pressing problem from the 1500s that really required calculus
880500	882660	and logarithms.
882660	886260	Petrus' voyage began an era of sailing across oceans.
886260	890700	It might be shocking to realize that nearly all voyages up to that point were made not
890700	894340	far out of sight of land, even when traveling in the Mediterranean.
894340	897920	The reason is it's hard to know where you are, and especially so when the distance is
897920	901460	so far that the curvature of the earth makes a big difference.
901460	906860	The mathematician Petrus Nonius was the first to point out in the 1530s that if you travel
906860	912480	in a ship at a constant cardinal direction, or room line, it won't follow a great circle,
912480	916960	but it will make a constant angle with each meridian, resulting in a spiral he called
916960	918720	the loxodrome.
918720	923200	An analytical expression for the loxodrome was beyond the mathematics of the time, but
923200	928580	that didn't stop Mercator from practically dealing with the problem in the 1560s by projecting
928580	933160	the sphere onto a cylinder from its center, a transformation that takes loxodromes to
933160	937720	straight lines, and then by uncurling the cylinder and cutting off at extreme latitudes,
937720	943360	you get his famous map, which is still the most popular way to draw a world map today.
943360	948480	The key mathematical question is, if you travel in a given distance along a room line, starting
948480	953600	from some latitude and longitude, what will be your final latitude and longitude?
953600	958520	For short distances, the change in latitude is just the distance times cosine alpha, where
958520	960440	alpha is the cardinal direction.
960440	965920	The change in longitude is more difficult because each circle of latitude has circumference
966120	970420	that of the equator multiplied by the cosine of the latitude, so the same distance east
970420	976240	or west will cover more degrees of longitude the farther from the equator.
976240	980800	This non-constancy makes finding the change in longitude difficult, that's the problem
980800	983160	of meridional parts.
983160	987280	The determination of the change in longitude ultimately requires an integration of the
987280	989840	secant of the latitude phi.
989840	995240	This is one of these elementary but difficult integrals requiring a very clever substitution
995240	1001760	to see that it's an area under hyperbola with anti-derivative log of tangent of phi
1001760	1004680	over 2 plus pi over 4.
1004680	1009280	It's really remarkable that in an era before calculus, the mathematician Edward Wright
1009280	1016200	in 1599 published certain errors in navigation containing tables for calculating the meridional
1016200	1022280	parts made by taking what we today call Riemann sums of secants.
1022320	1028360	It was only noticed in 1645 that Wright's table was the same as a table of logs of tangents
1028360	1032720	obtained from Napier's work, but it was a complete mystery why.
1032720	1037280	James Gregory was finally able to compute the integral of the secant analytically in
1037280	1043280	1668 by a clever substitution and making use of the then available knowledge of the integral
1043280	1046360	of the hyperbola 1 over x.
1046360	1052120	In the era before Newton, Fermat had been able to work out in the 1630s formulas for
1052120	1058200	the areas under all power law curves except x to the minus 1, which defeated him.
1058200	1064280	It fell to Grégoire de Saint Vincent in 1647 to show that the area under the hyperbola
1064280	1070840	from A to AR is the same as the area from AR to AR squared, essentially by the technique
1070840	1075200	that I described in method 5 of the previous episode.
1075200	1080600	That implies that if you take A of x to be the area under the curve from 1 to x, then
1080600	1089080	A satisfies the multiplicative additive property A of x, y equals A of x plus A of y.
1089080	1094320	Saint Vincent's student, DeSerasa, who must have been familiar with Napier's logarithm,
1094320	1098360	pointed out that the function A was therefore Napier's logarithm up to a multiplicative
1098360	1099480	constant.
1099480	1102920	It was clear numerically that it was the same as the improved version of Napier's
1102920	1108120	logarithm, which was 0 at 1 and had derivative 1 over x, which gave a strong indication of
1108120	1112080	the yet unproved fundamental theorem of calculus.
1112080	1116000	Saint Vincent might have received more credit for such an important discovery had he not
1116000	1120880	in the same book published a construction of the squaring of the circle by ruler and compass,
1120880	1124200	of course incorrect.
1124200	1128680	So those are all the directions which could have led people to the exponential function
1128680	1132840	in the logarithm, but now let's discuss how it actually happened.
1132840	1136920	John Napier did not set out to define a new function, but to provide astronomers and
1136920	1142520	navigators with a useful table to calculate with 7 decimal digits of accuracy.
1142520	1146920	It's hard to imagine, but back then there were no calculators, and when in the 1500s
1146920	1152280	people wanted to do calculations quickly, they relied on lookups to extensive tables.
1152280	1156400	Remember that multiplication is computationally harder than addition.
1156400	1158320	Consider this method of multiplying two numbers.
1158320	1164560	Use the identity AB equals one-fourth A plus B squared minus one-fourth A minus B squared
1164600	1170280	To multiply A times B then, just look up the values at A plus B and A minus B in a table
1170280	1173880	that you've made of values of one-fourth X squared.
1173880	1178400	This method goes back once again to the Babylonians, and even these numbers were once called tables
1178400	1180640	of logarithms.
1180640	1185600	Alternately, because astronomers and engineers made frequent reference to trig tables, see
1185600	1190600	my episode 4, they could use sines and cosines for quick arithmetic.
1190600	1194960	Using the angle sum identities and shifting terms around gives, for example, sine A times
1194960	1200440	sine B equals one-half cosine A minus B minus one-half cosine A plus B.
1200440	1206640	To multiply, for example, 0.68 by 0.43, find the angles in the first quadrant corresponding
1206640	1211640	to these sine values in the table, and then subtract the relevant cosines.
1211640	1218000	Using the angle sum identities like this to multiply is called prosthephoresis, and basically
1218000	1220160	nobody does it anymore.
1220160	1226340	By about 1600, the mathematician Jost Berge came upon the idea of making a more versatile
1226340	1228040	table like this.
1228040	1232080	Suppose you want to do arithmetic with four digits of accuracy.
1232080	1238000	Berge began with the number 10,000, or 10 to the fourth, and then at each step he shifts
1238000	1243080	the number he has over four places and adds it to get the next number and repeats over
1243080	1247880	and over, keeping only an extra four places, you can think about why.
1247880	1254440	Suppose he continued painstakingly until he reached the next power of 10 after 23,027
1254440	1255440	steps.
1255440	1259800	I'm going to make a modern adjustment and move the decimal place over so that the table
1259800	1262640	begins at one and not 10 to the fourth.
1262640	1268560	This table is a geometric progression by the factor one plus one over 10 to the fourth,
1268560	1272280	same as a table of compound interest if the interest rate were 0.01%.
1273280	1278440	Actually, just to get a feel for this process, I attempted to make my own geometric progression
1278440	1284960	table with a much more manageable rate of 1.01%, by shifting by two places and adding
1284960	1291560	over and over, I made it to about 2.01 in 70 steps, which is correct, which is where
1291560	1292560	I stopped.
1292560	1298080	Actually, I found that I had a typo at step nine, which makes all the later digits incorrect,
1298080	1299760	but it's still very close.
1299760	1304080	Getting to 10 would just require a bit more than triple the time and a bit more care than
1304080	1306320	I put into it.
1306320	1309720	Getting back to Berge's four-digit table, here's how to use it.
1309720	1316440	If you want to find, say, the cubed root of 3.6, you find the index of the entry closest
1316440	1325280	to 3.6, which is 12,810, and the entry at 4,270 or one-third of 12,810 is very close
1325280	1326280	to the root.
1326280	1330800	If you want the cube root of 36,000, you have to adjust for powers of 10.
1330800	1333520	36,000 is 3.6 times 10 to the fourth.
1333520	1338080	You can get 10 to the fourth-thirds as 10 times 10 to the one-third, so you take one-third
1338080	1351720	of 23,027, add it to 4,270, that's between 11,945 and 11,946, giving 3.3017, so 33.017
1351720	1354360	cubed is about 36,000.
1354360	1359880	I give this example to clarify the exposition in Otto Toplitz's The Calculus, A Genetic
1359880	1365680	Approach, a great book where I learned about a lot of Napier's work, but already for the
1365680	1370640	scientific work of the late 1500s, four places of accuracy wasn't enough, and a few people
1370640	1377040	like Berge and John Napier set out to make the analogous table with seven places of accuracy.
1377040	1379360	The trouble is that this takes a long time.
1379360	1384400	Taking powers of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the seventh, it will take over 23 million steps
1384400	1389280	to reach 10, so Napier was forced to take a step back and develop some theory.
1389280	1393240	What I'm going to do here is follow the essence of Napier's thinking, minus the particular
1393240	1396480	details of his version of the logarithm, which would confuse the issue.
1396480	1401400	First of all, he figured out that you could make tables based on different geometric progressions
1401400	1406360	of rates A and B, and then you could recover the index of a number in the base B if you
1406360	1411200	knew the index in base A and the number of indices alpha and beta to reach 10 in both
1411200	1417120	tables by the laws of exponents, so it didn't really matter what base was used.
1417120	1422680	Then if you're free to consider any base, the key property of the index, or step function,
1422680	1427960	is that it converts any geometric progression to an arithmetic one, that is, for any rho,
1427960	1435280	f of x, f of rho x, f of rho squared x, etc., all form an arithmetic progression, or f of
1435280	1441600	rho x equals f of x plus k, a constant depending only on rho, for any x.
1441600	1446360	But then f of rho equals f of 1 plus k, but f of 1 equals 0, since that's where we start
1446360	1453520	the table, so k of rho equals f of rho, and therefore, for any x and y, f of x, y equals
1453520	1455600	f of x plus f of y.
1455600	1460520	This again is the multiplicative additive property I mentioned in episode 5, in the first instance
1460520	1463120	in which it appeared historically.
1463120	1467720	If you compute the derivative of such a function, which is a notion Napier knew decades ahead
1467720	1472640	of his time, not by that name, but which he understood as a velocity, using modern notation,
1472640	1479420	the difference quotient limit is the limit of 1 over x times f of x plus h over x divided
1479420	1482560	by x plus h over x minus 1.
1482560	1486520	That's 1 over x times an expression that doesn't actually depend on x, just the ratio
1486520	1489680	y equals x plus h over x.
1489680	1496200	So as y goes to 1, the limit, if it exists, is just some constant c independent of x.
1496200	1500240	By declaring his interest in the particular function for which the constant c was equal
1500240	1506120	to 1, Napier introduced the natural logarithm.
1506120	1510960	So that's how Napier arrived at a natural logarithm, but what did he use it for?
1510960	1517200	His goal was to make a trig table with logarithms of sines or cosines, so that trig functions
1517200	1524080	could be multiplied quickly with seven-digit accuracy, more on why that was important later.
1524080	1531280	Napier's table had an entry for every minute of arc between 0 and 90 degrees, or 5400 entries.
1531280	1535120	There's that factor of 60 again that we inherited from the Babylonians.
1535120	1540840	Note that this is much more practical than making a table with 23 million entries.
1540840	1544560	Here's how we could make a table like Napier's.
1544560	1548560	First make tables of geometric progressions for reference values.
1548560	1553840	Start at 1 and multiply by 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th over and over, but stop at a round
1553840	1565480	value, say after 100 terms when you reach 1.0001495 and so on.
1565480	1569120	That's very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th.
1569120	1573200	We're not going to forget that it's not exactly 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, we'll account
1573200	1574720	for the difference later.
1574720	1579920	But for now start a second table with 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th as the common ratio and
1579920	1582000	go until another round number.
1582000	1591480	Napier went 50 steps to 1.0005001225196, again cutting off after the 14th place.
1591480	1596440	Now you have to make another table with common ratio 1 plus 1 over 2000, where now you have
1596440	1600280	to shift four places and multiply by five at each step.
1600280	1604840	This will take you in 20 steps to something close to 1.01 and from there it's a practical
1604840	1608200	232 steps to 10.
1608200	1613480	Then you can fill in your course 1.01 rate progression by making a table that starts
1613480	1620200	at the power of 1.01 and increases by the next 20 powers of 1.0005, which will give
1620200	1625000	you 4,640 reference values.
1625000	1630000	To compute logarithms of the entries in these tables, it suffices since they're in geometric
1630000	1634040	progression to get the logarithms of the first two terms since the logarithms will
1634040	1636800	be an arithmetic progression.
1636800	1643160	To compute the natural logarithm of the first progression, 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th,
1643160	1648280	Napier needed another ingredient, a key inequality that allows you to approximate the logarithm.
1648280	1653940	In one form this inequality looks like log x is less than x minus 1 and greater than
1653940	1655960	x minus 1 over x.
1655960	1660820	Now I already proved this inequality in a slightly disguised form in method 5 of the
1660820	1665280	previous episode, but here's another proof that Napier would have recognized.
1665280	1672360	The graph of his function log x lies below x minus 1 and above x minus 1 over x since
1672360	1679040	all three functions are 0 at 1 and their derivatives are 1, 1 over x, and 1 over x squared, so
1679040	1683020	it's clear which ones grow faster, though to make this rigorous you might invoke the
1683020	1684800	mean value theorem.
1684800	1689200	A second version of this inequality comes from setting x equals a over b with a greater
1689200	1695760	than b, this can be written 1 over a is less than log a minus log b over a minus b is less
1695760	1697680	than 1 over b.
1697680	1703120	Of course these inequalities are only useful if x is close to 1 or if a is close to b.
1703120	1709480	With this inequality you get that log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th is between 1 over
1709480	1714560	10 to the 7th and 1 over 10 to the 7th plus 1, which led Napier to simply take an
1714560	1723160	intermediate value like the middle value point 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5.
1723160	1727000	Now you have the logs of all the values in the first reference table and you can use
1727000	1732160	the inequality to compare the log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th to the log of the last
1732160	1736640	entry in the first table, which is very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, so you get
1736640	1741560	an arithmetic progression of all the logs in the second table and you do the same for
1741560	1744160	all the other tables.
1744160	1749720	Now it's just a matter of taking an existing accurate trig table, finding the closest reference
1749720	1754720	values in the table to the sine value and approximating the logarithm with the inequality.
1754720	1760600	For example, here's how to find the log of sine of 48 degrees in 30 minutes.
1760600	1765320	Note that I interchanged the notation ln of x with log of x. Contemporary available
1765480	1771000	trig tables gave the sine as 0.7489557.
1771000	1776080	The closest power of 1.01 is 1.01 to the 202.
1776080	1780880	Note that we have to adjust by a factor of 10 to locate the value in our table.
1780880	1786640	Then you can go to the 200 second finer reference table and multiply by an additional 7 powers
1786640	1789200	of 1.0005.
1789200	1794880	Now use the inequality to get a small range, approximate by the middle value, and subtract
1794880	1800840	the log of 10, which is the final value in the whole table of reference values.
1800840	1805440	Here I've tried to capture the spirit of what Napier was trying to do, but the details
1805440	1808720	of his particular construction were different in several ways.
1808720	1812560	He used a decreasing geometric progression rather than an increasing one.
1812560	1818000	He took 10 to the 7th to be the radius of the circle and considered the sines as lengths
1818000	1823560	working downwards with a logarithm set to 0 at 10 to the 7th, so in terms of our modern
1823600	1829800	natural logarithm, Napier's function was Napier log of x equals 10 to the 7th log of
1829800	1831840	10 to the 7th over x.
1831840	1837000	Also, his analysis was based on the differential equation of exponential decay for the values
1837000	1842320	as the indices progressed arithmetically, just like Newton's discussion of drag force.
1842320	1846600	I'll include references in the description if you want a fuller picture of Napier's actual
1846600	1847680	process.
1847680	1851600	Here, by the way, is a page from his table.
1851640	1856480	Napier's table of logarithms was published in 1614 and was immediately well received.
1856480	1860360	Kepler might not have been able to devise his laws of planetary motion without Napier's
1860360	1863160	tables and their subsequent improvements.
1863160	1867040	Napier was prevailed upon by Henry Briggs to make new tables with the logarithm to
1867040	1872320	base 10 to be of more practical use, so although Napier had given a construction of the natural
1872320	1876960	logarithm, the details obscured the role of the base E.
1876960	1881320	In a sense, Christian Huygens isolated E when he computed several digits of its base
1881320	1887680	10 logarithm in the 1660s, but a full description of E, its connections to logarithms and continuously
1887680	1891680	compounded interest, had to wait until Euler.
1891680	1896880	Napier died in 1617 and the details of how he constructed his logarithms were published
1896880	1899680	posthumously in 1619.
1899680	1906080	Incredibly, it only took until 1622 for William Autrid to take Napier's tables and construct
1906080	1911320	the first slide rule, a ruler marked with a logarithmic scale and moving slide to read
1911320	1914240	off multiplied values by adding lengths.
1914240	1919920	This was the most widespread tool for numerical calculation until the personal electronic calculator,
1919920	1923440	and now hardly anyone knows what a slide rule even is.
1923440	1929040	Lastly, I want to address why Napier wanted to make a table of logs of trig functions
1929040	1930600	in the first place.
1930600	1933760	It has to do with using the spherical law of cosines.
1933760	1939640	The problems of astronomy and navigation require not plain trigonometry, but spherical trigonometry.
1939640	1943720	Spherical triangles are formed by the arcs of three great circles and have interior angles
1943720	1948920	marked with capital letters and side lengths themselves angles subtended by the arcs given
1948920	1950800	by lowercase letters.
1950800	1955920	In the 16th century, the spherical law of cosines was better known than the planar law
1955920	1957360	of cosines.
1957360	1962720	This law and another version for angles instead of arcs involved multiplying signs and cosines,
1962720	1964560	hence the need for the table.
1964560	1968440	These formulas were crucial for navigation by the positions of the stars, including telling
1968440	1973160	the time or longitude by the hour angle and to track the motion of the planets.
1973160	1977280	Maybe I'll discuss this in a future episode.
