1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hey everyone, it's time for more tricky parts of calculus.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,160
This episode is about the history of the functions e to the x and log x.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,680
In the last episode, I introduced the exponential function and the logarithm and gave the best

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,400
ways to rigorously establish their properties.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,760
There was a lot of great math in that episode, check it out if you haven't seen it, but

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
a lot of it was from Euler's treatment of these functions from 1748, and some of the

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,200
arguments were even from the 19th century.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,920
What I didn't discuss was how people came up with these functions in the first place.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,080
The short answer is that in the reverse of the way these functions are typically introduced

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,660
to students today, the natural logarithm preceded the standard exponential function.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,840
We can date the natural logarithm precisely to 1614 in the modern era when it was introduced

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
by a Scotsman named John Napier.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,640
I want to explain what Napier was trying to do and how he worked out the properties of

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,720
the logarithm, but I also want to discuss how people might have developed the theory

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,040
of these functions and see if history can tell us why this theory was developed when

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,480
it was and not at some other time.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,640
It's really a fascinating story.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,880
So I'll start with this puzzling observation.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,960
Trigonometry is very old, dating back to the time when civilizations first needed enough

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,920
of a grasp of astronomy to work out a regular solar calendar about 4,000 years ago.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
But although the exponential function is newer, the most common application of exponentiation,

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,120
compound interest, is older than trigonometry.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,040
In fact, it's much, much older.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
There's evidence of primitive banks in the very first cities with agriculture going back

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,560
about 10,000 years to the period called the Neolithic.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,520
These were cities like Jericho, Tel Caramel, and Katal Hoiak.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,320
Here's a map of cities from this period.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,640
Banking predates money to times when banks lent and stored seeds, animals, and grain.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
Banking predates writing.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,480
In fact, there's almost certainly banking which provided a need for symbols for goods,

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,020
quantities, names, and dates.

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,720
We know that the earliest banks issued clay tokens representing quantities of stuff.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,640
We have examples of these tokens with writing from about 3,000 BC.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,160
Did these early banks charge compound interest on loans or give interest to depositors?

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,720
That's unclear, though in the kinds of circumstances we're familiar with, compound interest is needed

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,040
to provide the right incentives for all parties, so probably at some point they must have.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,920
The earliest written record of compound interest that we have is an incredible artifact.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,160
It's actually a cone made of clay with a cuneiform inscription.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,480
Today it's in the Yale Babylonian Collection, dating from about 2,400 BC.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,480
That makes it about 600 years older than the Plympton 322 tablet on the banner of my channel

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,080
that contains the earliest trig table.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,160
It's also our oldest record of a long war with border disputes and diplomatic alliances.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,280
It records the victory of Enmetena of Lagash over the rival city of Umma, two cities on

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,560
the Tigris River in what is today southern Iraq.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Apparently, Umma had taken from Lagash a valuable strip of fertile land some two generations

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
before.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,160
The army of Lagash killed the leader of Umma, and Enmetena demanded that his conquered foes

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,880
repay the value of the land they had taken with interest.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,960
The land produced one guru of barley in their units, so at the rather high rate of one-third

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,520
or 33 and a third percent interest compounded annually for 55 years and a few months, he

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,320
arrived at the round figure of 8.64 million guru.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Here you can see what the writing looks like.

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm fairly sure that here in the fourth column it says one guru in this box, and down in

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,380
this box these circles indicate the really big number of guru.

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,480
Some sources translate these circles as 40 times 60 squared, which is 144,000 instead

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,960
of 8.64 million, which is 40 times 60 cubed, but the larger figure is more consistent with

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
the timeline and known interest rate.

58
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,000
In any case, 8.64 million guru converted to our units is 128 billion bushels of barley

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
of almost 800 times what the United States produces in a year today.

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,440
Of course the debt was not repaid, as it might have taken them millions of years to do so.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,840
What happened was that Umma eventually rose up and conquered Lagash instead, killing Enmetena's

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,640
son, and the feud might have gone on and on, except all the Sumerian cities were conquered

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,760
by Sargon the Great of Akkad in the 2330s.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,080
Maybe what this example shows is that people did not like compound interest.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
Compound interest was the subject of endless political battles across time and civilizations.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Often it was outlawed.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,840
Inscriptions tell us that the Bronze Age states of Egypt, Babylon, and the Hittites

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,200
had state mandated insurance rates.

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,720
But apparently compound interest was bad for the little guy.

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,760
If you're wondering like I was, why didn't regular people benefit from compound interest

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,040
on their savings, the answer seems to be a combination that often banks served only

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,640
the very wealthy, and that at various times instead of offering interest, banks charged

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,600
depositors a fraction of their money just to hold it, possibly because the world was

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
so precarious.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,080
There's evidence of a 160th charge in Babylon.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,640
So compound interest only favored creditors.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,520
All the western monotheistic religions from the periods that followed had injunctions

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,920
against usury, usually defined as lending with interest, though sometimes interpreted

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,200
as lending at too high a rate.

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,360
And of course compound interest was especially evil, as it was thought of as interest on interest.

81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,480
Ancient Rome had an extensive banking and credit system with interest rates set by the

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,680
state, but it was simple interest, not compound interest, which was outlawed, and the rates

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,080
seemed to have been set to be easy to calculate, not based on economics.

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,160
Rome's collapse made banks disappear for hundreds of years, but banks sprang up again

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,560
in Italy as early as the time of the Crusades, and they usually found ways around the laws

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
against usury.

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,600
But compound interest was only made legal in England in 1545, and then revoked and then

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,480
allowed again, so that's why we find the first book on the mathematics of compound

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,880
interest, Richard Witt's Arithmetical Questions, appearing in 1613.

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,440
It contains tables very similar to the logarithmic tables I'm going to talk about by Napier and

91
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,280
Burgey from about the same time, completely independently.

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,600
But the issue of compounding more and more frequently wasn't asked, and only seems to

93
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,560
have been brought up in 1683 by Jacob Bernoulli, as mentioned in the previous episode.

94
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,000
As an aside, the ancient economy and ancient banking are huge and fascinating topics I

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,480
really would like to know more about as a mathematician.

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,440
There are so many problems people in the past had to solve that we solved with math, so

97
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,960
I wonder if they knew more math than we'd give them credit for, or if they had some

98
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,920
completely different way of doing business.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,200
How did they price insurance?

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,320
Did they keep statistics?

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
That sort of thing.

102
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,480
I'd love if anyone can point me in the right direction.

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,720
So I think it's also worth noting, exponential growth is part of the cultural lexicon today,

104
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,640
but it certainly wasn't in history.

105
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,120
Some of our best examples of exponential growth, like population growth, or growth in GDP,

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,000
or progress in technology, exemplified by something like Moore's Law, which observed

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,080
that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit tended to double about every two years.

108
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Probably were not features of human society prior to the Industrial Revolution.

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,400
Here's a graph of the human population over time.

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,160
The average rate of growth from 10,000 BC to 1700 was 0.04 percent, an imperceptible

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,280
rate even if they had kept records, which they did not.

112
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,200
I suspect that, to the extent anyone thought about it, life appeared more cyclical than

113
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
progressive.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,080
There were periods of growth and periods of stagnation and death.

115
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,160
This attitude was explicit in the writings of ancient Egypt.

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,440
By the way, the population is not growing exponentially now.

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Growth has actually slowed to being approximately linear, albeit with large slope.

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,200
Of course, also no one observed the growth of bacteria until the invention of the microscope

119
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,760
in the 1670s, and radioactive decay is even later.

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,680
What about physical phenomena involving exponentials, like the phenomenon of terminal velocity,

121
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,440
whereby a falling object encountering air resistance proportional to its velocity converges

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,960
exponentially to a limiting speed?

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,600
Both the mathematics and the experimental apparatus to observe such a phenomenon were

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,400
out of reach at the time of Napier's discovery.

125
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Galileo at that time was just realizing that falling objects covered a distance growing

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,760
quadratically in time, which he confirmed by setting flags along a track at square intervals,

127
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
and as a ball rolled down, it made a steady rhythm of ticks.

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
With the parabola for the basic model for the path of projectiles, eventually people

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,240
observed that cannons, that is, once the cannons were powerful enough for drag to be significant,

130
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,520
did not shoot as far as predicted, which required a theory of drag.

131
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Newton considered the equation of an object whose motion is resisted by a drag force proportional

132
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
to its velocity in the Principia, published in 1687.

133
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,400
At the start of book two, he correctly derives the geometric decay and gives an account of

134
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
terminal velocity.

135
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,260
Here's an even simpler equation of drag without the constant force of gravity, x double dot

136
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,680
equals minus kx dot, or v dot equals minus kv.

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Today we would solve this differential equation using the fundamental theorem of calculus

138
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,560
and our knowledge of the logarithm and exponential.

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
Newton's account is very different.

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,320
In his view, the equation v dot equals minus kv means that in each of any number of very

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,560
small equal increments of time, the change in velocity is proportional to the instantaneous

142
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,600
velocity.

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,360
Since you can show that if a sequence of values a, b, c, d is in constant proportion to their

144
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,280
differences, they are proportional to each other, the velocity must obey a geometric

145
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,600
progression in equal intervals of time.

146
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,640
This is actually the same argument that Napier gave 70 years earlier when introducing the

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
logarithm.

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,320
But at no point does Newton use terminology or notation for the exponential or the logarithm.

149
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,320
He does mention how the velocity and time are related to the lengths on the x-axis and

150
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,560
areas under the graph of a hyperbola defined by those lengths, as discovered by St. Vincent

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,000
in the 1640s, more on him later.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,080
In 1701, Newton posited a similar equation in connection with his law of cooling.

153
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,840
So these investigations would have led to the exponential, but they required the development

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,280
of calculus to be further along, and it's worth noting something that the ancients observed

155
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,920
that the motion of the stars was more regular and perfectly circular than anything observed

156
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,400
on Earth, hence the greater attention to and progress in astronomy before the advent of

157
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,080
Newton's laws, though that's not how physics is taught today.

158
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,040
There's another field of investigation that might have led to the exponential in the 16th

159
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,240
century, gambling.

160
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,880
Gambling was always around, but it received a major boon from the ability to manufacture

161
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,480
more regular dice and the invention of the printing press for playing cards.

162
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,880
Many of the top mathematicians of the early modern period were gamblers, Cardano, Fermat,

163
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Pascal, Demouave.

164
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,320
Here's a popular problem in gambling circles from the 1500s or even earlier.

165
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,480
One bets his friend 100 duckets that he will throw aces, or snake eyes, on two dice in

166
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,020
some number of attempts.

167
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,760
What number of attempts makes this a fair bet?

168
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,760
If P is the chance of rolling two ones, one in 36, and the chance of failure is Q equals

169
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,480
one minus P equals 35 over 36, then people realize that the fair number of tries n was

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,280
when Q to the n equals one half, or as close to it as one could get with a whole number

171
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
n.

172
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,480
Today we'd throw into a calculator n equals minus log 2 over log Q, but they didn't have

173
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
calculators or logs yet.

174
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,920
People did compute tables and use some laws of exponents to approximate the right number

175
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,800
of tries.

176
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Here the thrower has the advantage for the first time at 25 tries.

177
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,000
Here's a way to approximate the right number more easily.

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Set P over Q equals one over R, so the equation we have to solve is Q to the minus n, which

179
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,520
is one plus one over R to the n equals two.

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,600
Now suppose we approximate the expression involving R and n by looking in the limit as

181
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,920
P goes to zero, so R goes to infinity and n goes to infinity so that the ratio n over

182
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,720
R is fixed to be some value, say m.

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Then by carefully examining the limit of the binomial coefficients, you get the power series

184
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,540
we recognize as the exponential, the sum of m to the k over k factorial.

185
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,300
If this analysis had been done by Cardano, it might have been the starting point for

186
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,380
the exponential, but instead it waited until Du Moivre in 1711, who referred to this result

187
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,300
as the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is m, because logarithms have been around almost

188
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,740
100 years, but it was before Euler's work on the exponential function.

189
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:16,980
In any case, you get the solution by taking hyperbolic logarithms m equals log 2 or n equals

190
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,740
log 2 times Q over P, which is about 24.3 in this case, which is good enough to find

191
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,820
the right number of tries.

192
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,420
What about how many tries before it's a fair bet to throw snake eyes twice or three times?

193
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:37,620
For C successes, you can set the failure probability that of getting 0, 1, 2, or up to C minus

194
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,260
1 successes to one-half.

195
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,980
Again you can take limits to get a transcendental equation for m involving the exponential function

196
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,640
and the truncation of its power series.

197
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,340
This was also done by Du Moivre in the same work, essentially finding that the limit of

198
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,340
the binomial distribution when the success rate goes to 0, but the tries increase so

199
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,060
that np over q is constant, is what we call the Poisson distribution.

200
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,580
This result is named for Poisson, who would not even be born for another 70 years.

201
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,300
That's the first appearance of exponentials in probability.

202
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,900
Du Moivre also established the convergence of the binomial in the case of trials going

203
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,980
to infinity with fixed success rate to the normal distribution e to the minus x squared,

204
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,560
maybe a later episode on this.

205
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,860
Also exponentials come up if you analyze the so-called martingale betting strategy.

206
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,940
I'll link below to a great recent number file video on this, but it seems this strategy

207
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,180
was only discussed at the end of the 18th century.

208
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,500
So here's another particularly pressing problem from the 1500s that really required calculus

209
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,660
and logarithms.

210
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,260
Petrus' voyage began an era of sailing across oceans.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,700
It might be shocking to realize that nearly all voyages up to that point were made not

212
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,340
far out of sight of land, even when traveling in the Mediterranean.

213
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,920
The reason is it's hard to know where you are, and especially so when the distance is

214
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,460
so far that the curvature of the earth makes a big difference.

215
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,860
The mathematician Petrus Nonius was the first to point out in the 1530s that if you travel

216
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,480
in a ship at a constant cardinal direction, or room line, it won't follow a great circle,

217
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,960
but it will make a constant angle with each meridian, resulting in a spiral he called

218
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
the loxodrome.

219
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,200
An analytical expression for the loxodrome was beyond the mathematics of the time, but

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,580
that didn't stop Mercator from practically dealing with the problem in the 1560s by projecting

221
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,160
the sphere onto a cylinder from its center, a transformation that takes loxodromes to

222
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,720
straight lines, and then by uncurling the cylinder and cutting off at extreme latitudes,

223
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,360
you get his famous map, which is still the most popular way to draw a world map today.

224
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,480
The key mathematical question is, if you travel in a given distance along a room line, starting

225
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,600
from some latitude and longitude, what will be your final latitude and longitude?

226
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,520
For short distances, the change in latitude is just the distance times cosine alpha, where

227
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
alpha is the cardinal direction.

228
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,920
The change in longitude is more difficult because each circle of latitude has circumference

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,420
that of the equator multiplied by the cosine of the latitude, so the same distance east

230
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,240
or west will cover more degrees of longitude the farther from the equator.

231
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
This non-constancy makes finding the change in longitude difficult, that's the problem

232
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,160
of meridional parts.

233
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,280
The determination of the change in longitude ultimately requires an integration of the

234
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,840
secant of the latitude phi.

235
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,240
This is one of these elementary but difficult integrals requiring a very clever substitution

236
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,760
to see that it's an area under hyperbola with anti-derivative log of tangent of phi

237
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,680
over 2 plus pi over 4.

238
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,280
It's really remarkable that in an era before calculus, the mathematician Edward Wright

239
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:56,200
in 1599 published certain errors in navigation containing tables for calculating the meridional

240
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:02,280
parts made by taking what we today call Riemann sums of secants.

241
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,360
It was only noticed in 1645 that Wright's table was the same as a table of logs of tangents

242
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,720
obtained from Napier's work, but it was a complete mystery why.

243
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,280
James Gregory was finally able to compute the integral of the secant analytically in

244
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,280
1668 by a clever substitution and making use of the then available knowledge of the integral

245
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,360
of the hyperbola 1 over x.

246
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,120
In the era before Newton, Fermat had been able to work out in the 1630s formulas for

247
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,200
the areas under all power law curves except x to the minus 1, which defeated him.

248
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,280
It fell to Grégoire de Saint Vincent in 1647 to show that the area under the hyperbola

249
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,840
from A to AR is the same as the area from AR to AR squared, essentially by the technique

250
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,200
that I described in method 5 of the previous episode.

251
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,600
That implies that if you take A of x to be the area under the curve from 1 to x, then

252
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:09,080
A satisfies the multiplicative additive property A of x, y equals A of x plus A of y.

253
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,320
Saint Vincent's student, DeSerasa, who must have been familiar with Napier's logarithm,

254
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,360
pointed out that the function A was therefore Napier's logarithm up to a multiplicative

255
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,480
constant.

256
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,920
It was clear numerically that it was the same as the improved version of Napier's

257
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,120
logarithm, which was 0 at 1 and had derivative 1 over x, which gave a strong indication of

258
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,080
the yet unproved fundamental theorem of calculus.

259
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
Saint Vincent might have received more credit for such an important discovery had he not

260
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
in the same book published a construction of the squaring of the circle by ruler and compass,

261
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,200
of course incorrect.

262
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,680
So those are all the directions which could have led people to the exponential function

263
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,840
in the logarithm, but now let's discuss how it actually happened.

264
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,920
John Napier did not set out to define a new function, but to provide astronomers and

265
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,520
navigators with a useful table to calculate with 7 decimal digits of accuracy.

266
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,920
It's hard to imagine, but back then there were no calculators, and when in the 1500s

267
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,280
people wanted to do calculations quickly, they relied on lookups to extensive tables.

268
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,400
Remember that multiplication is computationally harder than addition.

269
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
Consider this method of multiplying two numbers.

270
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,560
Use the identity AB equals one-fourth A plus B squared minus one-fourth A minus B squared

271
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,280
To multiply A times B then, just look up the values at A plus B and A minus B in a table

272
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,880
that you've made of values of one-fourth X squared.

273
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,400
This method goes back once again to the Babylonians, and even these numbers were once called tables

274
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
of logarithms.

275
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,600
Alternately, because astronomers and engineers made frequent reference to trig tables, see

276
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
my episode 4, they could use sines and cosines for quick arithmetic.

277
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,960
Using the angle sum identities and shifting terms around gives, for example, sine A times

278
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,440
sine B equals one-half cosine A minus B minus one-half cosine A plus B.

279
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,640
To multiply, for example, 0.68 by 0.43, find the angles in the first quadrant corresponding

280
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,640
to these sine values in the table, and then subtract the relevant cosines.

281
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,000
Using the angle sum identities like this to multiply is called prosthephoresis, and basically

282
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
nobody does it anymore.

283
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,340
By about 1600, the mathematician Jost Berge came upon the idea of making a more versatile

284
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,040
table like this.

285
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,080
Suppose you want to do arithmetic with four digits of accuracy.

286
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,000
Berge began with the number 10,000, or 10 to the fourth, and then at each step he shifts

287
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,080
the number he has over four places and adds it to get the next number and repeats over

288
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,880
and over, keeping only an extra four places, you can think about why.

289
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,440
Suppose he continued painstakingly until he reached the next power of 10 after 23,027

290
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
steps.

291
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm going to make a modern adjustment and move the decimal place over so that the table

292
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,640
begins at one and not 10 to the fourth.

293
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,560
This table is a geometric progression by the factor one plus one over 10 to the fourth,

294
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,280
same as a table of compound interest if the interest rate were 0.01%.

295
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,440
Actually, just to get a feel for this process, I attempted to make my own geometric progression

296
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,960
table with a much more manageable rate of 1.01%, by shifting by two places and adding

297
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,560
over and over, I made it to about 2.01 in 70 steps, which is correct, which is where

298
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
I stopped.

299
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,080
Actually, I found that I had a typo at step nine, which makes all the later digits incorrect,

300
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
but it's still very close.

301
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,080
Getting to 10 would just require a bit more than triple the time and a bit more care than

302
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,320
I put into it.

303
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,720
Getting back to Berge's four-digit table, here's how to use it.

304
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,440
If you want to find, say, the cubed root of 3.6, you find the index of the entry closest

305
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:05,280
to 3.6, which is 12,810, and the entry at 4,270 or one-third of 12,810 is very close

306
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
to the root.

307
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,800
If you want the cube root of 36,000, you have to adjust for powers of 10.

308
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,520
36,000 is 3.6 times 10 to the fourth.

309
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,080
You can get 10 to the fourth-thirds as 10 times 10 to the one-third, so you take one-third

310
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:31,720
of 23,027, add it to 4,270, that's between 11,945 and 11,946, giving 3.3017, so 33.017

311
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,360
cubed is about 36,000.

312
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,880
I give this example to clarify the exposition in Otto Toplitz's The Calculus, A Genetic

313
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Approach, a great book where I learned about a lot of Napier's work, but already for the

314
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,640
scientific work of the late 1500s, four places of accuracy wasn't enough, and a few people

315
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,040
like Berge and John Napier set out to make the analogous table with seven places of accuracy.

316
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,360
The trouble is that this takes a long time.

317
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,400
Taking powers of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the seventh, it will take over 23 million steps

318
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,280
to reach 10, so Napier was forced to take a step back and develop some theory.

319
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,240
What I'm going to do here is follow the essence of Napier's thinking, minus the particular

320
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,480
details of his version of the logarithm, which would confuse the issue.

321
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,400
First of all, he figured out that you could make tables based on different geometric progressions

322
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,360
of rates A and B, and then you could recover the index of a number in the base B if you

323
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,200
knew the index in base A and the number of indices alpha and beta to reach 10 in both

324
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,120
tables by the laws of exponents, so it didn't really matter what base was used.

325
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,680
Then if you're free to consider any base, the key property of the index, or step function,

326
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,960
is that it converts any geometric progression to an arithmetic one, that is, for any rho,

327
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,280
f of x, f of rho x, f of rho squared x, etc., all form an arithmetic progression, or f of

328
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,600
rho x equals f of x plus k, a constant depending only on rho, for any x.

329
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,360
But then f of rho equals f of 1 plus k, but f of 1 equals 0, since that's where we start

330
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:13,520
the table, so k of rho equals f of rho, and therefore, for any x and y, f of x, y equals

331
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
f of x plus f of y.

332
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,520
This again is the multiplicative additive property I mentioned in episode 5, in the first instance

333
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,120
in which it appeared historically.

334
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,720
If you compute the derivative of such a function, which is a notion Napier knew decades ahead

335
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,640
of his time, not by that name, but which he understood as a velocity, using modern notation,

336
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,420
the difference quotient limit is the limit of 1 over x times f of x plus h over x divided

337
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,560
by x plus h over x minus 1.

338
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,520
That's 1 over x times an expression that doesn't actually depend on x, just the ratio

339
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,680
y equals x plus h over x.

340
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,200
So as y goes to 1, the limit, if it exists, is just some constant c independent of x.

341
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,240
By declaring his interest in the particular function for which the constant c was equal

342
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,120
to 1, Napier introduced the natural logarithm.

343
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,960
So that's how Napier arrived at a natural logarithm, but what did he use it for?

344
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,200
His goal was to make a trig table with logarithms of sines or cosines, so that trig functions

345
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,080
could be multiplied quickly with seven-digit accuracy, more on why that was important later.

346
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,280
Napier's table had an entry for every minute of arc between 0 and 90 degrees, or 5400 entries.

347
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,120
There's that factor of 60 again that we inherited from the Babylonians.

348
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,840
Note that this is much more practical than making a table with 23 million entries.

349
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,560
Here's how we could make a table like Napier's.

350
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,560
First make tables of geometric progressions for reference values.

351
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,840
Start at 1 and multiply by 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th over and over, but stop at a round

352
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:05,480
value, say after 100 terms when you reach 1.0001495 and so on.

353
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,120
That's very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th.

354
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,200
We're not going to forget that it's not exactly 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, we'll account

355
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
for the difference later.

356
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,920
But for now start a second table with 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th as the common ratio and

357
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,000
go until another round number.

358
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,480
Napier went 50 steps to 1.0005001225196, again cutting off after the 14th place.

359
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,440
Now you have to make another table with common ratio 1 plus 1 over 2000, where now you have

360
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,280
to shift four places and multiply by five at each step.

361
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,840
This will take you in 20 steps to something close to 1.01 and from there it's a practical

362
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,200
232 steps to 10.

363
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,480
Then you can fill in your course 1.01 rate progression by making a table that starts

364
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,200
at the power of 1.01 and increases by the next 20 powers of 1.0005, which will give

365
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,000
you 4,640 reference values.

366
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
To compute logarithms of the entries in these tables, it suffices since they're in geometric

367
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,040
progression to get the logarithms of the first two terms since the logarithms will

368
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,800
be an arithmetic progression.

369
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,160
To compute the natural logarithm of the first progression, 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th,

370
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,280
Napier needed another ingredient, a key inequality that allows you to approximate the logarithm.

371
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,940
In one form this inequality looks like log x is less than x minus 1 and greater than

372
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,960
x minus 1 over x.

373
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,820
Now I already proved this inequality in a slightly disguised form in method 5 of the

374
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,280
previous episode, but here's another proof that Napier would have recognized.

375
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,360
The graph of his function log x lies below x minus 1 and above x minus 1 over x since

376
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,040
all three functions are 0 at 1 and their derivatives are 1, 1 over x, and 1 over x squared, so

377
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,020
it's clear which ones grow faster, though to make this rigorous you might invoke the

378
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,800
mean value theorem.

379
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,200
A second version of this inequality comes from setting x equals a over b with a greater

380
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,760
than b, this can be written 1 over a is less than log a minus log b over a minus b is less

381
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,680
than 1 over b.

382
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,120
Of course these inequalities are only useful if x is close to 1 or if a is close to b.

383
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,480
With this inequality you get that log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th is between 1 over

384
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,560
10 to the 7th and 1 over 10 to the 7th plus 1, which led Napier to simply take an

385
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:43,160
intermediate value like the middle value point 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5.

386
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,000
Now you have the logs of all the values in the first reference table and you can use

387
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,160
the inequality to compare the log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th to the log of the last

388
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,640
entry in the first table, which is very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, so you get

389
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,560
an arithmetic progression of all the logs in the second table and you do the same for

390
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,160
all the other tables.

391
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Now it's just a matter of taking an existing accurate trig table, finding the closest reference

392
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,720
values in the table to the sine value and approximating the logarithm with the inequality.

393
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,600
For example, here's how to find the log of sine of 48 degrees in 30 minutes.

394
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,320
Note that I interchanged the notation ln of x with log of x. Contemporary available

395
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,000
trig tables gave the sine as 0.7489557.

396
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,080
The closest power of 1.01 is 1.01 to the 202.

397
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,880
Note that we have to adjust by a factor of 10 to locate the value in our table.

398
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,640
Then you can go to the 200 second finer reference table and multiply by an additional 7 powers

399
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
of 1.0005.

400
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,880
Now use the inequality to get a small range, approximate by the middle value, and subtract

401
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,840
the log of 10, which is the final value in the whole table of reference values.

402
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,440
Here I've tried to capture the spirit of what Napier was trying to do, but the details

403
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,720
of his particular construction were different in several ways.

404
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,560
He used a decreasing geometric progression rather than an increasing one.

405
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,000
He took 10 to the 7th to be the radius of the circle and considered the sines as lengths

406
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,560
working downwards with a logarithm set to 0 at 10 to the 7th, so in terms of our modern

407
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,800
natural logarithm, Napier's function was Napier log of x equals 10 to the 7th log of

408
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,840
10 to the 7th over x.

409
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,000
Also, his analysis was based on the differential equation of exponential decay for the values

410
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,320
as the indices progressed arithmetically, just like Newton's discussion of drag force.

411
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,600
I'll include references in the description if you want a fuller picture of Napier's actual

412
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,680
process.

413
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,600
Here, by the way, is a page from his table.

414
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Napier's table of logarithms was published in 1614 and was immediately well received.

415
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,360
Kepler might not have been able to devise his laws of planetary motion without Napier's

416
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
tables and their subsequent improvements.

417
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,040
Napier was prevailed upon by Henry Briggs to make new tables with the logarithm to

418
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,320
base 10 to be of more practical use, so although Napier had given a construction of the natural

419
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,960
logarithm, the details obscured the role of the base E.

420
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,320
In a sense, Christian Huygens isolated E when he computed several digits of its base

421
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,680
10 logarithm in the 1660s, but a full description of E, its connections to logarithms and continuously

422
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,680
compounded interest, had to wait until Euler.

423
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,880
Napier died in 1617 and the details of how he constructed his logarithms were published

424
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,680
posthumously in 1619.

425
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:46,080
Incredibly, it only took until 1622 for William Autrid to take Napier's tables and construct

426
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,320
the first slide rule, a ruler marked with a logarithmic scale and moving slide to read

427
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,240
off multiplied values by adding lengths.

428
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,920
This was the most widespread tool for numerical calculation until the personal electronic calculator,

429
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,440
and now hardly anyone knows what a slide rule even is.

430
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,040
Lastly, I want to address why Napier wanted to make a table of logs of trig functions

431
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,600
in the first place.

432
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,760
It has to do with using the spherical law of cosines.

433
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,640
The problems of astronomy and navigation require not plain trigonometry, but spherical trigonometry.

434
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,720
Spherical triangles are formed by the arcs of three great circles and have interior angles

435
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,920
marked with capital letters and side lengths themselves angles subtended by the arcs given

436
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,800
by lowercase letters.

437
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,920
In the 16th century, the spherical law of cosines was better known than the planar law

438
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,360
of cosines.

439
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,720
This law and another version for angles instead of arcs involved multiplying signs and cosines,

440
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,560
hence the need for the table.

441
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,440
These formulas were crucial for navigation by the positions of the stars, including telling

442
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,160
the time or longitude by the hour angle and to track the motion of the planets.

443
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,280
Maybe I'll discuss this in a future episode.

444
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,640
