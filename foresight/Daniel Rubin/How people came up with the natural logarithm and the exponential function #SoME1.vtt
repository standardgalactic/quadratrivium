00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Hey everyone, it's time for more tricky parts of calculus.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.160
This episode is about the history of the functions e to the x and log x.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.680
In the last episode, I introduced the exponential function and the logarithm and gave the best

00:13.680 --> 00:16.400
ways to rigorously establish their properties.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.760
There was a lot of great math in that episode, check it out if you haven't seen it, but

00:19.760 --> 00:24.240
a lot of it was from Euler's treatment of these functions from 1748, and some of the

00:24.240 --> 00:26.200
arguments were even from the 19th century.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.920
What I didn't discuss was how people came up with these functions in the first place.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.080
The short answer is that in the reverse of the way these functions are typically introduced

00:36.080 --> 00:40.660
to students today, the natural logarithm preceded the standard exponential function.

00:40.660 --> 00:45.840
We can date the natural logarithm precisely to 1614 in the modern era when it was introduced

00:45.840 --> 00:48.440
by a Scotsman named John Napier.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.640
I want to explain what Napier was trying to do and how he worked out the properties of

00:52.640 --> 00:56.720
the logarithm, but I also want to discuss how people might have developed the theory

00:56.720 --> 01:01.040
of these functions and see if history can tell us why this theory was developed when

01:01.040 --> 01:03.480
it was and not at some other time.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.640
It's really a fascinating story.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.880
So I'll start with this puzzling observation.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.960
Trigonometry is very old, dating back to the time when civilizations first needed enough

01:13.960 --> 01:19.920
of a grasp of astronomy to work out a regular solar calendar about 4,000 years ago.

01:19.920 --> 01:25.200
But although the exponential function is newer, the most common application of exponentiation,

01:25.200 --> 01:28.120
compound interest, is older than trigonometry.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.040
In fact, it's much, much older.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.360
There's evidence of primitive banks in the very first cities with agriculture going back

01:35.360 --> 01:39.560
about 10,000 years to the period called the Neolithic.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.520
These were cities like Jericho, Tel Caramel, and Katal Hoiak.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.320
Here's a map of cities from this period.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.640
Banking predates money to times when banks lent and stored seeds, animals, and grain.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.320
Banking predates writing.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.480
In fact, there's almost certainly banking which provided a need for symbols for goods,

01:58.480 --> 02:00.020
quantities, names, and dates.

02:00.020 --> 02:04.720
We know that the earliest banks issued clay tokens representing quantities of stuff.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.640
We have examples of these tokens with writing from about 3,000 BC.

02:09.640 --> 02:14.160
Did these early banks charge compound interest on loans or give interest to depositors?

02:14.160 --> 02:18.720
That's unclear, though in the kinds of circumstances we're familiar with, compound interest is needed

02:18.720 --> 02:25.040
to provide the right incentives for all parties, so probably at some point they must have.

02:25.040 --> 02:30.920
The earliest written record of compound interest that we have is an incredible artifact.

02:30.920 --> 02:35.160
It's actually a cone made of clay with a cuneiform inscription.

02:35.160 --> 02:40.480
Today it's in the Yale Babylonian Collection, dating from about 2,400 BC.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.480
That makes it about 600 years older than the Plympton 322 tablet on the banner of my channel

02:45.480 --> 02:48.080
that contains the earliest trig table.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.160
It's also our oldest record of a long war with border disputes and diplomatic alliances.

02:53.160 --> 02:59.280
It records the victory of Enmetena of Lagash over the rival city of Umma, two cities on

02:59.280 --> 03:02.560
the Tigris River in what is today southern Iraq.

03:02.560 --> 03:08.400
Apparently, Umma had taken from Lagash a valuable strip of fertile land some two generations

03:08.400 --> 03:09.400
before.

03:09.400 --> 03:15.160
The army of Lagash killed the leader of Umma, and Enmetena demanded that his conquered foes

03:15.160 --> 03:19.880
repay the value of the land they had taken with interest.

03:19.880 --> 03:25.960
The land produced one guru of barley in their units, so at the rather high rate of one-third

03:25.960 --> 03:32.520
or 33 and a third percent interest compounded annually for 55 years and a few months, he

03:32.520 --> 03:38.320
arrived at the round figure of 8.64 million guru.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.960
Here you can see what the writing looks like.

03:39.960 --> 03:45.360
I'm fairly sure that here in the fourth column it says one guru in this box, and down in

03:45.360 --> 03:50.380
this box these circles indicate the really big number of guru.

03:50.380 --> 03:55.480
Some sources translate these circles as 40 times 60 squared, which is 144,000 instead

03:55.480 --> 04:00.960
of 8.64 million, which is 40 times 60 cubed, but the larger figure is more consistent with

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
the timeline and known interest rate.

04:03.520 --> 04:10.000
In any case, 8.64 million guru converted to our units is 128 billion bushels of barley

04:10.000 --> 04:15.280
of almost 800 times what the United States produces in a year today.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.440
Of course the debt was not repaid, as it might have taken them millions of years to do so.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.840
What happened was that Umma eventually rose up and conquered Lagash instead, killing Enmetena's

04:26.840 --> 04:31.640
son, and the feud might have gone on and on, except all the Sumerian cities were conquered

04:31.640 --> 04:35.760
by Sargon the Great of Akkad in the 2330s.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.080
Maybe what this example shows is that people did not like compound interest.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.560
Compound interest was the subject of endless political battles across time and civilizations.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.360
Often it was outlawed.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.840
Inscriptions tell us that the Bronze Age states of Egypt, Babylon, and the Hittites

04:49.840 --> 04:52.200
had state mandated insurance rates.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.720
But apparently compound interest was bad for the little guy.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.760
If you're wondering like I was, why didn't regular people benefit from compound interest

04:59.760 --> 05:04.040
on their savings, the answer seems to be a combination that often banks served only

05:04.040 --> 05:08.640
the very wealthy, and that at various times instead of offering interest, banks charged

05:08.640 --> 05:12.600
depositors a fraction of their money just to hold it, possibly because the world was

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
so precarious.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.080
There's evidence of a 160th charge in Babylon.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.640
So compound interest only favored creditors.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.520
All the western monotheistic religions from the periods that followed had injunctions

05:24.520 --> 05:28.920
against usury, usually defined as lending with interest, though sometimes interpreted

05:28.920 --> 05:31.200
as lending at too high a rate.

05:31.200 --> 05:37.360
And of course compound interest was especially evil, as it was thought of as interest on interest.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.480
Ancient Rome had an extensive banking and credit system with interest rates set by the

05:41.480 --> 05:45.680
state, but it was simple interest, not compound interest, which was outlawed, and the rates

05:45.680 --> 05:50.080
seemed to have been set to be easy to calculate, not based on economics.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.160
Rome's collapse made banks disappear for hundreds of years, but banks sprang up again

05:54.160 --> 05:58.560
in Italy as early as the time of the Crusades, and they usually found ways around the laws

05:58.560 --> 05:59.920
against usury.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.600
But compound interest was only made legal in England in 1545, and then revoked and then

06:04.600 --> 06:08.480
allowed again, so that's why we find the first book on the mathematics of compound

06:08.480 --> 06:13.880
interest, Richard Witt's Arithmetical Questions, appearing in 1613.

06:13.880 --> 06:18.440
It contains tables very similar to the logarithmic tables I'm going to talk about by Napier and

06:18.440 --> 06:22.280
Burgey from about the same time, completely independently.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.600
But the issue of compounding more and more frequently wasn't asked, and only seems to

06:25.640 --> 06:32.560
have been brought up in 1683 by Jacob Bernoulli, as mentioned in the previous episode.

06:32.560 --> 06:37.000
As an aside, the ancient economy and ancient banking are huge and fascinating topics I

06:37.000 --> 06:39.480
really would like to know more about as a mathematician.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.440
There are so many problems people in the past had to solve that we solved with math, so

06:43.440 --> 06:46.960
I wonder if they knew more math than we'd give them credit for, or if they had some

06:46.960 --> 06:48.920
completely different way of doing business.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.200
How did they price insurance?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.320
Did they keep statistics?

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
That sort of thing.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.480
I'd love if anyone can point me in the right direction.

06:56.480 --> 07:01.720
So I think it's also worth noting, exponential growth is part of the cultural lexicon today,

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
but it certainly wasn't in history.

07:03.640 --> 07:09.120
Some of our best examples of exponential growth, like population growth, or growth in GDP,

07:09.120 --> 07:13.000
or progress in technology, exemplified by something like Moore's Law, which observed

07:13.000 --> 07:18.080
that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit tended to double about every two years.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.720
Probably were not features of human society prior to the Industrial Revolution.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.400
Here's a graph of the human population over time.

07:26.400 --> 07:33.160
The average rate of growth from 10,000 BC to 1700 was 0.04 percent, an imperceptible

07:33.160 --> 07:36.280
rate even if they had kept records, which they did not.

07:36.280 --> 07:42.200
I suspect that, to the extent anyone thought about it, life appeared more cyclical than

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
progressive.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.080
There were periods of growth and periods of stagnation and death.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.160
This attitude was explicit in the writings of ancient Egypt.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.440
By the way, the population is not growing exponentially now.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.440
Growth has actually slowed to being approximately linear, albeit with large slope.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.200
Of course, also no one observed the growth of bacteria until the invention of the microscope

08:04.200 --> 08:10.760
in the 1670s, and radioactive decay is even later.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.680
What about physical phenomena involving exponentials, like the phenomenon of terminal velocity,

08:15.680 --> 08:20.440
whereby a falling object encountering air resistance proportional to its velocity converges

08:20.440 --> 08:22.960
exponentially to a limiting speed?

08:22.960 --> 08:27.600
Both the mathematics and the experimental apparatus to observe such a phenomenon were

08:27.600 --> 08:31.400
out of reach at the time of Napier's discovery.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.200
Galileo at that time was just realizing that falling objects covered a distance growing

08:36.200 --> 08:41.760
quadratically in time, which he confirmed by setting flags along a track at square intervals,

08:41.760 --> 08:45.760
and as a ball rolled down, it made a steady rhythm of ticks.

08:45.760 --> 08:50.480
With the parabola for the basic model for the path of projectiles, eventually people

08:50.480 --> 08:56.240
observed that cannons, that is, once the cannons were powerful enough for drag to be significant,

08:56.240 --> 09:01.520
did not shoot as far as predicted, which required a theory of drag.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.320
Newton considered the equation of an object whose motion is resisted by a drag force proportional

09:06.320 --> 09:10.320
to its velocity in the Principia, published in 1687.

09:10.320 --> 09:15.400
At the start of book two, he correctly derives the geometric decay and gives an account of

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
terminal velocity.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.260
Here's an even simpler equation of drag without the constant force of gravity, x double dot

09:21.260 --> 09:26.680
equals minus kx dot, or v dot equals minus kv.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.480
Today we would solve this differential equation using the fundamental theorem of calculus

09:30.480 --> 09:33.560
and our knowledge of the logarithm and exponential.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.600
Newton's account is very different.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.320
In his view, the equation v dot equals minus kv means that in each of any number of very

09:41.320 --> 09:46.560
small equal increments of time, the change in velocity is proportional to the instantaneous

09:46.560 --> 09:48.600
velocity.

09:48.600 --> 09:54.360
Since you can show that if a sequence of values a, b, c, d is in constant proportion to their

09:54.360 --> 10:00.280
differences, they are proportional to each other, the velocity must obey a geometric

10:00.280 --> 10:03.600
progression in equal intervals of time.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.640
This is actually the same argument that Napier gave 70 years earlier when introducing the

10:08.640 --> 10:10.200
logarithm.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.320
But at no point does Newton use terminology or notation for the exponential or the logarithm.

10:15.320 --> 10:20.320
He does mention how the velocity and time are related to the lengths on the x-axis and

10:20.320 --> 10:25.560
areas under the graph of a hyperbola defined by those lengths, as discovered by St. Vincent

10:25.560 --> 10:29.000
in the 1640s, more on him later.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.080
In 1701, Newton posited a similar equation in connection with his law of cooling.

10:34.080 --> 10:38.840
So these investigations would have led to the exponential, but they required the development

10:38.840 --> 10:43.280
of calculus to be further along, and it's worth noting something that the ancients observed

10:43.280 --> 10:47.920
that the motion of the stars was more regular and perfectly circular than anything observed

10:47.920 --> 10:53.400
on Earth, hence the greater attention to and progress in astronomy before the advent of

10:53.400 --> 10:59.080
Newton's laws, though that's not how physics is taught today.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.040
There's another field of investigation that might have led to the exponential in the 16th

11:03.040 --> 11:05.240
century, gambling.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.880
Gambling was always around, but it received a major boon from the ability to manufacture

11:08.880 --> 11:13.480
more regular dice and the invention of the printing press for playing cards.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.880
Many of the top mathematicians of the early modern period were gamblers, Cardano, Fermat,

11:17.880 --> 11:18.880
Pascal, Demouave.

11:18.880 --> 11:23.320
Here's a popular problem in gambling circles from the 1500s or even earlier.

11:23.320 --> 11:29.480
One bets his friend 100 duckets that he will throw aces, or snake eyes, on two dice in

11:29.480 --> 11:31.020
some number of attempts.

11:31.020 --> 11:34.760
What number of attempts makes this a fair bet?

11:34.760 --> 11:39.760
If P is the chance of rolling two ones, one in 36, and the chance of failure is Q equals

11:39.760 --> 11:45.480
one minus P equals 35 over 36, then people realize that the fair number of tries n was

11:45.480 --> 11:50.280
when Q to the n equals one half, or as close to it as one could get with a whole number

11:50.280 --> 11:51.280
n.

11:51.280 --> 11:56.480
Today we'd throw into a calculator n equals minus log 2 over log Q, but they didn't have

11:56.480 --> 11:58.680
calculators or logs yet.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.920
People did compute tables and use some laws of exponents to approximate the right number

12:02.920 --> 12:04.800
of tries.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.400
Here the thrower has the advantage for the first time at 25 tries.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.000
Here's a way to approximate the right number more easily.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.560
Set P over Q equals one over R, so the equation we have to solve is Q to the minus n, which

12:19.560 --> 12:23.520
is one plus one over R to the n equals two.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.600
Now suppose we approximate the expression involving R and n by looking in the limit as

12:27.600 --> 12:32.920
P goes to zero, so R goes to infinity and n goes to infinity so that the ratio n over

12:32.920 --> 12:37.720
R is fixed to be some value, say m.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.560
Then by carefully examining the limit of the binomial coefficients, you get the power series

12:42.560 --> 12:48.540
we recognize as the exponential, the sum of m to the k over k factorial.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.300
If this analysis had been done by Cardano, it might have been the starting point for

12:52.300 --> 12:58.380
the exponential, but instead it waited until Du Moivre in 1711, who referred to this result

12:58.380 --> 13:04.300
as the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is m, because logarithms have been around almost

13:04.300 --> 13:08.740
100 years, but it was before Euler's work on the exponential function.

13:08.740 --> 13:16.980
In any case, you get the solution by taking hyperbolic logarithms m equals log 2 or n equals

13:16.980 --> 13:22.740
log 2 times Q over P, which is about 24.3 in this case, which is good enough to find

13:22.740 --> 13:24.820
the right number of tries.

13:24.820 --> 13:30.420
What about how many tries before it's a fair bet to throw snake eyes twice or three times?

13:30.420 --> 13:37.620
For C successes, you can set the failure probability that of getting 0, 1, 2, or up to C minus

13:37.620 --> 13:40.260
1 successes to one-half.

13:40.260 --> 13:44.980
Again you can take limits to get a transcendental equation for m involving the exponential function

13:44.980 --> 13:47.640
and the truncation of its power series.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.340
This was also done by Du Moivre in the same work, essentially finding that the limit of

13:51.340 --> 13:55.340
the binomial distribution when the success rate goes to 0, but the tries increase so

13:55.340 --> 14:00.060
that np over q is constant, is what we call the Poisson distribution.

14:00.060 --> 14:05.580
This result is named for Poisson, who would not even be born for another 70 years.

14:05.580 --> 14:09.300
That's the first appearance of exponentials in probability.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.900
Du Moivre also established the convergence of the binomial in the case of trials going

14:12.900 --> 14:17.980
to infinity with fixed success rate to the normal distribution e to the minus x squared,

14:17.980 --> 14:20.560
maybe a later episode on this.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.860
Also exponentials come up if you analyze the so-called martingale betting strategy.

14:24.860 --> 14:29.940
I'll link below to a great recent number file video on this, but it seems this strategy

14:29.940 --> 14:35.180
was only discussed at the end of the 18th century.

14:35.180 --> 14:40.500
So here's another particularly pressing problem from the 1500s that really required calculus

14:40.500 --> 14:42.660
and logarithms.

14:42.660 --> 14:46.260
Petrus' voyage began an era of sailing across oceans.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.700
It might be shocking to realize that nearly all voyages up to that point were made not

14:50.700 --> 14:54.340
far out of sight of land, even when traveling in the Mediterranean.

14:54.340 --> 14:57.920
The reason is it's hard to know where you are, and especially so when the distance is

14:57.920 --> 15:01.460
so far that the curvature of the earth makes a big difference.

15:01.460 --> 15:06.860
The mathematician Petrus Nonius was the first to point out in the 1530s that if you travel

15:06.860 --> 15:12.480
in a ship at a constant cardinal direction, or room line, it won't follow a great circle,

15:12.480 --> 15:16.960
but it will make a constant angle with each meridian, resulting in a spiral he called

15:16.960 --> 15:18.720
the loxodrome.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.200
An analytical expression for the loxodrome was beyond the mathematics of the time, but

15:23.200 --> 15:28.580
that didn't stop Mercator from practically dealing with the problem in the 1560s by projecting

15:28.580 --> 15:33.160
the sphere onto a cylinder from its center, a transformation that takes loxodromes to

15:33.160 --> 15:37.720
straight lines, and then by uncurling the cylinder and cutting off at extreme latitudes,

15:37.720 --> 15:43.360
you get his famous map, which is still the most popular way to draw a world map today.

15:43.360 --> 15:48.480
The key mathematical question is, if you travel in a given distance along a room line, starting

15:48.480 --> 15:53.600
from some latitude and longitude, what will be your final latitude and longitude?

15:53.600 --> 15:58.520
For short distances, the change in latitude is just the distance times cosine alpha, where

15:58.520 --> 16:00.440
alpha is the cardinal direction.

16:00.440 --> 16:05.920
The change in longitude is more difficult because each circle of latitude has circumference

16:06.120 --> 16:10.420
that of the equator multiplied by the cosine of the latitude, so the same distance east

16:10.420 --> 16:16.240
or west will cover more degrees of longitude the farther from the equator.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.800
This non-constancy makes finding the change in longitude difficult, that's the problem

16:20.800 --> 16:23.160
of meridional parts.

16:23.160 --> 16:27.280
The determination of the change in longitude ultimately requires an integration of the

16:27.280 --> 16:29.840
secant of the latitude phi.

16:29.840 --> 16:35.240
This is one of these elementary but difficult integrals requiring a very clever substitution

16:35.240 --> 16:41.760
to see that it's an area under hyperbola with anti-derivative log of tangent of phi

16:41.760 --> 16:44.680
over 2 plus pi over 4.

16:44.680 --> 16:49.280
It's really remarkable that in an era before calculus, the mathematician Edward Wright

16:49.280 --> 16:56.200
in 1599 published certain errors in navigation containing tables for calculating the meridional

16:56.200 --> 17:02.280
parts made by taking what we today call Riemann sums of secants.

17:02.320 --> 17:08.360
It was only noticed in 1645 that Wright's table was the same as a table of logs of tangents

17:08.360 --> 17:12.720
obtained from Napier's work, but it was a complete mystery why.

17:12.720 --> 17:17.280
James Gregory was finally able to compute the integral of the secant analytically in

17:17.280 --> 17:23.280
1668 by a clever substitution and making use of the then available knowledge of the integral

17:23.280 --> 17:26.360
of the hyperbola 1 over x.

17:26.360 --> 17:32.120
In the era before Newton, Fermat had been able to work out in the 1630s formulas for

17:32.120 --> 17:38.200
the areas under all power law curves except x to the minus 1, which defeated him.

17:38.200 --> 17:44.280
It fell to Grégoire de Saint Vincent in 1647 to show that the area under the hyperbola

17:44.280 --> 17:50.840
from A to AR is the same as the area from AR to AR squared, essentially by the technique

17:50.840 --> 17:55.200
that I described in method 5 of the previous episode.

17:55.200 --> 18:00.600
That implies that if you take A of x to be the area under the curve from 1 to x, then

18:00.600 --> 18:09.080
A satisfies the multiplicative additive property A of x, y equals A of x plus A of y.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.320
Saint Vincent's student, DeSerasa, who must have been familiar with Napier's logarithm,

18:14.320 --> 18:18.360
pointed out that the function A was therefore Napier's logarithm up to a multiplicative

18:18.360 --> 18:19.480
constant.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.920
It was clear numerically that it was the same as the improved version of Napier's

18:22.920 --> 18:28.120
logarithm, which was 0 at 1 and had derivative 1 over x, which gave a strong indication of

18:28.120 --> 18:32.080
the yet unproved fundamental theorem of calculus.

18:32.080 --> 18:36.000
Saint Vincent might have received more credit for such an important discovery had he not

18:36.000 --> 18:40.880
in the same book published a construction of the squaring of the circle by ruler and compass,

18:40.880 --> 18:44.200
of course incorrect.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.680
So those are all the directions which could have led people to the exponential function

18:48.680 --> 18:52.840
in the logarithm, but now let's discuss how it actually happened.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.920
John Napier did not set out to define a new function, but to provide astronomers and

18:56.920 --> 19:02.520
navigators with a useful table to calculate with 7 decimal digits of accuracy.

19:02.520 --> 19:06.920
It's hard to imagine, but back then there were no calculators, and when in the 1500s

19:06.920 --> 19:12.280
people wanted to do calculations quickly, they relied on lookups to extensive tables.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.400
Remember that multiplication is computationally harder than addition.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.320
Consider this method of multiplying two numbers.

19:18.320 --> 19:24.560
Use the identity AB equals one-fourth A plus B squared minus one-fourth A minus B squared

19:24.600 --> 19:30.280
To multiply A times B then, just look up the values at A plus B and A minus B in a table

19:30.280 --> 19:33.880
that you've made of values of one-fourth X squared.

19:33.880 --> 19:38.400
This method goes back once again to the Babylonians, and even these numbers were once called tables

19:38.400 --> 19:40.640
of logarithms.

19:40.640 --> 19:45.600
Alternately, because astronomers and engineers made frequent reference to trig tables, see

19:45.600 --> 19:50.600
my episode 4, they could use sines and cosines for quick arithmetic.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.960
Using the angle sum identities and shifting terms around gives, for example, sine A times

19:54.960 --> 20:00.440
sine B equals one-half cosine A minus B minus one-half cosine A plus B.

20:00.440 --> 20:06.640
To multiply, for example, 0.68 by 0.43, find the angles in the first quadrant corresponding

20:06.640 --> 20:11.640
to these sine values in the table, and then subtract the relevant cosines.

20:11.640 --> 20:18.000
Using the angle sum identities like this to multiply is called prosthephoresis, and basically

20:18.000 --> 20:20.160
nobody does it anymore.

20:20.160 --> 20:26.340
By about 1600, the mathematician Jost Berge came upon the idea of making a more versatile

20:26.340 --> 20:28.040
table like this.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.080
Suppose you want to do arithmetic with four digits of accuracy.

20:32.080 --> 20:38.000
Berge began with the number 10,000, or 10 to the fourth, and then at each step he shifts

20:38.000 --> 20:43.080
the number he has over four places and adds it to get the next number and repeats over

20:43.080 --> 20:47.880
and over, keeping only an extra four places, you can think about why.

20:47.880 --> 20:54.440
Suppose he continued painstakingly until he reached the next power of 10 after 23,027

20:54.440 --> 20:55.440
steps.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.800
I'm going to make a modern adjustment and move the decimal place over so that the table

20:59.800 --> 21:02.640
begins at one and not 10 to the fourth.

21:02.640 --> 21:08.560
This table is a geometric progression by the factor one plus one over 10 to the fourth,

21:08.560 --> 21:12.280
same as a table of compound interest if the interest rate were 0.01%.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.440
Actually, just to get a feel for this process, I attempted to make my own geometric progression

21:18.440 --> 21:24.960
table with a much more manageable rate of 1.01%, by shifting by two places and adding

21:24.960 --> 21:31.560
over and over, I made it to about 2.01 in 70 steps, which is correct, which is where

21:31.560 --> 21:32.560
I stopped.

21:32.560 --> 21:38.080
Actually, I found that I had a typo at step nine, which makes all the later digits incorrect,

21:38.080 --> 21:39.760
but it's still very close.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.080
Getting to 10 would just require a bit more than triple the time and a bit more care than

21:44.080 --> 21:46.320
I put into it.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.720
Getting back to Berge's four-digit table, here's how to use it.

21:49.720 --> 21:56.440
If you want to find, say, the cubed root of 3.6, you find the index of the entry closest

21:56.440 --> 22:05.280
to 3.6, which is 12,810, and the entry at 4,270 or one-third of 12,810 is very close

22:05.280 --> 22:06.280
to the root.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.800
If you want the cube root of 36,000, you have to adjust for powers of 10.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.520
36,000 is 3.6 times 10 to the fourth.

22:13.520 --> 22:18.080
You can get 10 to the fourth-thirds as 10 times 10 to the one-third, so you take one-third

22:18.080 --> 22:31.720
of 23,027, add it to 4,270, that's between 11,945 and 11,946, giving 3.3017, so 33.017

22:31.720 --> 22:34.360
cubed is about 36,000.

22:34.360 --> 22:39.880
I give this example to clarify the exposition in Otto Toplitz's The Calculus, A Genetic

22:39.880 --> 22:45.680
Approach, a great book where I learned about a lot of Napier's work, but already for the

22:45.680 --> 22:50.640
scientific work of the late 1500s, four places of accuracy wasn't enough, and a few people

22:50.640 --> 22:57.040
like Berge and John Napier set out to make the analogous table with seven places of accuracy.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.360
The trouble is that this takes a long time.

22:59.360 --> 23:04.400
Taking powers of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the seventh, it will take over 23 million steps

23:04.400 --> 23:09.280
to reach 10, so Napier was forced to take a step back and develop some theory.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.240
What I'm going to do here is follow the essence of Napier's thinking, minus the particular

23:13.240 --> 23:16.480
details of his version of the logarithm, which would confuse the issue.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.400
First of all, he figured out that you could make tables based on different geometric progressions

23:21.400 --> 23:26.360
of rates A and B, and then you could recover the index of a number in the base B if you

23:26.360 --> 23:31.200
knew the index in base A and the number of indices alpha and beta to reach 10 in both

23:31.200 --> 23:37.120
tables by the laws of exponents, so it didn't really matter what base was used.

23:37.120 --> 23:42.680
Then if you're free to consider any base, the key property of the index, or step function,

23:42.680 --> 23:47.960
is that it converts any geometric progression to an arithmetic one, that is, for any rho,

23:47.960 --> 23:55.280
f of x, f of rho x, f of rho squared x, etc., all form an arithmetic progression, or f of

23:55.280 --> 24:01.600
rho x equals f of x plus k, a constant depending only on rho, for any x.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.360
But then f of rho equals f of 1 plus k, but f of 1 equals 0, since that's where we start

24:06.360 --> 24:13.520
the table, so k of rho equals f of rho, and therefore, for any x and y, f of x, y equals

24:13.520 --> 24:15.600
f of x plus f of y.

24:15.600 --> 24:20.520
This again is the multiplicative additive property I mentioned in episode 5, in the first instance

24:20.520 --> 24:23.120
in which it appeared historically.

24:23.120 --> 24:27.720
If you compute the derivative of such a function, which is a notion Napier knew decades ahead

24:27.720 --> 24:32.640
of his time, not by that name, but which he understood as a velocity, using modern notation,

24:32.640 --> 24:39.420
the difference quotient limit is the limit of 1 over x times f of x plus h over x divided

24:39.420 --> 24:42.560
by x plus h over x minus 1.

24:42.560 --> 24:46.520
That's 1 over x times an expression that doesn't actually depend on x, just the ratio

24:46.520 --> 24:49.680
y equals x plus h over x.

24:49.680 --> 24:56.200
So as y goes to 1, the limit, if it exists, is just some constant c independent of x.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.240
By declaring his interest in the particular function for which the constant c was equal

25:00.240 --> 25:06.120
to 1, Napier introduced the natural logarithm.

25:06.120 --> 25:10.960
So that's how Napier arrived at a natural logarithm, but what did he use it for?

25:10.960 --> 25:17.200
His goal was to make a trig table with logarithms of sines or cosines, so that trig functions

25:17.200 --> 25:24.080
could be multiplied quickly with seven-digit accuracy, more on why that was important later.

25:24.080 --> 25:31.280
Napier's table had an entry for every minute of arc between 0 and 90 degrees, or 5400 entries.

25:31.280 --> 25:35.120
There's that factor of 60 again that we inherited from the Babylonians.

25:35.120 --> 25:40.840
Note that this is much more practical than making a table with 23 million entries.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.560
Here's how we could make a table like Napier's.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.560
First make tables of geometric progressions for reference values.

25:48.560 --> 25:53.840
Start at 1 and multiply by 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th over and over, but stop at a round

25:53.840 --> 26:05.480
value, say after 100 terms when you reach 1.0001495 and so on.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.120
That's very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.200
We're not going to forget that it's not exactly 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, we'll account

26:13.200 --> 26:14.720
for the difference later.

26:14.720 --> 26:19.920
But for now start a second table with 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th as the common ratio and

26:19.920 --> 26:22.000
go until another round number.

26:22.000 --> 26:31.480
Napier went 50 steps to 1.0005001225196, again cutting off after the 14th place.

26:31.480 --> 26:36.440
Now you have to make another table with common ratio 1 plus 1 over 2000, where now you have

26:36.440 --> 26:40.280
to shift four places and multiply by five at each step.

26:40.280 --> 26:44.840
This will take you in 20 steps to something close to 1.01 and from there it's a practical

26:44.840 --> 26:48.200
232 steps to 10.

26:48.200 --> 26:53.480
Then you can fill in your course 1.01 rate progression by making a table that starts

26:53.480 --> 27:00.200
at the power of 1.01 and increases by the next 20 powers of 1.0005, which will give

27:00.200 --> 27:05.000
you 4,640 reference values.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
To compute logarithms of the entries in these tables, it suffices since they're in geometric

27:10.000 --> 27:14.040
progression to get the logarithms of the first two terms since the logarithms will

27:14.040 --> 27:16.800
be an arithmetic progression.

27:16.800 --> 27:23.160
To compute the natural logarithm of the first progression, 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th,

27:23.160 --> 27:28.280
Napier needed another ingredient, a key inequality that allows you to approximate the logarithm.

27:28.280 --> 27:33.940
In one form this inequality looks like log x is less than x minus 1 and greater than

27:33.940 --> 27:35.960
x minus 1 over x.

27:35.960 --> 27:40.820
Now I already proved this inequality in a slightly disguised form in method 5 of the

27:40.820 --> 27:45.280
previous episode, but here's another proof that Napier would have recognized.

27:45.280 --> 27:52.360
The graph of his function log x lies below x minus 1 and above x minus 1 over x since

27:52.360 --> 27:59.040
all three functions are 0 at 1 and their derivatives are 1, 1 over x, and 1 over x squared, so

27:59.040 --> 28:03.020
it's clear which ones grow faster, though to make this rigorous you might invoke the

28:03.020 --> 28:04.800
mean value theorem.

28:04.800 --> 28:09.200
A second version of this inequality comes from setting x equals a over b with a greater

28:09.200 --> 28:15.760
than b, this can be written 1 over a is less than log a minus log b over a minus b is less

28:15.760 --> 28:17.680
than 1 over b.

28:17.680 --> 28:23.120
Of course these inequalities are only useful if x is close to 1 or if a is close to b.

28:23.120 --> 28:29.480
With this inequality you get that log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 7th is between 1 over

28:29.480 --> 28:34.560
10 to the 7th and 1 over 10 to the 7th plus 1, which led Napier to simply take an

28:34.560 --> 28:43.160
intermediate value like the middle value point 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5.

28:43.160 --> 28:47.000
Now you have the logs of all the values in the first reference table and you can use

28:47.000 --> 28:52.160
the inequality to compare the log of 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th to the log of the last

28:52.160 --> 28:56.640
entry in the first table, which is very close to 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 5th, so you get

28:56.640 --> 29:01.560
an arithmetic progression of all the logs in the second table and you do the same for

29:01.560 --> 29:04.160
all the other tables.

29:04.160 --> 29:09.720
Now it's just a matter of taking an existing accurate trig table, finding the closest reference

29:09.720 --> 29:14.720
values in the table to the sine value and approximating the logarithm with the inequality.

29:14.720 --> 29:20.600
For example, here's how to find the log of sine of 48 degrees in 30 minutes.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.320
Note that I interchanged the notation ln of x with log of x. Contemporary available

29:25.480 --> 29:31.000
trig tables gave the sine as 0.7489557.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.080
The closest power of 1.01 is 1.01 to the 202.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.880
Note that we have to adjust by a factor of 10 to locate the value in our table.

29:40.880 --> 29:46.640
Then you can go to the 200 second finer reference table and multiply by an additional 7 powers

29:46.640 --> 29:49.200
of 1.0005.

29:49.200 --> 29:54.880
Now use the inequality to get a small range, approximate by the middle value, and subtract

29:54.880 --> 30:00.840
the log of 10, which is the final value in the whole table of reference values.

30:00.840 --> 30:05.440
Here I've tried to capture the spirit of what Napier was trying to do, but the details

30:05.440 --> 30:08.720
of his particular construction were different in several ways.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.560
He used a decreasing geometric progression rather than an increasing one.

30:12.560 --> 30:18.000
He took 10 to the 7th to be the radius of the circle and considered the sines as lengths

30:18.000 --> 30:23.560
working downwards with a logarithm set to 0 at 10 to the 7th, so in terms of our modern

30:23.600 --> 30:29.800
natural logarithm, Napier's function was Napier log of x equals 10 to the 7th log of

30:29.800 --> 30:31.840
10 to the 7th over x.

30:31.840 --> 30:37.000
Also, his analysis was based on the differential equation of exponential decay for the values

30:37.000 --> 30:42.320
as the indices progressed arithmetically, just like Newton's discussion of drag force.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.600
I'll include references in the description if you want a fuller picture of Napier's actual

30:46.600 --> 30:47.680
process.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.600
Here, by the way, is a page from his table.

30:51.640 --> 30:56.480
Napier's table of logarithms was published in 1614 and was immediately well received.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.360
Kepler might not have been able to devise his laws of planetary motion without Napier's

31:00.360 --> 31:03.160
tables and their subsequent improvements.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.040
Napier was prevailed upon by Henry Briggs to make new tables with the logarithm to

31:07.040 --> 31:12.320
base 10 to be of more practical use, so although Napier had given a construction of the natural

31:12.320 --> 31:16.960
logarithm, the details obscured the role of the base E.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.320
In a sense, Christian Huygens isolated E when he computed several digits of its base

31:21.320 --> 31:27.680
10 logarithm in the 1660s, but a full description of E, its connections to logarithms and continuously

31:27.680 --> 31:31.680
compounded interest, had to wait until Euler.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.880
Napier died in 1617 and the details of how he constructed his logarithms were published

31:36.880 --> 31:39.680
posthumously in 1619.

31:39.680 --> 31:46.080
Incredibly, it only took until 1622 for William Autrid to take Napier's tables and construct

31:46.080 --> 31:51.320
the first slide rule, a ruler marked with a logarithmic scale and moving slide to read

31:51.320 --> 31:54.240
off multiplied values by adding lengths.

31:54.240 --> 31:59.920
This was the most widespread tool for numerical calculation until the personal electronic calculator,

31:59.920 --> 32:03.440
and now hardly anyone knows what a slide rule even is.

32:03.440 --> 32:09.040
Lastly, I want to address why Napier wanted to make a table of logs of trig functions

32:09.040 --> 32:10.600
in the first place.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.760
It has to do with using the spherical law of cosines.

32:13.760 --> 32:19.640
The problems of astronomy and navigation require not plain trigonometry, but spherical trigonometry.

32:19.640 --> 32:23.720
Spherical triangles are formed by the arcs of three great circles and have interior angles

32:23.720 --> 32:28.920
marked with capital letters and side lengths themselves angles subtended by the arcs given

32:28.920 --> 32:30.800
by lowercase letters.

32:30.800 --> 32:35.920
In the 16th century, the spherical law of cosines was better known than the planar law

32:35.920 --> 32:37.360
of cosines.

32:37.360 --> 32:42.720
This law and another version for angles instead of arcs involved multiplying signs and cosines,

32:42.720 --> 32:44.560
hence the need for the table.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.440
These formulas were crucial for navigation by the positions of the stars, including telling

32:48.440 --> 32:53.160
the time or longitude by the hour angle and to track the motion of the planets.

32:53.160 --> 32:57.280
Maybe I'll discuss this in a future episode.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.640
Thanks so much for watching.

the notification bell since my uploads are a bit sporadic.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.240
It will really help me to grow this channel.

33:08.240 --> 33:12.040
Check out my other videos in the Tricky Parts of Calculus series for subtle parts of calculus

33:12.040 --> 33:15.240
that are rarely covered, including difficult proofs and how problems were solved for the

33:15.240 --> 33:16.240
first time.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.480
I also do a podcast and videos with general advice and opinions about the world of math.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.000
Thanks again.
