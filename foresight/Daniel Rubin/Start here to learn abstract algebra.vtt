00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
All right, everybody. Today, I'm really excited to tell you about a fantastic math book, a book I've been meaning to talk about for a while.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
It is my recommendation for how to get started in the subject of abstract algebra.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
It is Galois Theory by Harold M. Edwards.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Now, I can already hear the shouting of my detractors.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
Let me tell you this is a very unique book, a very different book from a regular treatment of this subject and the subject of algebra generally.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
And I understand it is one thing for me to tell you about what I think is great about this book and to recommend it.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
It's altogether another thing for me to suggest this is where students ought to get their start in the subject of algebra.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
And I really am saying, even to professors and people who sit on curriculum committees,

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
I think there is something very seriously wrong with the standard way that abstract algebra is taught to math majors.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
I think students are being done a real disservice with the standard groups, rings and fields approach.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
I think you could begin with a course taught along the lines of this book and it would be a much better approach to algebra.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
It's maybe not the only way of doing it, but it is a very good way of doing it.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Let me start with three things you might notice about this book right off the bat.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
First of all, it is not a very thick book. This is not one of those giant tomes of algebra.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
This is a very manageable book that you can actually read start to finish.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
And an instructor could cover this entire book in a semester, probably with some time left over for additional topics.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
Second, this book belongs to Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics series, but it is not just for graduate students.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm going to tell you why I think this book is not only appropriate, but it's actually my preferred way to get started.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
So don't worry about that at all. It's just the series to which this book belongs.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
All it amounts to is not my favorite type setting, but that's fine.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And the third thing is that this book is not called Abstract Algebra, Modern Algebra, Higher Algebra.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
It's called Galois Theory.

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
A Galois theory is a theory that relates the solutions of polynomials to this hidden symmetries that their roots possess.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
It is named in honor of Everest Galois, who developed this whole theory completely on his own and was never recognized for it in his short life.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
He was killed in a duel at age 20 very tragically, but people came to recognize the importance of his work afterwards.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And it is the foundation of a lot of modern algebra.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
But you may know that Galois theory is typically taught in a second semester of undergraduate abstract algebra if it is covered at all.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
And so why am I saying this is the book to get started and not a book which actually has algebra in the title?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And the answer, you can start to get a sense of the answer if you read.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
What is this book about?

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
On the back it says, this book is an introduction to Galois theory along the lines of Galois actual memoir.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And he talks about the antecedents of Galois theory.

03:10.000 --> 03:19.000
These names, Gauss Lagrange, Vandermonde Newton, even back to the ancient Babylonians are explained to put Galois main ideas in their historical setting.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And that is the main crux of it.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
One of the things that makes this book special is this is a historically minded treatment of this subject.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
And if you pay attention to this channel, you know that is an approach that I really like.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
It's not just because I like history, but it's because this is how I like to understand math.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And I'm going to try to tell you why I think this is a very concrete and good way of understanding the subject.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
But at least you can see if he starts all the way back, the ancient Babylonians and works his way forward through history.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
How could this possibly be something that comes later, comes only as you're a graduate student.

03:56.000 --> 04:05.000
All of this material in this book came well before the theory was rewritten in the way that you will see in most other algebra textbooks.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And this is something great.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
That's true of a lot of the books of this fantastic author Harold M. Edwards.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
What are the prerequisites for this book?

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Actually, in terms of content, the prerequisites are pretty minimal.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
Really, high school algebra and having some curiosity about if you know how to solve quadratic equations, what happens for higher degree.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
But as Edwards says in the preface, he has assumed a certain degree of mathematical experience.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You need to be able to compute.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
You need to be able to give an argument.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.000
And so although this book doesn't actually require a whole lot of content knowledge, it doesn't make it easy, but it is manageable.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
All right, so let's look at the content of this book.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So the first thing you'll notice is that the book doesn't actually have chapters.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
It is arranged in terms of sections, each of which is very short and usually contains just one idea.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
But the sections are grouped together in a way that they end in an exercise set.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
So there are eight exercise sets in the book.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So you may hear me refer to these as chapters.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The only difference is that these chapters are not modular.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
You really have to go from start to finish.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
The first 30 sections are algebra before Galois and up to Galois.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
So in the beginning, there are some historical remarks.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
There is the solution of quadratic equations even from the time of the Babylonians.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
From there, you have to go to the 16th century and he describes the methods of solution of the cubic and then the solution of the quartic

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
and what people tried on the quintic and how those same methods didn't seem to work.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
And then you get into the first key technique that will be used throughout the book, these expressions in terms of symmetric polynomials.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
The second chapter is about the work of Lagrange and Vandermonde.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
This is already 200 years after Cardano with their own way of trying to work out what was going on in those earlier methods.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Could they generalize?

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And then there is a chapter on cyclotomic equations, the roots of unity.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Can you write the roots of unity in terms of radicals?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And this is mostly work of Gauss.

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
Cyclotomic equations play a central role in the theory in this book because if you're interested in, can you solve an equation by radicals?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
It's assumed you can include roots of unity in that solution.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
And then there is this discussion of Lagrange's idea of what's something called a resolvent and Galois' resolvent.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
This is what begins the Galois part of this book.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
And the rest of the book is pretty much a kind of expanded explanation or commentary on Galois' paper.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
The revolutionary paper that he wrote and was still adding to the night before he died.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Really great general theorems here about constructing simple algebraic extensions.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
How do you know that there is a root anyway?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
This is the beginning of Galois' work.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
And then these chapters five and six may be the heart of the matter here.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
There is the introduction of the idea of a group, which you could say is due to Galois.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
You'll see Galois' idea of a group is not exactly what we think of as a group today.

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
But it captures the key idea because in the sixth chapter you can see if an equation is solvable by radicals,

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
then there's some interesting structure to its Galois group when you reduce that group as normal.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And that was the key thing that Galois discovered.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Now this seventh chapter is really interesting on splitting fields.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
This is a somewhat philosophically-binded chapter.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Edwards makes the case that for the foundations of this theory you would need to know

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
what tells you that there exists roots in the first place.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
How do you know when you have a theory about permuting roots?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, what is it that you're talking about?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
And he argues that the fundamental theorem of algebra due to Gauss,

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
that every polynomial over the complex numbers splits over the complex numbers,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
is not really the right foundation for this theory for a couple of reasons.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Actually, it has to do with algebraic constructions of a splitting field,

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
and that has to do with the theorem that was proven earlier that constructs simple algebraic extensions

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
and having a factorization method for field extensions.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So this is a really interesting addition to the theory.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
It's something I hadn't really thought about in this way.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
It's good material.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
This is the only material in the book that actually comes from after Galois.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
This is a few decades later.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
And then the final chapter of the book, this review of Galois theory,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
is about the fundamental theorem.

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
The fundamental relationship in Galois theory is this correspondence between the subfields of an extension

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and the subgroups of the Galois group that fix them.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
And then this correspondence is used to address some of the other issues in the book

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
and this issue of solvable equations of prime degree, which was in Galois' original memoir,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
maybe a little bit esoteric, but also it fills in the proof of this Lemma II,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
which was part of the theory of cyclatomic equations.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
So everything is all wrapped up very nicely and neatly at the end of this book.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
And then there are three appendices, and the first one is Galois' actual memoir.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
So you can see, here is Edwards' translation.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
This is what Galois actually wrote.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And it's really fascinating.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Well, it is difficult for a modern audience to read.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
You can see why you need this whole book to make sense of this.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
But you can see such a thing like here in Proposition 2,

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
here is how the idea of a normal subgroup, these groups will have the remarkable property

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
that one will pass from one to the other and applying the same substitution of letters

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
to all the permutations of the first.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
What does that mean?

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, in the text, here Edwards explains this is what Galois meant by that,

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
and this is the discovery of the key property of normal subgroups.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
That's just a really interesting historical thing to have there.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
But then it's really nice to have this synopsis and some material on groups

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
that sort of ties this material together and puts it in maybe a more standard formulation

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
than what is in the rest of the book.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Just a really solid course on Galois theory.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
So there are lots of really good exercises in this book.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
What do I mean by good exercises?

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
They are good in the sense that they are worthy results

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
and they typically involve good practice in the techniques of the theory,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
so you really learn the theory by doing them.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Exercises are a very good mix of computational problems and theoretical ones.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
My one issue with these exercises, and I did a bunch of them before this review,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
is that a few of them, and there's no warning which ones,

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
a few of them are quite hard in the sense that they go beyond the methods demonstrated in the text

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
or they are quite involved and the answers are very long,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
and I'll just point out a couple of them.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
So for example, it is left completely as an exercise to the reader

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
to prove that every prime has a primitive root.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
This is such an important theorem, and of course you should prove it,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and the methods go a little bit maybe beyond what's in the book to do it,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
and I'll mention two other really important exercises as well.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Here you are asked in these two exercises to essentially give the connection

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
between Galois's method of solving equations to the earlier methods,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
and that's really important, but you will see the answers are quite long.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
But that's the other thing about this book.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
There are answers to all of the exercises,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
which is really incredible to see in a book,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
and fortunately, so it's really nice to have,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
especially for the computational ones and for the more theoretical ones,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
it's really more like a hint, generalized outline.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
It doesn't invalidate the use of this book for student exercises,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
and this book has another feature, which I've actually never seen in a book before.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
This is really something here.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
It has this feature, list of exercises,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
and what is it?

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
This is, I imagine this must be for an instructor.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It actually, so that you don't have to read the exercises,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
it gives a description of every exercise, what it's getting at,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
so an instructor can know maybe which ones to assign.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
This one has to do with the construction of a regular pentagon, et cetera, et cetera.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
I've never seen this before, as I said, but that's really convenient.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
What may not be apparent if you are not already a mathematician,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
if you're not an expert, this is a very, very different treatment of this subject.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It's a different treatment of Galois theory,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
and certainly it's a different approach to the whole subject of algebra in many ways.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
In some simple ways, first of all, there is some non-standard terminology in this book,

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
the terminology of Galois Resolvent, Galois' original definition of a group.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
It's not what you will find in other books, and that is an issue,

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
although Edwards does eventually connect it to more standard notions.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
And of course, you will notice if you look at the text,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
there is a lot of text in this book.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It is not just definition theorem proof.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
There is a lot written out, it's more written like a lecture.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
In part, this is a matter of style,

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
and in part, this is because the book takes a problem-solving approach to mathematics

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
as opposed to a theory-building approach.

14:27.000 --> 14:35.000
The standard approach to algebra is to introduce students to the various abstract structures

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
that the theory is built on, and you will learn in the abstract a theory of groups,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
a theory of rings, and a theory of fields, and that is not the approach in this book.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
This book takes the approach of what is the story?

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
There is a constant through-line in this book of the problem at hand is to solve polynomial equations,

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
a certain kind of polynomial equation, and you just do whatever you have to do in order to solve it.

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
So that is why, for example, when the issue becomes constructing a simple algebraic extension,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
the text makes clear what is the problem at hand, what you would have to do,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
as you work through the problem and you need to deal with some critical distinction,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
that's when the distinction is introduced.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
So issues about rings and fields that you would learn, it takes a whole semester to learn abstractly on their own,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and maybe not know why they're important.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Well, when they become important in the course of this book, that's when they're introduced.

15:33.000 --> 15:41.000
So here you see the Euclidean algorithm being introduced when he wants to prove this theorem on simple algebraic extensions.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Clearly, I prefer this problem-solving approach.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I find it much more concrete, far more motivated, and it is how mathematics was actually done.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
If you go through a regular course on algebra and then Galois theory, it will probably be a complete mystery to you

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
how this teenager came up with this whole theory and revolutionized the whole subject.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
But if you read this book, you will learn the subject in a way that makes you say,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
It'll be very clear why you are doing what you are doing and the emphasis is on techniques rather than remembering definitions.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
This is not how I learned the subject.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I learned the subject from a bunch of other much more standard books,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
and I really wish I had discovered this earlier, but I love this book now.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Where do you go after this book?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
This does not really replace a full year of algebra.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
It does not cover everything.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
It does not cover, for example, some of the structure theorems of finite groups or the Silo theorems,

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
that sort of thing, which is often covered in a first semester in algebra.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
But I think after this book, now you actually have a reason to study these objects.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
And so there are lots of different directions you can go after this book, even with a more standard text.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I will talk about some other good algebra books later.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Now, this book was actually originally intended, as he says in the preface,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
as just a section of his other book for Ma's last theorem,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
a genetic approach to algebraic number theory.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
And that is a fantastic follow up for people who are interested in number theory,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
which you can read after this book.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Other directions might be in the direction of representation theory and matrix groups.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I hope this kind of discussion about books is helpful to you.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I've provided some links in the description.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
If you want to learn more about the history of algebra,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
there is a great book by Vendor Verden, History of Algebra.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
And that goes into some things that are not discussed in this book.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
For example, Abel's Proof of the Insolubility of the Quintic, which actually came before.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Galois's explanation and the work of Ruffini as well.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
It's hard to actually learn math from a book that's really about the history of math.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Either there's too much history or it's intended for experts.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But Harold M. Edwards has done The Math World a great service

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
by writing these books that are really intended for students

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
and contain a motivated historical presentation.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
The whole book is actually infused with an attitude of setting the record straight.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
A kind of zeal both for the real way that things are done and making it concrete

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
and exposing the absurdity of the philosophy of the Berbaki growth and deep group

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
that has written this kind of revisionist mathematics

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and these highly general abstract texts

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
and thinks that if you only studied things in the appropriate generality

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
then the solutions would pop out.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Of course, this book shows that's not how it happened at all,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
certainly in the case of this subject.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
And I think this book can teach a lot of people, a lot of algebra

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
that is very hard to obscure if you try to do it a different way.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Alright, thanks a lot.
