0	10800	Welcome to another Mathologer video. You're all familiar with the diagram over there, right?
11360	14400	Yes, of course. It's a diagram powering the Mathologer logo.
15760	21440	Yes, but that's not really it, right? I'm sure for the majority of people watching this video,
21440	27120	this diagram will scream Pythagoras. If this is not the case, ask for your money back from your
27760	32000	and definitely keep on watching for, hopefully, life-changing experience.
32720	37120	And even for those of you who've treasured this twisted square diagram since primary school,
37120	41760	keep watching. Today will be about all the secrets of this iconic diagram
41760	47120	that not even most professional mathematicians will be familiar with. But first, a bit of revision
47120	54400	to get us all on the same page. a squared plus b squared equals c squared. You all know the drill.
55360	58960	Take any right angle triangle with short sides a and b and hypotenuse
58960	64800	c and the area of the square on the hypotenuse c squared is equal to the combined area of
64800	71520	the squares on the two shorter sides a squared plus b squared. A stunning visual proof of this
71520	78880	fundamental theorem runs like this. Take four copies of the triangle and combine them into a
78880	85920	large square like this. Okay, this large square is partly covered by the four triangles.
86800	92240	The area that's not covered is what? Well, c squared, of course. Now move one of the little
92240	98720	triangles just a little bit. How large is the blue area now? Well, still c squared, of course.
99360	104880	How about now? Still c squared. And this will be true no matter how we position the triangles
104880	111280	inside the blue square as long as they don't overlap, right? Okay, ready for a big aha moment?
111280	117200	Move the triangles one more time. No overlaps. And so the area is still c squared. However,
117200	124400	this area is also a squared plus b squared. And so a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
124400	130080	What an amazingly simple and beautiful proof. What a killer punchline. Don't you think? All right.
130080	138400	Now, how about this? The area of the large square is equal to the area of the little square
138960	146400	plus the area of the four triangles. Okay, the area of the large square is a plus b squared.
146400	152640	The area of the little square is c squared. And the area of one of the right angle triangles is
153360	160560	one half base thumbs height, one half a times b. Now simply go on algebra autopilot. There's two
161200	170000	over there. We expand and we cancel and a squared plus b squared equals c squared. Fantastic again.
170000	175920	Well, maybe not quite as fantastic as the first proof, but still fantastic. Just out of interest,
175920	180640	can you let me know in the comments which of these two twisted square proofs you were already
180640	186960	familiar with and when and where you first came across them? Will be interesting. Of course,
186960	192160	most kids never get to see either proof, which in my book is a crime which should entitle them to
192160	197360	get their money back from their schools. As well, most school textbooks that feature a proof only
197360	203840	mention the second less spectacular algebraic one. Go figure. Anyway, no matter how pretty these
203840	210800	proofs are, that's really all there is to this iconic diagram, right? Wrong. There's more, lots
210800	217360	and lots more. There's from our four square theorem, the tri-thagorean theorem, the bug chasing vertex,
218160	226000	vortex and much more ready to be amazed. Here we go. The twisted square diagram has been around
226000	230800	for a couple thousand years and features in the earliest documented proof of Pythagoras theorem,
230800	234960	which is part of an ancient Chinese manuscript on astronomy and mathematics.
235520	240480	Well, Pythagoras neither discovered his theorem nor was he the first to prove it,
240480	245600	and so to have a theorem named after him is really a bit of a scandal in mathematics. Anyway,
245600	252400	let's have a look inside the manuscript. What you find there is pages upon pages of this. Well,
252400	257440	maybe not surprising. Lots and lots of Chinese characters. However, eventually we come across
257440	265440	a page featuring our diagram. Well, that's definitely our diagram, but there's a bit more
265440	271600	to this drawing, isn't there? There, a second very different twisted square diagram made up
271600	278560	of the same four right angle triangles. Let us push them around a bit. In fact,
278560	282640	the second diagram can also be used to prove Pythagoras theorem in two different ways,
282640	288320	one algebraic and one based on shuffling triangles. Just looking at areas, again,
288320	294000	we have four times the area of the triangle plus the area of the little square is equal to the
294000	300320	area of the large square. Expressing this identity in terms of a, b and c and some algebra autopilot
300320	306080	spits out a squared plus b squared equals c squared in pretty much exactly the same way as before.
306080	312720	On the other hand, the c squared area of the large square stays unchanged when we move some
312720	321360	of the triangles. And so c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared also very pretty. And in a
321360	325760	way, this proof is even slicker than the first triangle shuffle proof, since we only have to
325760	337120	shuffle two of the triangles instead of all four. The Chinese drawing also features a grid.
337760	342960	What's that grid for? Well, it's clear that no matter what right angle triangle you start with,
342960	348240	everything we set so far will stay true. Of course, this is very important. Otherwise,
348240	351920	none of our proofs would actually count as a general proof of Pythagoras theorem.
352640	358320	On the other hand, the grid shows that in our example, we're dealing with a super famous
358320	363520	right angle triangle. Can you see it? Yep, it's a 345 right angle triangle.
365280	371840	3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared. 345, the prototype Pythagorean triple, a
371840	376240	triple of integers that satisfies the equation a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
377200	381120	Since we've all been familiar with the 345 triples since kindergarten,
381120	385840	we're taking the fact that such triples exist for granted, that the existence of such
385840	392240	integer triples is in fact a little bit of a miracle is illustrated by Fermat's last theorem,
392240	400000	which says that if you change the exponent to 3, 4 or any other larger integer, the equation will
400000	406720	not have any positive integer solutions. But of course, the wonderful 345 Pythagorean triple
406720	412560	does exist. And you get more of these wonderful integer triples by simply changing the number
412560	419440	of lines in the grid. There, doubling the number of grid lines gives this. 6 squared plus 8 squared
419440	426240	equals 10 squared. Easy, and tripling gives this. But there are also other essentially different
426240	432880	Pythagorean triples, and many of you will be familiar with this particular one, right? 51213,
432880	438400	5 squared plus 12 squared equals 13 squared. Anyway, there are infinitely many essentially
438400	443440	different Pythagorean triples. And let me just mention that we know how to construct all of them
443440	448880	pretty easily. And of course, we can use any of these triples to make up one of our diagrams.
449760	455920	But let's stick with 345. Alright, let's have another close look. How many squares are there?
456000	464000	Well, there's this one, and that one. And one more. The area of the little square is one squared.
464720	472880	Okay. The area of this green square is 5 squared. And what about the largest one? Well,
472880	483120	3 plus 4 is 7, and so the area is 7 squared. Cool. Now, what is 25 minus 1? 25 minus 1? That's
483120	493760	24, of course. Okay. What about 49 minus 25? You got it? 49 minus 25. It's also 24. Interesting.
493760	500480	Both differences are the same. Is that a coincidence? What do you think? Well, no. That we get the
500480	506400	same difference is always true. And it's also really easy to see. Have a look. What's the difference
506400	511520	between blue and green? Well, that's just the area of four copies of our right angle triangle.
512320	518000	And how about the difference between the green and the orange? Same thing, of course. Let's shuffle
518000	526560	them around. Very pretty, isn't it? So, what this means is that within the square numbers,
526560	532960	we can find three equally spaced squares, and that every Pythagorean triple translates into three
532960	544160	such special squares. Okay. So, that's what we get for 345. And here is what we get if we double
544160	552720	the number of grid lines. There. Now, in maths, an arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers
552720	559360	in which consecutive terms differ by a fixed amount like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc., with a common
559360	566640	difference of 2 or 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., with a common difference of 3. And so, another way of expressing
566640	572320	this equal difference business at hand is to say that there are arithmetic progressions of length
572320	579200	3 within the squares. Okay. This fact was already known to the great 17th century mathematician
579200	584880	Pierre de Fermat, whose super famous last theorem I mentioned just a moment ago. And this fact prompted
584880	591280	Pierre de Fermat to ask a very natural question. What do you think that question was? Well, he
591280	598640	asked, are there any longer arithmetic progressions hiding in the squares? Right? Here we've got four,
598640	612480	plus 96 is 100, plus 96 is 196. What if we add another 96? Do we get another square? That would
612560	622160	then be an arithmetic progression of length 4. Well, no, because 196 plus 96 is 292, and 292 is not a
622160	627920	square. But in general, are there arithmetic progressions of four squares or five squares? How
627920	633920	long can such progressions be? What do you think? Well, this is a tricky one. Let me try to confuse
633920	639600	you a little bit more. In 2004, the mathematical superstars Ben Green and Terry Tau approved
639600	644080	that there are, in fact, arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths among the primes.
645280	650800	Insane, right? Here's one of lengths 5 that we've been staring at all your life without realizing
650800	658560	it. There, 5 plus 6 is 11, plus 6 is 17, plus 6 is 23, plus 6 is 29, and arithmetic progression of
658560	665840	five primes was common difference 6. Anyway, how long can arithmetic progressions of squares get?
666560	672800	Well, Fermat figured out that, in fact, 3 is the surprising answer. You cannot do any better
672800	676800	than the many sequences that our diagram produces from Pythagorean triples.
678080	683280	Allegedly, Fermat also had a proof, but nobody knows what that proof looked like exactly.
683280	688240	A situation similar to that with his famous last theorem, where he also claimed to have a proof,
688240	693760	but none was found in his writings. Here's a quote from the well-known Australian number
693760	699440	theorist, Alf van der Poorten. Here's what he writes. I looked this up in reference 3 and found
699440	705680	at page 54 the unhelpful footnote, Fermat could show by descent that one cannot have four squares
705680	710720	in arithmetic progression. Jerry Meissen has pointed me to a reference, but the argument there seems
710720	718080	utterly soulless. And I remain searching for a decent descent argument warranty report to you.
718080	723680	Now, that's really funny. I decided recently that such a proof was most readily found on a previously
723760	729360	blank page of my notebook. So he decided that everything seen so far is useless. He's going
729360	735120	to make up a proof himself. And here's what he ended up writing in his notebook. This is the
735120	740560	nicest and most natural proof of Fermat's four square theorem that I'm aware of. And it may very
740560	746000	well be similar to what Fermat came up with a couple hundred years ago. I won't go into the
746000	751600	nitty gritty details here. Let me just say that this proof features the kind of infinite descent
751600	757280	argument that we've already encountered a couple of times in mythology videos. At its core is a
757280	763280	well-known construction of all known Pythagorean triples. And so it appears that this proof may
763280	768080	have had its origin in the little Pythagorean triple construction that this talked about.
774400	779840	Now Pythagoras theorem has been around for thousands of years. And so you would think that
779840	785840	everything worth discovering about Pythagoras theorem was discovered a long time ago. Far from
785840	791840	it. What I'll talk about now was only discovered around 20 years ago. Okay. So instead of twisting
791840	798480	squares, we now twist equilateral triangles. Let's try to mimic as much as possible what we did
798480	805360	before. So instead of right angle triangles, we start with a triangle that features a 60 degree
805360	813520	angle. Make three copies. Arrange them into a large equilateral triangle. Okay. Next we have to
813520	818320	shuffle the triangles around. Now after a bit of fiddling, it turns out that for this to prove
818320	823600	something interesting, we have to get rid of one of the red triangles first. There. Go away triangle.
823600	830080	Go away, go away, go away. Now shuffle. Not much of a shuffle, but anyway. Looks promising.
830960	834560	As before, side by side or two diagrams amount to an equation.
835760	839280	Cancel two triangles each on the left and right sides of this equation.
840480	846880	So what's left? Well, we've got one equilateral triangle each for the three sides A, B and C of
846880	854880	our original triangle. Let's name the areas of these triangles like this. Okay. Using these names,
854880	863200	our identity looks like this. Watch it. It's coming. Oh, fantastic. A trithagorean theorem
863200	869680	for 60 degree triangles. Note that in the real trithagoras, the A and B areas add up exactly
869680	876080	to the C area. That's almost also works in this trithagorean theorem, right? So here we've got
876080	881840	A area plus B area equals C area plus, well, there's a little bit of a correction term,
881840	889280	a really nice correction term, the area of the original triangle T. Okay. For the next surprise,
889280	894800	let's make the 60 degree angle into a right angle, but keep the equilateral triangles on the sides.
895360	902640	Experts, what am I about to say? Well, we can make the identity on top work by simply removing the
902640	909200	T. Really? Yes. Pithagoras not only works for squares, but also for equilateral triangles.
909200	916320	A area plus B area equals C area. Exactly. In fact, even better, Pithagoras works for
916320	921680	three suitably scaled copies of any shape, glued to the sides of a right angle triangle.
921680	927520	Semi circles, capital M for mythology, anything whatsoever. I already talked about this at length
927520	933120	in a separate video on Pithagoras theorem a couple of years ago. Also, check out that video.
933360	945600	60 is 90 minus 30. On the other hand, 90 plus 30 is 120. And it turns out that just like 60 degree
945600	952160	triangles, 120 degree triangles also have a nice Trithagorean theorem. The only difference between
952160	960000	these two Trithagorean theorems is that the plus correction term turns into a minus correction term.
960720	967440	Also nice, isn't it? Anyway, back to 60 degree triangles. Well, our Trithagorean theorem is
967440	973120	very cute. However, it is definitely not as applicable as Pithagoras theorem, right? If you
973120	978400	give me the length of any two sides of a right angle triangle, Pithagoras immediately tells me
978400	985920	what the third length is. Not so with our Trithagorean identity. However, there's also a nice
986000	991040	a squared plus b squared equals c squared Pithagoras counterpart for 60 degree triangles
991040	995520	that is just as applicable as its 90 degree original. Here it is.
997840	1005680	a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared plus a times b. Super nice. And also very easy to
1005680	1010960	see why this is true if you know the cosine rule, a generalization of Pithagoras to general triangles
1011680	1018800	taught as part of Trigonometry. Well, that's all good. But here's another nice way to conjure up
1018800	1023440	this identity, which also shows that it's simply another way of writing our original
1025360	1031680	Trithagorean identity. Let's call the area of the equilateral triangle with sides of lengths one,
1031680	1039440	f. There, f is that red area. Then the 60 degree triangle with sides a and b bound in the 60 degree
1039440	1046800	angle has area, really easy, a times b times f. Yeah, that guy has area a times b times f.
1046800	1052960	Bit of a challenge. Can you see at a glance why this is the case? If you can, let us know in the
1052960	1062560	comments. Anyway, this means t is equal to a times b times f. What about the area of the a triangle?
1062560	1068480	Well, this is an equilateral triangle. And so all its sides are equal to a. And so its area is
1068480	1075760	a times a times f, a squared times f. And similarly with b and c equilateral triangles.
1076880	1080880	Now it comes next. Can you see it? Of course, we just divide by f and we're done.
1083600	1089760	Slicker. What about Trithagorean Chipples counterparts to 345 and company?
1091520	1095280	Are there 60 degree triangles with integer sides? What do you think?
1096000	1101040	Well, he should be able to answer that one. Are there 60 degree triangles with integer sides?
1101760	1107760	Of course there are. Any equilateral triangle with integer lengths sides will work. 1 1 1,
1107760	1115680	2 2 2 and so on. Obvious. What about other 60 degree triangles? Not so obvious, but yes,
1115680	1120000	there are such triangles. In fact, our example over there is such a triangle.
1120080	1127280	387 works. Check for yourself that this triple really satisfies the equation 3 squared plus
1127280	1134480	8 squared equals 7 squared plus 3 times 8. Well, if I ever change the mythology logo from a twisted
1134480	1140720	square to a twisted equilateral triangle, I'll base it on this special 387 triple of integers.
1140720	1146640	Something like this. What do you think? Time for a change of logo? Anyway, the official name for
1146720	1153520	our Trithagorean integer triple is Eisenstein triples named after the 19th century genius
1153520	1160160	mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein. Just like with Pythagorean triples, there are infinitely many
1160160	1165360	essentially different Eisenstein triples. Okay, well, before I move on, here's something really,
1165360	1174320	really cute. Overlaying these two triangles immediately gives us second Eisenstein triple.
1174320	1181120	Can you see that? No? Well, let's just do it, right? The sides of this blue 60 degree triangle are
1181920	1191040	7, 8 and 8 minus 3 equals 5. There, a new Eisenstein triple, 5, 8, 7. Nice, huh? Here's
1191040	1199120	something else that you like. I'm pretty sure you like this one. Okay, super imposing. These two
1199120	1206400	triangles gives the red 120 degree triangle as integer sides. This triangle has sides 7, 3 and
1206400	1213920	8 minus 3 is 5. Also, to get the ABC identity 420 degree triangles, just change the plus in front
1213920	1221360	of the AB to a minus. Also super pretty. Anyway, do these triangular twists to the original Pythagorean
1221360	1235680	theorem get your seal of approval? I sure hope so. Okay, so we have this pair of diagrams for
1235680	1243600	equilateral triangles and this very similar pair for squares. We can make these two pictures look
1243600	1251120	even more similar by relocating these two triangles there. Now a bit of a facelift.
1252160	1256960	Very pretty, don't you think? Anyway, while preparing for this mythology video, I discovered
1256960	1263600	a third type of diagram that nicely complements this pair. What does this diagram show? Well,
1264560	1268960	the white triangles are all the same. There are 12 of them on the left and 6 on the right.
1268960	1276720	So let's cancel 6 on both sides. Do the usual thing here.
1279360	1284880	Also beautiful, the Hexagorean theorem. Ready for another nice aha moment? Okay,
1284880	1289120	divide by 6. What's a regular Hexagon divided by 6? Well, let's see.
1291680	1298160	Here, the Hexagorean theorem for 120 degree triangles divided by 6 is the Trithagorean
1298160	1304160	theorem for 120 degree triangles. You saw it first on mythology. As I already mentioned,
1304160	1308880	all the twisted triangle shuffle stuff only seems to have been around for about 20 years.
1308880	1314240	Over there is a painting of amateur mathematician Wayne Roberts created in 2003,
1314240	1319680	which is one of the possible origins of the nice triangle shuffle proof of our Trithagorean theorem.
1319680	1324320	This painting was also the inspiration for the way I purified the diagrams in this chapter.
1329520	1340320	Back to the original twisted square diagram. Have a look at this.
1340880	1350800	What you've just witnessed is yet another really weird
1350800	1355120	proof of Pythagoras based on the twisted square diagram, right? It's another proof.
1355120	1358560	The top two squares have the same area as the bottom square,
1358560	1363600	because it's possible to chop the top squares into 10 pieces that can be reassembled exactly
1363600	1371200	into the large square at the bottom. There. Really wonderful and unexpected, isn't it?
1371200	1376560	With an added bonus miracle being the overall shape at the top and bottom dissections,
1376560	1381840	which mirror the two diagrams in our original proof. Of course, with all these visual proofs,
1381840	1386800	it's very important to chase around the angles and lengths in these diagrams to make sure that
1386800	1391760	looks are not deceiving. That things really fit together exactly as suggested by our pictures,
1391760	1397360	for all possible choices of right angle triangles. Anyway, I checked. Trust me.
1397360	1400880	And if you don't trust me, check for yourself. Here's another miraculous
1400880	1404000	chop up proof based on the twisted square diagram.
1404560	1431600	There are a number of interesting properties of right angle triangles that appear to be very
1431600	1437440	mysterious at first sight. But once you remember the twisted squares, it all becomes crystal clear
1437440	1444240	in a flash. Here are three great examples. Okay, take any right angle triangle and attach the square
1444240	1450320	on the hypotenuse. Next, draw the line that cuts the right angle in two. Okay, now, no matter what
1450320	1455520	right triangle you started with, this line will always pass through the center of the square.
1456480	1461360	Now, if you encounter this property in the wild, it will most likely come as quite a surprise.
1462000	1468160	But then you remember your twisted squares. And now everything's clear. Drawing one of the
1468160	1473920	diagonals of the big square. Obviously, this diagonal cuts the right angles in half.
1474800	1481040	And it is also clear that it passes through the center of the square. Ta-da! Nice. I hope you
1481120	1485920	still experienced a bit of an aha moment despite me advertising the twisted squares
1485920	1494640	as the solution in advance. Okay, second property. And here's how it's usually presented. Start with
1494640	1500160	a square and insert a right angle triangle like this. Make three copies and attach them
1500160	1506800	to the remaining sides. Now, what's the special property? Pretty obvious, right? All right
1506880	1513520	angles are on a line. Very pretty. Again, very hard to see why this should be the case unless you
1513520	1528640	remember our twisted squares. One more. There are hundreds of different proofs of Pythagoras
1528640	1534560	theorem. One of them is by the 20th American president, James Garfield. It runs like this.
1534560	1540960	Start with a right angle triangle. Make a copy and complete the resulting figure into a trapezium.
1540960	1546880	Now, as usual, calculate the area for this trapezium in two different ways. First, using the formula
1546880	1553360	for the trapezium and then by adding up the area of the three triangles. Then some algebra
1553360	1559920	order pilot and outcomes a squared plus b squared equals c squared. All by now a complete no-brainer,
1559920	1566480	I hope. But doesn't this trapezium remind you of something? Yes, of course. It's just
1566480	1571760	half our favorite diagram. And really, on close inspection, President Garfield's proof
1571760	1578640	is exactly our original algebraic proof divided by two. And so really nothing new. But of course,
1578640	1583760	I can see why it's great to be able to tell kids that being good at maths and becoming an American
1583760	1589840	president can go together. And so for propaganda purposes, let's also say in the future that
1589840	1593760	an American president came up with a new proof of Pythagoras theorem.
1599840	1605200	Having fun so far? Right. Let's start with this special case of our twisted square diagram with
1605200	1612240	the little blue square twisted 45 degrees. Let's squish the diagram a bit. Okay. Okay. Shuffling
1612240	1618720	the triangles as usual is still possible. There, there, there. Let's say the sides of the blue
1618720	1624800	rectangles are root a and root b. Why root a and not just a? Well, don't worry about it.
1624800	1628800	Whatever the lengths are in the diagram, we can certainly write them as square roots of some
1628800	1636640	numbers. Now, the area of one of the two rectangles is root a times b. Okay. Now, what about the
1636640	1644880	diagram on the right? Using Pythagoras, we can see that one side of the blue rhombus is root
1644880	1651520	a plus b. Okay. The blue area on the left is two times root a times b,
1653440	1660160	which is equal to the area of the blue rhombus on the right, as usual. But this area is definitely
1660160	1665680	not larger than that of the square with sides of exactly the same lengths. Right.
1665840	1676080	Well, the area of both the rhombus and the square are based on side. Both shapes have
1676080	1682080	the same base, but the height of the square is larger and so its area is also larger.
1682800	1688560	Clear this way, right? What's the area of the square? Easy.
1688640	1699040	Now, this is a very famous inequality between the two most useful types of averaging two positive
1699040	1704720	numbers, the geometric mean on the left and the arithmetic mean on the right. So what we've just
1704720	1712160	proved is that the geometric mean of two positive numbers is always less or equal to their arithmetic
1712160	1720080	mean. Okay, let's modify what we just started with. First on the left, then reshuffled on the right,
1720080	1725440	we get this tilted parallelogram. Now, if we do exactly the same as we just did with a different
1725440	1730960	sort of labeling, we get another super famous inequality, the so-called Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
1732000	1736160	We need a bit more maths background to be able to appreciate that one. And so I'll just do an
1736160	1741120	animation of the relevant bits at the end of this video for those of you in the know and interested.
1742960	1747760	But I also would like to show you one more surprising completely different application that
1747760	1753600	everybody watching will be able to appreciate. To set it up, we modify things a bit more. First,
1753600	1759440	we swap the two diagrams and now we adjust so that all the sides of the parallelogram
1759440	1766720	are equal to one. Then we'll write things change like this. Okay, now pencil in some of the angles.
1767440	1773040	Then the length of the sides of our triangles will be the signs and cosines of these angles,
1773040	1780480	like this. There, there, there, and there. I'm pretty obvious that this is correct, right?
1780480	1786480	Let's shuffle them over to the other side. That's where we need them. Also, we can find the two
1786480	1794240	angles again inside the blue parallelogram. Let's just do that too. Here, it comes around here,
1794240	1800240	the better shows up here. And so this angle is just alpha plus beta. Okay, in terms of areas of
1800240	1806560	the blue regions, what have we got? Well, on the right, it's completely obvious. What about on the
1806560	1812320	left? Let's have a look. Still animating around, almost there. The area of the parallelogram is
1812320	1818880	equal to base times height. Base is one and height. Well, that's just the sign of alpha plus beta,
1818880	1822640	right? And so the area, base times height, is this.
1828160	1835120	Very nice. And so in total, we get the addition formula for our sign. How nice is that? Do you
1835120	1844400	see that one coming? Let's finish off with something totally different. Start with a square and
1844400	1849920	place some bugs on the corners of the square. Let's say that at some point in time, each bug
1849920	1855280	will start running towards the bug it is facing right now, that all four bugs will always be running
1855280	1860720	at the same constant speed towards each other. With a setup like this, what are some natural
1860720	1867280	questions to ask? Well, how about this? Will the bugs ever catch up to each other? If they do,
1867280	1872000	how long will their journeys be? What are the equations of their journeys? Which way will
1872000	1877440	they be facing when they meet? How do things change if we use different starting configurations,
1877440	1883440	numbers of bugs, etc. Lots of mathematical fun to be had here. Some of these problems and their
1883440	1888160	very surprising answers were made popular by the famous mathematics popularizer Martin Gardner
1888160	1895200	in his column in the July 1965 column of the Scientific American. Let me show you a nice
1895200	1900960	twisted square way to get a feel for what's going on here and for how to come up with answers to
1900960	1906800	some of our questions. First, ask the bugs to forget about Martin Gardner's instructions. Instead,
1906800	1912000	ask them to run along one-fifths of the sides of the square and then stop, like this. Now,
1912000	1918400	ask them to turn towards each other like this. Whoa, twisted squares! And we've arrived back
1918400	1924400	at the starting configuration just with a slightly smaller rotated square. Now, let's ask the bugs
1924400	1929600	to repeat everything they've done so far over and over. So, cover one-fifths, turn towards
1929600	1938960	each other, cover one-fifths, turn towards each other and so on. Go again, go again and pretty
1938960	1945840	spectacular, isn't it? Now, two simple observations. First, because of the symmetry of everything
1945840	1950720	that's happening here, the bugs will form a square at all times, pretty clear, right? Second,
1950720	1956720	from the way we repeat the same overall movement over and over, it follows that from one square to
1956720	1963120	the next, we are rotating the orientation of squares by the same angle and we scale the size
1963120	1969360	down by the same factor. Also pretty easy, right? Conclusions from this. Since we scale down by a
1969360	1975120	fixed factor, the size of the squares will decrease, but we'll do so infinitely often. Hence, there
1975120	1981760	are infinitely many squares and the sizes will shrink to zero. And since the orientations of
1981760	1988640	consecutive squares differ by a fixed angle and there are infinitely many squares, on their journey,
1988640	1993440	ideal bugs will circle the center infinitely often, right? So, there's one angle and we do this
1993440	1999520	infinitely, so it goes do, do, do, do, do. That's a bit unexpected, isn't it? Now, does this mean
1999520	2005040	that the bug's path is infinitely long? It's circling infinitely often, so is it infinitely long?
2005040	2009440	Actually, no. Although these paths wind infinitely often around the center, they are of finite
2009440	2014960	lengths. Let's figure out how long one of these paths actually is. If the side of the square is
2014960	2021040	one unit long, a bug walks one-fifths of one and one-fifths of one is 0.2. The remaining distance
2021040	2027840	is 0.8. Okay? We find the side lengths of the smaller square with Pythagoras. It's approximately
2027840	2035600	0.825. Since the outer side lengths 1 shrinks to 0.825 in the second square, we conclude
2035600	2042160	that 0.825 is the factor by which the squares shrink. This allows us to figure out the lengths of
2042160	2048000	all the segments of one of the bug's paths, right? Since the first segment is 0.2 long,
2048000	2055360	the second segment is 0.2 times 0.825 long. To get the length of the next segment,
2055360	2063680	we just have to multiply by 0.825 again, there, squared, and so on. There, cubed, power four.
2063680	2069280	This means that the total length of the path is this. All right. Now, the infinite series in the
2069280	2075200	brackets is a geometric series. Since you're still here, chances are you know the formula for the sum
2075200	2081280	of a geometric series by heart. It's just 1 over 1 minus the scale factor. With this, the overall
2081280	2088800	length of the path pens out to be this. And this is approximately 1.14, which is a little bit longer
2088800	2093440	than one of the sides of the square. Interesting. Now, we've reduced the fraction of the sides
2093440	2101280	covered by the bugs from 0.2 to 0.1. The numbers change like this. Uh-huh. The length of the path
2101280	2106800	is even closer to 1. In fact, if we let the fraction of the sides covered by the bugs go to 0,
2106800	2110480	the picture will turn into the picture that corresponds to the original Martin Gardner
2110480	2116880	problem. And the length of the paths of the bugs in the original problem can be seen to be exactly
2116880	2123040	1. How nice an answer is that? By the way, this was the picture on the cover of Martin Gardner's
2123040	2128960	Scientific American article. Again, the bugs pass exactly as long as the sides of the square.
2129600	2134880	It's a pretty surprising answer, yes. But in hindsight, is there maybe a simpler way to see why
2134880	2140560	the bugs path should be exactly as long as their original distance apart? Again, leave your thoughts
2140560	2147120	in the comments. I could report on many more ingenious results as far as bugs chasing bugs
2147120	2151920	are concerned, but let's call it a day for today. If you're interested in more neat details about
2151920	2156080	any of the topics touched upon today, check out the links in the description of this video.
2157200	2163040	Okay, one last nice insight. Early on, we encountered two types of twisted square diagrams,
2163040	2169360	this one and that one. There's actually a third one in this third diagram to triangle's overlap.
2170640	2175520	Here, then, is your final puzzle. Let's say A is equal to one-half and B is equal to one,
2175520	2182000	as in this example. What is the area of the square in the middle? Once again,
2182000	2187840	leave your hopefully surprising answers in the comments. Okay, and that's it from me for today.
2187840	2192640	As promised, I'll leave you with an animation of the proof for the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
2192640	2194720	in the case of two numbers, A and B.
