00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Welcome to another Mathologer video. You're all familiar with the diagram over there, right?

00:11.360 --> 00:14.400
Yes, of course. It's a diagram powering the Mathologer logo.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.440
Yes, but that's not really it, right? I'm sure for the majority of people watching this video,

00:21.440 --> 00:27.120
this diagram will scream Pythagoras. If this is not the case, ask for your money back from your

00:27.760 --> 00:32.000
and definitely keep on watching for, hopefully, life-changing experience.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.120
And even for those of you who've treasured this twisted square diagram since primary school,

00:37.120 --> 00:41.760
keep watching. Today will be about all the secrets of this iconic diagram

00:41.760 --> 00:47.120
that not even most professional mathematicians will be familiar with. But first, a bit of revision

00:47.120 --> 00:54.400
to get us all on the same page. a squared plus b squared equals c squared. You all know the drill.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.960
Take any right angle triangle with short sides a and b and hypotenuse

00:58.960 --> 01:04.800
c and the area of the square on the hypotenuse c squared is equal to the combined area of

01:04.800 --> 01:11.520
the squares on the two shorter sides a squared plus b squared. A stunning visual proof of this

01:11.520 --> 01:18.880
fundamental theorem runs like this. Take four copies of the triangle and combine them into a

01:18.880 --> 01:25.920
large square like this. Okay, this large square is partly covered by the four triangles.

01:26.800 --> 01:32.240
The area that's not covered is what? Well, c squared, of course. Now move one of the little

01:32.240 --> 01:38.720
triangles just a little bit. How large is the blue area now? Well, still c squared, of course.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.880
How about now? Still c squared. And this will be true no matter how we position the triangles

01:44.880 --> 01:51.280
inside the blue square as long as they don't overlap, right? Okay, ready for a big aha moment?

01:51.280 --> 01:57.200
Move the triangles one more time. No overlaps. And so the area is still c squared. However,

01:57.200 --> 02:04.400
this area is also a squared plus b squared. And so a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.080
What an amazingly simple and beautiful proof. What a killer punchline. Don't you think? All right.

02:10.080 --> 02:18.400
Now, how about this? The area of the large square is equal to the area of the little square

02:18.960 --> 02:26.400
plus the area of the four triangles. Okay, the area of the large square is a plus b squared.

02:26.400 --> 02:32.640
The area of the little square is c squared. And the area of one of the right angle triangles is

02:33.360 --> 02:40.560
one half base thumbs height, one half a times b. Now simply go on algebra autopilot. There's two

02:41.200 --> 02:50.000
over there. We expand and we cancel and a squared plus b squared equals c squared. Fantastic again.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.920
Well, maybe not quite as fantastic as the first proof, but still fantastic. Just out of interest,

02:55.920 --> 03:00.640
can you let me know in the comments which of these two twisted square proofs you were already

03:00.640 --> 03:06.960
familiar with and when and where you first came across them? Will be interesting. Of course,

03:06.960 --> 03:12.160
most kids never get to see either proof, which in my book is a crime which should entitle them to

03:12.160 --> 03:17.360
get their money back from their schools. As well, most school textbooks that feature a proof only

03:17.360 --> 03:23.840
mention the second less spectacular algebraic one. Go figure. Anyway, no matter how pretty these

03:23.840 --> 03:30.800
proofs are, that's really all there is to this iconic diagram, right? Wrong. There's more, lots

03:30.800 --> 03:37.360
and lots more. There's from our four square theorem, the tri-thagorean theorem, the bug chasing vertex,

03:38.160 --> 03:46.000
vortex and much more ready to be amazed. Here we go. The twisted square diagram has been around

03:46.000 --> 03:50.800
for a couple thousand years and features in the earliest documented proof of Pythagoras theorem,

03:50.800 --> 03:54.960
which is part of an ancient Chinese manuscript on astronomy and mathematics.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.480
Well, Pythagoras neither discovered his theorem nor was he the first to prove it,

04:00.480 --> 04:05.600
and so to have a theorem named after him is really a bit of a scandal in mathematics. Anyway,

04:05.600 --> 04:12.400
let's have a look inside the manuscript. What you find there is pages upon pages of this. Well,

04:12.400 --> 04:17.440
maybe not surprising. Lots and lots of Chinese characters. However, eventually we come across

04:17.440 --> 04:25.440
a page featuring our diagram. Well, that's definitely our diagram, but there's a bit more

04:25.440 --> 04:31.600
to this drawing, isn't there? There, a second very different twisted square diagram made up

04:31.600 --> 04:38.560
of the same four right angle triangles. Let us push them around a bit. In fact,

04:38.560 --> 04:42.640
the second diagram can also be used to prove Pythagoras theorem in two different ways,

04:42.640 --> 04:48.320
one algebraic and one based on shuffling triangles. Just looking at areas, again,

04:48.320 --> 04:54.000
we have four times the area of the triangle plus the area of the little square is equal to the

04:54.000 --> 05:00.320
area of the large square. Expressing this identity in terms of a, b and c and some algebra autopilot

05:00.320 --> 05:06.080
spits out a squared plus b squared equals c squared in pretty much exactly the same way as before.

05:06.080 --> 05:12.720
On the other hand, the c squared area of the large square stays unchanged when we move some

05:12.720 --> 05:21.360
of the triangles. And so c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared also very pretty. And in a

05:21.360 --> 05:25.760
way, this proof is even slicker than the first triangle shuffle proof, since we only have to

05:25.760 --> 05:37.120
shuffle two of the triangles instead of all four. The Chinese drawing also features a grid.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.960
What's that grid for? Well, it's clear that no matter what right angle triangle you start with,

05:42.960 --> 05:48.240
everything we set so far will stay true. Of course, this is very important. Otherwise,

05:48.240 --> 05:51.920
none of our proofs would actually count as a general proof of Pythagoras theorem.

05:52.640 --> 05:58.320
On the other hand, the grid shows that in our example, we're dealing with a super famous

05:58.320 --> 06:03.520
right angle triangle. Can you see it? Yep, it's a 345 right angle triangle.

06:05.280 --> 06:11.840
3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared. 345, the prototype Pythagorean triple, a

06:11.840 --> 06:16.240
triple of integers that satisfies the equation a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.120
Since we've all been familiar with the 345 triples since kindergarten,

06:21.120 --> 06:25.840
we're taking the fact that such triples exist for granted, that the existence of such

06:25.840 --> 06:32.240
integer triples is in fact a little bit of a miracle is illustrated by Fermat's last theorem,

06:32.240 --> 06:40.000
which says that if you change the exponent to 3, 4 or any other larger integer, the equation will

06:40.000 --> 06:46.720
not have any positive integer solutions. But of course, the wonderful 345 Pythagorean triple

06:46.720 --> 06:52.560
does exist. And you get more of these wonderful integer triples by simply changing the number

06:52.560 --> 06:59.440
of lines in the grid. There, doubling the number of grid lines gives this. 6 squared plus 8 squared

06:59.440 --> 07:06.240
equals 10 squared. Easy, and tripling gives this. But there are also other essentially different

07:06.240 --> 07:12.880
Pythagorean triples, and many of you will be familiar with this particular one, right? 51213,

07:12.880 --> 07:18.400
5 squared plus 12 squared equals 13 squared. Anyway, there are infinitely many essentially

07:18.400 --> 07:23.440
different Pythagorean triples. And let me just mention that we know how to construct all of them

07:23.440 --> 07:28.880
pretty easily. And of course, we can use any of these triples to make up one of our diagrams.

07:29.760 --> 07:35.920
But let's stick with 345. Alright, let's have another close look. How many squares are there?

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, there's this one, and that one. And one more. The area of the little square is one squared.

07:44.720 --> 07:52.880
Okay. The area of this green square is 5 squared. And what about the largest one? Well,

07:52.880 --> 08:03.120
3 plus 4 is 7, and so the area is 7 squared. Cool. Now, what is 25 minus 1? 25 minus 1? That's

08:03.120 --> 08:13.760
24, of course. Okay. What about 49 minus 25? You got it? 49 minus 25. It's also 24. Interesting.

08:13.760 --> 08:20.480
Both differences are the same. Is that a coincidence? What do you think? Well, no. That we get the

08:20.480 --> 08:26.400
same difference is always true. And it's also really easy to see. Have a look. What's the difference

08:26.400 --> 08:31.520
between blue and green? Well, that's just the area of four copies of our right angle triangle.

08:32.320 --> 08:38.000
And how about the difference between the green and the orange? Same thing, of course. Let's shuffle

08:38.000 --> 08:46.560
them around. Very pretty, isn't it? So, what this means is that within the square numbers,

08:46.560 --> 08:52.960
we can find three equally spaced squares, and that every Pythagorean triple translates into three

08:52.960 --> 09:04.160
such special squares. Okay. So, that's what we get for 345. And here is what we get if we double

09:04.160 --> 09:12.720
the number of grid lines. There. Now, in maths, an arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers

09:12.720 --> 09:19.360
in which consecutive terms differ by a fixed amount like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc., with a common

09:19.360 --> 09:26.640
difference of 2 or 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., with a common difference of 3. And so, another way of expressing

09:26.640 --> 09:32.320
this equal difference business at hand is to say that there are arithmetic progressions of length

09:32.320 --> 09:39.200
3 within the squares. Okay. This fact was already known to the great 17th century mathematician

09:39.200 --> 09:44.880
Pierre de Fermat, whose super famous last theorem I mentioned just a moment ago. And this fact prompted

09:44.880 --> 09:51.280
Pierre de Fermat to ask a very natural question. What do you think that question was? Well, he

09:51.280 --> 09:58.640
asked, are there any longer arithmetic progressions hiding in the squares? Right? Here we've got four,

09:58.640 --> 10:12.480
plus 96 is 100, plus 96 is 196. What if we add another 96? Do we get another square? That would

10:12.560 --> 10:22.160
then be an arithmetic progression of length 4. Well, no, because 196 plus 96 is 292, and 292 is not a

10:22.160 --> 10:27.920
square. But in general, are there arithmetic progressions of four squares or five squares? How

10:27.920 --> 10:33.920
long can such progressions be? What do you think? Well, this is a tricky one. Let me try to confuse

10:33.920 --> 10:39.600
you a little bit more. In 2004, the mathematical superstars Ben Green and Terry Tau approved

10:39.600 --> 10:44.080
that there are, in fact, arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths among the primes.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.800
Insane, right? Here's one of lengths 5 that we've been staring at all your life without realizing

10:50.800 --> 10:58.560
it. There, 5 plus 6 is 11, plus 6 is 17, plus 6 is 23, plus 6 is 29, and arithmetic progression of

10:58.560 --> 11:05.840
five primes was common difference 6. Anyway, how long can arithmetic progressions of squares get?

11:06.560 --> 11:12.800
Well, Fermat figured out that, in fact, 3 is the surprising answer. You cannot do any better

11:12.800 --> 11:16.800
than the many sequences that our diagram produces from Pythagorean triples.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.280
Allegedly, Fermat also had a proof, but nobody knows what that proof looked like exactly.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.240
A situation similar to that with his famous last theorem, where he also claimed to have a proof,

11:28.240 --> 11:33.760
but none was found in his writings. Here's a quote from the well-known Australian number

11:33.760 --> 11:39.440
theorist, Alf van der Poorten. Here's what he writes. I looked this up in reference 3 and found

11:39.440 --> 11:45.680
at page 54 the unhelpful footnote, Fermat could show by descent that one cannot have four squares

11:45.680 --> 11:50.720
in arithmetic progression. Jerry Meissen has pointed me to a reference, but the argument there seems

11:50.720 --> 11:58.080
utterly soulless. And I remain searching for a decent descent argument warranty report to you.

11:58.080 --> 12:03.680
Now, that's really funny. I decided recently that such a proof was most readily found on a previously

12:03.760 --> 12:09.360
blank page of my notebook. So he decided that everything seen so far is useless. He's going

12:09.360 --> 12:15.120
to make up a proof himself. And here's what he ended up writing in his notebook. This is the

12:15.120 --> 12:20.560
nicest and most natural proof of Fermat's four square theorem that I'm aware of. And it may very

12:20.560 --> 12:26.000
well be similar to what Fermat came up with a couple hundred years ago. I won't go into the

12:26.000 --> 12:31.600
nitty gritty details here. Let me just say that this proof features the kind of infinite descent

12:31.600 --> 12:37.280
argument that we've already encountered a couple of times in mythology videos. At its core is a

12:37.280 --> 12:43.280
well-known construction of all known Pythagorean triples. And so it appears that this proof may

12:43.280 --> 12:48.080
have had its origin in the little Pythagorean triple construction that this talked about.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.840
Now Pythagoras theorem has been around for thousands of years. And so you would think that

12:59.840 --> 13:05.840
everything worth discovering about Pythagoras theorem was discovered a long time ago. Far from

13:05.840 --> 13:11.840
it. What I'll talk about now was only discovered around 20 years ago. Okay. So instead of twisting

13:11.840 --> 13:18.480
squares, we now twist equilateral triangles. Let's try to mimic as much as possible what we did

13:18.480 --> 13:25.360
before. So instead of right angle triangles, we start with a triangle that features a 60 degree

13:25.360 --> 13:33.520
angle. Make three copies. Arrange them into a large equilateral triangle. Okay. Next we have to

13:33.520 --> 13:38.320
shuffle the triangles around. Now after a bit of fiddling, it turns out that for this to prove

13:38.320 --> 13:43.600
something interesting, we have to get rid of one of the red triangles first. There. Go away triangle.

13:43.600 --> 13:50.080
Go away, go away, go away. Now shuffle. Not much of a shuffle, but anyway. Looks promising.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.560
As before, side by side or two diagrams amount to an equation.

13:55.760 --> 13:59.280
Cancel two triangles each on the left and right sides of this equation.

14:00.480 --> 14:06.880
So what's left? Well, we've got one equilateral triangle each for the three sides A, B and C of

14:06.880 --> 14:14.880
our original triangle. Let's name the areas of these triangles like this. Okay. Using these names,

14:14.880 --> 14:23.200
our identity looks like this. Watch it. It's coming. Oh, fantastic. A trithagorean theorem

14:23.200 --> 14:29.680
for 60 degree triangles. Note that in the real trithagoras, the A and B areas add up exactly

14:29.680 --> 14:36.080
to the C area. That's almost also works in this trithagorean theorem, right? So here we've got

14:36.080 --> 14:41.840
A area plus B area equals C area plus, well, there's a little bit of a correction term,

14:41.840 --> 14:49.280
a really nice correction term, the area of the original triangle T. Okay. For the next surprise,

14:49.280 --> 14:54.800
let's make the 60 degree angle into a right angle, but keep the equilateral triangles on the sides.

14:55.360 --> 15:02.640
Experts, what am I about to say? Well, we can make the identity on top work by simply removing the

15:02.640 --> 15:09.200
T. Really? Yes. Pithagoras not only works for squares, but also for equilateral triangles.

15:09.200 --> 15:16.320
A area plus B area equals C area. Exactly. In fact, even better, Pithagoras works for

15:16.320 --> 15:21.680
three suitably scaled copies of any shape, glued to the sides of a right angle triangle.

15:21.680 --> 15:27.520
Semi circles, capital M for mythology, anything whatsoever. I already talked about this at length

15:27.520 --> 15:33.120
in a separate video on Pithagoras theorem a couple of years ago. Also, check out that video.

15:33.360 --> 15:45.600
60 is 90 minus 30. On the other hand, 90 plus 30 is 120. And it turns out that just like 60 degree

15:45.600 --> 15:52.160
triangles, 120 degree triangles also have a nice Trithagorean theorem. The only difference between

15:52.160 --> 16:00.000
these two Trithagorean theorems is that the plus correction term turns into a minus correction term.

16:00.720 --> 16:07.440
Also nice, isn't it? Anyway, back to 60 degree triangles. Well, our Trithagorean theorem is

16:07.440 --> 16:13.120
very cute. However, it is definitely not as applicable as Pithagoras theorem, right? If you

16:13.120 --> 16:18.400
give me the length of any two sides of a right angle triangle, Pithagoras immediately tells me

16:18.400 --> 16:25.920
what the third length is. Not so with our Trithagorean identity. However, there's also a nice

16:26.000 --> 16:31.040
a squared plus b squared equals c squared Pithagoras counterpart for 60 degree triangles

16:31.040 --> 16:35.520
that is just as applicable as its 90 degree original. Here it is.

16:37.840 --> 16:45.680
a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared plus a times b. Super nice. And also very easy to

16:45.680 --> 16:50.960
see why this is true if you know the cosine rule, a generalization of Pithagoras to general triangles

16:51.680 --> 16:58.800
taught as part of Trigonometry. Well, that's all good. But here's another nice way to conjure up

16:58.800 --> 17:03.440
this identity, which also shows that it's simply another way of writing our original

17:05.360 --> 17:11.680
Trithagorean identity. Let's call the area of the equilateral triangle with sides of lengths one,

17:11.680 --> 17:19.440
f. There, f is that red area. Then the 60 degree triangle with sides a and b bound in the 60 degree

17:19.440 --> 17:26.800
angle has area, really easy, a times b times f. Yeah, that guy has area a times b times f.

17:26.800 --> 17:32.960
Bit of a challenge. Can you see at a glance why this is the case? If you can, let us know in the

17:32.960 --> 17:42.560
comments. Anyway, this means t is equal to a times b times f. What about the area of the a triangle?

17:42.560 --> 17:48.480
Well, this is an equilateral triangle. And so all its sides are equal to a. And so its area is

17:48.480 --> 17:55.760
a times a times f, a squared times f. And similarly with b and c equilateral triangles.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.880
Now it comes next. Can you see it? Of course, we just divide by f and we're done.

18:03.600 --> 18:09.760
Slicker. What about Trithagorean Chipples counterparts to 345 and company?

18:11.520 --> 18:15.280
Are there 60 degree triangles with integer sides? What do you think?

18:16.000 --> 18:21.040
Well, he should be able to answer that one. Are there 60 degree triangles with integer sides?

18:21.760 --> 18:27.760
Of course there are. Any equilateral triangle with integer lengths sides will work. 1 1 1,

18:27.760 --> 18:35.680
2 2 2 and so on. Obvious. What about other 60 degree triangles? Not so obvious, but yes,

18:35.680 --> 18:40.000
there are such triangles. In fact, our example over there is such a triangle.

18:40.080 --> 18:47.280
387 works. Check for yourself that this triple really satisfies the equation 3 squared plus

18:47.280 --> 18:54.480
8 squared equals 7 squared plus 3 times 8. Well, if I ever change the mythology logo from a twisted

18:54.480 --> 19:00.720
square to a twisted equilateral triangle, I'll base it on this special 387 triple of integers.

19:00.720 --> 19:06.640
Something like this. What do you think? Time for a change of logo? Anyway, the official name for

19:06.720 --> 19:13.520
our Trithagorean integer triple is Eisenstein triples named after the 19th century genius

19:13.520 --> 19:20.160
mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein. Just like with Pythagorean triples, there are infinitely many

19:20.160 --> 19:25.360
essentially different Eisenstein triples. Okay, well, before I move on, here's something really,

19:25.360 --> 19:34.320
really cute. Overlaying these two triangles immediately gives us second Eisenstein triple.

19:34.320 --> 19:41.120
Can you see that? No? Well, let's just do it, right? The sides of this blue 60 degree triangle are

19:41.920 --> 19:51.040
7, 8 and 8 minus 3 equals 5. There, a new Eisenstein triple, 5, 8, 7. Nice, huh? Here's

19:51.040 --> 19:59.120
something else that you like. I'm pretty sure you like this one. Okay, super imposing. These two

19:59.120 --> 20:06.400
triangles gives the red 120 degree triangle as integer sides. This triangle has sides 7, 3 and

20:06.400 --> 20:13.920
8 minus 3 is 5. Also, to get the ABC identity 420 degree triangles, just change the plus in front

20:13.920 --> 20:21.360
of the AB to a minus. Also super pretty. Anyway, do these triangular twists to the original Pythagorean

20:21.360 --> 20:35.680
theorem get your seal of approval? I sure hope so. Okay, so we have this pair of diagrams for

20:35.680 --> 20:43.600
equilateral triangles and this very similar pair for squares. We can make these two pictures look

20:43.600 --> 20:51.120
even more similar by relocating these two triangles there. Now a bit of a facelift.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.960
Very pretty, don't you think? Anyway, while preparing for this mythology video, I discovered

20:56.960 --> 21:03.600
a third type of diagram that nicely complements this pair. What does this diagram show? Well,

21:04.560 --> 21:08.960
the white triangles are all the same. There are 12 of them on the left and 6 on the right.

21:08.960 --> 21:16.720
So let's cancel 6 on both sides. Do the usual thing here.

21:19.360 --> 21:24.880
Also beautiful, the Hexagorean theorem. Ready for another nice aha moment? Okay,

21:24.880 --> 21:29.120
divide by 6. What's a regular Hexagon divided by 6? Well, let's see.

21:31.680 --> 21:38.160
Here, the Hexagorean theorem for 120 degree triangles divided by 6 is the Trithagorean

21:38.160 --> 21:44.160
theorem for 120 degree triangles. You saw it first on mythology. As I already mentioned,

21:44.160 --> 21:48.880
all the twisted triangle shuffle stuff only seems to have been around for about 20 years.

21:48.880 --> 21:54.240
Over there is a painting of amateur mathematician Wayne Roberts created in 2003,

21:54.240 --> 21:59.680
which is one of the possible origins of the nice triangle shuffle proof of our Trithagorean theorem.

21:59.680 --> 22:04.320
This painting was also the inspiration for the way I purified the diagrams in this chapter.

22:09.520 --> 22:20.320
Back to the original twisted square diagram. Have a look at this.

22:20.880 --> 22:30.800
What you've just witnessed is yet another really weird

22:30.800 --> 22:35.120
proof of Pythagoras based on the twisted square diagram, right? It's another proof.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.560
The top two squares have the same area as the bottom square,

22:38.560 --> 22:43.600
because it's possible to chop the top squares into 10 pieces that can be reassembled exactly

22:43.600 --> 22:51.200
into the large square at the bottom. There. Really wonderful and unexpected, isn't it?

22:51.200 --> 22:56.560
With an added bonus miracle being the overall shape at the top and bottom dissections,

22:56.560 --> 23:01.840
which mirror the two diagrams in our original proof. Of course, with all these visual proofs,

23:01.840 --> 23:06.800
it's very important to chase around the angles and lengths in these diagrams to make sure that

23:06.800 --> 23:11.760
looks are not deceiving. That things really fit together exactly as suggested by our pictures,

23:11.760 --> 23:17.360
for all possible choices of right angle triangles. Anyway, I checked. Trust me.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.880
And if you don't trust me, check for yourself. Here's another miraculous

23:20.880 --> 23:24.000
chop up proof based on the twisted square diagram.

23:24.560 --> 23:51.600
There are a number of interesting properties of right angle triangles that appear to be very

23:51.600 --> 23:57.440
mysterious at first sight. But once you remember the twisted squares, it all becomes crystal clear

23:57.440 --> 24:04.240
in a flash. Here are three great examples. Okay, take any right angle triangle and attach the square

24:04.240 --> 24:10.320
on the hypotenuse. Next, draw the line that cuts the right angle in two. Okay, now, no matter what

24:10.320 --> 24:15.520
right triangle you started with, this line will always pass through the center of the square.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.360
Now, if you encounter this property in the wild, it will most likely come as quite a surprise.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.160
But then you remember your twisted squares. And now everything's clear. Drawing one of the

24:28.160 --> 24:33.920
diagonals of the big square. Obviously, this diagonal cuts the right angles in half.

24:34.800 --> 24:41.040
And it is also clear that it passes through the center of the square. Ta-da! Nice. I hope you

24:41.120 --> 24:45.920
still experienced a bit of an aha moment despite me advertising the twisted squares

24:45.920 --> 24:54.640
as the solution in advance. Okay, second property. And here's how it's usually presented. Start with

24:54.640 --> 25:00.160
a square and insert a right angle triangle like this. Make three copies and attach them

25:00.160 --> 25:06.800
to the remaining sides. Now, what's the special property? Pretty obvious, right? All right

25:06.880 --> 25:13.520
angles are on a line. Very pretty. Again, very hard to see why this should be the case unless you

25:13.520 --> 25:28.640
remember our twisted squares. One more. There are hundreds of different proofs of Pythagoras

25:28.640 --> 25:34.560
theorem. One of them is by the 20th American president, James Garfield. It runs like this.

25:34.560 --> 25:40.960
Start with a right angle triangle. Make a copy and complete the resulting figure into a trapezium.

25:40.960 --> 25:46.880
Now, as usual, calculate the area for this trapezium in two different ways. First, using the formula

25:46.880 --> 25:53.360
for the trapezium and then by adding up the area of the three triangles. Then some algebra

25:53.360 --> 25:59.920
order pilot and outcomes a squared plus b squared equals c squared. All by now a complete no-brainer,

25:59.920 --> 26:06.480
I hope. But doesn't this trapezium remind you of something? Yes, of course. It's just

26:06.480 --> 26:11.760
half our favorite diagram. And really, on close inspection, President Garfield's proof

26:11.760 --> 26:18.640
is exactly our original algebraic proof divided by two. And so really nothing new. But of course,

26:18.640 --> 26:23.760
I can see why it's great to be able to tell kids that being good at maths and becoming an American

26:23.760 --> 26:29.840
president can go together. And so for propaganda purposes, let's also say in the future that

26:29.840 --> 26:33.760
an American president came up with a new proof of Pythagoras theorem.

26:39.840 --> 26:45.200
Having fun so far? Right. Let's start with this special case of our twisted square diagram with

26:45.200 --> 26:52.240
the little blue square twisted 45 degrees. Let's squish the diagram a bit. Okay. Okay. Shuffling

26:52.240 --> 26:58.720
the triangles as usual is still possible. There, there, there. Let's say the sides of the blue

26:58.720 --> 27:04.800
rectangles are root a and root b. Why root a and not just a? Well, don't worry about it.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.800
Whatever the lengths are in the diagram, we can certainly write them as square roots of some

27:08.800 --> 27:16.640
numbers. Now, the area of one of the two rectangles is root a times b. Okay. Now, what about the

27:16.640 --> 27:24.880
diagram on the right? Using Pythagoras, we can see that one side of the blue rhombus is root

27:24.880 --> 27:31.520
a plus b. Okay. The blue area on the left is two times root a times b,

27:33.440 --> 27:40.160
which is equal to the area of the blue rhombus on the right, as usual. But this area is definitely

27:40.160 --> 27:45.680
not larger than that of the square with sides of exactly the same lengths. Right.

27:45.840 --> 27:56.080
Well, the area of both the rhombus and the square are based on side. Both shapes have

27:56.080 --> 28:02.080
the same base, but the height of the square is larger and so its area is also larger.

28:02.800 --> 28:08.560
Clear this way, right? What's the area of the square? Easy.

28:08.640 --> 28:19.040
Now, this is a very famous inequality between the two most useful types of averaging two positive

28:19.040 --> 28:24.720
numbers, the geometric mean on the left and the arithmetic mean on the right. So what we've just

28:24.720 --> 28:32.160
proved is that the geometric mean of two positive numbers is always less or equal to their arithmetic

28:32.160 --> 28:40.080
mean. Okay, let's modify what we just started with. First on the left, then reshuffled on the right,

28:40.080 --> 28:45.440
we get this tilted parallelogram. Now, if we do exactly the same as we just did with a different

28:45.440 --> 28:50.960
sort of labeling, we get another super famous inequality, the so-called Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.160
We need a bit more maths background to be able to appreciate that one. And so I'll just do an

28:56.160 --> 29:01.120
animation of the relevant bits at the end of this video for those of you in the know and interested.

29:02.960 --> 29:07.760
But I also would like to show you one more surprising completely different application that

29:07.760 --> 29:13.600
everybody watching will be able to appreciate. To set it up, we modify things a bit more. First,

29:13.600 --> 29:19.440
we swap the two diagrams and now we adjust so that all the sides of the parallelogram

29:19.440 --> 29:26.720
are equal to one. Then we'll write things change like this. Okay, now pencil in some of the angles.

29:27.440 --> 29:33.040
Then the length of the sides of our triangles will be the signs and cosines of these angles,

29:33.040 --> 29:40.480
like this. There, there, there, and there. I'm pretty obvious that this is correct, right?

29:40.480 --> 29:46.480
Let's shuffle them over to the other side. That's where we need them. Also, we can find the two

29:46.480 --> 29:54.240
angles again inside the blue parallelogram. Let's just do that too. Here, it comes around here,

29:54.240 --> 30:00.240
the better shows up here. And so this angle is just alpha plus beta. Okay, in terms of areas of

30:00.240 --> 30:06.560
the blue regions, what have we got? Well, on the right, it's completely obvious. What about on the

30:06.560 --> 30:12.320
left? Let's have a look. Still animating around, almost there. The area of the parallelogram is

30:12.320 --> 30:18.880
equal to base times height. Base is one and height. Well, that's just the sign of alpha plus beta,

30:18.880 --> 30:22.640
right? And so the area, base times height, is this.

30:28.160 --> 30:35.120
Very nice. And so in total, we get the addition formula for our sign. How nice is that? Do you

30:35.120 --> 30:44.400
see that one coming? Let's finish off with something totally different. Start with a square and

30:44.400 --> 30:49.920
place some bugs on the corners of the square. Let's say that at some point in time, each bug

30:49.920 --> 30:55.280
will start running towards the bug it is facing right now, that all four bugs will always be running

30:55.280 --> 31:00.720
at the same constant speed towards each other. With a setup like this, what are some natural

31:00.720 --> 31:07.280
questions to ask? Well, how about this? Will the bugs ever catch up to each other? If they do,

31:07.280 --> 31:12.000
how long will their journeys be? What are the equations of their journeys? Which way will

31:12.000 --> 31:17.440
they be facing when they meet? How do things change if we use different starting configurations,

31:17.440 --> 31:23.440
numbers of bugs, etc. Lots of mathematical fun to be had here. Some of these problems and their

31:23.440 --> 31:28.160
very surprising answers were made popular by the famous mathematics popularizer Martin Gardner

31:28.160 --> 31:35.200
in his column in the July 1965 column of the Scientific American. Let me show you a nice

31:35.200 --> 31:40.960
twisted square way to get a feel for what's going on here and for how to come up with answers to

31:40.960 --> 31:46.800
some of our questions. First, ask the bugs to forget about Martin Gardner's instructions. Instead,

31:46.800 --> 31:52.000
ask them to run along one-fifths of the sides of the square and then stop, like this. Now,

31:52.000 --> 31:58.400
ask them to turn towards each other like this. Whoa, twisted squares! And we've arrived back

31:58.400 --> 32:04.400
at the starting configuration just with a slightly smaller rotated square. Now, let's ask the bugs

32:04.400 --> 32:09.600
to repeat everything they've done so far over and over. So, cover one-fifths, turn towards

32:09.600 --> 32:18.960
each other, cover one-fifths, turn towards each other and so on. Go again, go again and pretty

32:18.960 --> 32:25.840
spectacular, isn't it? Now, two simple observations. First, because of the symmetry of everything

32:25.840 --> 32:30.720
that's happening here, the bugs will form a square at all times, pretty clear, right? Second,

32:30.720 --> 32:36.720
from the way we repeat the same overall movement over and over, it follows that from one square to

32:36.720 --> 32:43.120
the next, we are rotating the orientation of squares by the same angle and we scale the size

32:43.120 --> 32:49.360
down by the same factor. Also pretty easy, right? Conclusions from this. Since we scale down by a

32:49.360 --> 32:55.120
fixed factor, the size of the squares will decrease, but we'll do so infinitely often. Hence, there

32:55.120 --> 33:01.760
are infinitely many squares and the sizes will shrink to zero. And since the orientations of

33:01.760 --> 33:08.640
consecutive squares differ by a fixed angle and there are infinitely many squares, on their journey,

33:08.640 --> 33:13.440
ideal bugs will circle the center infinitely often, right? So, there's one angle and we do this

33:13.440 --> 33:19.520
infinitely, so it goes do, do, do, do, do. That's a bit unexpected, isn't it? Now, does this mean

33:19.520 --> 33:25.040
that the bug's path is infinitely long? It's circling infinitely often, so is it infinitely long?

33:25.040 --> 33:29.440
Actually, no. Although these paths wind infinitely often around the center, they are of finite

33:29.440 --> 33:34.960
lengths. Let's figure out how long one of these paths actually is. If the side of the square is

33:34.960 --> 33:41.040
one unit long, a bug walks one-fifths of one and one-fifths of one is 0.2. The remaining distance

33:41.040 --> 33:47.840
is 0.8. Okay? We find the side lengths of the smaller square with Pythagoras. It's approximately

33:47.840 --> 33:55.600
0.825. Since the outer side lengths 1 shrinks to 0.825 in the second square, we conclude

33:55.600 --> 34:02.160
that 0.825 is the factor by which the squares shrink. This allows us to figure out the lengths of

34:02.160 --> 34:08.000
all the segments of one of the bug's paths, right? Since the first segment is 0.2 long,

34:08.000 --> 34:15.360
the second segment is 0.2 times 0.825 long. To get the length of the next segment,

34:15.360 --> 34:23.680
we just have to multiply by 0.825 again, there, squared, and so on. There, cubed, power four.

34:23.680 --> 34:29.280
This means that the total length of the path is this. All right. Now, the infinite series in the

34:29.280 --> 34:35.200
brackets is a geometric series. Since you're still here, chances are you know the formula for the sum

34:35.200 --> 34:41.280
of a geometric series by heart. It's just 1 over 1 minus the scale factor. With this, the overall

34:41.280 --> 34:48.800
length of the path pens out to be this. And this is approximately 1.14, which is a little bit longer

34:48.800 --> 34:53.440
than one of the sides of the square. Interesting. Now, we've reduced the fraction of the sides

34:53.440 --> 35:01.280
covered by the bugs from 0.2 to 0.1. The numbers change like this. Uh-huh. The length of the path

35:01.280 --> 35:06.800
is even closer to 1. In fact, if we let the fraction of the sides covered by the bugs go to 0,

35:06.800 --> 35:10.480
the picture will turn into the picture that corresponds to the original Martin Gardner

35:10.480 --> 35:16.880
problem. And the length of the paths of the bugs in the original problem can be seen to be exactly

35:16.880 --> 35:23.040
1. How nice an answer is that? By the way, this was the picture on the cover of Martin Gardner's

35:23.040 --> 35:28.960
Scientific American article. Again, the bugs pass exactly as long as the sides of the square.

35:29.600 --> 35:34.880
It's a pretty surprising answer, yes. But in hindsight, is there maybe a simpler way to see why

35:34.880 --> 35:40.560
the bugs path should be exactly as long as their original distance apart? Again, leave your thoughts

35:40.560 --> 35:47.120
in the comments. I could report on many more ingenious results as far as bugs chasing bugs

35:47.120 --> 35:51.920
are concerned, but let's call it a day for today. If you're interested in more neat details about

35:51.920 --> 35:56.080
any of the topics touched upon today, check out the links in the description of this video.

35:57.200 --> 36:03.040
Okay, one last nice insight. Early on, we encountered two types of twisted square diagrams,

36:03.040 --> 36:09.360
this one and that one. There's actually a third one in this third diagram to triangle's overlap.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.520
Here, then, is your final puzzle. Let's say A is equal to one-half and B is equal to one,

36:15.520 --> 36:22.000
as in this example. What is the area of the square in the middle? Once again,

36:22.000 --> 36:27.840
leave your hopefully surprising answers in the comments. Okay, and that's it from me for today.

36:27.840 --> 36:32.640
As promised, I'll leave you with an animation of the proof for the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

36:32.640 --> 36:34.720
in the case of two numbers, A and B.
