0	5600	Is the romantic archetype of the great artist finished? And if so, what is replacing it?
6800	14480	No, I don't think it is finished. I think there are still absolutely great artists who produce
14480	21040	work that's on a level with which only a small few others produce anything comparable.
21840	28800	And I think you can find hierarchies of artistic production in most
30000	36800	cultures in the world and in most periods in history. Whether the particular archetype
36800	43920	that was promoted by the romantics and the idea of the somewhat aloof artist and the
43920	49520	artist as a seer of special truths not really available to anyone else. Whether that has the
49520	54880	same currency today as it might have had in the early 90s century, I'm less sure. But I still think
54880	64160	there are absolutely great artists and I still think it's important that art forms a type of
64160	70640	activity which interacts with a wider society but doesn't just simply mirror it or isn't simply
70640	77360	determined with it by it. So I do believe in art existing in a dialectical relationship with the
77360	84000	rest of society and culture. And I do distinguish the words art and culture and that's even allowing
84000	89520	for multiple different meanings of the term culture itself. Right. Well, there are those who would
89520	93840	say that the very idea of the great artist is something that should be called into question
93840	100880	in the sense that it seems to indicate what would you say, well, a hierarchy to begin with,
100880	106800	a hierarchy of competence or of importance that some would call into question. They would instead
106800	112560	espouse perhaps a more flat horizon, a more flat landscape in which everybody potentially can
112560	119120	contribute as opposed to the, I'm caricaturing this perhaps, but the great man archetype of
119120	123360	people like Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, Kandinsky, Schoenberg and so on.
124400	131840	Well, I'd ask if they would extend that anti-hierarchical view into popular culture, say. I mean,
132800	139120	would they say that the reason why Taylor Swift or Beyonc√© are such global superstars compared
139120	143120	to many others that only a small community ever heard of, is that entirely arbitrary?
144480	149920	Is that not something to do with how they sing, how they dance, how they perform, the things that
149920	155120	they do sing or whatever? I mean, this is putting whatever views I might have about either of those
155360	162800	artists to one side, but I don't really believe anyone truly thinks that there are no distinctions
162800	170560	and no hierarchies between different types of artists in whatever form. And, you know, if it's
170560	174960	just down to a simpler thing as a conversation between two people who've been watching something
174960	179760	on television the previous evening, they'll often talk about what they thought of it,
179840	186400	how good it was. One might think it's better than the other does. You're already setting up a hierarchy
186400	194240	in that very process. Value judgment, I think, is a very common and perhaps even intrinsic human
194240	200720	activity when confronted with art, confronted with culture. And it's only perhaps a small few
200720	206320	academics, including semester musicologists and anthropologists, who seem to think you can
207200	213680	totally bracket out value judgment or is it somehow, it's some great sin. I don't think so.
213680	218560	I think it goes on all the time. And the moment you have value judgments about any culture,
218560	222000	then you create hierarchies between those who produce it.
222000	227040	Okay. I want to stay on this question of artistic greatness, of the great artist for a moment,
227040	232720	because this is very much on my mind at present. First of all, how would you define a great artist
232720	237520	in the present day context? What would that sort of a figure do and what would their role be within
237520	244880	society? Right. Well, those are two quite different questions, I think. I mean, very simply,
245840	250000	I'd say a great artist is one who produces a lot of great art, but I realize that doesn't
250000	258800	really answer the question then what constitutes great art. And I'm not sure if I can really
259040	265440	answer that question in any sort of comprehensive way. I can believe that such a thing like great
265440	272720	art does exist. But why exactly it's great and it's so much greater than a lot of other things
272720	277920	is often quite a complex question and needs to be addressed in each individual case.
278640	282240	If you could say this is what makes great art, that almost suggests that there's a
282240	286720	formula for producing it, which I don't believe there is.
286720	292240	Well, I think to start with, just to unravel this a little bit, the greatness of the art
292240	296880	does not reside only in the art itself. So it has something to do with the way the
296880	301600	art or indeed the artist interfaces with their society. And the greatness has something to do
301600	308640	with magnitude, to use a word that is perhaps not ideal, but the impact that the artist may be
308640	316640	having or may not be having. If the work is great but exists in a drawer and is not doing
316640	324160	anything real in the world besides merely existing, then can we ascribe greatness to that?
325760	331840	Well, last year I went to see the Vermeer exhibition that was on in Amsterdam, which is
331840	337360	absolutely incredible, probably the greatest art exhibition I've ever seen. Now I know that
337360	341840	Vermeer's paintings languished relatively unknown for quite an extended period until
341840	344560	they were rediscovered. I think it was some point in the 19th century.
348480	354640	Now they didn't have the impact that they have now in the earlier times, and they didn't have
354640	360560	a critical scholarly apparatus that developed around them, and which I do believe conditions
360560	365120	to some extent the reception of art, and I don't mean that in a negative way.
366080	373520	But I don't see any necessary reason why if they hadn't had that in earlier times,
373520	377360	they wouldn't have been thought just as great then. So what I'm trying to say from that is,
377360	384640	I don't think the reasons we think Vermeer is great now are limited to our current temporal
384640	390400	moment. I think it's something much more intrinsic in the art, which gives the potential for a
390400	396640	particular level of impact. But I don't think that is something grafted on artificially. I think
396640	402800	that has to somehow come out of the intrinsic qualities of the art itself, which to me is sort
402800	410160	of self-evidently monumental in Vermeer's case. So I'm just trying to remember the rest of your
410160	417200	question. Well, would there be... Is it more difficult to make a claim for greatness if the
417200	424640	artist is addressing perhaps an extraordinarily restricted audience, or perhaps even no one at
424640	429760	all, as opposed to... The Vermeer case is interesting because you could certainly put forth the argument
429760	436640	that Vermeer is addressing very simple universal concepts in his work that speak to a large number
436640	444000	of people. If we get into modernism and wherever it is we are now, you get into an archetype of
444000	454080	an artist that is extraordinarily, in many instances, detached from the reality of the
454080	461520	society in which they're living. And perhaps even dealing with artistic aesthetic concepts that are
461520	467120	so esoteric by their very nature that such universality, though it may be buried in there
467120	470800	somewhere, is going to be extraordinarily difficult for most people to locate.
470800	476640	I'll take two of the examples that you suggested before, Stravinsky and T.S. Eliot.
478640	486880	The means that they were using for conveying their art might have been, to some extent,
486880	492000	esoteric at the time, perhaps more so in Eliot's case than at least the early Stravinsky,
493920	497920	but I think they were dealing with concerns that were extremely
498880	505920	urgent at the time. In the early Stravinsky dealing with issues of primitivism, of folklorism,
505920	512320	with stylized barbarism and so on, which, for the works he was writing at the beginning of the
512320	518000	1910s, they now look incredibly prescient, I think, in knowledge of what happened in the
518000	522720	succeeding decades. In the case of Eliot, I mean, he was engaging with popular culture,
522720	533600	with sort of popular song and ballads and things like that, and looking at the modern city and the
533600	542080	whole alienation that came with that, and looking at the state of religion in his own time. These
542080	548400	were not very simply private concerns to Eliot himself. The way he assembled these into his
548400	555120	montage, like works of quite heavily, I would say, inspired by sort of Baudelaire's view of the city
555120	564560	as well, might have been part of a technical approach that was at that stage relatively
564560	572000	unfamiliar to readers, but those things have become absorbed into a much wider cultural
572000	580560	vernaculars. And so I suppose in both cases, I am questioning whether this work really was so cut
580560	585520	off from society, whether it was so esoteric, because I think it was dealing with sort of
585520	590480	very socially, in both cases, they were dealing with very socially and politically urgent things,
590480	597920	and I think they remain so. Now in their cases, whether those would still remain so in 200 years
597920	605280	from now, well, I can only guess. I believe so. I mean, again, I'm speculating there, but
605280	612960	I believe so in the same way that, you know, I can read Dante nowadays, and that is incredibly vivid
612960	622960	to me. Some of the more esoteric pieces of medieval theology take at least some sort of
623040	628320	extra annotations to understand, I find, certainly stuff in parody so. But nonetheless,
629120	638640	as a narrative, as a form of social commentary, when this incredible thing of deciding which
638640	645200	circles of hell you will consign people, you know, and public figures to, I think it's absolutely
645200	653200	gripping, even though it dates from the best part of a millennium ago. And I don't necessarily see
653200	660240	any reason why Stravinsky and Eliot won't be the same. I do think some very, very topical art
660240	668400	that deals with very, very much issues of their time, which do not necessarily project out much
668400	676480	further, tends to date a lot more. And this is a reason that I'm quite skeptical about a lot of
676480	684240	explicitly political art. No, not all. It's stuff that's absolutely rooted in response to concrete
684240	691760	events. Well, there's various reasons that I'm skeptical about it. One is the obvious one that
691760	698960	when those events cease to be current, the art loses a lot of its immediacy. But there's also
698960	703680	the issue of whether there's something exploitative about this, whether it's sort of rendering a
703680	708000	trustee's into art, whether it's taking some of the edge off them by rendering them aesthetic,
708000	712320	which is sort of how Adorno's critique of that worked.
712320	716480	Well, unless there's something in the style and substance of the work that is so transcendently
716480	722080	interesting that the pretext for its creation simply falls by the wayside. So for instance,
722080	728560	if you take, this is a random example, I suppose, but if you take the novels or the journalistic
728560	733680	work of Hunter S. Thompson, so the things that he was describing at the time are no longer of
733680	742640	particular public interest, their political events or events of the day that are now decades
742720	748400	beyond us. But nevertheless, there's something in the style, in the substance of those works
748400	751920	that is phenomenally interesting and that transcends the original subject matter.
752480	758240	So in the best case, in the best case, I think that the work can survive on that basis.
759040	766880	I absolutely agree. And that's a sort of testament to quite what a good writer Hunter S. Thompson
766880	773920	was. It's why it's probably a mistake to see his work primarily in terms of specific events
774560	779600	that he's looking at, but rather in terms of the much wider concerns that he's drawing out of them.
779600	784160	And yes, I could say that about any number of other things. I could say that about Guernica, for example.
788560	791680	So where does that leave the statement that I was just making before?
791840	797600	I think it's about sort of distinguishing,
800400	805040	I'm going to use some very old fashioned vocabulary here, distinguishing between
805680	810880	human concerns and localised political concerns.
811760	820480	Now, what would I'm trying to think of some other examples? I mean this...
821680	827840	Ode to Napoleon, for example, or the Eroica Symphony. I mean, you're entering into the realm
827840	834480	of archetypes and symbols and that, so there may be a contemporary pretext for producing the work.
835280	838480	It may refer on some level to a contemporary figure.
839200	842960	Well, let me give you another example of something of the opposite tendency,
842960	847280	but it's actually someone whose work I rather like. I don't know if you know his British playwright,
847280	848400	James Graham. No.
848960	853040	All right. Well, there's probably a reason why you don't know him and probably not many people
853040	858560	outside of Britain know him. He's very obsessed with British politics, as am I,
859680	864800	and he's written a whole load of plays which are dramatising particular events in British politics.
865760	872560	He wrote a play called The House, which is set in the House of Commons during the 70s,
872560	877920	and it's set in the whips office, the people who are whip up support for things, and it follows
877920	884080	all the machinations that go on and how exactly they manipulate people to get their vote. At a
884080	890720	particular time in British history where the Labour Party who were in power lost their majority
890720	896240	in the House of Commons through losing various by-elections, and even before they lost it,
896240	903760	it was down to one or two votes could mean whether they would lose or win some parliamentary votes.
905680	910560	Now, he traces this, and if you're interested in that, which I am, it's absolutely fascinating,
910560	916720	and he wrote a screenplay about how the Brexit campaign was managed by Dominic Cummings,
916720	925120	who was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in that. I say I enjoy his things, I'll always go and watch
925920	933120	the new ones, but I can see if you don't have that very specialised interest, I'm not sure how much
933120	937520	else would come out. I suppose something about the way the business of politics works in general,
938480	943600	for which parallels could be found in other contexts as well, but I think it goes quite
944400	949920	on those things, and so I'd say I like seeing them, but they're not particularly
949920	958080	places I'd want to see many times, or that I imagine will have any sort of long lasting sort
958080	966000	of impact. So I suppose that's what I'm thinking of. The other objections that I'm saying about
966000	974240	political art, I think are possibly more vivid in their own way. So I have problems, even with
974240	980720	the work like Luigi Nono's D'Gorda Cosi di Hanno Fatou in Auschwitz, which was written as originally
980720	988560	as incidental music for Peter Weiss's play Die Ermittlung, the investigation, which was essentially
988560	994640	a reconstruction of parts of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. And in his programme note for the work,
994720	1002480	Nono himself says that what the transcripts of the trials can't represent is
1003840	1010000	the voice of the Six Million Dead, and that's what he wants to do in his music. Now I think,
1010000	1015680	first of all, that's incredibly presumptuous, and I don't think any artist should claim to be
1016240	1025120	doing that. But beyond that, it's a strangely very beautiful piece. It's a very haunting piece.
1026720	1032720	It's a piece, dare I say, to enjoy. And when you can see where I'm leading from that,
1033840	1040880	it's turning genocide into an aesthetic spectacle. So if Adorno said, at one point,
1040880	1045120	I know he retracted this later, he said there could be no lyric poetry after Auschwitz.
1045200	1051360	Well, this is making lyric poetry out of Auschwitz, which is moving on to a whole different level.
1052320	1055600	And I just don't think it's an appropriate response.
1055600	1060160	It's funny, I had a similar reaction to a much more recent piece, which is
1060160	1065680	The Opera Innocence by Caio Sarriaho, which is an opera dealing with school shootings.
1066720	1068000	Oh yes, I haven't seen it.
1068000	1072640	Right. Well, it documents the story of a school shooting in quite
1073600	1079440	quite horrendous detail and presents this as an aesthetic object, I suppose. And
1080880	1086640	that made me intensely uncomfortable. And you could argue, well, that's perhaps the
1086640	1092400	point is to put that in your face and present the reality of it in a context where one might
1092400	1099520	not be expecting such a thing. But it seemed to me at the time, and this is acknowledging
1099600	1103360	the greatness of the work. I think it is her best opera. I think it's a very fine work.
1103360	1110160	The musical substance of it is outstanding. But nevertheless, it raised a question in my mind,
1110160	1114640	is this actually appropriate? Is this something that one can address in an opera?
1116000	1121040	Well, I'm interested to know more about the types of musical means she used and
1121840	1126720	what you think made it particularly a set as size there. But I suppose the question I would
1126720	1133040	always ask there is, why is this an opera? Why is it not a film? Why is it not a play?
1133040	1140800	Why is it not a documentary even? I remember someone talking about a projected piece
1142160	1149280	that would deal with the phenomenon of punch and duty shows here and what that meant in terms of
1149280	1155760	domestic violence at the time. You know, very relevant concern, absolutely. But I was, I never
1155760	1161680	really got around to asking them, why is this piece of music there? And why are you using a
1161680	1170080	particular artistic medium? And it's something I wonder about a lot of work I see nowadays,
1170080	1178560	where I think the nominal subject matter seems to have an importance way over and above what
1178560	1185040	the musical content is. And somehow it's seen by some as to render questions of the musical value
1185040	1191200	almost irrelevant. But in the end, if it is a work of music, I want to know why
1191200	1203360	music's being used for this. I mean, supposing I want to get off a sort of Nazi example,
1203360	1210800	because those are so full of problems. But I could imagine someone setting a gulag chorus or
1210800	1217200	something in opera, and I could imagine this being absolutely dreadful, if it was done a certain way.
1217200	1224800	It could make light of the gulag experience so much. And you know, I can think of other things,
1224800	1232400	even in opera, I like very much Billy Bird of Britain, but I know how brutalising the conditions
1232400	1237040	were in the Royal Navy at that time. Now, I mean, some of that comes across certainly
1237040	1243120	through the flogging scene and things like that. But when you see them singing their sea shanties
1244080	1251520	at night, there's a sort of sense that they've found some reasonably happy reconciliation
1251520	1258880	to their lot. That might have been a necessity, for sure. But somehow it just seems all a bit too
1258880	1264800	warm at that point. I mean, I'm probably being a bit harsh on that, because that opera certainly
1264800	1272000	does deal in some senses with other aspects. But yes, I'm back again to the question of why
1273360	1278480	use music, particularly why I have something sung rather than spoken, or why even fictionalise
1278480	1285120	something in some cases. Now, I can certainly see arguments for doing so in even including
1285120	1290240	things which are dealing with greater atrocities. Sometimes a fiction can reveal a reality that
1290240	1298480	a documentary approach might not. But I think these questions can easily be treated rather too
1298480	1306320	lightly. We've come off with a bit of a tangent, and I feel like I need to return to some thread,
1306320	1311600	but I've forgotten exactly where we were. You were talking about Sarajah's opera,
1312560	1319600	which I really want to see, and I haven't seen now. And I was thinking of other examples,
1320000	1325920	well, there's a piece I wrote for the conversation a few years ago, where I looked a bit critically
1325920	1331920	at the Nanna work, and also at Penderecki's Threnadie, which, as we know, was given its title
1331920	1338320	about Hiroshima after it was composed. The very fact of that makes me a bit skeptical,
1338880	1346800	where this is sort of appropriating a traumatic event to artificially sort of
1347360	1351280	paced on some relevance to our work. Opportunistically also, yes, yeah.
1351280	1356000	But as comparing with actually a more musically conservative work in some senses,
1356000	1362640	but I do think it's remarkable being Shostakovich's 13th Symphony after poems by Yev Deschenko
1362640	1366880	to do in part with the Babiyar massacre, there is actually a range of poems, they deal with
1366880	1376720	several subjects. But that simply doesn't become is a type of atrocity pornography
1377600	1382560	and I think it's remarkable for that, Shostakovich resists that temptation
1384080	1390560	to write some sort of, some sort of Lamentosa work, which will never be sufficient for the scale
1390560	1396640	of what's being represented. So no, I think it's a piece that actually invites a form of active
1396640	1402720	rational engagement with what it's doing, rather than using it as for some sort of emotional
1402720	1411120	catharsis. And maybe that's the thing, I think using, using traumatic events for that purpose,
1411120	1417840	I think is in questionable taste at the very limit. And I've, you know, I've written a bit
1418560	1426880	recently about endless pieces we get about climate change. It's very fashionable to write
1426880	1432320	a piece about climate change. Now, if I'm going to look critically at this, don't think for a moment
1432320	1438400	this means I'm trying to sort of, in a sense, minimize the importance of climate change as an
1438400	1444560	issue, I think it's absolutely urgent and the consequences are incredibly serious in so many
1444560	1452640	respects. But I just wonder what people are doing by writing a piece of music about it,
1452640	1458720	which will probably get heard by a small community of listeners in the new music world,
1458720	1463120	few of who will need convincing that climate change is a bad thing,
1464960	1469200	whether it's really, whether these things are really adding to our understanding
1469200	1471280	any more so than could be done by other means.
1472640	1475920	Well, I suspect it's a form of in-group affirmation,
1476880	1479440	ultimately. And there's a lot of that in the new music community.
1480240	1485840	Sure. And that's not new. I mean, some of the political references even in Mozart operas may
1485840	1493200	have actually taken the same form that when he was writing Don Giovanni's singing Viva la Libert√†,
1494160	1500560	he wasn't particularly saying something to his audiences as to some of his patrons to show that
1500560	1507120	he was in support of a particular political direction there. So in a sense, that was a type
1507120	1514240	of virtue signalling to an in-crowd as well. But I think, I mean, I don't, it would be too harsh
1514240	1522720	just to condemn such things out of hand. I suppose I'm bothered when I think these become the primary
1522720	1529280	focus of attention. And the rest of the music doesn't seem to count for very much. And I see this
1530400	1538880	certainly in academic contexts with music, where ultimately, there are many composers
1538880	1545520	employed by universities who are often writing in and in some sort of what I might say post-Avancard
1545520	1551600	idiom for now, which draws upon some of the techniques and styles and genres that were
1551600	1557760	associated with the avant-garde at its peak, rather necessarily developing wholly new ones.
1559360	1568160	But in a language which will ultimately be esoteric to many academic managers,
1568160	1574240	to many research funding bodies, to many of the other people that they have to please in order
1574240	1582160	to secure a solid future within academia. And so if they can link their piece to other things,
1582160	1588480	which are not in themselves, anything necessary to do with music, this is a good career strategy.
1590160	1592400	If that sounds a bit of cynical views, because it is.
1593360	1598480	Those two things are not necessarily mutually exclusive. You can have an optimized career
1598480	1605760	strategy and also be a great artist. And in fact, I think the great artist who is hopelessly unable
1607440	1613680	to communicate with anybody who is socially inept and who can't make a strong case for their work
1613680	1616240	is going to be at a significant disadvantage, I would imagine.
1616880	1624080	Yeah, no, I do agree with that. But I think it's possible to make a case for work in
1625360	1633920	other terms. But I recognize that's hard for those working in particular, as I say, post-Avancard
1634640	1643040	idioms. And that might actually say something reluctant, though I am, to go down this road about
1644000	1649920	whether it's ever possible that those idioms in themselves can have any wider communicative
1649920	1655120	potential. Well, communicative is probably not the best word. The whole series of communications
1655120	1662320	have their own sorts of qualities, which are not necessarily the best, the most applicable
1662320	1671040	to music. Maybe I like using the word, though it's become a bit of a cliche, resonance, or whether
1671040	1677040	the music resonates and it's got a literal musical dimension to it. As I say, it's just
1677040	1681920	become a little bit overused to become hackneyed. But I think it's possible that music can resonate
1681920	1688480	rather than, in some sense, conveying a meaning. Or it can be meaningful without having a meaning.
1688480	1696400	It doesn't have an object in the same way as, say, figurative art does, or a lot of uses of language
1696720	1704640	can. Well, it's certainly possible for esoteric aesthetic directions to communicate to a very
1704640	1709920	large number of people. That's happened on many occasions. The classic example is possibly the
1709920	1715680	Right of Spring, which is enormously popular work and has an immediate power of seduction
1715680	1723520	and expression that is self-evident. As for where that may stand in the present day, I'm
1724080	1731280	considerably less convinced about composers able to take what might be by contemporary standards
1733120	1739840	might be, let's say, esoteric or aesthetics that notably diverge from
1740880	1745120	the bulk of musical practices in the composition world and manage to find a large
1745120	1748720	audience doing that. I don't know. I think that that would be extraordinarily difficult.
1748720	1754000	I haven't seen too many examples of that, certainly. And if I were to survey the composition
1754000	1758560	landscape of the past 30 or 40 years, what are the individual works that have had anything like
1759840	1766080	even an iota of significance in comparison with the work Like the Right of Spring?
1766080	1770880	Now, you could argue that's something that reveals itself over time, that we need decades,
1770880	1777040	perhaps half a century or more before the work reveals itself in its full dimensions.
1777520	1784960	But I don't think that's necessarily the case. There are certainly works that find a broad audience
1784960	1791840	and create a significant impact very shortly after their premiere. It just doesn't seem to be
1791840	1798960	happening. And this is something that emerged as a kind of light motif in the discussions I had with
1800160	1805360	intellectuals, public figures, people from the business world who attended the art conference
1805360	1809760	in London back in October. Now, I had the opportunity to exchange with quite a number
1809760	1814640	of people at that event, including prominent intellectuals from all sides of the political
1814640	1822640	spectrum. And one recurring motif was the question, what are the artists doing? Where are they? Where
1822640	1827200	have they gone? Where are the great figures of today? We mentioned T.S. Eliot and Stravinsky as
1827200	1834080	two sort of emblematic examples, but is there anybody today who can claim to have anything
1834080	1843440	like that measure of public notoriety, significance, critical attention? I'm quite doubtful about that.
1844320	1850000	At least maybe not in the high cultural field, in popular cultural fields and possibly.
1850960	1857600	I'm not sure right now, but at least in the last 50 years, I can think of figures there.
1858960	1861840	You know, I can think of various popular musicians, I can think of jazz musicians,
1861840	1867360	late jazz musicians, because I sort of think jazz morphed into other things around about
1867360	1878400	the time of the 1970s onwards. Well, that's sort of what I call the one last push theory,
1879120	1884640	that if we wait a bit of time and we push things like new music just a bit more,
1884640	1889040	eventually, audiences will come around. Right. No, this is... I mean, I don't believe that.
1889040	1894080	I don't believe that for a second. The idea, and this has been floated since at least the 1950s,
1894080	1898400	if not longer, is that, well, it's because audiences aren't familiar enough with it,
1898400	1902640	so if you can educate them, if you can explain to them what's going on in the work,
1902640	1905600	then they'll come around to it. The problem is that they don't have the context,
1905600	1909200	they don't understand what artists are doing, so you need to be an advocate,
1909200	1912560	you need to explain it to them, and so on. In my experience, that simply doesn't work.
1912880	1920320	There are branches of new music that simply do not have the capacity, I believe, to communicate
1920320	1924480	broadly to a large number of people, and it's to do with the work. It's not to do with
1925600	1931200	deficiencies in the sensibility or the education or the experience of the people who are listening.
1932080	1938560	Now, that's an attitude that you see quite commonly in modernist composers such as
1938560	1944000	Eliot Carter, who is constantly saying things along the lines that, well, the music is difficult,
1944000	1948880	but people will just have to become more clever, and, well, where does that lead you?
1949920	1957280	Well, can I take a sort of middle ground position on this? I go home after I've been working hard
1958000	1970080	someday, and I don't always want to read some Goethe. I don't always want to be
1970880	1980320	watching some classic Japanese cinema. I don't always want to be listening to some late Brahms.
1981040	1988160	These are all things I like very much indeed, but, yes, I sometimes want something a bit lighter
1988160	1993680	that's not unintelligent, but is entertaining and gives me a chance to relax a bit, and I
1994480	2000000	never criticize anyone else for wanting to do the same. I would worry a lot if that's all
2000000	2009120	there was in culture, and I think that's a very real worry to have, but I started asking myself
2010400	2017200	a while ago, maybe at least 10 years ago, maybe even more, of a lot of the types of
2017200	2022480	avant-garde music that I've played, how often do I choose to actually listen to them myself?
2023840	2030400	And I mean, I certainly do, but not as often as one might think. I mean, when it's just listening,
2030400	2034000	because I'm interested, rather than listening because I need to learn more about something,
2034000	2039040	because I'm writing about it, or I'm listening to recordings in the process of preparing
2039120	2046000	interpretation or something like that, but just listening, for pleasure doesn't seem quite the
2046000	2051840	right way to put it, but listening for my own edification, I suppose, I've thought it's not
2051840	2057920	actually all that often. And then I ask myself, similarly, how often do I listen to early music?
2058720	2064000	Same here, or how often would I listen to even something like the Matas Passion?
2064880	2071440	And they're for special occasions. I mean, there are times when I've got time,
2071440	2074880	and I've got a clear head, and I really want to concentrate, and I really want something
2075520	2082800	that goes as deep as those things are. And if you know, as someone who's quite intensely
2082800	2090400	involved with these things as part of their work, if it's not so often that I get the chance to do
2090400	2098240	that, then what's the chance for those working in other fields? Who don't have that? But from that,
2098240	2105280	I still don't think that necessarily has to be a problem. I think there can be many forms of art,
2106400	2111840	which are, let's go back to the first question, which are great, which are demanding,
2113440	2118640	and which are not probably for casual or recreational viewing, listening, reading,
2118640	2126000	or whatever. But I don't think that in any sense minimizes their significance or their importance.
2128160	2133200	Well, if I could just continue one thing on that, because I want to look,
2133200	2139360	I mean, the Eliot Carter example is interesting there. In a sense, I can see that I can view
2139360	2143920	Carter's work, which I like very much, and I've played most of his piano music,
2144560	2148320	is an extension of that. And Carter's work,
2152160	2159600	if I say there's, in one small sense, it's slightly conservative. I don't mean that in any sort of
2159600	2164800	denigratory fashion. I mean, in a sense, it's music that situates itself in a particular
2164800	2174880	relationship to traditions, which I think is quite clear. It's not radically iconoclastic work,
2174880	2182080	never has been, not in the way that certainly things like Cage or Schnabel or Globacar might be,
2182080	2187920	not things that are really sort of trying to make you redefine the whole question of what music is.
2187920	2198640	Carter's work uses an expressive language, which has a clear lineage behind it. He uses forms,
2198640	2207360	which are certainly informed by his own particular means, not least on a metrical level, but on the
2207360	2214160	other hand, they still somehow relate to established forms in things. And so that
2214160	2220320	gives the point of reference. That gives, for those familiar with that tradition,
2220320	2225680	you can hear it relative, listen to it relative to that tradition if you're familiar with that.
2225680	2229920	And what that would mean to someone not familiar with that tradition is not necessarily so
2231120	2240800	clear. But, and this is the question, like I think so many involved in new music, I've evaded
2240800	2249120	for a long time, but I can't really get away from is simply about atonality. Now, if I define
2249120	2258240	atonality as, or atonal music is music which is not organized around single tonal centers for any
2258240	2265840	appreciable amount of time. I mean, I don't think there's almost any fully atonal music,
2265840	2270560	music where you can't hear some localized tonal centers at various points, but they're so
2270560	2278800	diffuse and so changing in atonal music as to essentially issue that sort of sense of
2278800	2283440	some gravitational force such as a more long range tonal organization provides.
2286400	2294960	Atonal music is disorienting. It is alienating, I think, to an awful lot of people. I mean,
2294960	2301520	every bit of evidence points to that the lack of much of an atonal tradition in almost any other
2301520	2306400	world culture. Perhaps you could find some, something akin in, say, gagaku music or so on,
2307200	2311920	but it's not really comparable. I wonder about this. This is a question that I ask myself quite
2311920	2316960	often as well. Now, I don't think I'm being self-deluding about this because obviously I write
2316960	2322000	completely chromatic music and indeed sometimes infracromatic music with microtones and so on.
2322240	2327600	My sense is, having worked with a lot of students and having exchanged with a very broad range of
2327600	2332240	audience members through my public lecturing and through the work I've done as a composer as well,
2332240	2338400	my sense is that the organization of the tones is not really at the forefront of most people's
2338400	2342720	concerns when they're listening to things and finding them perhaps too esoteric or too difficult
2342720	2349360	to handle. I think the absence of identifiable patterns in music is extremely challenging for
2350320	2355440	audiences, but that can come through any means, actually. It's not simply a matter of the
2355440	2360480	organization of tones. I think it may have to do somewhat with rhythm. I think that the
2361600	2368320	tendency of the second Viennese school composers, for example, and certainly the generation that
2368320	2376800	came after that, to work with rhythmic patterns that do not relate in any obvious manner to
2377760	2382960	a meter, to a pattern, I think that that's more destabilizing than any degree of
2385920	2393920	atonality in the music. There are so many examples of ostensibly tonal music that is so far into
2393920	2398720	the margins of what constitutes any kind of functionality that it's difficult to make a
2398720	2405360	case for the piece being in this or that key. For example, you can cite certain passages in
2405360	2410400	Wagner, you can cite Hugo Woeuf, certainly, where it's extraordinarily difficult to determine
2410400	2415520	if many of those songs are, in fact, in a key at all. You can cite Debussy, you can look at
2416720	2422160	certain works by Hindemith, you can look at things like the Bagatelle Santonalit√© of Liszt.
2424240	2429520	Those works don't seem to disturb anybody. Well, the Bagatelle Santonalit√©, I'd say, is in B minor.
2429760	2432240	Okay. Well, that settles it.
2434400	2440880	I think it's simply a piece that lacks a clear tonic in root position,
2441600	2447280	rather than lacks a tonal center. There's a very, very clear tonal organization in that.
2448160	2454000	It's nothing like the cutter drift in the way that Schoenberg from Op. 11 onwards is.
2454960	2460000	And when you're talking about recognizable patterns, well, what about in Schoenberg's
2460000	2465840	Suite Op. 25, or the Third String Quartet, or the Variations for Orchestra, do these not use a quite
2467200	2471440	readily recognizable rhythmic vocabulary and gestural vocabulary as well?
2471920	2476960	Which I thought, I mean, I've seen some fascinating talks about these works, which
2477760	2483360	actually push the pitch organization to one side and look at them more primarily in gestural terms.
2484400	2488880	And actually how subtle the gestural and rhythmic working is in them.
2488880	2497120	And which, you know, which I find fascinating. It's a lot more than about what makes these,
2497120	2501280	to my mind, quite remarkable pieces than just saying how the rose manipulated.
2501280	2504880	But sorry, it's a little tangent here, but you might find it's quite interesting here that
2506160	2511680	I was just in a conference at Dublin last week, and I was sort of supporting a postgraduate student
2511680	2518720	who was giving a paper, which I had some input into. We're looking at the role of music theory
2518720	2525120	analysis comparatively in Scottish and Irish educational systems and how this relates to
2525120	2531520	secondary provision and so on. And one thing she found from talking to teachers in Scotland is they
2531520	2538960	said, serialism is a gift for teaching, because it's not difficult for students to learn how to
2538960	2545120	just invert and retrograde the row, and then just combine that and they create something in the process.
2546160	2550720	Yeah, whether there's something you'd ever want to listen to is another question. But
2551760	2556960	I mean, this to me portrays such a narrow understanding of what serial music is, and
2556960	2561520	certainly what the serial music of Schoenberg or Berg or Webern is, that there are so many other
2561520	2568480	aspects which are defining to what makes it so distinctive. It's not just about the row
2568560	2574400	manipulation. And as we know, Schoenberg reacted quite negatively to Rudolf Kirlisch,
2575120	2578640	coming back and saying, I've worked out this is how the row works in the third string quartet.
2580240	2586400	So I suppose I'm saying from this that I'm not sure that those other factors that you think
2586400	2591280	are probably more important for listeners than pitch organisation. I'm not sure if those things
2591840	2598080	aren't present in a lot of these works, which nonetheless, have never gone on to have the
2598080	2606720	same sustained and wide listenership that works of Stravinsky or Bartok or Prokofiev have. And
2609200	2615840	I don't in any sense want to sort of suggest that those latter group composers are any less
2615920	2620960	modern. In fact, in some sense is more so than the second Viennese school.
2624000	2627760	And you could trace a different sort of history through the 20th century, which
2628880	2636000	is certainly focused on lots of very innovative developments. I mean,
2636000	2643440	was obviously with Debussy, as you mentioned, but which I don't believe ultimately give up on
2643440	2648960	some form of tonal organisation. I don't believe Debussy does. We were saying about Wagner, Hugo
2648960	2655840	Volf. I think for momentary periods, they go off directions, but I think it's still ultimately clear.
2656640	2658640	I think even in Charles Ives, that's the case as well.
2658640	2663120	Well, the harmony is fundamentally triadic in nature most of the time,
2664000	2669520	even though it may not be obvious how the modulatory scheme works and how it might all
2669520	2676560	relate to essential tonality. But something along those lines, having an extended tonality
2676560	2682800	that is fundamentally centred around triads is probably, that might be the marker. But then
2682800	2687120	again, it's very complicated. It's terribly difficult to parse it all out because a lot of
2687120	2691120	the harmony in Opus 11 is triadic, if you look at the chords.
2691840	2701680	But modified triads with added notes that sort of preclude them from fulfilling the
2701680	2706720	usual triadic functions. Yes, but Scriabin, it's tricky, it's tricky.
2707280	2710320	Yes, but it's more directional in Scriabin, I think.
2711360	2716080	Depends. Some of those pieces are quite static in their harmonic effect, I would argue.
2716960	2720240	I think of the opening of the eight sonata, for example.
2722880	2729280	That's just a modified cadence in A, I think, for all the high amount of chromaticism.
2730160	2735120	It's still got these basic cadential function working underneath it.
2738080	2741120	Look at the beginning of the tenth sonata. It starts with essentially
2741600	2751600	outlining an augmented triad on G-flat, and then that moves down to an E-flat minor triad.
2754400	2761760	That to me is just a certain type of cadence from the third to the first degree of the scale,
2762720	2770320	as in terms of the bass line, that it's not...
2772800	2780080	Now, but then if I say look at one of the most tonal of Schoenberg's early A tonal works being
2780080	2791360	the Opus 11 number two. So, for any listening to this who don't know this piece, it starts with an
2791440	2797840	oscillating F and D in the bass and a lower F, an octave below the higher one,
2799040	2806480	which could very simply imply a D minor harmony. But then when the melody comes above that,
2806480	2816160	it's quite... It goes from D-flat to A, and then down a tri-tone to E-flat, and up a fourth to A-flat,
2816160	2822880	and then back down a tri-tone to D. But inevitably that D naturalism here
2822880	2828000	sounds to me like a resolution. And when I'm hearing the other chromatic notes,
2828000	2832240	they're just implying a resolution that's going to come. Now Schoenberg does this,
2832240	2835040	but sometimes he holds back or doesn't even resolve, but...
2835040	2840240	No, clearly. Well, I would argue that that principle is operative to a greater or lesser
2840240	2845440	degree in a lot of the works, where the E-flat sounds like a flat supertonic more or less.
2845440	2850160	It's the same in the slow movement of the fourth quartet to a degree. It seems to have,
2850160	2856240	which coincidentally also sounds like it's in D minor. So it's a question of degree,
2856240	2861200	but I'm not convinced by the idea that that is the level on which these works are fundamentally
2861200	2867200	challenging for audiences. It may have to do with the rate of change, with the constant
2867200	2872800	onslaught of new chromatic pitches, the harmonic rhythm. The harmonic rhythm in the
2872800	2876800	right of spring is drastically slowed down in comparison.
2878240	2883920	And we know Schoenberg didn't like repetition, and this might be a key thing here.
2886240	2888720	Yes, there's a sort of information overload.
2888720	2893840	Well, if you take a work like De Stade by Andreessen, you have rhythmic patterns that are
2893840	2899520	obvious and easy to hear. You have tonal patterns that are obvious and easy to hear. The harmonic
2899520	2906400	rhythm is extremely slow. You have gestures and contrasts that form very clear and simple
2906400	2910720	formal markers in the piece. It's hypnotic, it's repetitive, and so on.
2913120	2917760	It's not obvious to me that De Stade is a more popular work than the fourth string quartet
2917760	2923760	of Schoenberg. Maybe it is, but I don't know that that's the level on which... Do you see what I mean?
2924720	2934640	It's tricky. I think we'd need some empirical data for this. We need to play some audiences,
2935360	2938560	both the works, and then engage their responses to them.
2941200	2948720	There might be some who are quite conservative listeners who think the Schoenberg sounds quite
2949200	2955760	refined, and whereas I think the Andreessen's all a bit too noisy and riotous. That's very
2955760	2959680	possible, but I think you could say the same about the Rite of Spring as well.
2961600	2967200	Well, I tried an experiment with my students when I was teaching at the conservatory in Cambrai in
2967200	2971600	northern France, and I had some younger students in that class. We were doing a course on musical
2971600	2978320	analysis, and the idea was to alternate 20th century works with more established classical
2978320	2983520	works. We were looking at late romanticism. We were looking at things like Wagner and
2983520	2988640	Mahler and so on, and then one week I brought in the five orchestral pieces by Schoenberg,
2989280	2995280	and we listened to them. To the students, it wasn't immediately obvious that the
2996720	3002320	tonal organization of that work was in some fundamental manner all that different from
3003040	3009280	a more chromatic example, say, from Liszt or Wagner. Now, that kind of surprised me. I wasn't
3009280	3014240	expecting that reaction, but it was in fact repeated multiple times, and if I asked them to
3014240	3020080	say, well, which work is tonal and which work is non-tonal, it wasn't necessarily categorically
3020080	3029040	obvious to them. How well versed in the standard repertoire would those students have been?
3030000	3034240	Well, they were younger, so presumably their exposure to the repertoire would have been
3034240	3039520	limited, I imagine. They would have probably been centering themselves around a small number of
3039520	3042800	works that they were attempting to master on their instruments. I don't get the sense that they would
3042800	3048080	go home and listen to ten symphonies a day. So not really immersed in the tradition?
3048080	3054320	No. Because this presents an interesting sort of comparison to something that
3054640	3062240	my friend, the musicologist, Eva-Marida Rodriguez, was telling me that she was teaching to some
3062240	3068320	students some ideas coming from the new musicology out of the work from the 90s, particularly about
3068320	3074800	queer musicology and how some works of Schubert and Tchaikovsky have been analyzed in terms of their
3074800	3081280	particular harmonic patterns and their structural organizations as a quite alternative model of
3081360	3088000	tonal organization to the dominant one coming from Beethoven and so on, which I think is actually
3088000	3093680	quite a powerful explanation that whether this maps onto sexuality, I think, is open to question.
3093680	3098000	But there's no doubt to me that Tchaikovsky's approach to writing a symphony was quite fundamentally
3098000	3104960	different to Beethoven's. And at the very least, these paradigms have gone some way to explaining
3104960	3114160	how that organization is considerably different, and particularly the substitution of more
3114160	3122240	relationships between harmonic riches based upon thirds rather than fifths is quite a fundamental
3122240	3129280	thing found there. And so it's as a way of bypassing some of the clear sort of dominant tonic
3129280	3134960	opposition, which is still so fundamental in Beethoven, as you can see in those endless 5-1
3134960	3141120	alternations at the end of some of the symphonies, for example. But apparently this was lost a lot
3141120	3147840	of the students. They just said, oh, that all sounds like classical music. The differences
3147840	3153120	between Beethoven and Tchaikovsky was probably something akin to the narcissism of small differences.
3154080	3161600	It was a world that at most they saw from the perspective of an outsider.
3163680	3172880	And maybe it's possible now if you take the Schoenberg 5 orchestral pieces that, you know,
3172880	3179440	those are still composed using an orchestral idiom in terms of the use of the instruments
3179520	3185040	that's now well established, has been much imitated or much drawn upon.
3186480	3193600	And itself, you can quite clearly link to some of that that you find in Wagner, in Rekard Strauss,
3193600	3199920	and in others. Let me show them by text in new directions, but it belongs within a tradition
3200880	3212080	and other aspects of texture, of rhythm, of density. These things certainly overlap to a large
3212080	3218080	degree with lots of other works in the tradition. And so I'm wondering if when the whole music is
3219360	3224320	not something that's become second nature, when the tradition's not become second nature to students,
3224400	3231840	whether the things that we see as crucial differences are not yet so apparent, but maybe
3231840	3237440	with a greater degree of familiarity they would become. Absolutely. Well, there's a quote, you'll
3237440	3243200	probably know who this poet is, which is, when the lights are dim, all cats would be gray. If you
3243200	3248000	don't have enough illumination to see distinctions between things, then everything, of course,
3248000	3258800	looks the same to you. But still, just the relative lack of differentiation, I'm not sure
3258800	3269280	that's any signifier that this is going to generate amongst these sorts of less-tutored minds,
3269280	3276000	a new sort of enthusiasm for Schoenberg, orchestral music. But I might be wrong on that.
3278960	3283760	What I'm trying to say here, the latest article I read just very recently,
3285680	3293200	which, okay, to put it in a nutshell, it's saying if you lose a classical tradition,
3294320	3298480	you'll lose contemporary classical music as well, which I think is accurate.
3299040	3308080	I think ultimately, the audiences for, well, I still like the term new music, which comes,
3308080	3312080	which is something I date back to about 1918, the audiences for that,
3316240	3323280	those who would pursue that music or a lot of it with real sort of sustained enthusiasm
3323840	3331440	will come from those who are also used to grappling with the intricacies and the complexities
3332400	3339600	of music in the Western classical tradition. Now, that's a quite unfashionable position to
3339600	3349840	take nowadays, and it's far from uncommon to find amongst composers a view that, no, this music has
3349840	3354480	to sort of get away from that tradition, and the new audiences are to be found amongst those
3354480	3360560	who listen to more popular music or jazz or things like that. Twitch, I'd say,
3360560	3366480	hey, I don't think I haven't yet seen much evidence of that process happening on any
3366480	3369200	sustained level. There are odd cases for sure, but...
3371760	3378240	I think what I'm trying to establish is that the differences for, let's say,
3378240	3385680	a non-specialized audience between late list, for example, Wagner, Schoenberg, Bartok, Debussy
3385680	3391600	are comparatively minor. They're not colossal differences in the sense that they might reveal
3391600	3399600	themselves to a more well-versed or specialized listener. But so my argument is that that's
3399600	3405200	fundamentally not where this breakdown seems to occur. I think that that happens in the post-war
3405200	3412640	era, and I think it has possibly partly to do with stylistic matters, but not exclusively. I
3412640	3418480	think it has to do with the way the music is being disseminated, with the way that the composers
3418480	3424000	may be addressing their audience or not addressing it, their attitude towards the audience,
3424800	3431840	and the progressive entrenchment of the compositional tradition into academia and into
3431840	3439920	things that are extremely distant, in fact, from the want of a better term, from the quotidian
3440480	3447360	concerns of everyday people. Schoenberg is certainly a radical figure within that tradition,
3447360	3453440	but he's still within that tradition, very demonstratively so. There isn't really a break,
3453440	3458640	there's an acceleration, there's an intensification, there's an increased degree of complexity, I
3458640	3463600	suppose, but there isn't a categorical break, but I do think that occurs in the in the post-war
3463600	3471360	era. Well, one explanation for this is the idea that essentially the Second Vanity School
3471360	3477360	represent the end of a tradition, and possibly you could extend it a bit further, maybe Carter
3477360	3483200	would belong with that, maybe Verninger would belong within that, but all sort of playing a type of
3483200	3493120	end game. Music that strikes by seeing what's still possible to do out of what's been inherited
3493120	3499520	from that tradition, rather than setting down blueprints for a whole new directions, which I
3499520	3510240	think is what Stravinsky and Bartok and Prokofiev did. So the response of those who wanted to build
3510240	3520160	upon the achievements of Second Vanity School was generally to strip it out from most of that sort
3520160	3527280	of early 20th century Viennese expression that came with it, and all the other trappings of tradition
3528000	3531520	that were there, which I think are absolutely defining to the music, in fact more defining
3532160	3536560	than the serial organization, in the case of the Dodecophonic works, I mean.
3537120	3549200	But in that, and yes, you're right, I mean, even in Stravinsky, and Debussy, and Prokofiev,
3549200	3554160	and so on, I mean, this music didn't come from nowhere, this wasn't sort of ripped up and started
3554160	3560640	again, you know, you can easily trace Stravinsky back to Remsky Korsakov, to Misorgsky, to Tchaikovsky,
3561600	3568000	and some senses to Italian opera and some French music and so on. You can easily trace Prokofiev
3568000	3575920	back to similar things. For those familiar with that sort of period in French music that's perhaps
3575920	3582880	least well known in between the deaths of Berlioz and the first mature works of Debussy, so in the
3582880	3590880	1870s and 1880s, the period right after the Franco-Pression War, when you see important works of
3590880	3597520	Faur√©, of Chabret, of Messonni, and others, once you have a sort of degree of familiarity with
3597520	3602880	that tradition, then it's not so difficult to see where Debussy comes from, combined with
3602880	3608960	influences from Russian music and from Wagner and elsewhere, that, I mean, for radical composers, they
3609680	3620400	moved music on by quite palpable degree, but it didn't come out of nowhere. But nor did Boulers,
3620400	3626720	nor did Schlockhausen, they didn't come out of nowhere. I mean, Boulers, at least in time,
3626720	3633360	became quite explicit about this, how much he felt that what had been achieved by Debussy,
3633360	3639040	by Bartok, by Strominski, by Schoenberg, by Berg, was there to build, by Varez as well,
3639040	3646400	was there to build on, whilst rejecting some aspects of it as well. And I've probably said to
3646400	3654560	you before how I'll never accept the Stundinal theory of new music after 1945. First of all,
3654560	3660560	because actually, in terms of what was being predominantly written and performed after 1945,
3660560	3662960	in no sense constituted a Stundinal.
3662960	3664880	Could you lay out what that means for our listeners?
3664880	3671840	Sorry, Stundinal zero hour in Germany. It's a theory of history, which is treated with a lot
3671840	3678320	of skepticism by his Reuser period now. But it's the idea that essentially, Germany had been destroyed,
3678320	3684560	reduced to rubble, and everything had to start again from first principles. And that this would
3684560	3691200	happen in music and culture that the whole, the languages inherited from the past had been thoroughly
3691200	3698000	discredited by the associations with Nazism. And so something new that broke with these completely
3698000	3700240	had to be created in its place.
3700240	3702880	Well, that doesn't account for a figure like Henson.
3702880	3711520	No, it certainly doesn't, nor for at least up until the late 1950s, the figures that were
3711600	3718240	extremely dominant in German new music, who were people like, well, like Carl Orth for a start,
3718240	3724720	Wolfgang Fortner, like Werner Eck, like Boris Blacker, Hindemith very much. So yes,
3725360	3730160	even though he was out of the country, but he was being played a lot. And younger figures,
3730160	3735360	including Hans Werner, Henson, and one that's now pretty much forgotten, but was very big,
3735360	3740800	Gieselic Kleber, who was getting commissioned here and everywhere. And someone like Stockhausen,
3741920	3751680	and the slightly younger figures such as Hans Otter, or such as Dieter Schnabel,
3751680	3756080	just a couple of years younger than Stockhausen, these people were very much on the margins.
3756640	3761360	And Otter found his way through writing music that was essentially like his teacher, Hindemith,
3761360	3764720	for a while before in the 60s, he moved into a more sort of
3767840	3775520	aleatory music and more radical idioms there. I mean, my point is the avant-garde was on the
3775520	3783200	margins throughout most of the early post-war period. It was through the influence of people
3783200	3790160	like Herbert Eimer, who had a very important position at clone radio, and was something
3790160	3796960	of an avant-garde himself that managed to push things so that by the time, not earlier than
3796960	3804000	the early 60s, some of the avant-garde was starting to move more into the mainstream there. But
3805520	3810160	I mean, that was to explain, I don't believe Stundernull, if there had been a Stundernull,
3810160	3812640	you would have had very few of those other tendencies.
3812880	3814080	This meeting, zero hour?
3814080	3821520	Yes, zero hour. But that zero hour model, which informed quite a bit of the
3821520	3824720	historiography of new music, this is something I'm writing about at the moment,
3824720	3832000	particularly the stuff published in the 70s and 80s, presented this as a new language had to be
3832000	3840480	built up from first principles, almost literally from elementary particles and integral serialism,
3840480	3846720	pointless music, seem a maps onto that sort of metaphor very well, because you can see individual
3846720	3853040	notes, which somehow removed from any of the previous functional relationships that they might
3853040	3859600	have had, form the particles of the new music, and then new types of macroscopic organization,
3859600	3865200	especially if you find something like Stockhausen's Gruppen, enable ways of developing a more
3865280	3867760	sophisticated language out of this.
3869600	3877040	Well, I certainly agree that it's far too simplistic to ascribe the Second World War as
3877040	3881120	the moment in which everything fundamentally shifts permanently and that there's no recovering it.
3881120	3887760	I think that's far too simplistic. Nevertheless, it clearly accelerated certain forces that were
3887760	3894000	perhaps already operative before that period. And you could perhaps say that we're at the,
3894720	3898960	perhaps the end of a very long historical process that's been playing out over 100,
3898960	3905280	150 years. But nevertheless, there is for me a categorical difference between where we are now
3905280	3912320	with the manner in which a composer may interface with their audience versus what was the case
3912320	3917120	in the time of Schoenberg. I think that it's a categorical difference. It's no longer a matter
3917120	3923360	of degree. If you go from one generation to the next, you can say, well, if you compare
3923360	3928560	the attitude of Schoenberg versus Les, for example, you can say, well, it's not a complete break.
3928560	3936320	There are still some common features. But if you were to jump three generations or four generations
3936320	3939760	and then compare, then I think it would be increasingly difficult to see
3940400	3947600	any sense of affiliation, any sense of connection by that point. And I suppose my argument now is
3947600	3955680	that a figure like Schoenberg, although obviously his music is radical and it was in its time and
3955680	3962000	continues to be for many people in alienating language, nevertheless, his intention, his aim,
3962000	3967360	which you can easily trace in the music, was not fundamentally different from the attitude of a
3967360	3972160	Beethoven who wants to address everybody fundamentally. The language in which he's doing so
3972960	3979120	may be rebarbative, it may be challenging. But I believe that's his fundamental aspiration.
3979120	3984080	It's his hope that the work will eventually find its audience. It will eventually be
3984080	3991200	comprehensible and it will speak to humanity in the broadest sense. I simply don't believe that
3991200	3997440	for a lot of composers working today, that is their ambition. And I don't believe that they
3997440	4002880	believe that that's even something that one can aspire to today. Now, obviously, you could say
4002880	4007760	I'm making a bit of a paper tiger out of these figures. I'm not citing names, but as a general
4007760	4015120	phenomenon, my sense is that the expectations that artists have today in terms of what might be
4015120	4023120	possible to do are significantly lower. Yes, I think that's true. But I'm not completely sure
4023200	4027840	if I agree with you on how similar Schoenberg and Beethoven were in that respect. I mean,
4027840	4035600	Schoenberg did still say if it's for all, then it's not art. I'm not sure on what basis the
4035600	4043200	evidence is that Schoenberg really was intending, or at least imagining, that he was going to write
4043200	4050640	a music that would speak to all people. I mean, it's often that thing that he apparently said
4050640	4057360	to Josef Rufa about I've come across a new technique that will sustain German music for another
4057360	4063120	hundred years. He probably didn't say that. No, but those two statements are in contradiction to
4063120	4070800	one another. You have to be careful with the proclamations of composers. It's not self-evident
4070800	4075200	that he actually believed that. When he would say, for example, if it's art, it's not for everybody,
4075200	4079200	and if it's for everybody, it's not for art. I don't know that he necessarily believed that.
4079200	4083920	Maybe he did, but you have to look at the work and what the work is aiming to do.
4086960	4089040	I'm not utterly convinced by that.
4089920	4096720	Well, how about if I put it a slightly different way? I say Schoenberg was aiming to write music
4097360	4101920	whose greatness he thought would ultimately be realized by all, but that didn't mean
4102560	4107440	that all would want to listen to it. Right. Whereas I think Beethoven did imagine
4108000	4110960	probably most of those who thought it was great would want to listen to it as well.
4111840	4114880	Even the late string quartets, the Grosse figure. Maybe not by that stage,
4116240	4120480	but that's quite exceptional within his own output, even within his late output,
4120480	4127600	where Charles Rosenscher is very well, how to some extent he actually returns to some of the
4127600	4135360	more strict formal models from his earlier work in comparison to some of the late mid-period works,
4135360	4140960	where he's pushing the boundaries of form all the more. Even the Hammerklavier sonata,
4140960	4145600	the first movement, is in a quite strict traditional sonata form in many ways,
4145600	4148320	more so than some of the other sonatas that surround it.
4154080	4158720	That's the sort of thing I'd link to a whole phenomenon within certain types of modernism
4158720	4164960	that were about expanding resources, but also reinscribing a certain sort of new formal discipline.
4165520	4171760	As well. You can find that across the arts, especially in architecture,
4171760	4177040	and you find that there's a deep classicizing strain in most of the modern movement, I would say.
4178720	4186800	They were in some ways reacting against late romantic excess, and the same is true,
4186800	4188400	I think, in a lot of music as well.
4195520	4203680	This is where, you know, the model that, well, it's actually Richard Tereskin has developed it a
4203680	4209760	lot, though it draws upon lots of us before him, of his period of maximalism between around 1890
4210880	4218400	to around 1918 in music, where you see the most opulent extravagant works of Strauss,
4218400	4224400	of Schoenberg, of the earlier Ravel, and of lots of other figures,
4225600	4231760	which contrast so strongly with this paring down and narrowing of resources. I mean,
4231760	4236560	early Stravinsky would fall into that mode as well, but then when you hear works like the
4236560	4241840	architect of Stravinsky, you know, you're almost listening to a different composer. I mean, with
4243040	4246320	real familiarity, one could see the commonalities between the two things,
4246320	4254240	but in terms of the idiom, in terms of the style, all of that ostentation has gone, and you can see
4254240	4262560	this in, to a slight, not quite a screen degree, but in Ravel's work before and after around the sort
4262560	4270320	of mid-1910s, the sort of world of Gaspar, or of Daphnis, is such a different idiom from that,
4270320	4275120	you find it something like the violin sonata, or L'Enfantil√© sortil√®che, though he returns to
4275120	4280160	a bit of it in the left-hand concerto. That's why I say it's not quite so extreme, the gap there,
4280160	4286320	but that's why I've always thought of 1918 as being the really crucial turning point. It's
4287520	4297280	reinscribing a cleaner and more objective, if you like, and more disciplined music to get away
4297280	4304320	from the excesses of expression, and that's, if you follow the debates amongst the sort of
4304320	4312400	German aestheticians of the left during the 20s, that's very clear, between between the advocates
4312400	4320160	of expressionism of which Ernst Bloch, and to some extent Adorno, were probably the last true
4320160	4326800	advocates, and then all the much more common ideas around the Neuers-Achelic guide, and then later on
4326800	4334960	the new objectivity. And if anything, the new objectivity was maybe new in Germany,
4334960	4342480	wasn't so new in France, that's at least as far back as the early Sati you see, that sort of
4342480	4347120	break certainly was the Wagnerian model, and Debussy broke with the Wagnerian model as well,
4347120	4353200	but not as drastically as Sati did. I think once again, I think this is a progressive
4354160	4360160	tendency that you see that's been playing out for decades. We may be in the end stages of it,
4360160	4364880	I don't know, it's hard to have the requisite distance and objectivity to look at these things
4365520	4372800	properly, but all I can see is judging from the indications that I can observe from people who
4372800	4379040	are outside of the Neu music world. It certainly appears to be the case that as a cultural force,
4379120	4385280	as something that may in some manner contribute to shaping our culture, and you could certainly
4385280	4390720	argue that there's a kind of a trickle down effect where it doesn't reach the ears of most
4390720	4396960	people, but nevertheless it does eventually find its way down into something that would be more
4397600	4404480	accessible or popular in nature. But that as a cultural force, it's basically spent,
4404720	4409840	the game is over, nobody's listening except for interested parties, professional artists,
4410800	4415200	the people who attend festivals such as Dono Eshingen and Darmstadt, who tend to be music
4415200	4421360	professionals. But outside of that, there's no, to use your term, there's no wider resonance from
4421360	4430240	the vast majority of the production of Neu music. That is the indication I'm getting from people
4430240	4436640	outside of that. Now these are not Philistines, these are not uneducated people, they are in
4436640	4441440	many instances extraordinarily cultivated, well-versed in culture, extremely well-read,
4441440	4446880	very familiar with classical music. And this is what I'm hearing.
4448160	4453680	Well, there are three things that come to mind in the context of all that you're saying there.
4453840	4467360	The first is to ask whether the idea of a new music cultural sphere, which seems to sort of
4467920	4474800	communicate only within its own realms to groups of aficionados who go along to festivals,
4474800	4479840	a lot of them with professional involvement in that scene, to ask really how new that is.
4479840	4485280	I mean, if you read a lot about the festivals, and there were many in the 1920s, but of which
4485280	4491840	probably the best known now is that in Dono Eshingen and later in Baden-Baden and Berlin,
4494160	4499680	I've read enough about the reception of the concerts there, and wider commentary about
4499680	4504240	festival culture to see many of the same sorts of sentiments being expressed then.
4504880	4513360	A concern that new music was sort of painting itself into a corner was obsessed with certain
4513360	4518720	types of experiment over and above the challenges of writing something that might have some
4518720	4525600	wider currency. And, well, it's quite interesting if we look back at the programs from Dono Eshingen,
4525600	4533760	I mean, how many Psytopias are known nowadays, whatever happened to those sort of radio
4533760	4542320	compositions that people, including Hindemith wrote, or, I mean, actually many of the figures there,
4542320	4547840	I mean, who listens to Heinz Teesson or Ernst Tocke, except perhaps the geographical fugue
4548480	4553440	nowadays. Even a figure like Stefan Wolper is really very much a composer,
4555680	4560480	appreciated within a narrow circle, but not that much outside of there. But you did see
4560480	4565120	things like New Works of Bartok being played at these festivals as well, and those have made
4565120	4574080	their way into some sort of wider repertoire. So, I am in time going to be writing a new
4574080	4579600	history of musical modernism in the Weimar Republic, and it strikes me how little of the German
4579600	4585600	composers of that time are heard with any frequency nowadays. Hindemith's reputation is nothing like
4585600	4593200	it was when I was younger, let alone what it was in the 50s. Certainly the Second Vanity School are
4593200	4600000	played, but even even that's within, I mean, I think probably most musicians have encountered
4600000	4604480	some of their work, but it hasn't really etched you to wider currency. But that to one side,
4604480	4609760	Kurt Vile's work has definitely had a lasting impression. You don't often hear that advanced
4609760	4616240	Kronik nowadays. You don't hear Tach, you don't hear Ties, and you don't hear Max Butting.
4618240	4627680	Any Phillips Janak, any number of other people who are really quite sort of prominent figures in
4627680	4637040	the 20s and 30s in Germany are now pretty much forgotten. But maybe that's quite
4637120	4640800	inevitable. I could think of any number of 19th century figures for whom the same could be
4641440	4647200	said. Maybe if just a few things come out of this festival circuit and go on to continue
4647200	4653680	to be listened to, that in itself is as much as we might reasonably hope for. So, it might be a bit
4653680	4660960	premature to say that what's being played in the new music infrastructure is a term I like to use
4660960	4667120	for it, the network of festivals, of concert series, of radio stations and programmes,
4667840	4673040	and some educational institutions and journals and things as well. What is known in that,
4673920	4680160	to say that it has little wider currency, doesn't register outside of that, may not be so new, and
4681040	4686320	I think we shouldn't wholly rule out the possibility that might be a few things that do.
4686320	4691520	That's the first point, but my other points might sort of slightly temper that.
4692960	4703040	The second point I really think is important to bear in mind. When you compare music with
4703040	4710480	other cultural forms, with literature, with the visual arts, with film and television,
4711440	4720480	with dance as well, and theatre, I don't think in any of the others is quite as much of a chasm
4720480	4725680	between the popular and the high art form as exists in music.
4727360	4729280	You can trace that back to Wagner, if not earlier.
4730080	4735840	Yes, certainly, but I think it's become especially pronounced in the 20th century.
4736800	4743520	That, I mean, what perhaps hasn't really existed on any sustained, 20 sustained degree
4744240	4751760	since figures like Britain and Shostakovich say is, or Kalamides Hartman would be another,
4752720	4756480	is a sustained tradition of music which somehow,
4759920	4763200	I don't want, I really don't want to use the term middle brow because I dislike it.
4763200	4767840	I don't think that's a very fair term for those composers. I don't think those composers are any
4767840	4773920	less sort of serious or any less demanding than some of their more avant-garde counterpoints.
4774720	4779600	But they are working comfortably from within a tradition without
4781680	4788400	engaging any sort of radically iconoclastic activity there. And as such, it's not such a leap
4788400	4793920	from an interest in that tradition to an interest in their work.
4793920	4800080	Well, you might be able to cite figures such as John Adams, for example, Philip Glass perhaps,
4801200	4806640	to a limited degree, George Benjamin, although I would situate him much more in the new music
4806640	4811360	realm than anything resembling what Benjamin Britton achieved.
4812400	4816000	Which is, of course, not a commentary on the achievement of George Benjamin, but simply to
4816000	4823200	point out that he doesn't have that level of cultural penetration or of accessibility in his
4823200	4829440	work. But then you could say, well, the counterargument could say, well, yes, but a figure such as
4829440	4836880	Glass, for example, is not as compositionally accomplished. The music is not of as high quality
4836880	4845600	as a lot of the output of Britton. And it's tricky to find any kind of figure
4846560	4852160	who would be who would be comparable or analogous in any way whatsoever to someone like that,
4852160	4854320	I would argue. Well, Satie, perhaps.
4856000	4857600	Satie? Why so?
4859600	4868960	Using very sort of limited and delimited compositional resources towards a particular end.
4870560	4874320	I mean, in terms of what you're saying, Glass being less accomplished as a composer than
4874320	4876880	Britton. I'm not making that argument. I'm sorry.
4876880	4878240	It's a devil's advocate position.
4878240	4883360	Yeah, because I'm not sure that would be easy to justify as an argument.
4885520	4891120	I mean, we could say that a large amount of Morton Feldman's music is quiet,
4891120	4894960	so he showed he could write quiet music, but he wasn't so good at the mezzo-forte as a fortissimo.
4894960	4899760	But that would be a really facile argument. I think because some composers have
4900720	4906640	stuck within limited realms doesn't make them any less accomplished than those who've done
4906640	4911040	broader things. I mean, I know Schrockhausen once criticized composer, and it's thought he
4911040	4915200	might have had people like Ligeti or Zanakis or Feldman in mind, who said, if you want to make
4915200	4921200	a big name, do something like become the snare drum composer. That's in the Robin McConae book.
4923520	4928880	So, okay, now I appreciate you saying that as a devil's advocate argument rather than
4928960	4934480	as your own one. And I think it is true to say that Glass and Adam's iteration,
4934480	4940880	others have achieved a genuine penetration to a wider public sphere in some ways,
4940880	4950400	perhaps more so than some more canonical figures. But that's a very particular direction,
4950400	4956160	and it's not one I want to denigrate by any means. I might have harsher things to say
4956880	4959600	about some of the propaganda surrounding it, whether coming from
4960320	4964960	composers or their advocates, and also about the historiography which I've written about,
4965760	4971360	which sort of posits that everything was going to pot in new music, and then these people came
4971360	4977120	along and saved their, saved its ass, as it were. And I dislike that sort of rhetoric,
4977200	4984480	even expressed in slightly less crude terms. But I think that work stands
4987200	4992080	quite outside of the classical tradition in many ways.
4992080	4998560	Well, Feldman characterized it as showbiz. He was saying he doesn't take Filt Glass seriously,
4998560	5002800	because he's in showbiz. He's not a composer, which, you know, you don't have to take that
5002800	5006640	seriously as a remark, but... Well, some Kurt Wallin showbiz, very literally.
5007920	5011840	And I'd say he's a very serious composer, and I don't just mean his early works, I mean,
5011840	5013920	all the way up to his American musicals.
5019760	5025600	When I wrote my big two-part article on the historiography of minimal music, I posited that
5026480	5033920	there are three, because I don't think minimal music represents a drastic break.
5033920	5038240	I think it does represent a break with a lot of Central European traditions,
5038240	5042960	but it has a clear lineage, and it's sort of one branch coming out of several roots.
5042960	5048240	And those roots include Musica Sati, above all, the earlier music of Stravinsky,
5048240	5055120	especially of Lesacre and Lenos. And then, and this is the argument that comes out of
5056320	5061280	work of Wim Mertens, who wrote one of the early books on minimal music, that it actually comes
5061280	5068000	out of integral serialism, in a way, and the figure of Hoivetz, who bridges those two worlds,
5068000	5074640	demonstrates that. Also, the fact that Lamont Young's early work can be seen like a sort of
5074640	5081840	expansion of Feldman onto a vast, expansion of Weber, onto a vast canvas as well.
5083520	5090400	That relationship is more complex and difficult. But then, within the traditions bequeased by
5090400	5095520	those roots, I would include Feldman's music, or Christian Wolf's music on one hand. I would include,
5096480	5103120	say, some of the work of Nicholas Ahuba, or Ernst Albrecht Stiebler, using very limited resources,
5103120	5107920	or some aspects of music spectral as well. All those different branches coming out of
5109120	5117520	a fundamental aesthetic of relative stasis, which rejects this particular dynamic and
5117520	5121600	dialectical approach to composition. Well, there's an interesting article, actually,
5121600	5127200	by Jonathan Harvey that deals with that topic. And his contention is that this is the inevitable
5127200	5133120	heritage of the Weberian project, which is of having a harmony that's completely unmoored
5133120	5137360	from any kind of a base function. Or rather, as he puts it, the base has moved up into the
5137360	5141680	middle register, but it's no longer determining the harmony. I think that was published in
5141680	5147840	contact. You probably have read that article. And that, in consequence, because of this absence of
5147840	5153760	gravity, so to speak, in the harmony, then it forces you, in a sense, to have a
5154480	5161680	a significantly slowed down harmonic rhythm. And that leads to, or to a stasis of some kind,
5161680	5167680	effectively. The music no longer is oriented or grounded. And that leads you to things like
5167680	5170480	the Feldman pieces. But that's not the only example.
5170480	5178400	I could trace that sort of unanchored music, if you like, that horizontally focused music
5179040	5185680	back to such things as the publications of books on linear counterpoint by Ernst Kurt in
5185680	5195520	1917. And the whole new lease of life that that sort of thought gave to a music that was
5195520	5204400	about line rather than about harmony as well. That's before some of Weber's major essays in
5204400	5211200	that sort of genre. But that's that sort of thinking, which is, on one hand, radical,
5211200	5216000	on the other hand, quite conservative, because it's really looking back to a time before the
5216000	5221680	19th century, before harmony comes to sort of take precedence over counterpoint and harmony
5221680	5226800	comes to be taught first towards an idea that counterpoint is at the root of things and harmony
5226800	5234240	is at most a byproduct of that. But it's using that to a radical end towards the construction
5234240	5240880	of music, which isn't sort of formed around some tonal principles, which you can still say
5240880	5245280	of relatively modal counterpoint, at least in the equal temperament era.
5245280	5251120	Okay, you seem to be arguing in that the points that I've raised in terms of how
5251120	5256960	the present moment in terms of musical production seems to me to be fundamentally
5257600	5263360	different from the way it would have been 50 or 60 years ago. That's not even to go back
5263360	5268560	any farther than that. You seem to be arguing that for many of the points that I'm raising,
5268560	5272000	there are historical precedents for it, there is a degree of connectedness,
5272000	5276000	there's nothing fundamentally exceptional about the present moment.
5276000	5280800	No, I wouldn't quite say that. I think there are differences to the present moment that I was
5280800	5287840	coming on to when I mentioned about sort of the relationship to popular music, which is something
5287840	5295360	I would loosely trace back to the early 19th century. It's an urban music fundamentally
5295360	5302320	associated with the growth of larger cities and so on. And it takes forms of things such as Music Hall
5302320	5309280	or Cafe Conceal, Cabaret or Vorderville in the 19th century, then through traditions of ragtime,
5309280	5317360	blues and early jazz and so on. But it really comes together, I think I would say in the 40s,
5317360	5322880	rather than the mid 50s, mid 50s is commonly the date given for the beginning of rock and roll.
5322880	5327760	But I would say it comes together with the beginning of Rhythm and Blues as a really
5327760	5333440	established genre in New Orleans at the beginning of the 40s, which is exactly the point that Fats
5333440	5340560	Domino was very keen to point out to some interviewer who asked him in the mid 50s,
5340560	5343120	tell me about this new music called Rock and Roll Your Play. He says,
5343120	5346240	I call it Rhythm and Blues and I've been playing it in New Orleans since 1940.
5347360	5353040	So I think it's around that time that something really comes together that forms a truly lasting
5353040	5360320	tradition which gains a very wide currency and even a global currency in time to come.
5361440	5371760	And that's a huge thing for an art music tradition to compete with. And I think more so than
5371760	5381920	let's say literary fiction does with, compared to popular fiction. The chasm is not so great
5381920	5390080	between them. Perhaps if we were talking only about that literature, the producer makes radical
5390080	5395840	experiments with form, for example, say, well, some of the literature of Samuel Beckett, the work of
5395840	5404000	B. S. Johnson, or figures like Eva Figus or Christine Brooke Rose or that sort of thing.
5404000	5414080	There, that's probably about as far away from popular fiction as you could get.
5414080	5420160	Same in cinema. If you were looking at a very experimental film, what, of Stan Brackage or
5420160	5425520	Bill Viola or something like that and you were to compare that with Jurassic Park, then
5425600	5433760	there's a big chasm. But if you'd compare, say, the very intelligent films but made for a mainstream
5433760	5439680	audience like, say, those of Martin Scorsese with some of the more populous inclined things of George
5439680	5444800	Lucas and Steven Spielberg, I don't think there's anything like the same sort of total
5446080	5452320	difference of intent and means and everything there. But that's, it's very hard for me to think
5452320	5459680	of a composer who's equivalent to someone like Scorsese in cinema. And that's in no sense to call
5459680	5464480	Scorsese a middle brow filmmaker. I think he's a very, very great filmmaker throughout his career.
5465520	5473360	But he has worked within basically narrative oriented structures. He's done very imaginative
5473360	5480400	things with all aspects of the cinema, all aspects of how you use cuts, how you use edits of other
5480400	5485760	types, how you use the camera work, everything like that, how you use music actually, everything
5485760	5491440	like that. But in ways that are meaningful to a mainstream audience.
5492000	5496480	I think you'd have to look in the popular music sphere to find an equivalent figure. I don't
5496480	5501280	think you'd find it in the composition world. Yeah. So maybe in the jazz sphere, something like
5501280	5508640	Coltrane's A Love Supreme might be comparable in a way that something like Cecil Taylor's
5508640	5516800	unit structures wouldn't, I think. If that makes sense. So I think
5519120	5527520	the competition from popular culture is of a different order of magnitude. I mean, also just
5527520	5533280	simply the global reach of it. I mean, does that much popular fiction other than perhaps
5533360	5537680	J.K. Rowling and a few others, when she was more in vogue than she is now,
5538880	5545280	how much popular fiction gets a truly, maybe 10 round as well, gets a truly global audience,
5545280	5551280	like you could say of a quite a significant amount of popular music as well, probably even less so
5551280	5559680	with theatre as well. So and, you know, a thing I noticed in academia, you can, when you talk about
5559680	5569360	cultured people, again, I come across people who know huge amounts about literature, huge amounts
5569360	5574560	about society and politics, lots about the visual arts, but you mentioned something like a D major
5574560	5579200	scale to them. And they really think this is, you know, you might as well be talking about
5579200	5584240	sort of advanced astrophysics. Right, right. But I don't think that would have been the case.
5584240	5589520	And this was my third point. I don't think that would have been the case 30 or 40 years
5589520	5598960	ago. I think a lot of educated people would have had some exposure to at least some basics of music
5598960	5605360	theory and some basics of a Western classical musical tradition. And that's, that is disappearing,
5605360	5611440	I think. It's particularly bad here in Britain and particularly bad in the US. But from all I can
5611440	5617040	tell, it's sort of being marginalised out in lots of other countries as well, perhaps at a slightly
5617040	5628080	different rate. And one of the consequences of this is that I'm, well, I think, I still think
5628640	5635920	even some of the most radical work in new music, in some sense, has meaning relative to a tradition,
5636560	5640800	including some of that stuff like Helmut Lachemann on where it's your cargo, and the sense is
5640800	5646000	turning that tradition on its head. But you need to know what that tradition is to recognise it
5646000	5657040	being turned on its head. The, I've heard from regularly, perhaps a bit too often from young
5657040	5664240	composers, they think that the classical tradition is dead, or they want it to be dead, perhaps.
5664240	5669280	I mean, in some universities, I think they don't want to have their own music to compete with that
5669280	5676080	for student interest and favour. But some of some contemporary composers have played an active
5677520	5683680	role in trying to sort of push that Western classical tradition out of the curriculum,
5684720	5687200	in a way that I think is often very destructive.
5687200	5689280	What do you think is their motivation for doing that?
5689280	5693920	Well, as I say, on one hand, I think they want to have the ground to themselves for a certain sort of
5694880	5701440	art music, if you like. And if they're just one composer amongst the great many spanning
5701440	5704880	centuries, and they're a much smaller fish, and a much bigger pond.
5704880	5709600	Do you think there are contemporary authors who are anxious about having their work
5710240	5711360	compete with Shakespeare?
5712560	5713600	Not to the same extent.
5716320	5720960	Because composers routinely, I know this because I have, I work with so many students,
5721680	5727280	they imagine themselves as being potentially in the same room as Beethoven, and they're not
5727280	5732720	measuring up. But I don't see a lot of poets thinking now, hang on a minute, this is not as
5732720	5734080	good as the Shakespearean sonnets.
5735360	5742000	Well, because I think there is an audience for contemporary literature, I say, not the most
5742000	5748080	radical experimental stuff I was mentioning, but a lot of artistic literature, if you like,
5748480	5756240	which is not in its own right, which doesn't necessarily, those who read it don't necessarily
5756240	5762960	have the same amount invested in at least sort of classics from before the 19th century.
5763760	5767920	That's possible, I think the same is true in theatre as well, and possibly in the visual
5767920	5776400	arts, so it's a bit more complex. I've not yet seen evidence that the same is true for new music.
5777360	5784160	There's a few people, there's a few people who might like some progressive rock and some zapper
5784160	5787920	or something, and then come from that into Stockhouse, and yes, I've known that happened,
5787920	5792720	but I think that's quite exceptional. There isn't the same,
5795520	5801440	constituency has say many who might read a novel of Martin Amos or something, or
5801520	5808480	Michel Huelbeck, but wouldn't necessarily be that drawn to reading Daniel Defoe or reading
5808480	5819520	Samantha's. I don't think that's there, or I haven't seen it in music, and so when I'm saying
5819520	5826640	about those in universities who are pushing the sort of, take the dead white European males off
5826640	5832000	the curriculum, and there are plenty of these, I think they're ultimately to some extent digging
5832000	5838720	their own grave here, because if they- Well, the second part of that means get rid of the
5838720	5844320	dead white males in order to make room for me. Yes, exactly, and sometimes it's just living
5844320	5848480	white males. The only way they differ is they're not dead, but unfortunately we all will be in
5848480	5853840	the end. Which posits that there's a zero-sum game effectively. Yes, there is.
5856320	5862640	But if, I mean, I really wish some contemporary poets would think more about this, if you didn't have
5864160	5870640	some sort of weight of tradition, which in some sense informs and gives somewhere to locate your
5870640	5875760	work, if you're actually just having to compete on its own terms with popular music,
5876560	5884240	do you think it was your standard chance? I hear lots of stuff about saying, oh,
5884240	5888240	we have different modes of distribution, now anyone can produce things on a laptop, and you
5888240	5892480	can produce a lot with a laptop, especially now with some of the latest AI software for
5892480	5898480	composition, which I've looked at and has other sorts of new implications. There is a lot you
5898480	5906160	can do in that respect, but how do you get anyone to listen to it? Anyone can do something,
5906160	5912400	put it out on SoundCloud, or Spotify, or something like that. But that's just as true of popular
5912960	5919920	genres as it is. Oh yes, sure. It's not as though it's any easier to emerge from nothing
5919920	5925440	and make a gigantic career for yourself as a singer-songwriter. Oh, I know, and all
5925520	5930560	I hear is this is getting harder and harder in the popular field to make any sort of impact
5931200	5936080	when there are so many other people trying to do it, and there might be all sorts of factors
5936080	5941600	with the small number who come from this and actually gain some sort of wider recognition,
5941600	5949200	which is why it's a huge mistake. And it's disingenuous when you get things like Degreak
5949200	5954880	or Supromasis to think, if you study popular music, that this will give you a route towards a great
5955760	5961440	well-paying career. For everyone you see, every population you see who is doing that,
5961440	5966160	there are any number of others who've done a handful of gigs and small venues and then
5966160	5974320	just sort of split up. Nevertheless, my intuitive sense, having been in the new music world,
5974320	5979920	I'm not really sure if I'm in it anymore, but perhaps I am, it's hard to say, is that
5980800	5988800	that there's something either fundamentally broken or exhausted about that culture today.
5989520	5994320	I don't know which. I don't know if it's repairable. I don't know if it ought to be repaired,
5994960	6002480	but the sense I get attending concerts, and this could partly be a reflection of
6002480	6007520	my being a little bit older now. So, of course, it feels different to attend a concert when you're
6007520	6012480	42, as I am now, as opposed to when you're 22. The excitement level is perhaps not the same,
6012480	6018480	because you've seen several hundred concerts in the intervening years. But it certainly seems to
6018480	6024160	me, as though something has changed, there's much less of a sense of anticipation or excitement
6024160	6029840	surrounding these events. There's a sense that the infrastructures that are supporting these sorts
6029840	6039360	of events is on very shaky ground, I would say, that it may not be able to convincingly justify
6039360	6046160	its own indefinite existence without some kind of massive change in the way that it's set up,
6047840	6054320	and that we cannot indefinitely push off into the future the question of, well, who's listening to
6054400	6057360	it? Well, future audiences, well, that doesn't work forever.
6058080	6064800	No, it doesn't work forever. And then I'll just finish this with one more point. So, there are
6064800	6072240	pieces that I've heard that involve enormous orchestras playing extraordinarily esoteric
6072240	6077680	techniques that require a great deal of specialized training that is not something you can count on
6077680	6082160	with the vast majority of professional orchestras. You need a specialized new music orchestra to do
6082160	6087440	that. Specialized new music orchestras are, of course, financially non-viable, unless they're
6087440	6094480	being massively subsidized by the state. These works require enormously expensive rehearsals to
6094480	6100640	produce, and they're typically played once. And this is not by any means an isolated phenomenon.
6100640	6105840	It is, in fact, the standard mode of operating for most of the continental festivals. And the
6105840	6113440	assumption seems to be that it's better to program only premieres or buy-in-large premieres,
6113440	6119680	let's say 90% of the works will be premieres. And it seems to be almost a structural phenomenon
6120480	6126720	that, of course, these works won't be played again, or maybe they'll be dug up in 25 years
6126720	6133280	and dusted off. But in the vast majority of cases, works that cost hundreds of thousands
6133360	6139280	of euros to put on, there's no way that you can play them with anything like the frequency that
6139280	6144160	would be required for them to become either familiar or to make any kind of an impression
6144160	6149760	beyond the local audience of maybe a few hundred people that hears the premiere. So that, I think,
6151040	6156320	I think that's got to stop, or it simply will stop out of its own inertia and out of the
6156320	6162720	sheer financial absurdity of it. So if you were to compare something like that, a composition that
6162720	6168560	takes two years to write, that requires a colossal budget in order to perform, and that can only
6168560	6176240	be done once, that sounds to me like a non-starter. Compare that to a figure such as Vivian Meyer
6176240	6181760	in the photography world. There we go. Vivian Meyer was a photographer who operated essentially
6181760	6189760	in secret. She was a street photographer in Chicago who, for decades, took square format images
6190320	6195200	with a rolloflex camera on the streets of Chicago, produced something like 25,000 photographs,
6195200	6198960	just one of the finest street photographers of all time, never showed her work to anybody,
6198960	6203920	never told anyone she was doing it. And when she died, all of these boxes of negatives were
6203920	6210160	discovered by a film historian, and she became posthumously a phenomenon. But this work is done
6210160	6218000	privately at no cost to anybody except the cost of a film for her, and ends up having a very
6218000	6224800	significant popular impact when it's eventually discovered. So there's a colossal asymmetry
6224800	6230080	between the means required to produce these things versus the number of people that will
6230080	6235840	actually benefit from that. Well, I think we do have to distinguish between the performing and
6235840	6241920	non-performing arts in this respect. I mean, photography can essentially be done by a single
6241920	6246800	person. I recognize sometimes you have other people doing prints and the negatives and so on,
6246800	6252880	but you don't require the whole apparatus of a group of performers to produce photography. It's
6252880	6264160	the same story for literature as well. Whereas music or film or theater or dance are multi-person
6264160	6270560	activities, and that's always going to be more expensive. And this is one reason why I say
6271200	6275680	what some people say about, well, why can't the modern music world be like the modern art world,
6275680	6281920	particularly in terms of the amounts of money that are made by some of the artists. But they
6281920	6290320	produce a particular thing that becomes a commodity. But here's the thing. In the popular sphere,
6291040	6297280	the amount of money that it costs to produce the thing is scaled in terms of the number of people
6297280	6302320	that it can potentially reach. There's a coherence between those two things. So if you make a film
6302320	6307200	that has a ¬£100 million budget, for example, then you're expecting to get a return on that.
6307200	6313040	You're expecting that it will draw at least ¬£100 million in the box office. So you could argue,
6313040	6319680	well, there's no reason why that should apply to the fine arts. But somebody does have to pay for
6319680	6326960	it. There's no way to get around that fact. This is what I've been banging on about for years,
6327600	6334640	a bit like a broken record, that I think the possible decline of a subsidy culture for new
6334640	6340560	music is one of the biggest threats it could possibly face. There is no way that the vast
6340560	6345600	majority of new music, other than things like rice and glass and a few others,
6347280	6352640	could survive just on the open marketplace. The costs are too great and the returns too low.
6353600	6360800	The listenership is too low, except for the odd few things that may... I mean, it's possible
6360800	6366640	some orchestra could put a big bird whistle piece on within, in the context of an otherwise
6367280	6372080	more traditional program, and they'd still get enough people in that that would just about cover
6372080	6378800	the costs of it. But those cases... Well, and yes, with things like chamber music as well and solo
6378880	6384000	performance where the costs aren't quite so great, it's also possible. But on the whole,
6385520	6391440	the vast majority of new music, as we understand it, at least in European terms,
6392320	6400160	only gets to be performed, only gets to be recorded through support, through state subsidies. So,
6400160	6405840	money collected through taxation and redistributed to make up for the shortfall, or through the
6405840	6412480	radio stations, or other broadcasters who collect it through the license fee, or to some extent
6412480	6422800	through the universities as well. Now, I mean, certainly in Britain, we've seen sweeping cuts
6422800	6426720	to arts funding, especially to music funding recently, the most prominent of which,
6427360	6434080	Relitia English National Opera, which at the time we're talking, the idea is it could be relocated
6434080	6439280	in Manchester, but it almost certainly won't be the same sort of entity that it was before.
6441120	6446560	Big grant losses to things like the Britain symphony, to the London symphony, to the
6446560	6452720	ensemble saffron in Manchester who have had to close down, and so on and so forth. And in economically
6452720	6460640	difficult times, these things are seen as perhaps not the most pressing social needs, and some of
6460640	6467360	the easiest things to cut when cuts are made. Now, many have said to me, why are you always so
6467360	6471200	concerned? Why are you always talking about subsidy? And they don't want to talk about it. They don't
6471200	6476720	think it's a very interesting issue or something. I say, well, you think it's all fine, doesn't
6476720	6482720	need thinking about while it's there. But the moment, I say, the moment people start saying,
6482720	6486800	well, maybe we don't need to spend this money on these ensembles, on these festivals,
6486880	6492880	what will be the arguments you will use to try and oppose those cuts?
6492880	6499040	Well, the problem is, that's exactly it. I don't think there necessarily are convincing
6499040	6502480	arguments, at least not to the people that would be in charge of dispensing the funds.
6503040	6508720	So for instance, you may have seen there's a rather well-known video on YouTube of Boulez
6509440	6514880	on a talk show with, I think it's Michel Schneider, who is a French minister of the time,
6515440	6520640	who gets rather combative with Boulez. And they're talking about Irkheim. And he says, well,
6521920	6526640	Irkheim is costing, I don't remember the figure, it was a colossal amount of money. It's costing
6527360	6533920	a significant percentage of the budget, the annual budget for music from the Ministry of Culture.
6534720	6539920	And the minister was basically asking Boulez, how can you possibly justify the expense of an
6539920	6546480	institution like this, given the extremely small amount of productions that it's actually producing
6546480	6551440	in terms of public concerts, in terms of anything that anybody in the general public could possibly
6551440	6556800	either understand or could attend. And of course, Boulez gets very angry and defensive and calls
6556800	6562400	the minister a fraud. But he basically sidesteps the question. He's very defensive, very angry,
6563280	6568960	but he doesn't acknowledge that there may be somewhere in there a totally legitimate question,
6568960	6573200	given that it is public money, it is coming out of the taxpayer's pocket.
6573200	6576400	So what is the justification for such a colossal expense,
6577120	6582160	given that the vast majority of the population is never going to either attend a concert or
6582160	6589600	benefit in any tangible way from that institution? Well, I think it is possible to make some sorts
6589600	6596400	of arguments there. But just to compare an even more mainstream example than your Boulez interview
6596400	6602240	one, in the 1990s, there was a series here called The House about the Royal Opera House.
6602240	6607520	It was a documentary crew who followed them over an extended period. And it's widely credited with
6609920	6614880	doing no particular good to the Royal Opera House's reputation, because in this so
6614880	6620320	elevated art form, of course, you saw lots of very petty people going about their jobs,
6620320	6624640	as you would in any institution of that size. But it sort of rather deflated a lot of its own
6624640	6636320	mythology there. But there was one episode which began with the general manager, Jeremy Isaacs,
6637280	6644240	traveling to work in a taxi. And I mean, it was clearly a bit set up, but you had the taxi driver
6644800	6648800	asking some of the things that taxi drivers in London do. He says, oh, you're Jeremy Isaacs,
6648800	6653440	aren't you? He says, yes, I am. Clearly a bit grumpy and not particularly wanted to talk to this
6653440	6660080	taxi driver. He said, OK, can you just ask me something? And the taxi driver was framed as
6660080	6665520	a quite reasonable way, saying, well, why should all of people like me and other taxpayers who
6665520	6672560	never go to the opera, why should our taxes go into this? And he just gave a very grumpy and
6672560	6675920	very defensive response. And he says, well, if you're not happy, I suggest you take it up with
6675920	6682960	your MP. And he says, we get the lowest subsidy in Europe, which is true. But he wasn't prepared
6682960	6689200	to engage the question. And unfortunately, I think that's quite common that people don't want to
6689200	6696400	ask this question. Now, you could, I think, articulate an argument in terms of the advancement
6696400	6703440	of musical knowledge and musical language, which could be seen as a good in its own right, even
6703440	6708720	if only minority actually partake of that. But it could be seen to have other sort of
6709280	6714640	side effects and other byproducts. Well, I think if you don't engage the question thoroughly,
6715520	6718960	then the danger is that it will simply seem like a form of entitlement.
6719600	6726640	Which it is. It is. And do you think the people who are chasing after the commissions on all the
6726640	6732560	big festivals in Europe, do you think that many of them have a sense of some sort of wider social
6732560	6737040	responsibility? Or do you think they're thinking, what do I have to do to get the most lucrative
6737040	6742960	commissions? And many think, well, I am a great composer, or at least I say so. So therefore,
6742960	6747840	I should get these commissions. And of course, there's more people wanting them than there are
6747840	6753200	commissions to go around. And for one way reason or another, some get the commissions, some don't.
6753200	6759040	I'm not saying that's always a fair process. There's lots of factors involved, but then some get very
6759040	6765840	embittered because they feel entitled to have these things. But you can sometimes frame their
6765840	6770720	entitlement in terms that would make sense to other people in new music, the value of their
6770720	6775840	work. But framing them in terms that would make sense to a wider public is quite a bit harder to do.
6777520	6788160	And as subsidy is gradually being cut, and as what we might call an avant-garde establishment,
6788160	6795200	its position is looking more and more precarious now, including in the light of new diversity
6795200	6803200	initiatives, and so on. As that's happening, what you are starting to see is what I think rather
6803920	6810160	desperate attempts to sort of suggest some social relevance, which is where you get a lot of music,
6810160	6820160	which is distinguish more by which topical issues it fastens itself on to, as if away saying, please
6820160	6828000	look, I'm writing a piece about the war in Ukraine, so therefore it's relevant and it's meaningful.
6829280	6833360	To which, as I was saying to you before, I would ask, well, why is that a piece of music?
6835680	6841760	And if you're writing a sort of, yes, a slow laminato so for string orchestra,
6842000	6849920	saying to the dead in Ukraine, I'm sorry, forget it, I've heard 100 pieces of those,
6849920	6854640	and you could take them from one traumatic event to another without having to change
6854640	6862800	almost anything. I mean, not so many people do that in the new music scene, but they're trying
6862800	6867280	to fame discourse around their work in terms of anything other than its musical qualities.
6868000	6874640	And musical abstraction and music's lack of an object, music's not being a figurative art
6874640	6880240	primarily, of course I recognise as sort of mimetic music and programmatic music and so on,
6880240	6885840	but I don't think music is fundamentally a mimetic art and that those things, which I think are
6885840	6897920	strengths are seen as weaknesses. And I think this is just emblematic of a new music scene
6897920	6904880	that's forced onto the defensive to some extent. The sense of entitlement is not being
6905440	6913680	mirrored in wider public discourse, which now lacks prominent and articulate figures such as
6913680	6919840	Boulez, such as Stoccas, perhaps such as Carter, but those types of composers, they're all either
6919840	6925200	very old or no longer with us now. It was politically expedient in France and Germany and
6925200	6930160	other places in the post-war era to support contemporary forms of culture for various reasons.
6931760	6937520	It's no longer the case. In fact, it's a liability to the extent that the general
6937520	6941840	population even thinks about these things, which I think is highly unlikely, but it's no longer
6942480	6946480	it's no longer advantageous to say, well, look what we're doing for the arts, look what we're
6946480	6952320	doing for contemporary music. So there's no reason to imagine that it would continue indefinitely.
6952320	6960800	And my argument is that this, and to make things clear, I'm not for a minute suggesting that
6960800	6964640	everything needs to be left up to market forces. Obviously, there are certain things that cannot
6964640	6972720	be left up to the market. And I'm in favor of state support for cultural institutions,
6972720	6979120	for museums, for symphony orchestras, for operas, and so on. Where it gets complicated, I think,
6979120	6984960	is subsidies to individual artists and how those get decided, how they get distributed.
6986880	6994160	That's very tricky. And my sense now is that a better model is some kind of private funding
6994160	6999360	or crowdfunding for a lot of projects. And I think that that can actually work quite well.
6999360	7004560	And part of the reason for that is there's, in those instances, a direct connection between
7004560	7009040	the person commissioning or the group of people commissioning, there's a relationship between
7009040	7016720	them and the artist. We open to all sorts of potentials that are corruptibility,
7016720	7023840	all sorts of favoritism. It could be some rich people give their private money to other people
7023840	7028960	from their own sort of milieu, their own background, and things like that. It could work
7028960	7033520	very much against those who are not born to the backgrounds where they're going to have those
7033520	7044160	sorts of contacts and things. Moving towards private funding, I wouldn't really see as the way
7044160	7050880	forward, to be honest. Crowdfunding as well, that's, I mean, I don't know how sustainable
7050880	7056960	that is. I mean, you can do odd projects, but whether someone could sustain enough to sort of
7056960	7063840	keep working, I'm less sure. The alternative that's left, then, is making an absolutely
7063840	7069680	airtight case for continued public subsidizing of esoteric art forms.
7070720	7078480	Yes. And I think that can be done, but maybe the artistic priorities would have to change
7079200	7088400	a bit. Maybe a bit more honesty would be needed about the traditions in which these are located.
7088400	7093920	I mean, why should we not be equally giving money towards supporting things that are doing
7093920	7099280	esoteric things in popular music idioms and traditions? Why would they be any less deserving
7099840	7104000	of it? There were quite a lot of extremely violent polemics around that in France,
7104000	7110080	actually, or surrounding the Villa Medici, notably. When they decided to open that institution up to
7110080	7116320	people working in popular domains, singer-songwriters, for example, and the composers, of course,
7116320	7122240	predictably, the older, more established composers were absolutely outraged at the idea that
7122240	7127200	you're taking away a spot from us. We need this. We don't have anything else, and you're giving it
7127200	7131600	to somebody in the popular field. Unless I know people don't need it. They don't need it.
7132480	7138640	If they're doing commercial singer-songwriting, of which there's a long tradition of at least
7138640	7144400	some people making a perfectly viable commercial income from that, then I would say they're right
7144400	7149360	to say they don't need it. If they were doing something that somehow engages with stylistic
7149360	7155280	aspects of it or other aspects of those traditions, but are taking it into some new realms, then that
7155360	7165600	might be a different matter. I suppose I do see value in art being able to experiment in art,
7165600	7172320	and not just keep doing new experiments from the bottom up, but starting developing new
7172320	7178640	idioms and developing them over a period of time. Where's there some continuity across an output?
7178640	7185120	I think there is something to be said for supporting that over an extended period.
7185120	7189280	And I'll come back to that in terms of what you're saying about premiers in a second.
7192800	7200480	Because, well, I would frame it in terms of that I think a society which doesn't
7201440	7205600	offer a space for those things to be developed and articulated
7207520	7212640	is one that's somewhat impoverished in terms of knowledge, in terms of the forms of experience,
7212640	7221200	the forms of thought that are made possible, even if they are for a minority. But most people,
7221200	7225520	I believe, have some sort of minority interest. They're just not all the same, or they wouldn't
7225600	7237920	be a minority. I've used this sort of analogy with television. Supposing you have
7240560	7248160	100 people and 101 television channels, and suppose each of those channels
7249520	7255200	is only watched by one of those people, except for the 101st, which everyone watches.
7255760	7263120	As well. Do you think any of those people would be happy if you got rid of the 100 and you were
7263120	7270640	left with only number 101? There is something to be said for supporting minority interests.
7270640	7275520	The problem is, new music seems to sport only one type of quite narrow minority interest, and
7276400	7284400	probably some different form of subsidy would have to be spread across a wider range of things,
7284480	7291520	where you can produce evidence that across the board, there's a range of engagement with all
7291520	7297840	sorts of people at different parts of society. We're a long way from that at the moment.
7297840	7303680	Some places more than others. The Huddersfield Festival, for example, is quite open to a very
7303680	7309120	broad range of styles and practices. A similar thing happened with-
7309120	7313680	Yes, but what about the audiences? I know they do have a local audience at Huddersfield,
7313680	7317360	and that matters, and that's been a very important factor in sustaining that festival.
7318160	7323040	A local audience, which isn't just visionaries, but just from a local community that have taken
7323040	7329040	an interest in it. But still, for all the variety of styles and practices that there are on show at
7329040	7333920	Huddersfield, what percentage of the British population, or even the population of parts
7333920	7340320	of Yorkshire, ever listen to any of them? If they had a range of things, lots of different
7341120	7346320	communities within that geographical area listen to it. It might be a bit different.
7348080	7352720	If that is the case already, I'd like to see the evidence for it.
7353440	7355760	But I just wondered if I could come back to your question about
7356640	7360320	premiers, because I think that's very important. I'm often bemoaned.
7360320	7373280	The way that the premier culture permeates so many of the institutions and the events,
7373920	7380080	and it's almost invariably seen as a better thing to commission new works or play new
7380080	7385600	works that are doing the circuit, than it is to go back to some other works, which might have happened.
7385920	7394160	Something, I think, very highly of James Dylan's cycle nine rivers. It was all pretty much
7394160	7400800	completed, except for a few details by the early noughties. It's had a few performances,
7400800	7407360	but not that many. I think that's an amazing cycle and would really reward more sustained
7407360	7414000	exposure. But most people would sooner commission a new work from Dylan if they're at a festival.
7414480	7419040	And of course, that has to be, if we didn't have the festivals commissioning things,
7419040	7423200	then a lot of the new things wouldn't get written and everything was new at some point in time.
7423840	7430880	But I think it's too extreme in terms of, yes, a fetishization of brand new. Something that's
7430880	7436320	10 years ago can be, certainly as far as the vast majority of any population's concern,
7436320	7442960	will be just as much new music as something written now. And maybe if we had fewer premiers,
7442960	7447120	which would actually save some money if you didn't have the same amount of commission fees to pay.
7448400	7453040	And a bit more revival of things, and a bit more giving things repeated listening,
7453040	7458960	which they definitely need. And also developing a performance tradition more for those things as
7458960	7464800	well. Since I've been in Britain on this trip, I've had the opportunity to meet with quite a
7464800	7471280	few artistic directors of various ensembles and festivals and organizations. And one of the things
7471280	7474960	that's emerged out of that is a lot of these people are very conscious of the need for that.
7474960	7482400	And in fact, increasingly inclined to, when contemplating a commission project,
7482960	7486720	they'll want to set it up in such a manner that the piece can be played four or five or six times,
7486720	7491920	or potentially be taken on tour. And they're increasingly moving away from this very, what
7491920	7498400	I think is a very old fashioned and ineffective model of doing a premiere and then moving on to
7498400	7502320	the next one. I think that's absurd. And I think that there's a lot of people that are recognizing
7502320	7509600	that. And for composers, I would say, don't be shy or hesitant about arguing in favor of that
7509600	7514480	when you decide what projects you're going to take on. If the group wants to commission a piece from
7514480	7520640	you and has no plans to ever do it again beyond the premiere, then perhaps you may wish to hesitate
7521440	7522720	before accepting that project.
7523840	7531680	Well, two thoughts there. I mean, absolutely. The move towards networks, I mean, where the
7531680	7540880	model is, so a new work will get played in arse musical, it'll get played in Veen Moden,
7540880	7545040	it'll get played in Huddersfield, it'll get played in Musica Strasburg, and so on. And
7545040	7552080	there are many projects to ensure that commissions don't lead to just one performance,
7552080	7556560	but a whole range of them. But it's usually a whole range in quite quick succession after
7556560	7564240	each other, usually in one season, at least, so no more than a year. I don't know of networks
7564240	7567760	that will have things so that they'll be played once and then played five years later and then
7567760	7573840	10 years later, and so on. And I know the objections that there are to some of these
7573840	7579520	networks, that it turns the festival circuit into more of a monolith and more homogenous in
7579520	7587040	its own way. If basically all the big festivals are just doing the big names and the new works of
7587040	7593200	those, that becomes less of a place for more distinct festivals as more of their own sort of
7593200	7599360	distinctive nature and character. So I suppose that's, I don't know why you couldn't have a
7599360	7603040	festival with its own distinctive character, but still isn't just focused on premiers.
7604400	7611120	So there's that factor for start, but there's also the question, are people writing music
7611920	7615520	that will last? Or are they even wanting it to last?
7618880	7626320	Let me think in the realms of, I mean, we're still talking with our point of reference being the
7626320	7633360	work. And in something like free improvisation, that really wouldn't be the case in the same
7633360	7639200	way. I mean, yes, there are works of free improvisation, and there are some that are
7639200	7644480	perhaps not quite so free or so improvised as suggested to be when they're done on repeated
7644480	7652000	occasions and there's quite a lot of commonality between them. But the event perhaps counts for more
7652000	7659120	than the work and its permanency in that sort of genre.
7660000	7665360	Now, to be fair, not all artists are necessarily preoccupied with posterity.
7666400	7671760	And it's a completely legitimate standpoint, I think to say. I'm making things for today,
7671760	7677360	and if it lasts and if it doesn't, that's fine. But I'm interested in doing what I
7677360	7682960	want to do that reflects the current moment and fate will decide. And it's fine.
7682960	7690640	Absolutely fair enough. No one, including the cabozas, can know for sure what will and won't
7690640	7697280	last. And trying self-consciously to write things for posterity brings his own set of problems.
7698320	7703680	You can see that. So I suppose I wasn't so much thinking of cabozas writing saying,
7703680	7709760	well, I'll do the best I can and then let history take its course as far as how it's seen. I was
7709760	7715600	thinking rather more of people writing more ephemeral and topical and off-the-moment things.
7718480	7724080	And this is where, yes, I'm looking at free improvisation. I'm looking at certain sorts
7724080	7730800	of community projects involving amateurs, very in vogue at the moment and so on. And lots of things
7730800	7736640	that might be more interesting for the participants and for the listeners.
7737520	7744560	And I do think that if I'm really honest, particularly with things involving amateurs,
7745120	7753200	it's a bit of a taboo, but I've reached taboo a bit. I'm not so convinced about an awful lot
7753200	7758080	of work with amateurs. And I don't really like the role that amateurism has in British musical
7758080	7765920	culture overall. I don't think anyone would find it so problematic if I suggested that
7765920	7773280	amateur dramatics are mostly for friends and family to see maybe a couple of others.
7775360	7778640	Maybe amateur music making is the same.
7778640	7783760	Yes, it depends on the level of accomplishment of the amateur, of course. Because in Germany,
7783760	7789120	there's of course a very strong tradition of, well, in fact, I know many people
7790320	7793520	in Strasbourg, for example, who are professionals in other fields. They might be
7794240	7797840	they might be diplomats, they might be working for the Council of Europe, they might be
7799440	7805200	who have a degree in music, who are passionate about music, but are simply not pursuing it as
7805200	7810080	a career, but who are outstanding performers. Absolutely. The New London Chamber Choir here,
7810080	7813280	again, not a professional choir, but one of the most outstanding,
7814000	7818000	the Disc of Synaxus' Choral Works is one of the greatest synaxus discs I think there's ever been.
7818880	7825200	And yes, some of the amateur choirs there are more widely, not specific to new music.
7826320	7832720	There is some fair degree of accomplishment there. But, well, in Britain, I think this means
7832720	7836400	that people think rare, therefore, we don't really need many professional choirs. And that's the
7836400	7842560	problem I have there. But I'm thinking more of these community projects with amateurs.
7843280	7849520	They may form some useful community social function, but I'm not sure they necessarily
7849520	7856000	produce really remarkable art. I mean, I've seen some exceptions. Some of the work that people
7856000	7860480	like Gerhard Stabler and Konzu Shim have done with amateurs or schoolchildren has been absolutely
7860480	7869120	remarkable, I think, really gripping stuff. But it's very directed. I mean, both of them know
7869120	7875840	exactly what they want from these people and can get it. But I'm not really sure how much input
7875840	7881200	beyond sort of doing what they're told the amateurs and others have in that.
7884160	7888080	So what I'm saying is if we're looking for something where you'll have more sustained
7888080	7893840	traditions and where we will have repeated performances, there needs to be work which
7893840	7898480	will stand up to that. That's quite right. That is quite right. Yes. Yes, you would have to be,
7898480	7902960	you would have to be aiming to produce work that can withstand that kind of scrutiny,
7902960	7909680	that kind of repeated listening. Yeah. Well, we should probably wrap this up. Before we stop,
7909680	7913520	though, is there anything you'd like to tell our listeners about what you're working on currently
7913520	7921440	and what you're doing at the moment? Well, things have taken a certain new direction in my
7921440	7926160	professional life that I've moved from my university, City University of London,
7926160	7930880	I've moved from the music department to the sociology department. I'm now professor of music,
7930880	7936080	culture and society here. And there are a lot of continuities in terms of the type of teaching
7936080	7941840	I do. I mean, I've taught about music and some aspects of wider culture in social context
7941840	7947360	for a long time. And if anything, I probably find there's a more hospitable culture in the
7947360	7953120	new department I'm in towards what I'll say is a dialectical view of the relationship between
7953760	7958480	what I call culture with a medium-sized C, which means not just high culture,
7958480	7963120	can be popular culture as well, but it means things specifically designated as culture.
7963120	7968160	It doesn't just mean the whole realm of human activity, which is the more anthropological
7968160	7973200	definition. But when I say dialectical model, I mean, between that type of culture and the
7973200	7980160	rest of society, there are all sorts of interplays, interactions, but it's not a simple deterministic
7980160	7984480	relationship. You can't say because of society's particular way, it'll therefore automatically
7984480	7990320	produce this type of culture. The culture isn't just a bright part of society. The culture is
7990320	7996320	equally part of society and can exist in a critical relationship with the rest of society.
7996320	8001040	Now, that's widely accepted amongst a lot of cultural sociologists, perhaps not so much
8001040	8006400	amongst some music sociologists and music anthropologists and so on. So it's actually
8006480	8014640	refreshing to find a much more open intellectual culture with respect to that and lots of other
8014640	8019680	things in here. So I teach more widely about culture, not just about music, and I teach
8019680	8025040	about classical social theory, but I will be teaching more about music as a social phenomenon
8025760	8032320	as well. Beyond that, I'm still playing. I've been playing perhaps more traditional repertoire
8032320	8040480	in the last few years. In 2022, I did this big cycle of all nine of Liszt's versions of
8040480	8044560	Beethoven's symphony, and I followed it up with doing this version of the Symphony Fantastique
8044560	8050880	last year of Berlioz as well. And, you know, I'm looking for new and interesting ways of
8050880	8055120	combining the old and the new, which is something I've done for a long time, but
8055920	8061600	it's more fundamental to me now. So I'm doing that. I'm doing lots of writing. I'm writing a new
8061680	8067120	biography of Stockhausen for reaction books. I'm working on other books on musical modernism
8067120	8072880	in Germany after 45 and on the history of specialist music schools in Britain
8074640	8082320	and a whole range of articles. And I've been writing more for non-academic outlets. I've done
8083280	8090160	oh, since, since 2022, I've published only 11 articles in the Times Higher Education
8091360	8097200	Journal on lots of things to do with education, including to do with music, but not just that.
8098240	8104080	I've written more stuff for the London Review books for the critic, and you're trying to,
8105120	8110160	again, not always on music, but very much on cultural issues and cultural and political
8110160	8115920	issues. And those things are very important to me. And the opportunity to engage with wider
8115920	8121680	audiences, also at public events where I've given talks and things is really important. And
8122960	8134160	it's made me realise the value of that for, for academics. I think there is certainly value
8134160	8138560	in academics working on something without necessarily knowing where it's going to lead,
8138560	8143760	just like we're talking about with musicians. And much knowledge has been generated without
8143760	8148160	necessarily clear endpoints at the beginning. And that's a whole nature of research. You don't
8148160	8154080	necessarily know what your research will tell you in the end. But that has to come to some point at
8154080	8164160	which there is a culture of thought of intellectual activity that if they must, if, if they've never
8164160	8172480	had any discernible, even indirect impact outside of small circles, then their, their value, surely
8173120	8180080	it's fair to question that. And I've, I've thought about this in the context of academic
8180080	8185040	writing on culture, including the realms of cultural studies and so on, which I think is
8185040	8194880	distinct from cultural sociology. You can produce any number of journal articles which will get
8194880	8204720	hardly read, which have very, very jargon ridden particular takes on cultural phenomena as on.
8205840	8210240	Now, I don't expect journal, academic journal articles to be read by a wide readership. They're
8210240	8214800	not done for their purpose. But I might expect that some of their core arguments might be distilled
8215120	8221760	and find their way into writings for, for a wider audience. And that's to something that what I'm
8221760	8227360	trying to do is from my wider writing and things. And that there are academics who are very hostile
8227360	8234560	to that. They, they don't ever want to sort of be asked any questions about what the wider impact or
8235600	8242160	relevance of their work is. And I think that's unsustainable in the long run. And, you know,
8242160	8247680	just like we're talking about possible crises and lack of faith in the realm of new music,
8249040	8256400	the same sort of things are happening in universities and certainly in Britain and
8257760	8261360	in some other countries, but I think particularly in Britain, now that we have about half the
8262000	8269120	population graduating from high school going into university, it's forced questions about
8269120	8273920	what university is for. And you can't just answer them in the same way as you did when
8273920	8278960	only 20% of the population. It was like, it was something like that or not much more when I was
8278960	8285600	a student. And you, the whole model of the relationship between research and teaching
8285600	8290720	has to be looked at again, and the whole model of what, which disciplines matter
8290720	8297200	inevitably does. And this has been happening, but it's made life difficult for those working in
8297760	8302960	what seem like very esoteric disciplines when they're no longer succeeding and generating
8302960	8311360	the same interest from young people are studying those things. And you do ultimately need students
8311360	8315680	for universities. They're not, they may be primarily research things, but they can't be only
8315680	8322560	research things on at least a whole sector can't be sustained that way. And how we can maintain
8323360	8332320	aspects of real sort of critical knowledge generation whilst also teaching things that
8332960	8338800	young people will find engaging and important. And we can somehow demonstrate to the wider society,
8338800	8345120	which we expect to fund our activities, how, how what we do has some other meaning. I think
8345120	8351600	those things can't be ignored and need to be ends as difficult times coming ahead. The British
8351600	8359680	university sector has been had a situation where fees were frozen in 2017 at 9,250 per year for,
8360400	8366880	for home undergraduate students. So in real terms, this means that the amount of money that each
8366880	8372800	institution has coming in is going down every year whilst whilst it's frozen that they can't
8372800	8378480	go up with inflation. At the same time, Brexit spent a real reduction of EU students,
8378480	8386160	new visa laws are making it harder for other foreign students to come. And certain subjects,
8386880	8393760	including music, are finding cuts in secondary provision here. So there isn't the same demand
8393760	8398960	generated amongst potential students. So we've just recently seen that the music department
8398960	8404480	in Oxford Brooks was scheduled to be closed down together with some other departments,
8404560	8409440	like including the Department of Mass there. And there were going to be cuts in other
8409440	8415280	developed particularly arts and humanities. Unfortunately, I foresee in the next five or
8415280	8419360	10 years, because other factors are going to make the financial provision even more precarious in
8419360	8427120	universities, we may see other cuts and we need to be adaptable and flexible and be prepared to
8427120	8431920	sort of countenance new ideas of what the university is for whilst holding on to what's best here. And
8432880	8436560	that's very much what I'm engaged with in what I'm writing about those subjects,
8436560	8440560	just like with music. Ian Pace, thank you very much. Always a pleasure to talk with you.
8440560	8441920	Likewise, thank you.
