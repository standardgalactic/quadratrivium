00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Is the romantic archetype of the great artist finished? And if so, what is replacing it?

00:06.800 --> 00:14.480
No, I don't think it is finished. I think there are still absolutely great artists who produce

00:14.480 --> 00:21.040
work that's on a level with which only a small few others produce anything comparable.

00:21.840 --> 00:28.800
And I think you can find hierarchies of artistic production in most

00:30.000 --> 00:36.800
cultures in the world and in most periods in history. Whether the particular archetype

00:36.800 --> 00:43.920
that was promoted by the romantics and the idea of the somewhat aloof artist and the

00:43.920 --> 00:49.520
artist as a seer of special truths not really available to anyone else. Whether that has the

00:49.520 --> 00:54.880
same currency today as it might have had in the early 90s century, I'm less sure. But I still think

00:54.880 --> 01:04.160
there are absolutely great artists and I still think it's important that art forms a type of

01:04.160 --> 01:10.640
activity which interacts with a wider society but doesn't just simply mirror it or isn't simply

01:10.640 --> 01:17.360
determined with it by it. So I do believe in art existing in a dialectical relationship with the

01:17.360 --> 01:24.000
rest of society and culture. And I do distinguish the words art and culture and that's even allowing

01:24.000 --> 01:29.520
for multiple different meanings of the term culture itself. Right. Well, there are those who would

01:29.520 --> 01:33.840
say that the very idea of the great artist is something that should be called into question

01:33.840 --> 01:40.880
in the sense that it seems to indicate what would you say, well, a hierarchy to begin with,

01:40.880 --> 01:46.800
a hierarchy of competence or of importance that some would call into question. They would instead

01:46.800 --> 01:52.560
espouse perhaps a more flat horizon, a more flat landscape in which everybody potentially can

01:52.560 --> 01:59.120
contribute as opposed to the, I'm caricaturing this perhaps, but the great man archetype of

01:59.120 --> 02:03.360
people like Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, Kandinsky, Schoenberg and so on.

02:04.400 --> 02:11.840
Well, I'd ask if they would extend that anti-hierarchical view into popular culture, say. I mean,

02:12.800 --> 02:19.120
would they say that the reason why Taylor Swift or BeyoncÃ© are such global superstars compared

02:19.120 --> 02:23.120
to many others that only a small community ever heard of, is that entirely arbitrary?

02:24.480 --> 02:29.920
Is that not something to do with how they sing, how they dance, how they perform, the things that

02:29.920 --> 02:35.120
they do sing or whatever? I mean, this is putting whatever views I might have about either of those

02:35.360 --> 02:42.800
artists to one side, but I don't really believe anyone truly thinks that there are no distinctions

02:42.800 --> 02:50.560
and no hierarchies between different types of artists in whatever form. And, you know, if it's

02:50.560 --> 02:54.960
just down to a simpler thing as a conversation between two people who've been watching something

02:54.960 --> 02:59.760
on television the previous evening, they'll often talk about what they thought of it,

02:59.840 --> 03:06.400
how good it was. One might think it's better than the other does. You're already setting up a hierarchy

03:06.400 --> 03:14.240
in that very process. Value judgment, I think, is a very common and perhaps even intrinsic human

03:14.240 --> 03:20.720
activity when confronted with art, confronted with culture. And it's only perhaps a small few

03:20.720 --> 03:26.320
academics, including semester musicologists and anthropologists, who seem to think you can

03:27.200 --> 03:33.680
totally bracket out value judgment or is it somehow, it's some great sin. I don't think so.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.560
I think it goes on all the time. And the moment you have value judgments about any culture,

03:38.560 --> 03:42.000
then you create hierarchies between those who produce it.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.040
Okay. I want to stay on this question of artistic greatness, of the great artist for a moment,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.720
because this is very much on my mind at present. First of all, how would you define a great artist

03:52.720 --> 03:57.520
in the present day context? What would that sort of a figure do and what would their role be within

03:57.520 --> 04:04.880
society? Right. Well, those are two quite different questions, I think. I mean, very simply,

04:05.840 --> 04:10.000
I'd say a great artist is one who produces a lot of great art, but I realize that doesn't

04:10.000 --> 04:18.800
really answer the question then what constitutes great art. And I'm not sure if I can really

04:19.040 --> 04:25.440
answer that question in any sort of comprehensive way. I can believe that such a thing like great

04:25.440 --> 04:32.720
art does exist. But why exactly it's great and it's so much greater than a lot of other things

04:32.720 --> 04:37.920
is often quite a complex question and needs to be addressed in each individual case.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.240
If you could say this is what makes great art, that almost suggests that there's a

04:42.240 --> 04:46.720
formula for producing it, which I don't believe there is.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.240
Well, I think to start with, just to unravel this a little bit, the greatness of the art

04:52.240 --> 04:56.880
does not reside only in the art itself. So it has something to do with the way the

04:56.880 --> 05:01.600
art or indeed the artist interfaces with their society. And the greatness has something to do

05:01.600 --> 05:08.640
with magnitude, to use a word that is perhaps not ideal, but the impact that the artist may be

05:08.640 --> 05:16.640
having or may not be having. If the work is great but exists in a drawer and is not doing

05:16.640 --> 05:24.160
anything real in the world besides merely existing, then can we ascribe greatness to that?

05:25.760 --> 05:31.840
Well, last year I went to see the Vermeer exhibition that was on in Amsterdam, which is

05:31.840 --> 05:37.360
absolutely incredible, probably the greatest art exhibition I've ever seen. Now I know that

05:37.360 --> 05:41.840
Vermeer's paintings languished relatively unknown for quite an extended period until

05:41.840 --> 05:44.560
they were rediscovered. I think it was some point in the 19th century.

05:48.480 --> 05:54.640
Now they didn't have the impact that they have now in the earlier times, and they didn't have

05:54.640 --> 06:00.560
a critical scholarly apparatus that developed around them, and which I do believe conditions

06:00.560 --> 06:05.120
to some extent the reception of art, and I don't mean that in a negative way.

06:06.080 --> 06:13.520
But I don't see any necessary reason why if they hadn't had that in earlier times,

06:13.520 --> 06:17.360
they wouldn't have been thought just as great then. So what I'm trying to say from that is,

06:17.360 --> 06:24.640
I don't think the reasons we think Vermeer is great now are limited to our current temporal

06:24.640 --> 06:30.400
moment. I think it's something much more intrinsic in the art, which gives the potential for a

06:30.400 --> 06:36.640
particular level of impact. But I don't think that is something grafted on artificially. I think

06:36.640 --> 06:42.800
that has to somehow come out of the intrinsic qualities of the art itself, which to me is sort

06:42.800 --> 06:50.160
of self-evidently monumental in Vermeer's case. So I'm just trying to remember the rest of your

06:50.160 --> 06:57.200
question. Well, would there be... Is it more difficult to make a claim for greatness if the

06:57.200 --> 07:04.640
artist is addressing perhaps an extraordinarily restricted audience, or perhaps even no one at

07:04.640 --> 07:09.760
all, as opposed to... The Vermeer case is interesting because you could certainly put forth the argument

07:09.760 --> 07:16.640
that Vermeer is addressing very simple universal concepts in his work that speak to a large number

07:16.640 --> 07:24.000
of people. If we get into modernism and wherever it is we are now, you get into an archetype of

07:24.000 --> 07:34.080
an artist that is extraordinarily, in many instances, detached from the reality of the

07:34.080 --> 07:41.520
society in which they're living. And perhaps even dealing with artistic aesthetic concepts that are

07:41.520 --> 07:47.120
so esoteric by their very nature that such universality, though it may be buried in there

07:47.120 --> 07:50.800
somewhere, is going to be extraordinarily difficult for most people to locate.

07:50.800 --> 07:56.640
I'll take two of the examples that you suggested before, Stravinsky and T.S. Eliot.

07:58.640 --> 08:06.880
The means that they were using for conveying their art might have been, to some extent,

08:06.880 --> 08:12.000
esoteric at the time, perhaps more so in Eliot's case than at least the early Stravinsky,

08:13.920 --> 08:17.920
but I think they were dealing with concerns that were extremely

08:18.880 --> 08:25.920
urgent at the time. In the early Stravinsky dealing with issues of primitivism, of folklorism,

08:25.920 --> 08:32.320
with stylized barbarism and so on, which, for the works he was writing at the beginning of the

08:32.320 --> 08:38.000
1910s, they now look incredibly prescient, I think, in knowledge of what happened in the

08:38.000 --> 08:42.720
succeeding decades. In the case of Eliot, I mean, he was engaging with popular culture,

08:42.720 --> 08:53.600
with sort of popular song and ballads and things like that, and looking at the modern city and the

08:53.600 --> 09:02.080
whole alienation that came with that, and looking at the state of religion in his own time. These

09:02.080 --> 09:08.400
were not very simply private concerns to Eliot himself. The way he assembled these into his

09:08.400 --> 09:15.120
montage, like works of quite heavily, I would say, inspired by sort of Baudelaire's view of the city

09:15.120 --> 09:24.560
as well, might have been part of a technical approach that was at that stage relatively

09:24.560 --> 09:32.000
unfamiliar to readers, but those things have become absorbed into a much wider cultural

09:32.000 --> 09:40.560
vernaculars. And so I suppose in both cases, I am questioning whether this work really was so cut

09:40.560 --> 09:45.520
off from society, whether it was so esoteric, because I think it was dealing with sort of

09:45.520 --> 09:50.480
very socially, in both cases, they were dealing with very socially and politically urgent things,

09:50.480 --> 09:57.920
and I think they remain so. Now in their cases, whether those would still remain so in 200 years

09:57.920 --> 10:05.280
from now, well, I can only guess. I believe so. I mean, again, I'm speculating there, but

10:05.280 --> 10:12.960
I believe so in the same way that, you know, I can read Dante nowadays, and that is incredibly vivid

10:12.960 --> 10:22.960
to me. Some of the more esoteric pieces of medieval theology take at least some sort of

10:23.040 --> 10:28.320
extra annotations to understand, I find, certainly stuff in parody so. But nonetheless,

10:29.120 --> 10:38.640
as a narrative, as a form of social commentary, when this incredible thing of deciding which

10:38.640 --> 10:45.200
circles of hell you will consign people, you know, and public figures to, I think it's absolutely

10:45.200 --> 10:53.200
gripping, even though it dates from the best part of a millennium ago. And I don't necessarily see

10:53.200 --> 11:00.240
any reason why Stravinsky and Eliot won't be the same. I do think some very, very topical art

11:00.240 --> 11:08.400
that deals with very, very much issues of their time, which do not necessarily project out much

11:08.400 --> 11:16.480
further, tends to date a lot more. And this is a reason that I'm quite skeptical about a lot of

11:16.480 --> 11:24.240
explicitly political art. No, not all. It's stuff that's absolutely rooted in response to concrete

11:24.240 --> 11:31.760
events. Well, there's various reasons that I'm skeptical about it. One is the obvious one that

11:31.760 --> 11:38.960
when those events cease to be current, the art loses a lot of its immediacy. But there's also

11:38.960 --> 11:43.680
the issue of whether there's something exploitative about this, whether it's sort of rendering a

11:43.680 --> 11:48.000
trustee's into art, whether it's taking some of the edge off them by rendering them aesthetic,

11:48.000 --> 11:52.320
which is sort of how Adorno's critique of that worked.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.480
Well, unless there's something in the style and substance of the work that is so transcendently

11:56.480 --> 12:02.080
interesting that the pretext for its creation simply falls by the wayside. So for instance,

12:02.080 --> 12:08.560
if you take, this is a random example, I suppose, but if you take the novels or the journalistic

12:08.560 --> 12:13.680
work of Hunter S. Thompson, so the things that he was describing at the time are no longer of

12:13.680 --> 12:22.640
particular public interest, their political events or events of the day that are now decades

12:22.720 --> 12:28.400
beyond us. But nevertheless, there's something in the style, in the substance of those works

12:28.400 --> 12:31.920
that is phenomenally interesting and that transcends the original subject matter.

12:32.480 --> 12:38.240
So in the best case, in the best case, I think that the work can survive on that basis.

12:39.040 --> 12:46.880
I absolutely agree. And that's a sort of testament to quite what a good writer Hunter S. Thompson

12:46.880 --> 12:53.920
was. It's why it's probably a mistake to see his work primarily in terms of specific events

12:54.560 --> 12:59.600
that he's looking at, but rather in terms of the much wider concerns that he's drawing out of them.

12:59.600 --> 13:04.160
And yes, I could say that about any number of other things. I could say that about Guernica, for example.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.680
So where does that leave the statement that I was just making before?

13:11.840 --> 13:17.600
I think it's about sort of distinguishing,

13:20.400 --> 13:25.040
I'm going to use some very old fashioned vocabulary here, distinguishing between

13:25.680 --> 13:30.880
human concerns and localised political concerns.

13:31.760 --> 13:40.480
Now, what would I'm trying to think of some other examples? I mean this...

13:41.680 --> 13:47.840
Ode to Napoleon, for example, or the Eroica Symphony. I mean, you're entering into the realm

13:47.840 --> 13:54.480
of archetypes and symbols and that, so there may be a contemporary pretext for producing the work.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.480
It may refer on some level to a contemporary figure.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.960
Well, let me give you another example of something of the opposite tendency,

14:02.960 --> 14:07.280
but it's actually someone whose work I rather like. I don't know if you know his British playwright,

14:07.280 --> 14:08.400
James Graham. No.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.040
All right. Well, there's probably a reason why you don't know him and probably not many people

14:13.040 --> 14:18.560
outside of Britain know him. He's very obsessed with British politics, as am I,

14:19.680 --> 14:24.800
and he's written a whole load of plays which are dramatising particular events in British politics.

14:25.760 --> 14:32.560
He wrote a play called The House, which is set in the House of Commons during the 70s,

14:32.560 --> 14:37.920
and it's set in the whips office, the people who are whip up support for things, and it follows

14:37.920 --> 14:44.080
all the machinations that go on and how exactly they manipulate people to get their vote. At a

14:44.080 --> 14:50.720
particular time in British history where the Labour Party who were in power lost their majority

14:50.720 --> 14:56.240
in the House of Commons through losing various by-elections, and even before they lost it,

14:56.240 --> 15:03.760
it was down to one or two votes could mean whether they would lose or win some parliamentary votes.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.560
Now, he traces this, and if you're interested in that, which I am, it's absolutely fascinating,

15:10.560 --> 15:16.720
and he wrote a screenplay about how the Brexit campaign was managed by Dominic Cummings,

15:16.720 --> 15:25.120
who was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in that. I say I enjoy his things, I'll always go and watch

15:25.920 --> 15:33.120
the new ones, but I can see if you don't have that very specialised interest, I'm not sure how much

15:33.120 --> 15:37.520
else would come out. I suppose something about the way the business of politics works in general,

15:38.480 --> 15:43.600
for which parallels could be found in other contexts as well, but I think it goes quite

15:44.400 --> 15:49.920
on those things, and so I'd say I like seeing them, but they're not particularly

15:49.920 --> 15:58.080
places I'd want to see many times, or that I imagine will have any sort of long lasting sort

15:58.080 --> 16:06.000
of impact. So I suppose that's what I'm thinking of. The other objections that I'm saying about

16:06.000 --> 16:14.240
political art, I think are possibly more vivid in their own way. So I have problems, even with

16:14.240 --> 16:20.720
the work like Luigi Nono's D'Gorda Cosi di Hanno Fatou in Auschwitz, which was written as originally

16:20.720 --> 16:28.560
as incidental music for Peter Weiss's play Die Ermittlung, the investigation, which was essentially

16:28.560 --> 16:34.640
a reconstruction of parts of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. And in his programme note for the work,

16:34.720 --> 16:42.480
Nono himself says that what the transcripts of the trials can't represent is

16:43.840 --> 16:50.000
the voice of the Six Million Dead, and that's what he wants to do in his music. Now I think,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.680
first of all, that's incredibly presumptuous, and I don't think any artist should claim to be

16:56.240 --> 17:05.120
doing that. But beyond that, it's a strangely very beautiful piece. It's a very haunting piece.

17:06.720 --> 17:12.720
It's a piece, dare I say, to enjoy. And when you can see where I'm leading from that,

17:13.840 --> 17:20.880
it's turning genocide into an aesthetic spectacle. So if Adorno said, at one point,

17:20.880 --> 17:25.120
I know he retracted this later, he said there could be no lyric poetry after Auschwitz.

17:25.200 --> 17:31.360
Well, this is making lyric poetry out of Auschwitz, which is moving on to a whole different level.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.600
And I just don't think it's an appropriate response.

17:35.600 --> 17:40.160
It's funny, I had a similar reaction to a much more recent piece, which is

17:40.160 --> 17:45.680
The Opera Innocence by Caio Sarriaho, which is an opera dealing with school shootings.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.000
Oh yes, I haven't seen it.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.640
Right. Well, it documents the story of a school shooting in quite

17:53.600 --> 17:59.440
quite horrendous detail and presents this as an aesthetic object, I suppose. And

18:00.880 --> 18:06.640
that made me intensely uncomfortable. And you could argue, well, that's perhaps the

18:06.640 --> 18:12.400
point is to put that in your face and present the reality of it in a context where one might

18:12.400 --> 18:19.520
not be expecting such a thing. But it seemed to me at the time, and this is acknowledging

18:19.600 --> 18:23.360
the greatness of the work. I think it is her best opera. I think it's a very fine work.

18:23.360 --> 18:30.160
The musical substance of it is outstanding. But nevertheless, it raised a question in my mind,

18:30.160 --> 18:34.640
is this actually appropriate? Is this something that one can address in an opera?

18:36.000 --> 18:41.040
Well, I'm interested to know more about the types of musical means she used and

18:41.840 --> 18:46.720
what you think made it particularly a set as size there. But I suppose the question I would

18:46.720 --> 18:53.040
always ask there is, why is this an opera? Why is it not a film? Why is it not a play?

18:53.040 --> 19:00.800
Why is it not a documentary even? I remember someone talking about a projected piece

19:02.160 --> 19:09.280
that would deal with the phenomenon of punch and duty shows here and what that meant in terms of

19:09.280 --> 19:15.760
domestic violence at the time. You know, very relevant concern, absolutely. But I was, I never

19:15.760 --> 19:21.680
really got around to asking them, why is this piece of music there? And why are you using a

19:21.680 --> 19:30.080
particular artistic medium? And it's something I wonder about a lot of work I see nowadays,

19:30.080 --> 19:38.560
where I think the nominal subject matter seems to have an importance way over and above what

19:38.560 --> 19:45.040
the musical content is. And somehow it's seen by some as to render questions of the musical value

19:45.040 --> 19:51.200
almost irrelevant. But in the end, if it is a work of music, I want to know why

19:51.200 --> 20:03.360
music's being used for this. I mean, supposing I want to get off a sort of Nazi example,

20:03.360 --> 20:10.800
because those are so full of problems. But I could imagine someone setting a gulag chorus or

20:10.800 --> 20:17.200
something in opera, and I could imagine this being absolutely dreadful, if it was done a certain way.

20:17.200 --> 20:24.800
It could make light of the gulag experience so much. And you know, I can think of other things,

20:24.800 --> 20:32.400
even in opera, I like very much Billy Bird of Britain, but I know how brutalising the conditions

20:32.400 --> 20:37.040
were in the Royal Navy at that time. Now, I mean, some of that comes across certainly

20:37.040 --> 20:43.120
through the flogging scene and things like that. But when you see them singing their sea shanties

20:44.080 --> 20:51.520
at night, there's a sort of sense that they've found some reasonably happy reconciliation

20:51.520 --> 20:58.880
to their lot. That might have been a necessity, for sure. But somehow it just seems all a bit too

20:58.880 --> 21:04.800
warm at that point. I mean, I'm probably being a bit harsh on that, because that opera certainly

21:04.800 --> 21:12.000
does deal in some senses with other aspects. But yes, I'm back again to the question of why

21:13.360 --> 21:18.480
use music, particularly why I have something sung rather than spoken, or why even fictionalise

21:18.480 --> 21:25.120
something in some cases. Now, I can certainly see arguments for doing so in even including

21:25.120 --> 21:30.240
things which are dealing with greater atrocities. Sometimes a fiction can reveal a reality that

21:30.240 --> 21:38.480
a documentary approach might not. But I think these questions can easily be treated rather too

21:38.480 --> 21:46.320
lightly. We've come off with a bit of a tangent, and I feel like I need to return to some thread,

21:46.320 --> 21:51.600
but I've forgotten exactly where we were. You were talking about Sarajah's opera,

21:52.560 --> 21:59.600
which I really want to see, and I haven't seen now. And I was thinking of other examples,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.920
well, there's a piece I wrote for the conversation a few years ago, where I looked a bit critically

22:05.920 --> 22:11.920
at the Nanna work, and also at Penderecki's Threnadie, which, as we know, was given its title

22:11.920 --> 22:18.320
about Hiroshima after it was composed. The very fact of that makes me a bit skeptical,

22:18.880 --> 22:26.800
where this is sort of appropriating a traumatic event to artificially sort of

22:27.360 --> 22:31.280
paced on some relevance to our work. Opportunistically also, yes, yeah.

22:31.280 --> 22:36.000
But as comparing with actually a more musically conservative work in some senses,

22:36.000 --> 22:42.640
but I do think it's remarkable being Shostakovich's 13th Symphony after poems by Yev Deschenko

22:42.640 --> 22:46.880
to do in part with the Babiyar massacre, there is actually a range of poems, they deal with

22:46.880 --> 22:56.720
several subjects. But that simply doesn't become is a type of atrocity pornography

22:57.600 --> 23:02.560
and I think it's remarkable for that, Shostakovich resists that temptation

23:04.080 --> 23:10.560
to write some sort of, some sort of Lamentosa work, which will never be sufficient for the scale

23:10.560 --> 23:16.640
of what's being represented. So no, I think it's a piece that actually invites a form of active

23:16.640 --> 23:22.720
rational engagement with what it's doing, rather than using it as for some sort of emotional

23:22.720 --> 23:31.120
catharsis. And maybe that's the thing, I think using, using traumatic events for that purpose,

23:31.120 --> 23:37.840
I think is in questionable taste at the very limit. And I've, you know, I've written a bit

23:38.560 --> 23:46.880
recently about endless pieces we get about climate change. It's very fashionable to write

23:46.880 --> 23:52.320
a piece about climate change. Now, if I'm going to look critically at this, don't think for a moment

23:52.320 --> 23:58.400
this means I'm trying to sort of, in a sense, minimize the importance of climate change as an

23:58.400 --> 24:04.560
issue, I think it's absolutely urgent and the consequences are incredibly serious in so many

24:04.560 --> 24:12.640
respects. But I just wonder what people are doing by writing a piece of music about it,

24:12.640 --> 24:18.720
which will probably get heard by a small community of listeners in the new music world,

24:18.720 --> 24:23.120
few of who will need convincing that climate change is a bad thing,

24:24.960 --> 24:29.200
whether it's really, whether these things are really adding to our understanding

24:29.200 --> 24:31.280
any more so than could be done by other means.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.920
Well, I suspect it's a form of in-group affirmation,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.440
ultimately. And there's a lot of that in the new music community.

24:40.240 --> 24:45.840
Sure. And that's not new. I mean, some of the political references even in Mozart operas may

24:45.840 --> 24:53.200
have actually taken the same form that when he was writing Don Giovanni's singing Viva la LibertÃ ,

24:54.160 --> 25:00.560
he wasn't particularly saying something to his audiences as to some of his patrons to show that

25:00.560 --> 25:07.120
he was in support of a particular political direction there. So in a sense, that was a type

25:07.120 --> 25:14.240
of virtue signalling to an in-crowd as well. But I think, I mean, I don't, it would be too harsh

25:14.240 --> 25:22.720
just to condemn such things out of hand. I suppose I'm bothered when I think these become the primary

25:22.720 --> 25:29.280
focus of attention. And the rest of the music doesn't seem to count for very much. And I see this

25:30.400 --> 25:38.880
certainly in academic contexts with music, where ultimately, there are many composers

25:38.880 --> 25:45.520
employed by universities who are often writing in and in some sort of what I might say post-Avancard

25:45.520 --> 25:51.600
idiom for now, which draws upon some of the techniques and styles and genres that were

25:51.600 --> 25:57.760
associated with the avant-garde at its peak, rather necessarily developing wholly new ones.

25:59.360 --> 26:08.160
But in a language which will ultimately be esoteric to many academic managers,

26:08.160 --> 26:14.240
to many research funding bodies, to many of the other people that they have to please in order

26:14.240 --> 26:22.160
to secure a solid future within academia. And so if they can link their piece to other things,

26:22.160 --> 26:28.480
which are not in themselves, anything necessary to do with music, this is a good career strategy.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.400
If that sounds a bit of cynical views, because it is.

26:33.360 --> 26:38.480
Those two things are not necessarily mutually exclusive. You can have an optimized career

26:38.480 --> 26:45.760
strategy and also be a great artist. And in fact, I think the great artist who is hopelessly unable

26:47.440 --> 26:53.680
to communicate with anybody who is socially inept and who can't make a strong case for their work

26:53.680 --> 26:56.240
is going to be at a significant disadvantage, I would imagine.

26:56.880 --> 27:04.080
Yeah, no, I do agree with that. But I think it's possible to make a case for work in

27:05.360 --> 27:13.920
other terms. But I recognize that's hard for those working in particular, as I say, post-Avancard

27:14.640 --> 27:23.040
idioms. And that might actually say something reluctant, though I am, to go down this road about

27:24.000 --> 27:29.920
whether it's ever possible that those idioms in themselves can have any wider communicative

27:29.920 --> 27:35.120
potential. Well, communicative is probably not the best word. The whole series of communications

27:35.120 --> 27:42.320
have their own sorts of qualities, which are not necessarily the best, the most applicable

27:42.320 --> 27:51.040
to music. Maybe I like using the word, though it's become a bit of a cliche, resonance, or whether

27:51.040 --> 27:57.040
the music resonates and it's got a literal musical dimension to it. As I say, it's just

27:57.040 --> 28:01.920
become a little bit overused to become hackneyed. But I think it's possible that music can resonate

28:01.920 --> 28:08.480
rather than, in some sense, conveying a meaning. Or it can be meaningful without having a meaning.

28:08.480 --> 28:16.400
It doesn't have an object in the same way as, say, figurative art does, or a lot of uses of language

28:16.720 --> 28:24.640
can. Well, it's certainly possible for esoteric aesthetic directions to communicate to a very

28:24.640 --> 28:29.920
large number of people. That's happened on many occasions. The classic example is possibly the

28:29.920 --> 28:35.680
Right of Spring, which is enormously popular work and has an immediate power of seduction

28:35.680 --> 28:43.520
and expression that is self-evident. As for where that may stand in the present day, I'm

28:44.080 --> 28:51.280
considerably less convinced about composers able to take what might be by contemporary standards

28:53.120 --> 28:59.840
might be, let's say, esoteric or aesthetics that notably diverge from

29:00.880 --> 29:05.120
the bulk of musical practices in the composition world and manage to find a large

29:05.120 --> 29:08.720
audience doing that. I don't know. I think that that would be extraordinarily difficult.

29:08.720 --> 29:14.000
I haven't seen too many examples of that, certainly. And if I were to survey the composition

29:14.000 --> 29:18.560
landscape of the past 30 or 40 years, what are the individual works that have had anything like

29:19.840 --> 29:26.080
even an iota of significance in comparison with the work Like the Right of Spring?

29:26.080 --> 29:30.880
Now, you could argue that's something that reveals itself over time, that we need decades,

29:30.880 --> 29:37.040
perhaps half a century or more before the work reveals itself in its full dimensions.

29:37.520 --> 29:44.960
But I don't think that's necessarily the case. There are certainly works that find a broad audience

29:44.960 --> 29:51.840
and create a significant impact very shortly after their premiere. It just doesn't seem to be

29:51.840 --> 29:58.960
happening. And this is something that emerged as a kind of light motif in the discussions I had with

30:00.160 --> 30:05.360
intellectuals, public figures, people from the business world who attended the art conference

30:05.360 --> 30:09.760
in London back in October. Now, I had the opportunity to exchange with quite a number

30:09.760 --> 30:14.640
of people at that event, including prominent intellectuals from all sides of the political

30:14.640 --> 30:22.640
spectrum. And one recurring motif was the question, what are the artists doing? Where are they? Where

30:22.640 --> 30:27.200
have they gone? Where are the great figures of today? We mentioned T.S. Eliot and Stravinsky as

30:27.200 --> 30:34.080
two sort of emblematic examples, but is there anybody today who can claim to have anything

30:34.080 --> 30:43.440
like that measure of public notoriety, significance, critical attention? I'm quite doubtful about that.

30:44.320 --> 30:50.000
At least maybe not in the high cultural field, in popular cultural fields and possibly.

30:50.960 --> 30:57.600
I'm not sure right now, but at least in the last 50 years, I can think of figures there.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.840
You know, I can think of various popular musicians, I can think of jazz musicians,

31:01.840 --> 31:07.360
late jazz musicians, because I sort of think jazz morphed into other things around about

31:07.360 --> 31:18.400
the time of the 1970s onwards. Well, that's sort of what I call the one last push theory,

31:19.120 --> 31:24.640
that if we wait a bit of time and we push things like new music just a bit more,

31:24.640 --> 31:29.040
eventually, audiences will come around. Right. No, this is... I mean, I don't believe that.

31:29.040 --> 31:34.080
I don't believe that for a second. The idea, and this has been floated since at least the 1950s,

31:34.080 --> 31:38.400
if not longer, is that, well, it's because audiences aren't familiar enough with it,

31:38.400 --> 31:42.640
so if you can educate them, if you can explain to them what's going on in the work,

31:42.640 --> 31:45.600
then they'll come around to it. The problem is that they don't have the context,

31:45.600 --> 31:49.200
they don't understand what artists are doing, so you need to be an advocate,

31:49.200 --> 31:52.560
you need to explain it to them, and so on. In my experience, that simply doesn't work.

31:52.880 --> 32:00.320
There are branches of new music that simply do not have the capacity, I believe, to communicate

32:00.320 --> 32:04.480
broadly to a large number of people, and it's to do with the work. It's not to do with

32:05.600 --> 32:11.200
deficiencies in the sensibility or the education or the experience of the people who are listening.

32:12.080 --> 32:18.560
Now, that's an attitude that you see quite commonly in modernist composers such as

32:18.560 --> 32:24.000
Eliot Carter, who is constantly saying things along the lines that, well, the music is difficult,

32:24.000 --> 32:28.880
but people will just have to become more clever, and, well, where does that lead you?

32:29.920 --> 32:37.280
Well, can I take a sort of middle ground position on this? I go home after I've been working hard

32:38.000 --> 32:50.080
someday, and I don't always want to read some Goethe. I don't always want to be

32:50.880 --> 33:00.320
watching some classic Japanese cinema. I don't always want to be listening to some late Brahms.

33:01.040 --> 33:08.160
These are all things I like very much indeed, but, yes, I sometimes want something a bit lighter

33:08.160 --> 33:13.680
that's not unintelligent, but is entertaining and gives me a chance to relax a bit, and I

33:14.480 --> 33:20.000
never criticize anyone else for wanting to do the same. I would worry a lot if that's all

33:20.000 --> 33:29.120
there was in culture, and I think that's a very real worry to have, but I started asking myself

33:30.400 --> 33:37.200
a while ago, maybe at least 10 years ago, maybe even more, of a lot of the types of

33:37.200 --> 33:42.480
avant-garde music that I've played, how often do I choose to actually listen to them myself?

33:43.840 --> 33:50.400
And I mean, I certainly do, but not as often as one might think. I mean, when it's just listening,

33:50.400 --> 33:54.000
because I'm interested, rather than listening because I need to learn more about something,

33:54.000 --> 33:59.040
because I'm writing about it, or I'm listening to recordings in the process of preparing

33:59.120 --> 34:06.000
interpretation or something like that, but just listening, for pleasure doesn't seem quite the

34:06.000 --> 34:11.840
right way to put it, but listening for my own edification, I suppose, I've thought it's not

34:11.840 --> 34:17.920
actually all that often. And then I ask myself, similarly, how often do I listen to early music?

34:18.720 --> 34:24.000
Same here, or how often would I listen to even something like the Matas Passion?

34:24.880 --> 34:31.440
And they're for special occasions. I mean, there are times when I've got time,

34:31.440 --> 34:34.880
and I've got a clear head, and I really want to concentrate, and I really want something

34:35.520 --> 34:42.800
that goes as deep as those things are. And if you know, as someone who's quite intensely

34:42.800 --> 34:50.400
involved with these things as part of their work, if it's not so often that I get the chance to do

34:50.400 --> 34:58.240
that, then what's the chance for those working in other fields? Who don't have that? But from that,

34:58.240 --> 35:05.280
I still don't think that necessarily has to be a problem. I think there can be many forms of art,

35:06.400 --> 35:11.840
which are, let's go back to the first question, which are great, which are demanding,

35:13.440 --> 35:18.640
and which are not probably for casual or recreational viewing, listening, reading,

35:18.640 --> 35:26.000
or whatever. But I don't think that in any sense minimizes their significance or their importance.

35:28.160 --> 35:33.200
Well, if I could just continue one thing on that, because I want to look,

35:33.200 --> 35:39.360
I mean, the Eliot Carter example is interesting there. In a sense, I can see that I can view

35:39.360 --> 35:43.920
Carter's work, which I like very much, and I've played most of his piano music,

35:44.560 --> 35:48.320
is an extension of that. And Carter's work,

35:52.160 --> 35:59.600
if I say there's, in one small sense, it's slightly conservative. I don't mean that in any sort of

35:59.600 --> 36:04.800
denigratory fashion. I mean, in a sense, it's music that situates itself in a particular

36:04.800 --> 36:14.880
relationship to traditions, which I think is quite clear. It's not radically iconoclastic work,

36:14.880 --> 36:22.080
never has been, not in the way that certainly things like Cage or Schnabel or Globacar might be,

36:22.080 --> 36:27.920
not things that are really sort of trying to make you redefine the whole question of what music is.

36:27.920 --> 36:38.640
Carter's work uses an expressive language, which has a clear lineage behind it. He uses forms,

36:38.640 --> 36:47.360
which are certainly informed by his own particular means, not least on a metrical level, but on the

36:47.360 --> 36:54.160
other hand, they still somehow relate to established forms in things. And so that

36:54.160 --> 37:00.320
gives the point of reference. That gives, for those familiar with that tradition,

37:00.320 --> 37:05.680
you can hear it relative, listen to it relative to that tradition if you're familiar with that.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.920
And what that would mean to someone not familiar with that tradition is not necessarily so

37:11.120 --> 37:20.800
clear. But, and this is the question, like I think so many involved in new music, I've evaded

37:20.800 --> 37:29.120
for a long time, but I can't really get away from is simply about atonality. Now, if I define

37:29.120 --> 37:38.240
atonality as, or atonal music is music which is not organized around single tonal centers for any

37:38.240 --> 37:45.840
appreciable amount of time. I mean, I don't think there's almost any fully atonal music,

37:45.840 --> 37:50.560
music where you can't hear some localized tonal centers at various points, but they're so

37:50.560 --> 37:58.800
diffuse and so changing in atonal music as to essentially issue that sort of sense of

37:58.800 --> 38:03.440
some gravitational force such as a more long range tonal organization provides.

38:06.400 --> 38:14.960
Atonal music is disorienting. It is alienating, I think, to an awful lot of people. I mean,

38:14.960 --> 38:21.520
every bit of evidence points to that the lack of much of an atonal tradition in almost any other

38:21.520 --> 38:26.400
world culture. Perhaps you could find some, something akin in, say, gagaku music or so on,

38:27.200 --> 38:31.920
but it's not really comparable. I wonder about this. This is a question that I ask myself quite

38:31.920 --> 38:36.960
often as well. Now, I don't think I'm being self-deluding about this because obviously I write

38:36.960 --> 38:42.000
completely chromatic music and indeed sometimes infracromatic music with microtones and so on.

38:42.240 --> 38:47.600
My sense is, having worked with a lot of students and having exchanged with a very broad range of

38:47.600 --> 38:52.240
audience members through my public lecturing and through the work I've done as a composer as well,

38:52.240 --> 38:58.400
my sense is that the organization of the tones is not really at the forefront of most people's

38:58.400 --> 39:02.720
concerns when they're listening to things and finding them perhaps too esoteric or too difficult

39:02.720 --> 39:09.360
to handle. I think the absence of identifiable patterns in music is extremely challenging for

39:10.320 --> 39:15.440
audiences, but that can come through any means, actually. It's not simply a matter of the

39:15.440 --> 39:20.480
organization of tones. I think it may have to do somewhat with rhythm. I think that the

39:21.600 --> 39:28.320
tendency of the second Viennese school composers, for example, and certainly the generation that

39:28.320 --> 39:36.800
came after that, to work with rhythmic patterns that do not relate in any obvious manner to

39:37.760 --> 39:42.960
a meter, to a pattern, I think that that's more destabilizing than any degree of

39:45.920 --> 39:53.920
atonality in the music. There are so many examples of ostensibly tonal music that is so far into

39:53.920 --> 39:58.720
the margins of what constitutes any kind of functionality that it's difficult to make a

39:58.720 --> 40:05.360
case for the piece being in this or that key. For example, you can cite certain passages in

40:05.360 --> 40:10.400
Wagner, you can cite Hugo Woeuf, certainly, where it's extraordinarily difficult to determine

40:10.400 --> 40:15.520
if many of those songs are, in fact, in a key at all. You can cite Debussy, you can look at

40:16.720 --> 40:22.160
certain works by Hindemith, you can look at things like the Bagatelle SantonalitÃ© of Liszt.

40:24.240 --> 40:29.520
Those works don't seem to disturb anybody. Well, the Bagatelle SantonalitÃ©, I'd say, is in B minor.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.240
Okay. Well, that settles it.

40:34.400 --> 40:40.880
I think it's simply a piece that lacks a clear tonic in root position,

40:41.600 --> 40:47.280
rather than lacks a tonal center. There's a very, very clear tonal organization in that.

40:48.160 --> 40:54.000
It's nothing like the cutter drift in the way that Schoenberg from Op. 11 onwards is.

40:54.960 --> 41:00.000
And when you're talking about recognizable patterns, well, what about in Schoenberg's

41:00.000 --> 41:05.840
Suite Op. 25, or the Third String Quartet, or the Variations for Orchestra, do these not use a quite

41:07.200 --> 41:11.440
readily recognizable rhythmic vocabulary and gestural vocabulary as well?

41:11.920 --> 41:16.960
Which I thought, I mean, I've seen some fascinating talks about these works, which

41:17.760 --> 41:23.360
actually push the pitch organization to one side and look at them more primarily in gestural terms.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.880
And actually how subtle the gestural and rhythmic working is in them.

41:28.880 --> 41:37.120
And which, you know, which I find fascinating. It's a lot more than about what makes these,

41:37.120 --> 41:41.280
to my mind, quite remarkable pieces than just saying how the rose manipulated.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.880
But sorry, it's a little tangent here, but you might find it's quite interesting here that

41:46.160 --> 41:51.680
I was just in a conference at Dublin last week, and I was sort of supporting a postgraduate student

41:51.680 --> 41:58.720
who was giving a paper, which I had some input into. We're looking at the role of music theory

41:58.720 --> 42:05.120
analysis comparatively in Scottish and Irish educational systems and how this relates to

42:05.120 --> 42:11.520
secondary provision and so on. And one thing she found from talking to teachers in Scotland is they

42:11.520 --> 42:18.960
said, serialism is a gift for teaching, because it's not difficult for students to learn how to

42:18.960 --> 42:25.120
just invert and retrograde the row, and then just combine that and they create something in the process.

42:26.160 --> 42:30.720
Yeah, whether there's something you'd ever want to listen to is another question. But

42:31.760 --> 42:36.960
I mean, this to me portrays such a narrow understanding of what serial music is, and

42:36.960 --> 42:41.520
certainly what the serial music of Schoenberg or Berg or Webern is, that there are so many other

42:41.520 --> 42:48.480
aspects which are defining to what makes it so distinctive. It's not just about the row

42:48.560 --> 42:54.400
manipulation. And as we know, Schoenberg reacted quite negatively to Rudolf Kirlisch,

42:55.120 --> 42:58.640
coming back and saying, I've worked out this is how the row works in the third string quartet.

43:00.240 --> 43:06.400
So I suppose I'm saying from this that I'm not sure that those other factors that you think

43:06.400 --> 43:11.280
are probably more important for listeners than pitch organisation. I'm not sure if those things

43:11.840 --> 43:18.080
aren't present in a lot of these works, which nonetheless, have never gone on to have the

43:18.080 --> 43:26.720
same sustained and wide listenership that works of Stravinsky or Bartok or Prokofiev have. And

43:29.200 --> 43:35.840
I don't in any sense want to sort of suggest that those latter group composers are any less

43:35.920 --> 43:40.960
modern. In fact, in some sense is more so than the second Viennese school.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.760
And you could trace a different sort of history through the 20th century, which

43:48.880 --> 43:56.000
is certainly focused on lots of very innovative developments. I mean,

43:56.000 --> 44:03.440
was obviously with Debussy, as you mentioned, but which I don't believe ultimately give up on

44:03.440 --> 44:08.960
some form of tonal organisation. I don't believe Debussy does. We were saying about Wagner, Hugo

44:08.960 --> 44:15.840
Volf. I think for momentary periods, they go off directions, but I think it's still ultimately clear.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.640
I think even in Charles Ives, that's the case as well.

44:18.640 --> 44:23.120
Well, the harmony is fundamentally triadic in nature most of the time,

44:24.000 --> 44:29.520
even though it may not be obvious how the modulatory scheme works and how it might all

44:29.520 --> 44:36.560
relate to essential tonality. But something along those lines, having an extended tonality

44:36.560 --> 44:42.800
that is fundamentally centred around triads is probably, that might be the marker. But then

44:42.800 --> 44:47.120
again, it's very complicated. It's terribly difficult to parse it all out because a lot of

44:47.120 --> 44:51.120
the harmony in Opus 11 is triadic, if you look at the chords.

44:51.840 --> 45:01.680
But modified triads with added notes that sort of preclude them from fulfilling the

45:01.680 --> 45:06.720
usual triadic functions. Yes, but Scriabin, it's tricky, it's tricky.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.320
Yes, but it's more directional in Scriabin, I think.

45:11.360 --> 45:16.080
Depends. Some of those pieces are quite static in their harmonic effect, I would argue.

45:16.960 --> 45:20.240
I think of the opening of the eight sonata, for example.

45:22.880 --> 45:29.280
That's just a modified cadence in A, I think, for all the high amount of chromaticism.

45:30.160 --> 45:35.120
It's still got these basic cadential function working underneath it.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.120
Look at the beginning of the tenth sonata. It starts with essentially

45:41.600 --> 45:51.600
outlining an augmented triad on G-flat, and then that moves down to an E-flat minor triad.

45:54.400 --> 46:01.760
That to me is just a certain type of cadence from the third to the first degree of the scale,

46:02.720 --> 46:10.320
as in terms of the bass line, that it's not...

46:12.800 --> 46:20.080
Now, but then if I say look at one of the most tonal of Schoenberg's early A tonal works being

46:20.080 --> 46:31.360
the Opus 11 number two. So, for any listening to this who don't know this piece, it starts with an

46:31.440 --> 46:37.840
oscillating F and D in the bass and a lower F, an octave below the higher one,

46:39.040 --> 46:46.480
which could very simply imply a D minor harmony. But then when the melody comes above that,

46:46.480 --> 46:56.160
it's quite... It goes from D-flat to A, and then down a tri-tone to E-flat, and up a fourth to A-flat,

46:56.160 --> 47:02.880
and then back down a tri-tone to D. But inevitably that D naturalism here

47:02.880 --> 47:08.000
sounds to me like a resolution. And when I'm hearing the other chromatic notes,

47:08.000 --> 47:12.240
they're just implying a resolution that's going to come. Now Schoenberg does this,

47:12.240 --> 47:15.040
but sometimes he holds back or doesn't even resolve, but...

47:15.040 --> 47:20.240
No, clearly. Well, I would argue that that principle is operative to a greater or lesser

47:20.240 --> 47:25.440
degree in a lot of the works, where the E-flat sounds like a flat supertonic more or less.

47:25.440 --> 47:30.160
It's the same in the slow movement of the fourth quartet to a degree. It seems to have,

47:30.160 --> 47:36.240
which coincidentally also sounds like it's in D minor. So it's a question of degree,

47:36.240 --> 47:41.200
but I'm not convinced by the idea that that is the level on which these works are fundamentally

47:41.200 --> 47:47.200
challenging for audiences. It may have to do with the rate of change, with the constant

47:47.200 --> 47:52.800
onslaught of new chromatic pitches, the harmonic rhythm. The harmonic rhythm in the

47:52.800 --> 47:56.800
right of spring is drastically slowed down in comparison.

47:58.240 --> 48:03.920
And we know Schoenberg didn't like repetition, and this might be a key thing here.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.720
Yes, there's a sort of information overload.

48:08.720 --> 48:13.840
Well, if you take a work like De Stade by Andreessen, you have rhythmic patterns that are

48:13.840 --> 48:19.520
obvious and easy to hear. You have tonal patterns that are obvious and easy to hear. The harmonic

48:19.520 --> 48:26.400
rhythm is extremely slow. You have gestures and contrasts that form very clear and simple

48:26.400 --> 48:30.720
formal markers in the piece. It's hypnotic, it's repetitive, and so on.

48:33.120 --> 48:37.760
It's not obvious to me that De Stade is a more popular work than the fourth string quartet

48:37.760 --> 48:43.760
of Schoenberg. Maybe it is, but I don't know that that's the level on which... Do you see what I mean?

48:44.720 --> 48:54.640
It's tricky. I think we'd need some empirical data for this. We need to play some audiences,

48:55.360 --> 48:58.560
both the works, and then engage their responses to them.

49:01.200 --> 49:08.720
There might be some who are quite conservative listeners who think the Schoenberg sounds quite

49:09.200 --> 49:15.760
refined, and whereas I think the Andreessen's all a bit too noisy and riotous. That's very

49:15.760 --> 49:19.680
possible, but I think you could say the same about the Rite of Spring as well.

49:21.600 --> 49:27.200
Well, I tried an experiment with my students when I was teaching at the conservatory in Cambrai in

49:27.200 --> 49:31.600
northern France, and I had some younger students in that class. We were doing a course on musical

49:31.600 --> 49:38.320
analysis, and the idea was to alternate 20th century works with more established classical

49:38.320 --> 49:43.520
works. We were looking at late romanticism. We were looking at things like Wagner and

49:43.520 --> 49:48.640
Mahler and so on, and then one week I brought in the five orchestral pieces by Schoenberg,

49:49.280 --> 49:55.280
and we listened to them. To the students, it wasn't immediately obvious that the

49:56.720 --> 50:02.320
tonal organization of that work was in some fundamental manner all that different from

50:03.040 --> 50:09.280
a more chromatic example, say, from Liszt or Wagner. Now, that kind of surprised me. I wasn't

50:09.280 --> 50:14.240
expecting that reaction, but it was in fact repeated multiple times, and if I asked them to

50:14.240 --> 50:20.080
say, well, which work is tonal and which work is non-tonal, it wasn't necessarily categorically

50:20.080 --> 50:29.040
obvious to them. How well versed in the standard repertoire would those students have been?

50:30.000 --> 50:34.240
Well, they were younger, so presumably their exposure to the repertoire would have been

50:34.240 --> 50:39.520
limited, I imagine. They would have probably been centering themselves around a small number of

50:39.520 --> 50:42.800
works that they were attempting to master on their instruments. I don't get the sense that they would

50:42.800 --> 50:48.080
go home and listen to ten symphonies a day. So not really immersed in the tradition?

50:48.080 --> 50:54.320
No. Because this presents an interesting sort of comparison to something that

50:54.640 --> 51:02.240
my friend, the musicologist, Eva-Marida Rodriguez, was telling me that she was teaching to some

51:02.240 --> 51:08.320
students some ideas coming from the new musicology out of the work from the 90s, particularly about

51:08.320 --> 51:14.800
queer musicology and how some works of Schubert and Tchaikovsky have been analyzed in terms of their

51:14.800 --> 51:21.280
particular harmonic patterns and their structural organizations as a quite alternative model of

51:21.360 --> 51:28.000
tonal organization to the dominant one coming from Beethoven and so on, which I think is actually

51:28.000 --> 51:33.680
quite a powerful explanation that whether this maps onto sexuality, I think, is open to question.

51:33.680 --> 51:38.000
But there's no doubt to me that Tchaikovsky's approach to writing a symphony was quite fundamentally

51:38.000 --> 51:44.960
different to Beethoven's. And at the very least, these paradigms have gone some way to explaining

51:44.960 --> 51:54.160
how that organization is considerably different, and particularly the substitution of more

51:54.160 --> 52:02.240
relationships between harmonic riches based upon thirds rather than fifths is quite a fundamental

52:02.240 --> 52:09.280
thing found there. And so it's as a way of bypassing some of the clear sort of dominant tonic

52:09.280 --> 52:14.960
opposition, which is still so fundamental in Beethoven, as you can see in those endless 5-1

52:14.960 --> 52:21.120
alternations at the end of some of the symphonies, for example. But apparently this was lost a lot

52:21.120 --> 52:27.840
of the students. They just said, oh, that all sounds like classical music. The differences

52:27.840 --> 52:33.120
between Beethoven and Tchaikovsky was probably something akin to the narcissism of small differences.

52:34.080 --> 52:41.600
It was a world that at most they saw from the perspective of an outsider.

52:43.680 --> 52:52.880
And maybe it's possible now if you take the Schoenberg 5 orchestral pieces that, you know,

52:52.880 --> 52:59.440
those are still composed using an orchestral idiom in terms of the use of the instruments

52:59.520 --> 53:05.040
that's now well established, has been much imitated or much drawn upon.

53:06.480 --> 53:13.600
And itself, you can quite clearly link to some of that that you find in Wagner, in Rekard Strauss,

53:13.600 --> 53:19.920
and in others. Let me show them by text in new directions, but it belongs within a tradition

53:20.880 --> 53:32.080
and other aspects of texture, of rhythm, of density. These things certainly overlap to a large

53:32.080 --> 53:38.080
degree with lots of other works in the tradition. And so I'm wondering if when the whole music is

53:39.360 --> 53:44.320
not something that's become second nature, when the tradition's not become second nature to students,

53:44.400 --> 53:51.840
whether the things that we see as crucial differences are not yet so apparent, but maybe

53:51.840 --> 53:57.440
with a greater degree of familiarity they would become. Absolutely. Well, there's a quote, you'll

53:57.440 --> 54:03.200
probably know who this poet is, which is, when the lights are dim, all cats would be gray. If you

54:03.200 --> 54:08.000
don't have enough illumination to see distinctions between things, then everything, of course,

54:08.000 --> 54:18.800
looks the same to you. But still, just the relative lack of differentiation, I'm not sure

54:18.800 --> 54:29.280
that's any signifier that this is going to generate amongst these sorts of less-tutored minds,

54:29.280 --> 54:36.000
a new sort of enthusiasm for Schoenberg, orchestral music. But I might be wrong on that.

54:38.960 --> 54:43.760
What I'm trying to say here, the latest article I read just very recently,

54:45.680 --> 54:53.200
which, okay, to put it in a nutshell, it's saying if you lose a classical tradition,

54:54.320 --> 54:58.480
you'll lose contemporary classical music as well, which I think is accurate.

54:59.040 --> 55:08.080
I think ultimately, the audiences for, well, I still like the term new music, which comes,

55:08.080 --> 55:12.080
which is something I date back to about 1918, the audiences for that,

55:16.240 --> 55:23.280
those who would pursue that music or a lot of it with real sort of sustained enthusiasm

55:23.840 --> 55:31.440
will come from those who are also used to grappling with the intricacies and the complexities

55:32.400 --> 55:39.600
of music in the Western classical tradition. Now, that's a quite unfashionable position to

55:39.600 --> 55:49.840
take nowadays, and it's far from uncommon to find amongst composers a view that, no, this music has

55:49.840 --> 55:54.480
to sort of get away from that tradition, and the new audiences are to be found amongst those

55:54.480 --> 56:00.560
who listen to more popular music or jazz or things like that. Twitch, I'd say,

56:00.560 --> 56:06.480
hey, I don't think I haven't yet seen much evidence of that process happening on any

56:06.480 --> 56:09.200
sustained level. There are odd cases for sure, but...

56:11.760 --> 56:18.240
I think what I'm trying to establish is that the differences for, let's say,

56:18.240 --> 56:25.680
a non-specialized audience between late list, for example, Wagner, Schoenberg, Bartok, Debussy

56:25.680 --> 56:31.600
are comparatively minor. They're not colossal differences in the sense that they might reveal

56:31.600 --> 56:39.600
themselves to a more well-versed or specialized listener. But so my argument is that that's

56:39.600 --> 56:45.200
fundamentally not where this breakdown seems to occur. I think that that happens in the post-war

56:45.200 --> 56:52.640
era, and I think it has possibly partly to do with stylistic matters, but not exclusively. I

56:52.640 --> 56:58.480
think it has to do with the way the music is being disseminated, with the way that the composers

56:58.480 --> 57:04.000
may be addressing their audience or not addressing it, their attitude towards the audience,

57:04.800 --> 57:11.840
and the progressive entrenchment of the compositional tradition into academia and into

57:11.840 --> 57:19.920
things that are extremely distant, in fact, from the want of a better term, from the quotidian

57:20.480 --> 57:27.360
concerns of everyday people. Schoenberg is certainly a radical figure within that tradition,

57:27.360 --> 57:33.440
but he's still within that tradition, very demonstratively so. There isn't really a break,

57:33.440 --> 57:38.640
there's an acceleration, there's an intensification, there's an increased degree of complexity, I

57:38.640 --> 57:43.600
suppose, but there isn't a categorical break, but I do think that occurs in the in the post-war

57:43.600 --> 57:51.360
era. Well, one explanation for this is the idea that essentially the Second Vanity School

57:51.360 --> 57:57.360
represent the end of a tradition, and possibly you could extend it a bit further, maybe Carter

57:57.360 --> 58:03.200
would belong with that, maybe Verninger would belong within that, but all sort of playing a type of

58:03.200 --> 58:13.120
end game. Music that strikes by seeing what's still possible to do out of what's been inherited

58:13.120 --> 58:19.520
from that tradition, rather than setting down blueprints for a whole new directions, which I

58:19.520 --> 58:30.240
think is what Stravinsky and Bartok and Prokofiev did. So the response of those who wanted to build

58:30.240 --> 58:40.160
upon the achievements of Second Vanity School was generally to strip it out from most of that sort

58:40.160 --> 58:47.280
of early 20th century Viennese expression that came with it, and all the other trappings of tradition

58:48.000 --> 58:51.520
that were there, which I think are absolutely defining to the music, in fact more defining

58:52.160 --> 58:56.560
than the serial organization, in the case of the Dodecophonic works, I mean.

58:57.120 --> 59:09.200
But in that, and yes, you're right, I mean, even in Stravinsky, and Debussy, and Prokofiev,

59:09.200 --> 59:14.160
and so on, I mean, this music didn't come from nowhere, this wasn't sort of ripped up and started

59:14.160 --> 59:20.640
again, you know, you can easily trace Stravinsky back to Remsky Korsakov, to Misorgsky, to Tchaikovsky,

59:21.600 --> 59:28.000
and some senses to Italian opera and some French music and so on. You can easily trace Prokofiev

59:28.000 --> 59:35.920
back to similar things. For those familiar with that sort of period in French music that's perhaps

59:35.920 --> 59:42.880
least well known in between the deaths of Berlioz and the first mature works of Debussy, so in the

59:42.880 --> 59:50.880
1870s and 1880s, the period right after the Franco-Pression War, when you see important works of

59:50.880 --> 59:57.520
FaurÃ©, of Chabret, of Messonni, and others, once you have a sort of degree of familiarity with

59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.880
that tradition, then it's not so difficult to see where Debussy comes from, combined with

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.960
influences from Russian music and from Wagner and elsewhere, that, I mean, for radical composers, they

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:20.400
moved music on by quite palpable degree, but it didn't come out of nowhere. But nor did Boulers,

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.720
nor did Schlockhausen, they didn't come out of nowhere. I mean, Boulers, at least in time,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:33.360
became quite explicit about this, how much he felt that what had been achieved by Debussy,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.040
by Bartok, by Strominski, by Schoenberg, by Berg, was there to build, by Varez as well,

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.400
was there to build on, whilst rejecting some aspects of it as well. And I've probably said to

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:54.560
you before how I'll never accept the Stundinal theory of new music after 1945. First of all,

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:00.560
because actually, in terms of what was being predominantly written and performed after 1945,

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.960
in no sense constituted a Stundinal.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.880
Could you lay out what that means for our listeners?

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:11.840
Sorry, Stundinal zero hour in Germany. It's a theory of history, which is treated with a lot

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.320
of skepticism by his Reuser period now. But it's the idea that essentially, Germany had been destroyed,

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.560
reduced to rubble, and everything had to start again from first principles. And that this would

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.200
happen in music and culture that the whole, the languages inherited from the past had been thoroughly

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:38.000
discredited by the associations with Nazism. And so something new that broke with these completely

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.240
had to be created in its place.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.880
Well, that doesn't account for a figure like Henson.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:51.520
No, it certainly doesn't, nor for at least up until the late 1950s, the figures that were

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:58.240
extremely dominant in German new music, who were people like, well, like Carl Orth for a start,

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:04.720
Wolfgang Fortner, like Werner Eck, like Boris Blacker, Hindemith very much. So yes,

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.160
even though he was out of the country, but he was being played a lot. And younger figures,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.360
including Hans Werner, Henson, and one that's now pretty much forgotten, but was very big,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.800
Gieselic Kleber, who was getting commissioned here and everywhere. And someone like Stockhausen,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:31.680
and the slightly younger figures such as Hans Otter, or such as Dieter Schnabel,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.080
just a couple of years younger than Stockhausen, these people were very much on the margins.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.360
And Otter found his way through writing music that was essentially like his teacher, Hindemith,

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.720
for a while before in the 60s, he moved into a more sort of

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:55.520
aleatory music and more radical idioms there. I mean, my point is the avant-garde was on the

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:03.200
margins throughout most of the early post-war period. It was through the influence of people

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.160
like Herbert Eimer, who had a very important position at clone radio, and was something

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.960
of an avant-garde himself that managed to push things so that by the time, not earlier than

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:24.000
the early 60s, some of the avant-garde was starting to move more into the mainstream there. But

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.160
I mean, that was to explain, I don't believe Stundernull, if there had been a Stundernull,

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.640
you would have had very few of those other tendencies.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.080
This meeting, zero hour?

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.520
Yes, zero hour. But that zero hour model, which informed quite a bit of the

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.720
historiography of new music, this is something I'm writing about at the moment,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:52.000
particularly the stuff published in the 70s and 80s, presented this as a new language had to be

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:00.480
built up from first principles, almost literally from elementary particles and integral serialism,

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:06.720
pointless music, seem a maps onto that sort of metaphor very well, because you can see individual

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:13.040
notes, which somehow removed from any of the previous functional relationships that they might

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.600
have had, form the particles of the new music, and then new types of macroscopic organization,

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.200
especially if you find something like Stockhausen's Gruppen, enable ways of developing a more

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.760
sophisticated language out of this.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:37.040
Well, I certainly agree that it's far too simplistic to ascribe the Second World War as

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.120
the moment in which everything fundamentally shifts permanently and that there's no recovering it.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.760
I think that's far too simplistic. Nevertheless, it clearly accelerated certain forces that were

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.000
perhaps already operative before that period. And you could perhaps say that we're at the,

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.960
perhaps the end of a very long historical process that's been playing out over 100,

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.280
150 years. But nevertheless, there is for me a categorical difference between where we are now

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:12.320
with the manner in which a composer may interface with their audience versus what was the case

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.120
in the time of Schoenberg. I think that it's a categorical difference. It's no longer a matter

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:23.360
of degree. If you go from one generation to the next, you can say, well, if you compare

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.560
the attitude of Schoenberg versus Les, for example, you can say, well, it's not a complete break.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:36.320
There are still some common features. But if you were to jump three generations or four generations

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.760
and then compare, then I think it would be increasingly difficult to see

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:47.600
any sense of affiliation, any sense of connection by that point. And I suppose my argument now is

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:55.680
that a figure like Schoenberg, although obviously his music is radical and it was in its time and

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:02.000
continues to be for many people in alienating language, nevertheless, his intention, his aim,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.360
which you can easily trace in the music, was not fundamentally different from the attitude of a

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.160
Beethoven who wants to address everybody fundamentally. The language in which he's doing so

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:19.120
may be rebarbative, it may be challenging. But I believe that's his fundamental aspiration.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.080
It's his hope that the work will eventually find its audience. It will eventually be

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:31.200
comprehensible and it will speak to humanity in the broadest sense. I simply don't believe that

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.440
for a lot of composers working today, that is their ambition. And I don't believe that they

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.880
believe that that's even something that one can aspire to today. Now, obviously, you could say

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.760
I'm making a bit of a paper tiger out of these figures. I'm not citing names, but as a general

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:55.120
phenomenon, my sense is that the expectations that artists have today in terms of what might be

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:03.120
possible to do are significantly lower. Yes, I think that's true. But I'm not completely sure

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.840
if I agree with you on how similar Schoenberg and Beethoven were in that respect. I mean,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:15.600
Schoenberg did still say if it's for all, then it's not art. I'm not sure on what basis the

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:23.200
evidence is that Schoenberg really was intending, or at least imagining, that he was going to write

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:30.640
a music that would speak to all people. I mean, it's often that thing that he apparently said

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:37.360
to Josef Rufa about I've come across a new technique that will sustain German music for another

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.120
hundred years. He probably didn't say that. No, but those two statements are in contradiction to

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:50.800
one another. You have to be careful with the proclamations of composers. It's not self-evident

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.200
that he actually believed that. When he would say, for example, if it's art, it's not for everybody,

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.200
and if it's for everybody, it's not for art. I don't know that he necessarily believed that.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.920
Maybe he did, but you have to look at the work and what the work is aiming to do.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.040
I'm not utterly convinced by that.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.720
Well, how about if I put it a slightly different way? I say Schoenberg was aiming to write music

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.920
whose greatness he thought would ultimately be realized by all, but that didn't mean

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.440
that all would want to listen to it. Right. Whereas I think Beethoven did imagine

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.960
probably most of those who thought it was great would want to listen to it as well.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.880
Even the late string quartets, the Grosse figure. Maybe not by that stage,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.480
but that's quite exceptional within his own output, even within his late output,

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.600
where Charles Rosenscher is very well, how to some extent he actually returns to some of the

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:55.360
more strict formal models from his earlier work in comparison to some of the late mid-period works,

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.960
where he's pushing the boundaries of form all the more. Even the Hammerklavier sonata,

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.600
the first movement, is in a quite strict traditional sonata form in many ways,

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.320
more so than some of the other sonatas that surround it.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.720
That's the sort of thing I'd link to a whole phenomenon within certain types of modernism

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.960
that were about expanding resources, but also reinscribing a certain sort of new formal discipline.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:31.760
As well. You can find that across the arts, especially in architecture,

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.040
and you find that there's a deep classicizing strain in most of the modern movement, I would say.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:46.800
They were in some ways reacting against late romantic excess, and the same is true,

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.400
I think, in a lot of music as well.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:03.680
This is where, you know, the model that, well, it's actually Richard Tereskin has developed it a

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.760
lot, though it draws upon lots of us before him, of his period of maximalism between around 1890

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:18.400
to around 1918 in music, where you see the most opulent extravagant works of Strauss,

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.400
of Schoenberg, of the earlier Ravel, and of lots of other figures,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.760
which contrast so strongly with this paring down and narrowing of resources. I mean,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.560
early Stravinsky would fall into that mode as well, but then when you hear works like the

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.840
architect of Stravinsky, you know, you're almost listening to a different composer. I mean, with

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.320
real familiarity, one could see the commonalities between the two things,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:54.240
but in terms of the idiom, in terms of the style, all of that ostentation has gone, and you can see

01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:02.560
this in, to a slight, not quite a screen degree, but in Ravel's work before and after around the sort

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:10.320
of mid-1910s, the sort of world of Gaspar, or of Daphnis, is such a different idiom from that,

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.120
you find it something like the violin sonata, or L'EnfantilÃ© sortilÃ¨che, though he returns to

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.160
a bit of it in the left-hand concerto. That's why I say it's not quite so extreme, the gap there,

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:26.320
but that's why I've always thought of 1918 as being the really crucial turning point. It's

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:37.280
reinscribing a cleaner and more objective, if you like, and more disciplined music to get away

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:44.320
from the excesses of expression, and that's, if you follow the debates amongst the sort of

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:52.400
German aestheticians of the left during the 20s, that's very clear, between between the advocates

01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:00.160
of expressionism of which Ernst Bloch, and to some extent Adorno, were probably the last true

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:06.800
advocates, and then all the much more common ideas around the Neuers-Achelic guide, and then later on

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:14.960
the new objectivity. And if anything, the new objectivity was maybe new in Germany,

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:22.480
wasn't so new in France, that's at least as far back as the early Sati you see, that sort of

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.120
break certainly was the Wagnerian model, and Debussy broke with the Wagnerian model as well,

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:33.200
but not as drastically as Sati did. I think once again, I think this is a progressive

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.160
tendency that you see that's been playing out for decades. We may be in the end stages of it,

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.880
I don't know, it's hard to have the requisite distance and objectivity to look at these things

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.800
properly, but all I can see is judging from the indications that I can observe from people who

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.040
are outside of the Neu music world. It certainly appears to be the case that as a cultural force,

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:05.280
as something that may in some manner contribute to shaping our culture, and you could certainly

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.720
argue that there's a kind of a trickle down effect where it doesn't reach the ears of most

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.960
people, but nevertheless it does eventually find its way down into something that would be more

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:24.480
accessible or popular in nature. But that as a cultural force, it's basically spent,

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.840
the game is over, nobody's listening except for interested parties, professional artists,

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.200
the people who attend festivals such as Dono Eshingen and Darmstadt, who tend to be music

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:41.360
professionals. But outside of that, there's no, to use your term, there's no wider resonance from

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:50.240
the vast majority of the production of Neu music. That is the indication I'm getting from people

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:56.640
outside of that. Now these are not Philistines, these are not uneducated people, they are in

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.440
many instances extraordinarily cultivated, well-versed in culture, extremely well-read,

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.880
very familiar with classical music. And this is what I'm hearing.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.680
Well, there are three things that come to mind in the context of all that you're saying there.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:27.360
The first is to ask whether the idea of a new music cultural sphere, which seems to sort of

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.800
communicate only within its own realms to groups of aficionados who go along to festivals,

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:39.840
a lot of them with professional involvement in that scene, to ask really how new that is.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:45.280
I mean, if you read a lot about the festivals, and there were many in the 1920s, but of which

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:51.840
probably the best known now is that in Dono Eshingen and later in Baden-Baden and Berlin,

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.680
I've read enough about the reception of the concerts there, and wider commentary about

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.240
festival culture to see many of the same sorts of sentiments being expressed then.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:13.360
A concern that new music was sort of painting itself into a corner was obsessed with certain

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.720
types of experiment over and above the challenges of writing something that might have some

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:25.600
wider currency. And, well, it's quite interesting if we look back at the programs from Dono Eshingen,

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:33.760
I mean, how many Psytopias are known nowadays, whatever happened to those sort of radio

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:42.320
compositions that people, including Hindemith wrote, or, I mean, actually many of the figures there,

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.840
I mean, who listens to Heinz Teesson or Ernst Tocke, except perhaps the geographical fugue

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.440
nowadays. Even a figure like Stefan Wolper is really very much a composer,

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.480
appreciated within a narrow circle, but not that much outside of there. But you did see

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.120
things like New Works of Bartok being played at these festivals as well, and those have made

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:14.080
their way into some sort of wider repertoire. So, I am in time going to be writing a new

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.600
history of musical modernism in the Weimar Republic, and it strikes me how little of the German

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.600
composers of that time are heard with any frequency nowadays. Hindemith's reputation is nothing like

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:33.200
it was when I was younger, let alone what it was in the 50s. Certainly the Second Vanity School are

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:40.000
played, but even even that's within, I mean, I think probably most musicians have encountered

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.480
some of their work, but it hasn't really etched you to wider currency. But that to one side,

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.760
Kurt Vile's work has definitely had a lasting impression. You don't often hear that advanced

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:56.240
Kronik nowadays. You don't hear Tach, you don't hear Ties, and you don't hear Max Butting.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:07.680
Any Phillips Janak, any number of other people who are really quite sort of prominent figures in

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:17.040
the 20s and 30s in Germany are now pretty much forgotten. But maybe that's quite

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.800
inevitable. I could think of any number of 19th century figures for whom the same could be

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.200
said. Maybe if just a few things come out of this festival circuit and go on to continue

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:33.680
to be listened to, that in itself is as much as we might reasonably hope for. So, it might be a bit

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:40.960
premature to say that what's being played in the new music infrastructure is a term I like to use

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.120
for it, the network of festivals, of concert series, of radio stations and programmes,

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.040
and some educational institutions and journals and things as well. What is known in that,

01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:00.160
to say that it has little wider currency, doesn't register outside of that, may not be so new, and

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.320
I think we shouldn't wholly rule out the possibility that might be a few things that do.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.520
That's the first point, but my other points might sort of slightly temper that.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:23.040
The second point I really think is important to bear in mind. When you compare music with

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:30.480
other cultural forms, with literature, with the visual arts, with film and television,

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:40.480
with dance as well, and theatre, I don't think in any of the others is quite as much of a chasm

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.680
between the popular and the high art form as exists in music.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.280
You can trace that back to Wagner, if not earlier.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.840
Yes, certainly, but I think it's become especially pronounced in the 20th century.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:03.520
That, I mean, what perhaps hasn't really existed on any sustained, 20 sustained degree

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:11.760
since figures like Britain and Shostakovich say is, or Kalamides Hartman would be another,

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.480
is a sustained tradition of music which somehow,

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.200
I don't want, I really don't want to use the term middle brow because I dislike it.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.840
I don't think that's a very fair term for those composers. I don't think those composers are any

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:33.920
less sort of serious or any less demanding than some of their more avant-garde counterpoints.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.600
But they are working comfortably from within a tradition without

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:48.400
engaging any sort of radically iconoclastic activity there. And as such, it's not such a leap

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.920
from an interest in that tradition to an interest in their work.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:20:00.080
Well, you might be able to cite figures such as John Adams, for example, Philip Glass perhaps,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.640
to a limited degree, George Benjamin, although I would situate him much more in the new music

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.360
realm than anything resembling what Benjamin Britton achieved.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.000
Which is, of course, not a commentary on the achievement of George Benjamin, but simply to

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.200
point out that he doesn't have that level of cultural penetration or of accessibility in his

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:29.440
work. But then you could say, well, the counterargument could say, well, yes, but a figure such as

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:36.880
Glass, for example, is not as compositionally accomplished. The music is not of as high quality

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:45.600
as a lot of the output of Britton. And it's tricky to find any kind of figure

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:52.160
who would be who would be comparable or analogous in any way whatsoever to someone like that,

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.320
I would argue. Well, Satie, perhaps.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.600
Satie? Why so?

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:08.960
Using very sort of limited and delimited compositional resources towards a particular end.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.320
I mean, in terms of what you're saying, Glass being less accomplished as a composer than

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.880
Britton. I'm not making that argument. I'm sorry.

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.240
It's a devil's advocate position.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.360
Yeah, because I'm not sure that would be easy to justify as an argument.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:31.120
I mean, we could say that a large amount of Morton Feldman's music is quiet,

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.960
so he showed he could write quiet music, but he wasn't so good at the mezzo-forte as a fortissimo.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.760
But that would be a really facile argument. I think because some composers have

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:46.640
stuck within limited realms doesn't make them any less accomplished than those who've done

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.040
broader things. I mean, I know Schrockhausen once criticized composer, and it's thought he

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.200
might have had people like Ligeti or Zanakis or Feldman in mind, who said, if you want to make

01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.200
a big name, do something like become the snare drum composer. That's in the Robin McConae book.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.880
So, okay, now I appreciate you saying that as a devil's advocate argument rather than

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:14.480
as your own one. And I think it is true to say that Glass and Adam's iteration,

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:20.880
others have achieved a genuine penetration to a wider public sphere in some ways,

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:30.400
perhaps more so than some more canonical figures. But that's a very particular direction,

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.160
and it's not one I want to denigrate by any means. I might have harsher things to say

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.600
about some of the propaganda surrounding it, whether coming from

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.960
composers or their advocates, and also about the historiography which I've written about,

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.360
which sort of posits that everything was going to pot in new music, and then these people came

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:57.120
along and saved their, saved its ass, as it were. And I dislike that sort of rhetoric,

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:04.480
even expressed in slightly less crude terms. But I think that work stands

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.080
quite outside of the classical tradition in many ways.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:18.560
Well, Feldman characterized it as showbiz. He was saying he doesn't take Filt Glass seriously,

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.800
because he's in showbiz. He's not a composer, which, you know, you don't have to take that

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.640
seriously as a remark, but... Well, some Kurt Wallin showbiz, very literally.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.840
And I'd say he's a very serious composer, and I don't just mean his early works, I mean,

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.920
all the way up to his American musicals.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:45.600
When I wrote my big two-part article on the historiography of minimal music, I posited that

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:53.920
there are three, because I don't think minimal music represents a drastic break.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.240
I think it does represent a break with a lot of Central European traditions,

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.960
but it has a clear lineage, and it's sort of one branch coming out of several roots.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.240
And those roots include Musica Sati, above all, the earlier music of Stravinsky,

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:15.120
especially of Lesacre and Lenos. And then, and this is the argument that comes out of

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:21.280
work of Wim Mertens, who wrote one of the early books on minimal music, that it actually comes

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:28.000
out of integral serialism, in a way, and the figure of Hoivetz, who bridges those two worlds,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.640
demonstrates that. Also, the fact that Lamont Young's early work can be seen like a sort of

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:41.840
expansion of Feldman onto a vast, expansion of Weber, onto a vast canvas as well.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:50.400
That relationship is more complex and difficult. But then, within the traditions bequeased by

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.520
those roots, I would include Feldman's music, or Christian Wolf's music on one hand. I would include,

01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:03.120
say, some of the work of Nicholas Ahuba, or Ernst Albrecht Stiebler, using very limited resources,

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.920
or some aspects of music spectral as well. All those different branches coming out of

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:17.520
a fundamental aesthetic of relative stasis, which rejects this particular dynamic and

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.600
dialectical approach to composition. Well, there's an interesting article, actually,

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.200
by Jonathan Harvey that deals with that topic. And his contention is that this is the inevitable

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:33.120
heritage of the Weberian project, which is of having a harmony that's completely unmoored

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.360
from any kind of a base function. Or rather, as he puts it, the base has moved up into the

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:41.680
middle register, but it's no longer determining the harmony. I think that was published in

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.840
contact. You probably have read that article. And that, in consequence, because of this absence of

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:53.760
gravity, so to speak, in the harmony, then it forces you, in a sense, to have a

01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:01.680
a significantly slowed down harmonic rhythm. And that leads to, or to a stasis of some kind,

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.680
effectively. The music no longer is oriented or grounded. And that leads you to things like

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.480
the Feldman pieces. But that's not the only example.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:18.400
I could trace that sort of unanchored music, if you like, that horizontally focused music

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:25.680
back to such things as the publications of books on linear counterpoint by Ernst Kurt in

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:35.520
1917. And the whole new lease of life that that sort of thought gave to a music that was

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:44.400
about line rather than about harmony as well. That's before some of Weber's major essays in

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:51.200
that sort of genre. But that's that sort of thinking, which is, on one hand, radical,

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.000
on the other hand, quite conservative, because it's really looking back to a time before the

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.680
19th century, before harmony comes to sort of take precedence over counterpoint and harmony

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.800
comes to be taught first towards an idea that counterpoint is at the root of things and harmony

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:14.240
is at most a byproduct of that. But it's using that to a radical end towards the construction

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.880
of music, which isn't sort of formed around some tonal principles, which you can still say

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.280
of relatively modal counterpoint, at least in the equal temperament era.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.120
Okay, you seem to be arguing in that the points that I've raised in terms of how

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.960
the present moment in terms of musical production seems to me to be fundamentally

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.360
different from the way it would have been 50 or 60 years ago. That's not even to go back

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.560
any farther than that. You seem to be arguing that for many of the points that I'm raising,

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.000
there are historical precedents for it, there is a degree of connectedness,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
there's nothing fundamentally exceptional about the present moment.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.800
No, I wouldn't quite say that. I think there are differences to the present moment that I was

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:07.840
coming on to when I mentioned about sort of the relationship to popular music, which is something

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:15.360
I would loosely trace back to the early 19th century. It's an urban music fundamentally

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.320
associated with the growth of larger cities and so on. And it takes forms of things such as Music Hall

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:29.280
or Cafe Conceal, Cabaret or Vorderville in the 19th century, then through traditions of ragtime,

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:37.360
blues and early jazz and so on. But it really comes together, I think I would say in the 40s,

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.880
rather than the mid 50s, mid 50s is commonly the date given for the beginning of rock and roll.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.760
But I would say it comes together with the beginning of Rhythm and Blues as a really

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.440
established genre in New Orleans at the beginning of the 40s, which is exactly the point that Fats

01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:00.560
Domino was very keen to point out to some interviewer who asked him in the mid 50s,

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.120
tell me about this new music called Rock and Roll Your Play. He says,

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.240
I call it Rhythm and Blues and I've been playing it in New Orleans since 1940.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.040
So I think it's around that time that something really comes together that forms a truly lasting

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:20.320
tradition which gains a very wide currency and even a global currency in time to come.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:31.760
And that's a huge thing for an art music tradition to compete with. And I think more so than

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:41.920
let's say literary fiction does with, compared to popular fiction. The chasm is not so great

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:50.080
between them. Perhaps if we were talking only about that literature, the producer makes radical

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.840
experiments with form, for example, say, well, some of the literature of Samuel Beckett, the work of

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:04.000
B. S. Johnson, or figures like Eva Figus or Christine Brooke Rose or that sort of thing.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:14.080
There, that's probably about as far away from popular fiction as you could get.

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.160
Same in cinema. If you were looking at a very experimental film, what, of Stan Brackage or

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.520
Bill Viola or something like that and you were to compare that with Jurassic Park, then

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:33.760
there's a big chasm. But if you'd compare, say, the very intelligent films but made for a mainstream

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.680
audience like, say, those of Martin Scorsese with some of the more populous inclined things of George

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.800
Lucas and Steven Spielberg, I don't think there's anything like the same sort of total

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:52.320
difference of intent and means and everything there. But that's, it's very hard for me to think

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:59.680
of a composer who's equivalent to someone like Scorsese in cinema. And that's in no sense to call

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:04.480
Scorsese a middle brow filmmaker. I think he's a very, very great filmmaker throughout his career.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:13.360
But he has worked within basically narrative oriented structures. He's done very imaginative

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:20.400
things with all aspects of the cinema, all aspects of how you use cuts, how you use edits of other

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.760
types, how you use the camera work, everything like that, how you use music actually, everything

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:31.440
like that. But in ways that are meaningful to a mainstream audience.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.480
I think you'd have to look in the popular music sphere to find an equivalent figure. I don't

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.280
think you'd find it in the composition world. Yeah. So maybe in the jazz sphere, something like

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:48.640
Coltrane's A Love Supreme might be comparable in a way that something like Cecil Taylor's

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:56.800
unit structures wouldn't, I think. If that makes sense. So I think

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:07.520
the competition from popular culture is of a different order of magnitude. I mean, also just

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:13.280
simply the global reach of it. I mean, does that much popular fiction other than perhaps

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.680
J.K. Rowling and a few others, when she was more in vogue than she is now,

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:25.280
how much popular fiction gets a truly, maybe 10 round as well, gets a truly global audience,

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.280
like you could say of a quite a significant amount of popular music as well, probably even less so

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:39.680
with theatre as well. So and, you know, a thing I noticed in academia, you can, when you talk about

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:49.360
cultured people, again, I come across people who know huge amounts about literature, huge amounts

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.560
about society and politics, lots about the visual arts, but you mentioned something like a D major

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.200
scale to them. And they really think this is, you know, you might as well be talking about

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.240
sort of advanced astrophysics. Right, right. But I don't think that would have been the case.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:09.520
And this was my third point. I don't think that would have been the case 30 or 40 years

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:18.960
ago. I think a lot of educated people would have had some exposure to at least some basics of music

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:25.360
theory and some basics of a Western classical musical tradition. And that's, that is disappearing,

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:31.440
I think. It's particularly bad here in Britain and particularly bad in the US. But from all I can

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:37.040
tell, it's sort of being marginalised out in lots of other countries as well, perhaps at a slightly

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:48.080
different rate. And one of the consequences of this is that I'm, well, I think, I still think

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.920
even some of the most radical work in new music, in some sense, has meaning relative to a tradition,

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.800
including some of that stuff like Helmut Lachemann on where it's your cargo, and the sense is

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:06.000
turning that tradition on its head. But you need to know what that tradition is to recognise it

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:17.040
being turned on its head. The, I've heard from regularly, perhaps a bit too often from young

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:24.240
composers, they think that the classical tradition is dead, or they want it to be dead, perhaps.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.280
I mean, in some universities, I think they don't want to have their own music to compete with that

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:36.080
for student interest and favour. But some of some contemporary composers have played an active

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:43.680
role in trying to sort of push that Western classical tradition out of the curriculum,

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.200
in a way that I think is often very destructive.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.280
What do you think is their motivation for doing that?

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.920
Well, as I say, on one hand, I think they want to have the ground to themselves for a certain sort of

01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:01.440
art music, if you like. And if they're just one composer amongst the great many spanning

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.880
centuries, and they're a much smaller fish, and a much bigger pond.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.600
Do you think there are contemporary authors who are anxious about having their work

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.360
compete with Shakespeare?

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.600
Not to the same extent.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.960
Because composers routinely, I know this because I have, I work with so many students,

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.280
they imagine themselves as being potentially in the same room as Beethoven, and they're not

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.720
measuring up. But I don't see a lot of poets thinking now, hang on a minute, this is not as

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.080
good as the Shakespearean sonnets.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:42.000
Well, because I think there is an audience for contemporary literature, I say, not the most

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.080
radical experimental stuff I was mentioning, but a lot of artistic literature, if you like,

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:56.240
which is not in its own right, which doesn't necessarily, those who read it don't necessarily

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.960
have the same amount invested in at least sort of classics from before the 19th century.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.920
That's possible, I think the same is true in theatre as well, and possibly in the visual

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:16.400
arts, so it's a bit more complex. I've not yet seen evidence that the same is true for new music.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:24.160
There's a few people, there's a few people who might like some progressive rock and some zapper

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.920
or something, and then come from that into Stockhouse, and yes, I've known that happened,

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.720
but I think that's quite exceptional. There isn't the same,

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.440
constituency has say many who might read a novel of Martin Amos or something, or

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:48.480
Michel Huelbeck, but wouldn't necessarily be that drawn to reading Daniel Defoe or reading

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:59.520
Samantha's. I don't think that's there, or I haven't seen it in music, and so when I'm saying

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:06.640
about those in universities who are pushing the sort of, take the dead white European males off

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.000
the curriculum, and there are plenty of these, I think they're ultimately to some extent digging

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.720
their own grave here, because if they- Well, the second part of that means get rid of the

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.320
dead white males in order to make room for me. Yes, exactly, and sometimes it's just living

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.480
white males. The only way they differ is they're not dead, but unfortunately we all will be in

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.840
the end. Which posits that there's a zero-sum game effectively. Yes, there is.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:42.640
But if, I mean, I really wish some contemporary poets would think more about this, if you didn't have

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.640
some sort of weight of tradition, which in some sense informs and gives somewhere to locate your

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:55.760
work, if you're actually just having to compete on its own terms with popular music,

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:04.240
do you think it was your standard chance? I hear lots of stuff about saying, oh,

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.240
we have different modes of distribution, now anyone can produce things on a laptop, and you

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.480
can produce a lot with a laptop, especially now with some of the latest AI software for

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.480
composition, which I've looked at and has other sorts of new implications. There is a lot you

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:26.160
can do in that respect, but how do you get anyone to listen to it? Anyone can do something,

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.400
put it out on SoundCloud, or Spotify, or something like that. But that's just as true of popular

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:39.920
genres as it is. Oh yes, sure. It's not as though it's any easier to emerge from nothing

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.440
and make a gigantic career for yourself as a singer-songwriter. Oh, I know, and all

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.560
I hear is this is getting harder and harder in the popular field to make any sort of impact

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.080
when there are so many other people trying to do it, and there might be all sorts of factors

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.600
with the small number who come from this and actually gain some sort of wider recognition,

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:09.200
which is why it's a huge mistake. And it's disingenuous when you get things like Degreak

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.880
or Supromasis to think, if you study popular music, that this will give you a route towards a great

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:21.440
well-paying career. For everyone you see, every population you see who is doing that,

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.160
there are any number of others who've done a handful of gigs and small venues and then

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:34.320
just sort of split up. Nevertheless, my intuitive sense, having been in the new music world,

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.920
I'm not really sure if I'm in it anymore, but perhaps I am, it's hard to say, is that

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:48.800
that there's something either fundamentally broken or exhausted about that culture today.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.320
I don't know which. I don't know if it's repairable. I don't know if it ought to be repaired,

01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:02.480
but the sense I get attending concerts, and this could partly be a reflection of

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.520
my being a little bit older now. So, of course, it feels different to attend a concert when you're

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.480
42, as I am now, as opposed to when you're 22. The excitement level is perhaps not the same,

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.480
because you've seen several hundred concerts in the intervening years. But it certainly seems to

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.160
me, as though something has changed, there's much less of a sense of anticipation or excitement

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.840
surrounding these events. There's a sense that the infrastructures that are supporting these sorts

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:39.360
of events is on very shaky ground, I would say, that it may not be able to convincingly justify

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:46.160
its own indefinite existence without some kind of massive change in the way that it's set up,

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:54.320
and that we cannot indefinitely push off into the future the question of, well, who's listening to

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.360
it? Well, future audiences, well, that doesn't work forever.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:04.800
No, it doesn't work forever. And then I'll just finish this with one more point. So, there are

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:12.240
pieces that I've heard that involve enormous orchestras playing extraordinarily esoteric

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.680
techniques that require a great deal of specialized training that is not something you can count on

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:22.160
with the vast majority of professional orchestras. You need a specialized new music orchestra to do

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:27.440
that. Specialized new music orchestras are, of course, financially non-viable, unless they're

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:34.480
being massively subsidized by the state. These works require enormously expensive rehearsals to

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:40.640
produce, and they're typically played once. And this is not by any means an isolated phenomenon.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.840
It is, in fact, the standard mode of operating for most of the continental festivals. And the

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:53.440
assumption seems to be that it's better to program only premieres or buy-in-large premieres,

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.680
let's say 90% of the works will be premieres. And it seems to be almost a structural phenomenon

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.720
that, of course, these works won't be played again, or maybe they'll be dug up in 25 years

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:13.280
and dusted off. But in the vast majority of cases, works that cost hundreds of thousands

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.280
of euros to put on, there's no way that you can play them with anything like the frequency that

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.160
would be required for them to become either familiar or to make any kind of an impression

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.760
beyond the local audience of maybe a few hundred people that hears the premiere. So that, I think,

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:36.320
I think that's got to stop, or it simply will stop out of its own inertia and out of the

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:42.720
sheer financial absurdity of it. So if you were to compare something like that, a composition that

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.560
takes two years to write, that requires a colossal budget in order to perform, and that can only

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:56.240
be done once, that sounds to me like a non-starter. Compare that to a figure such as Vivian Meyer

01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.760
in the photography world. There we go. Vivian Meyer was a photographer who operated essentially

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:09.760
in secret. She was a street photographer in Chicago who, for decades, took square format images

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:15.200
with a rolloflex camera on the streets of Chicago, produced something like 25,000 photographs,

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.960
just one of the finest street photographers of all time, never showed her work to anybody,

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:23.920
never told anyone she was doing it. And when she died, all of these boxes of negatives were

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:30.160
discovered by a film historian, and she became posthumously a phenomenon. But this work is done

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:38.000
privately at no cost to anybody except the cost of a film for her, and ends up having a very

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.800
significant popular impact when it's eventually discovered. So there's a colossal asymmetry

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:50.080
between the means required to produce these things versus the number of people that will

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:55.840
actually benefit from that. Well, I think we do have to distinguish between the performing and

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:01.920
non-performing arts in this respect. I mean, photography can essentially be done by a single

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.800
person. I recognize sometimes you have other people doing prints and the negatives and so on,

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.880
but you don't require the whole apparatus of a group of performers to produce photography. It's

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:24.160
the same story for literature as well. Whereas music or film or theater or dance are multi-person

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.560
activities, and that's always going to be more expensive. And this is one reason why I say

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:35.680
what some people say about, well, why can't the modern music world be like the modern art world,

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.920
particularly in terms of the amounts of money that are made by some of the artists. But they

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:50.320
produce a particular thing that becomes a commodity. But here's the thing. In the popular sphere,

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:57.280
the amount of money that it costs to produce the thing is scaled in terms of the number of people

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:02.320
that it can potentially reach. There's a coherence between those two things. So if you make a film

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.200
that has a Â£100 million budget, for example, then you're expecting to get a return on that.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:13.040
You're expecting that it will draw at least Â£100 million in the box office. So you could argue,

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:19.680
well, there's no reason why that should apply to the fine arts. But somebody does have to pay for

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:26.960
it. There's no way to get around that fact. This is what I've been banging on about for years,

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:34.640
a bit like a broken record, that I think the possible decline of a subsidy culture for new

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.560
music is one of the biggest threats it could possibly face. There is no way that the vast

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.600
majority of new music, other than things like rice and glass and a few others,

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:52.640
could survive just on the open marketplace. The costs are too great and the returns too low.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:46:00.800
The listenership is too low, except for the odd few things that may... I mean, it's possible

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:06.640
some orchestra could put a big bird whistle piece on within, in the context of an otherwise

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.080
more traditional program, and they'd still get enough people in that that would just about cover

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:18.800
the costs of it. But those cases... Well, and yes, with things like chamber music as well and solo

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:24.000
performance where the costs aren't quite so great, it's also possible. But on the whole,

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.440
the vast majority of new music, as we understand it, at least in European terms,

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:40.160
only gets to be performed, only gets to be recorded through support, through state subsidies. So,

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.840
money collected through taxation and redistributed to make up for the shortfall, or through the

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:52.480
radio stations, or other broadcasters who collect it through the license fee, or to some extent

01:46:52.480 --> 01:47:02.800
through the universities as well. Now, I mean, certainly in Britain, we've seen sweeping cuts

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:06.720
to arts funding, especially to music funding recently, the most prominent of which,

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:14.080
Relitia English National Opera, which at the time we're talking, the idea is it could be relocated

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.280
in Manchester, but it almost certainly won't be the same sort of entity that it was before.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.560
Big grant losses to things like the Britain symphony, to the London symphony, to the

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:32.720
ensemble saffron in Manchester who have had to close down, and so on and so forth. And in economically

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:40.640
difficult times, these things are seen as perhaps not the most pressing social needs, and some of

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:47.360
the easiest things to cut when cuts are made. Now, many have said to me, why are you always so

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.200
concerned? Why are you always talking about subsidy? And they don't want to talk about it. They don't

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:56.720
think it's a very interesting issue or something. I say, well, you think it's all fine, doesn't

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.720
need thinking about while it's there. But the moment, I say, the moment people start saying,

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.800
well, maybe we don't need to spend this money on these ensembles, on these festivals,

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.880
what will be the arguments you will use to try and oppose those cuts?

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.040
Well, the problem is, that's exactly it. I don't think there necessarily are convincing

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.480
arguments, at least not to the people that would be in charge of dispensing the funds.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.720
So for instance, you may have seen there's a rather well-known video on YouTube of Boulez

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.880
on a talk show with, I think it's Michel Schneider, who is a French minister of the time,

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.640
who gets rather combative with Boulez. And they're talking about Irkheim. And he says, well,

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.640
Irkheim is costing, I don't remember the figure, it was a colossal amount of money. It's costing

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:53.920
a significant percentage of the budget, the annual budget for music from the Ministry of Culture.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.920
And the minister was basically asking Boulez, how can you possibly justify the expense of an

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:06.480
institution like this, given the extremely small amount of productions that it's actually producing

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.440
in terms of public concerts, in terms of anything that anybody in the general public could possibly

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.800
either understand or could attend. And of course, Boulez gets very angry and defensive and calls

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:22.400
the minister a fraud. But he basically sidesteps the question. He's very defensive, very angry,

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.960
but he doesn't acknowledge that there may be somewhere in there a totally legitimate question,

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.200
given that it is public money, it is coming out of the taxpayer's pocket.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.400
So what is the justification for such a colossal expense,

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.160
given that the vast majority of the population is never going to either attend a concert or

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:49.600
benefit in any tangible way from that institution? Well, I think it is possible to make some sorts

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:56.400
of arguments there. But just to compare an even more mainstream example than your Boulez interview

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.240
one, in the 1990s, there was a series here called The House about the Royal Opera House.

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:07.520
It was a documentary crew who followed them over an extended period. And it's widely credited with

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.880
doing no particular good to the Royal Opera House's reputation, because in this so

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.320
elevated art form, of course, you saw lots of very petty people going about their jobs,

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.640
as you would in any institution of that size. But it sort of rather deflated a lot of its own

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:36.320
mythology there. But there was one episode which began with the general manager, Jeremy Isaacs,

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:44.240
traveling to work in a taxi. And I mean, it was clearly a bit set up, but you had the taxi driver

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.800
asking some of the things that taxi drivers in London do. He says, oh, you're Jeremy Isaacs,

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:53.440
aren't you? He says, yes, I am. Clearly a bit grumpy and not particularly wanted to talk to this

01:50:53.440 --> 01:51:00.080
taxi driver. He said, OK, can you just ask me something? And the taxi driver was framed as

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:05.520
a quite reasonable way, saying, well, why should all of people like me and other taxpayers who

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:12.560
never go to the opera, why should our taxes go into this? And he just gave a very grumpy and

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.920
very defensive response. And he says, well, if you're not happy, I suggest you take it up with

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:22.960
your MP. And he says, we get the lowest subsidy in Europe, which is true. But he wasn't prepared

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:29.200
to engage the question. And unfortunately, I think that's quite common that people don't want to

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:36.400
ask this question. Now, you could, I think, articulate an argument in terms of the advancement

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:43.440
of musical knowledge and musical language, which could be seen as a good in its own right, even

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.720
if only minority actually partake of that. But it could be seen to have other sort of

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.640
side effects and other byproducts. Well, I think if you don't engage the question thoroughly,

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.960
then the danger is that it will simply seem like a form of entitlement.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:06.640
Which it is. It is. And do you think the people who are chasing after the commissions on all the

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.560
big festivals in Europe, do you think that many of them have a sense of some sort of wider social

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.040
responsibility? Or do you think they're thinking, what do I have to do to get the most lucrative

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.960
commissions? And many think, well, I am a great composer, or at least I say so. So therefore,

01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.840
I should get these commissions. And of course, there's more people wanting them than there are

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:33.200
commissions to go around. And for one way reason or another, some get the commissions, some don't.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:39.040
I'm not saying that's always a fair process. There's lots of factors involved, but then some get very

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:45.840
embittered because they feel entitled to have these things. But you can sometimes frame their

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:50.720
entitlement in terms that would make sense to other people in new music, the value of their

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:55.840
work. But framing them in terms that would make sense to a wider public is quite a bit harder to do.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:08.160
And as subsidy is gradually being cut, and as what we might call an avant-garde establishment,

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:15.200
its position is looking more and more precarious now, including in the light of new diversity

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:23.200
initiatives, and so on. As that's happening, what you are starting to see is what I think rather

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:30.160
desperate attempts to sort of suggest some social relevance, which is where you get a lot of music,

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:40.160
which is distinguish more by which topical issues it fastens itself on to, as if away saying, please

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:48.000
look, I'm writing a piece about the war in Ukraine, so therefore it's relevant and it's meaningful.

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.360
To which, as I was saying to you before, I would ask, well, why is that a piece of music?

01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:01.760
And if you're writing a sort of, yes, a slow laminato so for string orchestra,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.920
saying to the dead in Ukraine, I'm sorry, forget it, I've heard 100 pieces of those,

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.640
and you could take them from one traumatic event to another without having to change

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:22.800
almost anything. I mean, not so many people do that in the new music scene, but they're trying

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.280
to fame discourse around their work in terms of anything other than its musical qualities.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.640
And musical abstraction and music's lack of an object, music's not being a figurative art

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:40.240
primarily, of course I recognise as sort of mimetic music and programmatic music and so on,

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:45.840
but I don't think music is fundamentally a mimetic art and that those things, which I think are

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:57.920
strengths are seen as weaknesses. And I think this is just emblematic of a new music scene

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.880
that's forced onto the defensive to some extent. The sense of entitlement is not being

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:13.680
mirrored in wider public discourse, which now lacks prominent and articulate figures such as

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.840
Boulez, such as Stoccas, perhaps such as Carter, but those types of composers, they're all either

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.200
very old or no longer with us now. It was politically expedient in France and Germany and

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.160
other places in the post-war era to support contemporary forms of culture for various reasons.

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.520
It's no longer the case. In fact, it's a liability to the extent that the general

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.840
population even thinks about these things, which I think is highly unlikely, but it's no longer

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.480
it's no longer advantageous to say, well, look what we're doing for the arts, look what we're

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.320
doing for contemporary music. So there's no reason to imagine that it would continue indefinitely.

01:55:52.320 --> 01:56:00.800
And my argument is that this, and to make things clear, I'm not for a minute suggesting that

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.640
everything needs to be left up to market forces. Obviously, there are certain things that cannot

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:12.720
be left up to the market. And I'm in favor of state support for cultural institutions,

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.120
for museums, for symphony orchestras, for operas, and so on. Where it gets complicated, I think,

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.960
is subsidies to individual artists and how those get decided, how they get distributed.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:34.160
That's very tricky. And my sense now is that a better model is some kind of private funding

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.360
or crowdfunding for a lot of projects. And I think that that can actually work quite well.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:44.560
And part of the reason for that is there's, in those instances, a direct connection between

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.040
the person commissioning or the group of people commissioning, there's a relationship between

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:56.720
them and the artist. We open to all sorts of potentials that are corruptibility,

01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:03.840
all sorts of favoritism. It could be some rich people give their private money to other people

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.960
from their own sort of milieu, their own background, and things like that. It could work

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.520
very much against those who are not born to the backgrounds where they're going to have those

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:24.160
sorts of contacts and things. Moving towards private funding, I wouldn't really see as the way

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:30.880
forward, to be honest. Crowdfunding as well, that's, I mean, I don't know how sustainable

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.960
that is. I mean, you can do odd projects, but whether someone could sustain enough to sort of

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:43.840
keep working, I'm less sure. The alternative that's left, then, is making an absolutely

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.680
airtight case for continued public subsidizing of esoteric art forms.

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:58.480
Yes. And I think that can be done, but maybe the artistic priorities would have to change

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:08.400
a bit. Maybe a bit more honesty would be needed about the traditions in which these are located.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:13.920
I mean, why should we not be equally giving money towards supporting things that are doing

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:19.280
esoteric things in popular music idioms and traditions? Why would they be any less deserving

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:24.000
of it? There were quite a lot of extremely violent polemics around that in France,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.080
actually, or surrounding the Villa Medici, notably. When they decided to open that institution up to

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:36.320
people working in popular domains, singer-songwriters, for example, and the composers, of course,

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.240
predictably, the older, more established composers were absolutely outraged at the idea that

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:47.200
you're taking away a spot from us. We need this. We don't have anything else, and you're giving it

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:51.600
to somebody in the popular field. Unless I know people don't need it. They don't need it.

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:58.640
If they're doing commercial singer-songwriting, of which there's a long tradition of at least

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:04.400
some people making a perfectly viable commercial income from that, then I would say they're right

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.360
to say they don't need it. If they were doing something that somehow engages with stylistic

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:15.280
aspects of it or other aspects of those traditions, but are taking it into some new realms, then that

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:25.600
might be a different matter. I suppose I do see value in art being able to experiment in art,

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:32.320
and not just keep doing new experiments from the bottom up, but starting developing new

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:38.640
idioms and developing them over a period of time. Where's there some continuity across an output?

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:45.120
I think there is something to be said for supporting that over an extended period.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:49.280
And I'll come back to that in terms of what you're saying about premiers in a second.

01:59:52.800 --> 02:00:00.480
Because, well, I would frame it in terms of that I think a society which doesn't

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.600
offer a space for those things to be developed and articulated

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:12.640
is one that's somewhat impoverished in terms of knowledge, in terms of the forms of experience,

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.200
the forms of thought that are made possible, even if they are for a minority. But most people,

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:25.520
I believe, have some sort of minority interest. They're just not all the same, or they wouldn't

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:37.920
be a minority. I've used this sort of analogy with television. Supposing you have

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:48.160
100 people and 101 television channels, and suppose each of those channels

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:55.200
is only watched by one of those people, except for the 101st, which everyone watches.

02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:03.120
As well. Do you think any of those people would be happy if you got rid of the 100 and you were

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:10.640
left with only number 101? There is something to be said for supporting minority interests.

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.520
The problem is, new music seems to sport only one type of quite narrow minority interest, and

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:24.400
probably some different form of subsidy would have to be spread across a wider range of things,

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:31.520
where you can produce evidence that across the board, there's a range of engagement with all

02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:37.840
sorts of people at different parts of society. We're a long way from that at the moment.

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.680
Some places more than others. The Huddersfield Festival, for example, is quite open to a very

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:49.120
broad range of styles and practices. A similar thing happened with-

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.680
Yes, but what about the audiences? I know they do have a local audience at Huddersfield,

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:57.360
and that matters, and that's been a very important factor in sustaining that festival.

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.040
A local audience, which isn't just visionaries, but just from a local community that have taken

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.040
an interest in it. But still, for all the variety of styles and practices that there are on show at

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:13.920
Huddersfield, what percentage of the British population, or even the population of parts

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.320
of Yorkshire, ever listen to any of them? If they had a range of things, lots of different

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.320
communities within that geographical area listen to it. It might be a bit different.

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.720
If that is the case already, I'd like to see the evidence for it.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:35.760
But I just wondered if I could come back to your question about

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.320
premiers, because I think that's very important. I'm often bemoaned.

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:53.280
The way that the premier culture permeates so many of the institutions and the events,

02:02:53.920 --> 02:03:00.080
and it's almost invariably seen as a better thing to commission new works or play new

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.600
works that are doing the circuit, than it is to go back to some other works, which might have happened.

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:14.160
Something, I think, very highly of James Dylan's cycle nine rivers. It was all pretty much

02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:20.800
completed, except for a few details by the early noughties. It's had a few performances,

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:27.360
but not that many. I think that's an amazing cycle and would really reward more sustained

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:34.000
exposure. But most people would sooner commission a new work from Dylan if they're at a festival.

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.040
And of course, that has to be, if we didn't have the festivals commissioning things,

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.200
then a lot of the new things wouldn't get written and everything was new at some point in time.

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:50.880
But I think it's too extreme in terms of, yes, a fetishization of brand new. Something that's

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.320
10 years ago can be, certainly as far as the vast majority of any population's concern,

02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:02.960
will be just as much new music as something written now. And maybe if we had fewer premiers,

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:07.120
which would actually save some money if you didn't have the same amount of commission fees to pay.

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.040
And a bit more revival of things, and a bit more giving things repeated listening,

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.960
which they definitely need. And also developing a performance tradition more for those things as

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:24.800
well. Since I've been in Britain on this trip, I've had the opportunity to meet with quite a

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:31.280
few artistic directors of various ensembles and festivals and organizations. And one of the things

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.960
that's emerged out of that is a lot of these people are very conscious of the need for that.

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:42.400
And in fact, increasingly inclined to, when contemplating a commission project,

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:46.720
they'll want to set it up in such a manner that the piece can be played four or five or six times,

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.920
or potentially be taken on tour. And they're increasingly moving away from this very, what

02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:58.400
I think is a very old fashioned and ineffective model of doing a premiere and then moving on to

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:02.320
the next one. I think that's absurd. And I think that there's a lot of people that are recognizing

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:09.600
that. And for composers, I would say, don't be shy or hesitant about arguing in favor of that

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.480
when you decide what projects you're going to take on. If the group wants to commission a piece from

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:20.640
you and has no plans to ever do it again beyond the premiere, then perhaps you may wish to hesitate

02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:22.720
before accepting that project.

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:31.680
Well, two thoughts there. I mean, absolutely. The move towards networks, I mean, where the

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:40.880
model is, so a new work will get played in arse musical, it'll get played in Veen Moden,

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:45.040
it'll get played in Huddersfield, it'll get played in Musica Strasburg, and so on. And

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:52.080
there are many projects to ensure that commissions don't lead to just one performance,

02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:56.560
but a whole range of them. But it's usually a whole range in quite quick succession after

02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:04.240
each other, usually in one season, at least, so no more than a year. I don't know of networks

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:07.760
that will have things so that they'll be played once and then played five years later and then

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:13.840
10 years later, and so on. And I know the objections that there are to some of these

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:19.520
networks, that it turns the festival circuit into more of a monolith and more homogenous in

02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:27.040
its own way. If basically all the big festivals are just doing the big names and the new works of

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:33.200
those, that becomes less of a place for more distinct festivals as more of their own sort of

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:39.360
distinctive nature and character. So I suppose that's, I don't know why you couldn't have a

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.040
festival with its own distinctive character, but still isn't just focused on premiers.

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:51.120
So there's that factor for start, but there's also the question, are people writing music

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:55.520
that will last? Or are they even wanting it to last?

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:06.320
Let me think in the realms of, I mean, we're still talking with our point of reference being the

02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:13.360
work. And in something like free improvisation, that really wouldn't be the case in the same

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:19.200
way. I mean, yes, there are works of free improvisation, and there are some that are

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:24.480
perhaps not quite so free or so improvised as suggested to be when they're done on repeated

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:32.000
occasions and there's quite a lot of commonality between them. But the event perhaps counts for more

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:39.120
than the work and its permanency in that sort of genre.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.360
Now, to be fair, not all artists are necessarily preoccupied with posterity.

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:51.760
And it's a completely legitimate standpoint, I think to say. I'm making things for today,

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:57.360
and if it lasts and if it doesn't, that's fine. But I'm interested in doing what I

02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.960
want to do that reflects the current moment and fate will decide. And it's fine.

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:10.640
Absolutely fair enough. No one, including the cabozas, can know for sure what will and won't

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:17.280
last. And trying self-consciously to write things for posterity brings his own set of problems.

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:23.680
You can see that. So I suppose I wasn't so much thinking of cabozas writing saying,

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:29.760
well, I'll do the best I can and then let history take its course as far as how it's seen. I was

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.600
thinking rather more of people writing more ephemeral and topical and off-the-moment things.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:44.080
And this is where, yes, I'm looking at free improvisation. I'm looking at certain sorts

02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:50.800
of community projects involving amateurs, very in vogue at the moment and so on. And lots of things

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:56.640
that might be more interesting for the participants and for the listeners.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:04.560
And I do think that if I'm really honest, particularly with things involving amateurs,

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:13.200
it's a bit of a taboo, but I've reached taboo a bit. I'm not so convinced about an awful lot

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.080
of work with amateurs. And I don't really like the role that amateurism has in British musical

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:25.920
culture overall. I don't think anyone would find it so problematic if I suggested that

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:33.280
amateur dramatics are mostly for friends and family to see maybe a couple of others.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.640
Maybe amateur music making is the same.

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:43.760
Yes, it depends on the level of accomplishment of the amateur, of course. Because in Germany,

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:49.120
there's of course a very strong tradition of, well, in fact, I know many people

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:53.520
in Strasbourg, for example, who are professionals in other fields. They might be

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.840
they might be diplomats, they might be working for the Council of Europe, they might be

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:05.200
who have a degree in music, who are passionate about music, but are simply not pursuing it as

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.080
a career, but who are outstanding performers. Absolutely. The New London Chamber Choir here,

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.280
again, not a professional choir, but one of the most outstanding,

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000
the Disc of Synaxus' Choral Works is one of the greatest synaxus discs I think there's ever been.

02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:25.200
And yes, some of the amateur choirs there are more widely, not specific to new music.

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:32.720
There is some fair degree of accomplishment there. But, well, in Britain, I think this means

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:36.400
that people think rare, therefore, we don't really need many professional choirs. And that's the

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:42.560
problem I have there. But I'm thinking more of these community projects with amateurs.

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:49.520
They may form some useful community social function, but I'm not sure they necessarily

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:56.000
produce really remarkable art. I mean, I've seen some exceptions. Some of the work that people

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.480
like Gerhard Stabler and Konzu Shim have done with amateurs or schoolchildren has been absolutely

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:09.120
remarkable, I think, really gripping stuff. But it's very directed. I mean, both of them know

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:15.840
exactly what they want from these people and can get it. But I'm not really sure how much input

02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:21.200
beyond sort of doing what they're told the amateurs and others have in that.

02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:28.080
So what I'm saying is if we're looking for something where you'll have more sustained

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:33.840
traditions and where we will have repeated performances, there needs to be work which

02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:38.480
will stand up to that. That's quite right. That is quite right. Yes. Yes, you would have to be,

02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.960
you would have to be aiming to produce work that can withstand that kind of scrutiny,

02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:49.680
that kind of repeated listening. Yeah. Well, we should probably wrap this up. Before we stop,

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.520
though, is there anything you'd like to tell our listeners about what you're working on currently

02:11:53.520 --> 02:12:01.440
and what you're doing at the moment? Well, things have taken a certain new direction in my

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.160
professional life that I've moved from my university, City University of London,

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.880
I've moved from the music department to the sociology department. I'm now professor of music,

02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:16.080
culture and society here. And there are a lot of continuities in terms of the type of teaching

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:21.840
I do. I mean, I've taught about music and some aspects of wider culture in social context

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:27.360
for a long time. And if anything, I probably find there's a more hospitable culture in the

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:33.120
new department I'm in towards what I'll say is a dialectical view of the relationship between

02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:38.480
what I call culture with a medium-sized C, which means not just high culture,

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.120
can be popular culture as well, but it means things specifically designated as culture.

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.160
It doesn't just mean the whole realm of human activity, which is the more anthropological

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:53.200
definition. But when I say dialectical model, I mean, between that type of culture and the

02:12:53.200 --> 02:13:00.160
rest of society, there are all sorts of interplays, interactions, but it's not a simple deterministic

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:04.480
relationship. You can't say because of society's particular way, it'll therefore automatically

02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:10.320
produce this type of culture. The culture isn't just a bright part of society. The culture is

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:16.320
equally part of society and can exist in a critical relationship with the rest of society.

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.040
Now, that's widely accepted amongst a lot of cultural sociologists, perhaps not so much

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.400
amongst some music sociologists and music anthropologists and so on. So it's actually

02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:34.640
refreshing to find a much more open intellectual culture with respect to that and lots of other

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:39.680
things in here. So I teach more widely about culture, not just about music, and I teach

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:45.040
about classical social theory, but I will be teaching more about music as a social phenomenon

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:52.320
as well. Beyond that, I'm still playing. I've been playing perhaps more traditional repertoire

02:13:52.320 --> 02:14:00.480
in the last few years. In 2022, I did this big cycle of all nine of Liszt's versions of

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:04.560
Beethoven's symphony, and I followed it up with doing this version of the Symphony Fantastique

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:10.880
last year of Berlioz as well. And, you know, I'm looking for new and interesting ways of

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:15.120
combining the old and the new, which is something I've done for a long time, but

02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:21.600
it's more fundamental to me now. So I'm doing that. I'm doing lots of writing. I'm writing a new

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:27.120
biography of Stockhausen for reaction books. I'm working on other books on musical modernism

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.880
in Germany after 45 and on the history of specialist music schools in Britain

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:42.320
and a whole range of articles. And I've been writing more for non-academic outlets. I've done

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:50.160
oh, since, since 2022, I've published only 11 articles in the Times Higher Education

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:57.200
Journal on lots of things to do with education, including to do with music, but not just that.

02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:04.080
I've written more stuff for the London Review books for the critic, and you're trying to,

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:10.160
again, not always on music, but very much on cultural issues and cultural and political

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.920
issues. And those things are very important to me. And the opportunity to engage with wider

02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:21.680
audiences, also at public events where I've given talks and things is really important. And

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:34.160
it's made me realise the value of that for, for academics. I think there is certainly value

02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:38.560
in academics working on something without necessarily knowing where it's going to lead,

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:43.760
just like we're talking about with musicians. And much knowledge has been generated without

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.160
necessarily clear endpoints at the beginning. And that's a whole nature of research. You don't

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:54.080
necessarily know what your research will tell you in the end. But that has to come to some point at

02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:04.160
which there is a culture of thought of intellectual activity that if they must, if, if they've never

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:12.480
had any discernible, even indirect impact outside of small circles, then their, their value, surely

02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:20.080
it's fair to question that. And I've, I've thought about this in the context of academic

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.040
writing on culture, including the realms of cultural studies and so on, which I think is

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:34.880
distinct from cultural sociology. You can produce any number of journal articles which will get

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:44.720
hardly read, which have very, very jargon ridden particular takes on cultural phenomena as on.

02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:50.240
Now, I don't expect journal, academic journal articles to be read by a wide readership. They're

02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:54.800
not done for their purpose. But I might expect that some of their core arguments might be distilled

02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:01.760
and find their way into writings for, for a wider audience. And that's to something that what I'm

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:07.360
trying to do is from my wider writing and things. And that there are academics who are very hostile

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:14.560
to that. They, they don't ever want to sort of be asked any questions about what the wider impact or

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:22.160
relevance of their work is. And I think that's unsustainable in the long run. And, you know,

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:27.680
just like we're talking about possible crises and lack of faith in the realm of new music,

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:36.400
the same sort of things are happening in universities and certainly in Britain and

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:41.360
in some other countries, but I think particularly in Britain, now that we have about half the

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:49.120
population graduating from high school going into university, it's forced questions about

02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.920
what university is for. And you can't just answer them in the same way as you did when

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:58.960
only 20% of the population. It was like, it was something like that or not much more when I was

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:05.600
a student. And you, the whole model of the relationship between research and teaching

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:10.720
has to be looked at again, and the whole model of what, which disciplines matter

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:17.200
inevitably does. And this has been happening, but it's made life difficult for those working in

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.960
what seem like very esoteric disciplines when they're no longer succeeding and generating

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:31.360
the same interest from young people are studying those things. And you do ultimately need students

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.680
for universities. They're not, they may be primarily research things, but they can't be only

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:42.560
research things on at least a whole sector can't be sustained that way. And how we can maintain

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:52.320
aspects of real sort of critical knowledge generation whilst also teaching things that

02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:58.800
young people will find engaging and important. And we can somehow demonstrate to the wider society,

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:05.120
which we expect to fund our activities, how, how what we do has some other meaning. I think

02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:11.600
those things can't be ignored and need to be ends as difficult times coming ahead. The British

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:19.680
university sector has been had a situation where fees were frozen in 2017 at 9,250 per year for,

02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:26.880
for home undergraduate students. So in real terms, this means that the amount of money that each

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:32.800
institution has coming in is going down every year whilst whilst it's frozen that they can't

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:38.480
go up with inflation. At the same time, Brexit spent a real reduction of EU students,

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:46.160
new visa laws are making it harder for other foreign students to come. And certain subjects,

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:53.760
including music, are finding cuts in secondary provision here. So there isn't the same demand

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.960
generated amongst potential students. So we've just recently seen that the music department

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:04.480
in Oxford Brooks was scheduled to be closed down together with some other departments,

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:09.440
like including the Department of Mass there. And there were going to be cuts in other

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:15.280
developed particularly arts and humanities. Unfortunately, I foresee in the next five or

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:19.360
10 years, because other factors are going to make the financial provision even more precarious in

02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:27.120
universities, we may see other cuts and we need to be adaptable and flexible and be prepared to

02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:31.920
sort of countenance new ideas of what the university is for whilst holding on to what's best here. And

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:36.560
that's very much what I'm engaged with in what I'm writing about those subjects,

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:40.560
just like with music. Ian Pace, thank you very much. Always a pleasure to talk with you.

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.920
Likewise, thank you.
