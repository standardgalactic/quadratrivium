 Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a primatologist and psychology professor at Stanford University, shared a fascinating story about a group of baboons he studied in the wild, which had developed a unique social culture that was less aggressive and more socially affiliative than typical baboon groups. This culture was largely maintained over a decade even as new male baboons, who had grown up in more traditional groups, joined the troupe. These new males eventually learned to adapt to the group's non-aggressive norms after about six months.

The story illustrates how cultural transmission can occur among animals and how the social dynamics of a group can influence behavior. It also touches on broader questions in paleoanthropology and primatology about the origins of human social structures and the nature of our common ancestor with chimpanzees.

Dr. Sapolsky is recognized for his excellent communication skills, which he uses to convey complex scientific concepts to a broad audience. His lectures and ability to engage with topics ranging from stress in baboons to the intricacies of human behavior make him a highly respected science communicator.
