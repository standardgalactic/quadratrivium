Checking EconTalk/Eliezer Yudkowsky on the Dangers of AI 5⧸8⧸23.txt
 In this episode of Econ Talk, host Russ Roberts discusses intelligence and rationality with guest Eliezer Yudkowsky, a research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, who specializes in AI alignment. The conversation revolves around the relationship between intelligence and morality, the capabilities of artificial intelligence compared to humans, and the idea that increasing intelligence does not necessarily lead to better decision-making or more ethical behavior.

Yudkowsky argues that intelligence does not guarantee good judgment or adherence to moral principles, using historical examples like the Nazis to illustrate how intelligent people can still hold and act upon false beliefs and commit atrocities. He believes that while smarter individuals might be less likely to believe certain factually incorrect foundations of ideologies like Naziism, it is not a given that they would become more ethical or make better decisions.

Roberts challenges Yudkowsky's views by suggesting that if the intelligence of the SS agents from Nazi Germany had been increased, some might have abandoned their support for the Nazi ideology. However, Yudkowsky maintains that intelligence alone does not ensure ethical behavior, and he emphasizes that the range of human intelligence is limited and does not encompass the level of efficiency seen in highly advanced AI systems like Stockfish 15 in chess.

The conversation touches on the ideas of Nassim Taleb, who argues that bigger data can lead to bigger mistakes, and the misconception that more intelligence or data necessarily leads to better outcomes. Yudkowsky's perspective is that while humans are not as smart as they could be in an epistemic sense, it is still possible to recognize when their estimates are directionally incorrect and to propose actions that would better serve their goals.

The episode highlights the complex interplay between intelligence, rationality, and ethical behavior, suggesting that increasing intelligence does not automatically result in improved decision-making or more virtuous individuals. The conversation also underscores the importance of critical thinking and the recognition of fallacious models of reality.
