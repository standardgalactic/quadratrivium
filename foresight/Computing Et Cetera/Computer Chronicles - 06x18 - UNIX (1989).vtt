00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
This is what I was thinking in the middle of the IOHR lecture is that the

00:19.720 --> 00:36.760
These are the offices of Frame Technology in San Jose, California.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.700
They have Macintosh computers here, sunwork stations, PC compatibles, but the common thread

00:41.700 --> 00:44.800
that ties all their systems together is Unix.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.860
All of a sudden, Unix is hot.

00:46.860 --> 00:50.800
A nasty old operating system that used to be considered too difficult for most people

00:50.800 --> 00:56.040
to use is slowly emerging as an operating system of choice, as users discover its power

00:56.040 --> 00:59.700
and as vendors start to peddle it under a friendlier user interface.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.500
Today we take a look at the rebirth of Unix on this edition of the Computer Chronicles.

01:16.860 --> 01:32.640
The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw-Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,

01:32.640 --> 01:35.740
and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.

01:35.740 --> 01:41.620
In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information

01:41.620 --> 01:48.980
on new hardware, software, and technologies.

01:48.980 --> 01:52.780
Welcome to the Computer Chronicles, I'm Stuart Schiffay, and this is Gary Kildall.

01:52.780 --> 01:57.100
Gary, this is Rick Davis of Frame Technology Corporation, and Rick is using what is unquestionably

01:57.100 --> 02:01.020
the most talked about new computer of the year, the next computer from Steve Jobs.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.060
Lots of interesting features we could point out about the next, but I want to focus on

02:04.060 --> 02:05.540
the fact that it runs under Unix.

02:05.540 --> 02:09.380
Unix has been around 18 years or more, but primarily in the university community, the

02:09.380 --> 02:12.500
techie community, all of a sudden everyone is interested in Unix.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.500
Why?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.660
Well, Stuart, as you know, the traditional problem with Unix and PCs is that Unix really

02:16.660 --> 02:21.420
requires a lot of computing power, a lot of central memory, a lot of backup storage,

02:21.420 --> 02:24.580
of high performance processor, and we just haven't had that in PCs.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.200
Now we start to see the workstations come into the high-end PC market and the demand

02:28.200 --> 02:30.860
for multitasking, multi-user systems.

02:30.860 --> 02:35.060
Unix is written in C, gives us portability, relative portability across a lot of different

02:35.060 --> 02:37.540
platforms like the Next, the Sun Apollo, and so forth.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.980
Now we're also seeing standards evolve like object file formats, graphic standards, windowing

02:41.980 --> 02:43.340
standards, and so forth.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.860
It makes really Unix very viable in the high-end PC market.

02:46.860 --> 02:50.620
We're going to take a look at the power of Unix in its traditional workstation environment.

02:50.620 --> 02:54.880
We'll see some of these new graphic user interfaces, and we'll take a look at the implementation

02:54.880 --> 02:57.180
of one version of Unix on the Macintosh.

02:57.180 --> 03:01.100
We begin with a background look at the evolution of Unix, and for that report we go to the

03:01.100 --> 03:05.740
University of California at Berkeley.

03:05.780 --> 03:12.220
It began its life at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, won the endorsement of AT&T, and was

03:12.220 --> 03:18.140
adopted by universities around the country who appreciated its portability and its multitasking

03:18.140 --> 03:19.660
talents.

03:19.660 --> 03:25.420
It is Unix, an operating system with so many variants you need a family tree to trace its

03:25.420 --> 03:26.980
origins.

03:26.980 --> 03:32.580
One of the earliest centers of Unix development is the University of California at Berkeley,

03:32.620 --> 03:39.100
responsible for one of the main branches of Unix called BSD for Berkeley Software Distribution.

03:39.100 --> 03:44.020
Well, Berkeley got a fairly early version of Unix from Bell Labs and started writing

03:44.020 --> 03:47.140
additional programs for it, started adding things.

03:47.140 --> 03:51.420
When a larger version of many computers came out, Berkeley added a number of new features

03:51.420 --> 03:54.620
to the system that took advantage of the new computer.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.580
And we did software the way people wanted the software here.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.980
As a result, there were a number of other universities and research labs that were interested

04:01.980 --> 04:03.380
in the same thing.

04:03.380 --> 04:08.300
The Unix operating system has special appeal to programmers because of its many programming

04:08.300 --> 04:09.860
tools.

04:09.860 --> 04:15.860
Unix is also multitasking, so several applications can be running simultaneously.

04:15.860 --> 04:21.700
It is particularly suited to multi-user environments, and it offers structured programming, a way

04:21.700 --> 04:25.780
to divide problems into smaller parcels.

04:25.780 --> 04:30.500
On the other hand, the consequence of such diverse streams of development has been a

04:30.500 --> 04:32.860
lack of standards.

04:32.860 --> 04:37.860
To combine the best elements of those diverse strands is the latest challenge facing Unix.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.500
In general, the standards have been picking and choosing among the different features

04:41.500 --> 04:43.380
of different versions.

04:43.380 --> 04:47.060
And as a result, the standard versions will be not like any existing version, they'll

04:47.060 --> 04:49.220
be someplace in the middle.

04:49.220 --> 04:54.460
For example, a number of programs have options, and the standards will specify a smaller number

04:54.460 --> 04:57.700
of options than those will all be the same on every version.

05:00.500 --> 05:14.460
Joining us in the studio now is Karen Losarty, Karen is product manager with Sun Microsystems.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.460
Gary?

05:15.460 --> 05:20.780
Karen, Unix has had sort of a bad reputation in the past for a number of items like reliability

05:20.780 --> 05:23.980
and the lack of a good user interface and so forth.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.100
How has that changed with Unix in the last few years?

05:26.100 --> 05:30.380
Well, Unix has gained a lot of momentum in the last several years, and there's recent

05:30.420 --> 05:31.420
resistance for that.

05:31.420 --> 05:35.580
As you know, it's a very powerful operating system, and it supports multitasking so that

05:35.580 --> 05:38.140
you can do more than one function at a time.

05:38.140 --> 05:43.060
It also runs on a variety of hardware platforms, and many vendors in the industry do support

05:43.060 --> 05:44.060
Unix today.

05:44.060 --> 05:50.100
One of the most key things about Unix is that it supports a lot of hardware that run over

05:50.100 --> 05:52.220
networks, very, very large networks.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.580
What about the reliability issues?

05:53.580 --> 05:55.700
Is that a problem anymore with Unix?

05:55.700 --> 05:56.900
Not that we're finding at this time.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.100
And how about the interface issue that Karen mentioned also?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.100
Well, yes.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.100
That has been an issue.

06:01.100 --> 06:06.220
As you know, in universities today, a lot of developers learn Unix, they write C applications

06:06.220 --> 06:09.460
and so forth, and they move out into the industry and write applications.

06:09.460 --> 06:14.580
So there's a lot of support from the developers, and users find it hostile, and many of them

06:14.580 --> 06:16.180
have been very, very, very afraid of it.

06:16.180 --> 06:18.100
And this is one of the things you addressed with the open look.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.100
Correct.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.980
Now, Karen, before we get into the demo, could you describe basically what kind of hardware

06:21.980 --> 06:22.980
we're dealing with here?

06:22.980 --> 06:23.980
Yes.

06:23.980 --> 06:29.060
This is a 386i, Sun 386i, and it provides you the ability to run both DOS and Unix.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.060
It's on the same screen.

06:30.060 --> 06:34.340
So you could open a window and run a DOS application, and another window, run a Unix application.

06:34.340 --> 06:37.180
And what would the approximate cost of a piece of hardware like this cost, if you're

06:37.180 --> 06:38.180
running?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.180
Under $5,000.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.180
Okay.

06:40.180 --> 06:41.180
Okay, let's take a look at what you got here.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.420
This is a rather familiar looking interface, in fact, tell us about open look.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.420
Okay.

06:45.420 --> 06:48.780
Open look is a graphical user interface that was designed by Sun and AT&T in a joint

06:48.780 --> 06:49.780
development effort.

06:49.780 --> 06:53.060
We also licensed technology from Xerox Corporation.

06:53.060 --> 06:57.340
What I've done today is brought four applications that have actually implemented the open look

06:57.340 --> 06:58.340
specification.

06:58.340 --> 07:00.740
The open look is not a software product.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.700
It's actually consists of two books.

07:02.700 --> 07:07.020
It's a style guide for the developer on how to design an application and a specification

07:07.020 --> 07:08.740
for the toolkit designer.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.980
Okay, show us on the screen actually how you would use it.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.540
So these are four applications.

07:12.540 --> 07:17.660
We have here SunRite, which is what you see is what you get editor, SunPaint, which is

07:17.660 --> 07:23.100
a paint application or what we call a raster application.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.420
And this one is SunDraw, which is an object editor or a draw application.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.740
This is a file manager.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.020
This is critical.

07:29.020 --> 07:35.340
This one allows you to see graphically the UNIX file system right on the machine.

07:35.340 --> 07:40.780
As you know, most users that worked with UNIX and users today, raw commands on a command

07:40.780 --> 07:41.780
line to get at their files.

07:41.780 --> 07:43.260
It was all by memory.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.740
This is one of the most integral parts of open look.

07:45.740 --> 07:48.060
Okay, show us how you'd use it now and get into one of these applications.

07:48.060 --> 07:53.540
What we'll do is, first of all, what I'd like to show you is, as you see on this area right

07:53.540 --> 07:57.220
here is a control area, and each one of these windows has one.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.020
Notice that on there is buttons.

07:59.020 --> 08:04.460
All these buttons have common labels, and as you can see, each one has file, view, edit.

08:04.460 --> 08:10.060
What's remarkable about that is each application you go into, the learning curve goes way down.

08:10.060 --> 08:17.380
So for example, if I wanted to close this window, I simply click on the window mark,

08:17.380 --> 08:20.020
and it becomes an icon on the desktop.

08:20.020 --> 08:24.740
Same thing again here, and you can put them away on your desktop and rearrange them again

08:24.740 --> 08:25.740
any way you wish.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.740
Can you open up the paint box, for example, and let's take a look at, or do something.

08:28.740 --> 08:29.740
Yes, I'm very interested in saying that.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.260
This is the kind of interface that most users are familiar with by now.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.260
Correct.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.260
I mean, it's nothing new here.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.260
You're in fact trying to make it comfortable with stuff that already exists.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.260
Yes.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.940
Some of the things, though, that are very nice about open look, though, is I can preview

08:38.940 --> 08:39.940
my operations.

08:39.940 --> 08:42.740
For example, on the file, it says open or save.

08:42.740 --> 08:47.300
On view, it can be a canvas that brings up the appropriate window.

08:47.300 --> 08:55.620
On edit, you can actually pin up a menu, and you can move that to any location that you

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
wish.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.980
What is beneficial for the user is that I do not have to go back up to the control area

09:00.980 --> 09:02.700
to access the buttons all the time.

09:02.700 --> 09:07.340
It's minimum mouse movement, which you don't have on other user interfaces.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.820
Once I pull the pin, it goes away.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.700
Same thing for each of the windows here.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.980
Pull the pin, it disappears.

09:12.980 --> 09:21.980
Now, if we wanted to actually use this application, I can bring this up, select whichever one

09:21.980 --> 09:23.220
I want to work with.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.500
I can easily move it out of my way, because I might want to do some other things, and

09:27.500 --> 09:30.300
draw right into the window.

09:30.300 --> 09:37.300
At any time, I can also change the brush pattern, select any one of these, again, tell it to

09:37.300 --> 09:40.020
go away, and change it.

09:40.020 --> 09:43.180
Everything's very intuitive, very, very friendly.

09:43.180 --> 09:47.980
One of the most important things, though, that I found working with the interface is

09:47.980 --> 09:52.980
that other interfaces don't utilize is, with the file manager, you can actually use something

09:53.020 --> 09:55.140
called drag and drop.

09:55.140 --> 09:59.860
If you wanted to actually load a file into the window, all I have to do is grab the icon,

09:59.860 --> 10:06.620
position it over the window, and it actually loads that file into the window automatically.

10:06.620 --> 10:12.940
Now, if the entire file is not showing on the screen, and we'll just put this one to

10:12.940 --> 10:19.100
the back, I can actually use the scroll bars at any time to manipulate the window to see

10:19.100 --> 10:20.900
the rest of the file.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.620
If I stretch the window with what we call the resize corners, in any one of the four

10:25.620 --> 10:30.940
corners, then the actual scroll bars, if they're not needed, will go away.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.660
In this case, not all of the file is still on the screen, so they're resident.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.980
Are there a lot of applications being written out for OpenLook?

10:37.980 --> 10:38.980
Yes.

10:38.980 --> 10:43.620
Actually, we have over 1,500 applications that are being converted to support OpenLook,

10:43.620 --> 10:47.940
and what's real exciting is the applications that you see here today are shipping.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.500
This is not vaporware, they're available.

10:50.500 --> 10:55.260
We also have had early developers kits that our developers are taking, then they're actually

10:55.260 --> 10:57.260
working and designing applications today.

10:57.260 --> 11:01.700
Just returning very quickly, the price, I'm very amazed at the $5,000 price tag, it seems

11:01.700 --> 11:02.700
to be.

11:02.700 --> 11:06.340
Well, we have a vast array of workstations that Sun offers, and you can start at a very

11:06.340 --> 11:08.380
low end and go very, very expensive.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.380
This would not have certainly been the $5,000 one.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.380
Correct.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.500
Karen, thank you very much for joining us.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.100
We're familiar with Unix, of course, under many names and under many versions, and one

11:17.100 --> 11:21.380
of the popular versions of Unix is called SCO Xenix, developed by a company called the

11:21.380 --> 11:22.800
Santa Cruz operation.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.220
We have a report from Wendy Woods.

11:27.220 --> 11:32.620
Open Desktop is the latest attempt to sell Unix to mainstream corporate America.

11:32.620 --> 11:39.500
Open Desktop combines Xenix, Santa Cruz operations, form of Unix, which runs on PCs, with other

11:39.500 --> 11:45.540
industry standard tools, and a graphical user interface called Motif.

11:45.540 --> 11:50.260
It's all designed to offer a palatable form of Unix for general consumption.

11:50.260 --> 11:56.180
These open system offerings have never before been available in this kind of a platform,

11:56.180 --> 12:01.060
this widely available, pre-integrated, ready to go, and that's really the value added of

12:01.060 --> 12:02.500
Open Desktop.

12:02.500 --> 12:07.700
It's not a new product piece in itself, but it's the collection and standardization of

12:07.700 --> 12:11.780
all the open system standards that are available today.

12:11.780 --> 12:17.540
With Open Desktop, Windows display various applications running either on one's own PC

12:17.540 --> 12:19.860
or on a mainframe.

12:19.860 --> 12:23.220
Files are shared seamlessly between hardware platforms.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.580
The power of the 80386 is tapped.

12:26.580 --> 12:32.020
The Open Desktop environment is expected to be complete by September, and SCO's track

12:32.020 --> 12:37.580
record of success has attracted some big players to participate in the project, among them

12:37.580 --> 12:39.100
Deck and Tandy.

12:39.100 --> 12:44.700
Santa Cruz operation has doubled its sales for each of the last 10 years, and has gone

12:44.700 --> 12:48.980
from having just a few to now over 800 employees.

12:48.980 --> 12:53.820
But perhaps the biggest measure of its success comes from Giant Microsoft Corporation, which

12:53.820 --> 12:58.020
has just purchased nearly 20% of the company.

12:58.020 --> 13:01.580
In Santa Cruz, California, for the Computer Chronicles, I'm Wendy Woods.

13:09.100 --> 13:14.940
Joining us in the studio now is Janet Dobbs.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.980
Janet's a product manager with Hewlett Packard.

13:16.980 --> 13:21.100
Janet, before we get into the motif he has in her face, I'm Hewlett Packard.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.380
I know it's on the screen here, way in the background, there's a little bit of Unix there,

13:24.380 --> 13:25.940
it's like a directory.

13:25.940 --> 13:29.740
And so we all know that the Unix is underlying this whole user interface, which of course

13:29.740 --> 13:30.940
is different from Unix.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.700
It's a different piece of software.

13:33.700 --> 13:37.220
Why does Unix provide a good base for your product?

13:37.580 --> 13:42.140
Unix is a powerful operating system in that it allows for large amounts of memory and

13:42.140 --> 13:49.740
large programs, which are used in technical environments, factory floors, large databases.

13:49.740 --> 13:56.780
It's powerful, it's fast, it's unfriendly, so it's been very successful in more technical

13:56.780 --> 13:57.780
environments.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.340
That's why the user interface is in front of it.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.620
Okay now could you tell us, like we had in the last segment, what are we working with

14:03.620 --> 14:04.620
here in terms of hardware?

14:04.620 --> 14:06.460
There's obviously some equipment on the floor here.

14:06.700 --> 14:14.180
This is an HP360, it has a 68030 Motorola processor in it, it's running about 33 megahertz.

14:14.180 --> 14:17.180
And what's cost to this configuration?

14:17.180 --> 14:24.540
Series 300 workstations range from about 5000 up to 60 to 70,000, and a configuration like

14:24.540 --> 14:26.220
this goes from 10 to 15,000.

14:26.220 --> 14:30.340
Tell us about Motif now and the interface, in particular how is your approach different

14:30.340 --> 14:32.660
from what we just saw before in OpenLook?

14:32.860 --> 14:37.980
OSF Motif is a combination of technologies from both DEC and HP.

14:37.980 --> 14:45.100
If you notice on the screen the 3D borders around the windows, it's an enhanced look

14:45.100 --> 14:50.940
of the graphical user interface common in the PC environment from Microsoft, both Microsoft

14:50.940 --> 14:53.100
Windows and Presentation Manager.

14:53.100 --> 15:01.700
So it takes advantage of the large installed base in the PC market and all the work that's

15:01.740 --> 15:04.140
been done in graphical user interfaces there.

15:04.140 --> 15:07.860
Is that the major difference, the graphic look, we see it looks quite different or functionally

15:07.860 --> 15:10.020
is it really the same basic idea?

15:10.020 --> 15:13.060
The behavior is based on that found in the PC market.

15:13.060 --> 15:17.860
So a user that has been familiar with working with PCs can walk up to a Unix workstation

15:17.860 --> 15:22.900
and not be concerned that it's OS2 or Unix or whatever, what they see on the screen is

15:22.900 --> 15:28.180
what they're used to seeing and they know how to open applications, move around in them.

15:28.180 --> 15:32.380
Did you do that for us and show us how you actually use Motif?

15:32.380 --> 15:38.140
For example if I want to move a window and say I'm a PC user I know that I put the mouse

15:38.140 --> 15:43.340
pointer on the title bar, click on that with the left button and I can move that window

15:43.340 --> 15:45.620
around on the screen.

15:45.620 --> 15:51.540
I know that I can go to the left upper corner, hold the left mouse button down and I get

15:51.580 --> 15:56.580
a system menu which for each window contains things like restore, move, size.

15:56.580 --> 16:03.580
If I want to iconify a window I click in the, there's a minimize and maximize button that

16:05.220 --> 16:11.900
are found in presentation manager and on the left side it's minimize and I can click and

16:11.900 --> 16:18.900
I iconify that window and it moves into an icon.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.700
I can bring a window to the foreground by clicking in that window.

16:24.700 --> 16:29.380
The light source moves into the border so I can tell which window or which application

16:29.380 --> 16:32.100
is active at that point.

16:32.100 --> 16:37.300
By clicking in the upper right corner I can allow an application to maximize or take over

16:37.300 --> 16:39.220
the display.

16:39.220 --> 16:44.100
Can you access that sort of raw Unix window there and actually work inside it and go behind

16:44.100 --> 16:45.100
Motif?

16:45.100 --> 16:50.620
I have a terminal window right here that I click in and make that window active and

16:50.620 --> 16:55.500
at that point I can type in any of the commands in the Unix operating system.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.020
What is the status of Motif for me, where is this as a product?

16:59.020 --> 17:04.780
Motif will be available from OSF this summer, HP and Corvallis Oregon is under contract

17:04.780 --> 17:10.380
with OSF to merge the deck and the HP tool kits and we'll be turning that over to OSF

17:10.380 --> 17:11.380
in July.

17:12.380 --> 17:17.380
That's an acronym for Open Systems Foundation.

17:17.380 --> 17:20.380
Can you tell us a little bit about that group?

17:20.380 --> 17:26.500
The group was formed just about a year ago to ensure that software development environments

17:26.500 --> 17:32.820
were open, available for input from different workstation vendors to ensure that there were

17:32.820 --> 17:37.820
standards that would exist to help end users and software developers in creating programs.

17:37.820 --> 17:41.700
Especially around Unix and AIX in particular.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.580
And are there other applications you talked about, primarily Unix of course being in that

17:44.580 --> 17:45.580
technical environment.

17:45.580 --> 17:49.780
Is HP working on new, broader applications that will run under Unix and take advantage

17:49.780 --> 17:50.780
of these?

17:50.780 --> 17:56.060
We're working on applications and other third party developers are working on applications.

17:56.060 --> 18:01.500
With a user interface like this, more users will have access to the power of a Unix workstation

18:01.500 --> 18:05.340
and therefore I think we'll find workstations in more environments such as maybe office

18:05.340 --> 18:06.340
environments.

18:06.860 --> 18:07.860
Janet, thank you very much.

18:07.860 --> 18:12.980
In just a minute, we'll take a look at the new Macintosh 2CX and see the Macintosh implementation

18:12.980 --> 18:13.980
of Unix.

18:13.980 --> 18:14.980
AUX, stay with us.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.580
With us in the studio now is Bill Jacobs.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.380
Bill is product line manager with Apple.

18:31.380 --> 18:35.140
Next to Bill, Carrie Christian, author and research associate at the Rockefeller University

18:35.140 --> 18:36.140
in New York.

18:36.260 --> 18:39.860
Problems with Unix in the past has been all these different versions, homegrown versions

18:39.860 --> 18:41.100
and so forth.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.180
And then there becomes problems with things like the libraries and so forth.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.980
Being able to pass one program to another Unix system.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.860
Now, is there any standardization that has been taking place now recently?

18:50.860 --> 18:52.700
Well, there's quite a bit of standardization.

18:52.700 --> 18:57.500
In fact, there's really too much of it because the system is broken into two separate camps.

18:57.500 --> 19:02.780
And we have on one side an alliance between AT&T which is the originator of Unix with

19:02.820 --> 19:06.700
Sun, which is one of the major technical innovators in this area.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.940
Which was the open look version we saw at the beginning of the show.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.100
That's right.

19:10.100 --> 19:16.020
And on the other side, there's a fairly large group of companies that have, are not pleased

19:16.020 --> 19:17.020
with this.

19:17.020 --> 19:21.140
They're afraid of the power going to these two companies to their detriment.

19:21.140 --> 19:25.740
And they formed another alliance called the Open Software Foundation, OSF.

19:25.740 --> 19:29.460
And in that group, you have IBM plus a number of the other very major players in this business.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.500
And that was the motif we just saw on the HP machine.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.260
What about next step on the next machine?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.100
That's yet a third version, isn't it?

19:36.100 --> 19:39.940
Well, it uses a product called Mach, which is a variant of Unix.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.980
It's different enough from Unix that you would probably classify it as in a somewhat different

19:43.980 --> 19:44.980
category.

19:44.980 --> 19:49.260
Now, Bill, you have a, this is the first machine we've actually seen on the table.

19:49.260 --> 19:52.420
Well, it's a Mac 2X, and we really haven't seen that on the show yet.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.460
So maybe you can just run us, take a, give us a look inside the box there.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.460
Okay.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.780
The product we have here is the new Macintosh 2CX.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.780
It is fundamentally.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.100
Obviously, a lot smaller than the two.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.980
Fundamentally, the same electrical product in terms of capabilities as the Macintosh

20:07.980 --> 20:13.740
2X, except that by reducing the number of slots, we've greatly reduced the cost and

20:13.740 --> 20:15.100
thus the price of the machine.

20:15.100 --> 20:20.220
It is a much more clean internal design, much more easy to install things like hard disks

20:20.220 --> 20:22.740
which simply snap in place and the cable connects.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.820
Even the power supply, there's no screws holding it in.

20:24.820 --> 20:26.940
It's held in by plastic snap bosses.

20:26.980 --> 20:32.580
So, what we've done is not only reduce the price of the system through fixing some of

20:32.580 --> 20:36.420
the RAM problems that the whole industry suffered under, but also by building the machine,

20:36.420 --> 20:38.100
more simply, reduce its price.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.060
Does that sacrifice anything in terms of performance for?

20:41.060 --> 20:42.060
No.

20:42.060 --> 20:46.500
This is, in terms of performance, is exactly the same as the Macintosh 2CX and those.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
Two X, you mean.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
This is the two CX.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
This is the two CX.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.580
I'm sorry.

20:50.580 --> 20:54.780
Same performance as the Macintosh 2X, which is 10 to 20 percent greater than the Macintosh

20:54.780 --> 20:55.780
2 was.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.300
So what is AUX, you call it?

20:58.300 --> 21:02.140
Yes, Apple's Unix product is AUX.

21:02.140 --> 21:03.140
So can you give us a demo?

21:03.140 --> 21:04.140
Sure.

21:04.140 --> 21:07.020
What we're going to demo here is something you've seen variants of already today, so

21:07.020 --> 21:08.620
I'll not belabor the point.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.420
This is a particular application called Magic.

21:11.420 --> 21:17.580
It is a higher education product for designing integrated circuits and represents, fundamentally,

21:17.580 --> 21:21.580
one of the key uses of Unix today, and that is for technical professionals to do the types

21:21.580 --> 21:23.940
of work they're involved in.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.580
This is based on an X11.3 implementation.

21:26.580 --> 21:33.460
We mentioned X Windows is the underlying standard on which OpenLook and Motif both be based.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.780
This is a currently available product.

21:34.780 --> 21:38.380
We just introduced it and started shipping it a couple of weeks ago.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.340
Full X11.3 runs on multiple screens.

21:41.340 --> 21:42.420
What's the relationship here now?

21:42.420 --> 21:47.740
You're running Unix, AUX, but how's the relationship between the Mac operating system and Unix?

21:47.740 --> 21:48.740
What's going on inside?

21:48.740 --> 21:49.740
Okay.

21:49.740 --> 21:50.740
I'm going to show you that.

21:50.740 --> 21:57.300
What I'll just do here is exit the X11 implementation and go show you the other side of the fence

21:57.300 --> 22:04.460
for us here by exiting, or I guess you have to put the mouse in the box before that works.

22:04.460 --> 22:09.060
The X11 implementation runs on the machine and to exit that and then begin running Macintosh

22:09.060 --> 22:12.300
applications as you see about 10 seconds.

22:12.300 --> 22:16.660
We're now at a Unix terminal shell window as most Unix users are fairly comfortable with.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.460
I've loaded up a set of applications here.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.940
The important point about what I'm going to show you is these applications are not Unix

22:22.940 --> 22:23.940
applications.

22:23.940 --> 22:27.340
The first one I should probably show is MacDraw 2.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.340
This is a Claris product.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.100
So you got the screen there?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.100
Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:31.100 --> 22:36.580
In order to run Claris MacDraw 2 on an AUX system, you simply go down to Egghead Software

22:36.580 --> 22:40.700
and you buy the version of MacDraw 2 that you buy for your Macintosh Plus, your Macintosh

22:40.700 --> 22:41.940
GSC.

22:41.940 --> 22:46.180
From that, you move the files for the product off the floppy onto the Unix hard disk and

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
then run them there.

22:47.380 --> 22:49.900
Here's an example.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.500
While you're doing that, Bill, what's the advantage of doing that, running it under

22:52.500 --> 22:54.660
Unix instead of just under the Macintosh?

22:54.660 --> 22:57.980
The crucial advantage is that the end user gets to run both the applications that he

22:57.980 --> 23:03.140
knows and loves from the Unix world and the personal productivity software of the Macintosh.

23:03.140 --> 23:06.820
We studied very carefully the technical user's world and what he does day to day and he spends

23:06.820 --> 23:11.420
about 70 to 80 percent of his time doing, writing, drawing, presenting.

23:11.420 --> 23:14.500
So even though he's a Unix techie, he has all these other things to do.

23:14.540 --> 23:20.340
So we're now basically in a Macintosh application and have all the user interface of the Macintosh

23:20.340 --> 23:21.740
at our fingertips.

23:21.740 --> 23:24.980
Let's open just a file here.

23:24.980 --> 23:25.980
This is under MacDraw.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.780
These are MacDraw 2 files.

23:27.780 --> 23:31.260
This is some art that was created by an artist for some purpose and illustrates what you

23:31.260 --> 23:32.580
can do in MacDraw.

23:32.580 --> 23:37.740
The key point is you can now do it on a Unix system from a $300 application instead of

23:37.740 --> 23:38.740
a $2,000 application.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.180
You only have about a half a minute left, Karen.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.420
I want to ask you to kind of summarize from the user's point of view we've seen just in

23:43.420 --> 23:46.220
this half hour, you know, four different approaches to using Unix.

23:46.220 --> 23:50.220
What's a user to do here in terms of trying to get involved in the benefits of Unix?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.380
Well there are a couple of things.

23:51.380 --> 23:55.420
One is that most Unix systems are not being used in environments where there are no computers

23:55.420 --> 23:56.420
already.

23:56.420 --> 23:57.420
So you have to think about what you have.

23:57.420 --> 24:01.740
If you've got a shop that's been using Apple products, people are familiar with the Mac.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.420
AUX is a natural.

24:03.420 --> 24:06.500
On the same side, if you've got a company where it's coming in from the technical side,

24:06.500 --> 24:12.260
they may be familiar with many technical drafting applications like you'd have on a Sun system.

24:12.260 --> 24:15.780
Sun or HP or companies like that are also a natural.

24:15.780 --> 24:19.940
If people have heavy involvement in PCs, they've been using PC software.

24:19.940 --> 24:25.380
Things like Xenix and VPIX are able to run the PC software in the way that AUX can run

24:25.380 --> 24:26.380
Mac software.

24:26.380 --> 24:30.300
So I think for most users, you need to go with the alliances that you're already familiar

24:30.300 --> 24:32.220
with, go with some of these vendors.

24:32.220 --> 24:39.100
The other thing is to keep track of the numbers as best you can because in this war of OSF,

24:39.100 --> 24:45.500
AT&T, it's going to be determined by software vendors who gets the most applications on

24:45.500 --> 24:47.140
their product.

24:47.140 --> 24:52.340
And so if you look at the numbers six months from year, a year from now, you should be

24:52.340 --> 24:56.860
able to tell which of these two products is who's really winning in the marketplace.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.460
And that's going to determine it.

24:58.460 --> 24:59.660
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

24:59.660 --> 25:00.660
That's our look at Unix.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.180
We'll be back with this week's computer news in just a moment.

25:09.220 --> 25:18.820
In the Random Access file this week, many new product announcements tied to the just

25:18.820 --> 25:21.900
completed Spring Comdex show in Chicago.

25:21.900 --> 25:26.820
Intel stole most of the headlines with its new 8486 chip containing more than a million

25:26.820 --> 25:27.820
transistors.

25:27.820 --> 25:34.020
The Intel 486 now goes head to head with the new Motorola 68040 chip for the next generation

25:34.020 --> 25:35.500
of personal computers.

25:35.500 --> 25:40.300
However, analysts say it will likely be several years before software is written to take advantage

25:40.300 --> 25:42.500
of the new faster chips.

25:42.500 --> 25:47.300
Several vendors including Tandy, Grid and Dell introduced new PCs based on the Intel

25:47.300 --> 25:53.100
386SX chip, which is a 32-bit chip using a 16-bit data path.

25:53.100 --> 25:58.660
And compact Olivetti and Acer showed off new 33MHz 386 machines.

25:58.660 --> 26:02.700
Sharp became the first to actually demonstrate a color LCD laptop.

26:02.700 --> 26:08.660
The PC-8000 is a 386 machine with a 14-inch color screen supporting VGA.

26:08.660 --> 26:12.900
Sharp said their technology was different from the active Matrix LCDs used in miniature

26:12.900 --> 26:14.340
television sets.

26:14.340 --> 26:19.580
Sharp said the color laptop would be available by the end of the year for under $10,000.

26:19.580 --> 26:23.140
Toshiba showed off its new 4Mbit DRAM chips.

26:23.140 --> 26:29.780
The new chips make it possible to put as much as 14 megs inside a Toshiba T5200 laptop.

26:29.780 --> 26:33.500
In traveling software announced an upgrade of its Laplink program.

26:33.500 --> 26:38.100
The new version is called Laplink 3, and it will clone itself onto another computer so

26:38.100 --> 26:42.900
that if you have two different disk formats and only one copy of Laplink, you can still

26:42.900 --> 26:47.960
transfer files by first cloning the Laplink software onto another machine.

26:47.960 --> 26:53.740
In other news this week, Motorola announced a 50MHz version of its 6803O chip.

26:53.740 --> 26:56.500
That's the fastest clock speed in the industry.

26:56.500 --> 27:00.740
Commodore has released a new Angus graphics chip for the Amiga that solves the memory

27:00.740 --> 27:03.860
limitation problems with the current graphics chip.

27:03.860 --> 27:08.860
The new Angus chip lets you use up to a megabyte of memory just for graphics.

27:08.860 --> 27:14.460
A company called MacMotion has used HyperCard to program a new 9-axis robot system.

27:14.460 --> 27:19.340
The company says HyperCard has enabled programming costs to be cut so dramatically that the cost

27:19.340 --> 27:23.420
of the robot system may be reduced by a factor of 10.

27:23.420 --> 27:28.980
No semiconductor says it's building chips for the national security agency that self-destruct.

27:28.980 --> 27:33.220
Designed presumably for use by spies, the chips come apart if someone tries to open

27:33.220 --> 27:34.740
up the machine.

27:34.740 --> 27:39.740
Finally, Stanford University is conducting the first ever totally computerized election.

27:39.740 --> 27:43.580
The election is only for student government, but state and county election officials are

27:43.580 --> 27:44.900
watching the results.

27:44.900 --> 27:50.020
The Stanford system is using 70 Macintosh computers as voting stations, with special software

27:50.020 --> 27:52.060
written by a Stanford sophomore.

27:52.060 --> 27:56.660
The designers say the benefits are not only instant results, but fewer wasted ballots

27:56.660 --> 28:00.820
since the software is smart enough not to let the voter do something which would invalidate

28:00.820 --> 28:02.060
the ballot.

28:02.060 --> 28:06.460
There is a paper and pencil backup system for the total computer phobe who has never

28:06.460 --> 28:07.900
touched a mouse.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.460
That's it for this week's Random Access.

28:09.460 --> 28:14.140
I'm Maria Gabriel for the Computer Chronicles.

28:14.140 --> 28:20.420
The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,

28:20.420 --> 28:23.540
and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.

28:23.540 --> 28:29.420
In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information

28:29.420 --> 28:33.740
on new hardware, software, and technologies.

28:33.740 --> 28:40.100
