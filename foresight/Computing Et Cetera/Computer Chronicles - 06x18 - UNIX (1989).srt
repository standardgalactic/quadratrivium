1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
This is what I was thinking in the middle of the IOHR lecture is that the

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:36,760
These are the offices of Frame Technology in San Jose, California.

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,700
They have Macintosh computers here, sunwork stations, PC compatibles, but the common thread

4
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,800
that ties all their systems together is Unix.

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,860
All of a sudden, Unix is hot.

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,800
A nasty old operating system that used to be considered too difficult for most people

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,040
to use is slowly emerging as an operating system of choice, as users discover its power

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,700
and as vendors start to peddle it under a friendlier user interface.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,500
Today we take a look at the rebirth of Unix on this edition of the Computer Chronicles.

10
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:32,640
The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw-Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,740
and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.

12
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,620
In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,980
on new hardware, software, and technologies.

14
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,780
Welcome to the Computer Chronicles, I'm Stuart Schiffay, and this is Gary Kildall.

15
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,100
Gary, this is Rick Davis of Frame Technology Corporation, and Rick is using what is unquestionably

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,020
the most talked about new computer of the year, the next computer from Steve Jobs.

17
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,060
Lots of interesting features we could point out about the next, but I want to focus on

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,540
the fact that it runs under Unix.

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,380
Unix has been around 18 years or more, but primarily in the university community, the

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,500
techie community, all of a sudden everyone is interested in Unix.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Why?

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,660
Well, Stuart, as you know, the traditional problem with Unix and PCs is that Unix really

23
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,420
requires a lot of computing power, a lot of central memory, a lot of backup storage,

24
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,580
of high performance processor, and we just haven't had that in PCs.

25
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,200
Now we start to see the workstations come into the high-end PC market and the demand

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,860
for multitasking, multi-user systems.

27
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,060
Unix is written in C, gives us portability, relative portability across a lot of different

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,540
platforms like the Next, the Sun Apollo, and so forth.

29
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,980
Now we're also seeing standards evolve like object file formats, graphic standards, windowing

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,340
standards, and so forth.

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,860
It makes really Unix very viable in the high-end PC market.

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,620
We're going to take a look at the power of Unix in its traditional workstation environment.

33
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,880
We'll see some of these new graphic user interfaces, and we'll take a look at the implementation

34
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,180
of one version of Unix on the Macintosh.

35
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,100
We begin with a background look at the evolution of Unix, and for that report we go to the

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,740
University of California at Berkeley.

37
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,220
It began its life at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, won the endorsement of AT&T, and was

38
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,140
adopted by universities around the country who appreciated its portability and its multitasking

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,660
talents.

40
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,420
It is Unix, an operating system with so many variants you need a family tree to trace its

41
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,980
origins.

42
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,580
One of the earliest centers of Unix development is the University of California at Berkeley,

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,100
responsible for one of the main branches of Unix called BSD for Berkeley Software Distribution.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,020
Well, Berkeley got a fairly early version of Unix from Bell Labs and started writing

45
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,140
additional programs for it, started adding things.

46
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,420
When a larger version of many computers came out, Berkeley added a number of new features

47
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,620
to the system that took advantage of the new computer.

48
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,580
And we did software the way people wanted the software here.

49
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,980
As a result, there were a number of other universities and research labs that were interested

50
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,380
in the same thing.

51
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,300
The Unix operating system has special appeal to programmers because of its many programming

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,860
tools.

53
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Unix is also multitasking, so several applications can be running simultaneously.

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,700
It is particularly suited to multi-user environments, and it offers structured programming, a way

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,780
to divide problems into smaller parcels.

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,500
On the other hand, the consequence of such diverse streams of development has been a

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,860
lack of standards.

58
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,860
To combine the best elements of those diverse strands is the latest challenge facing Unix.

59
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,500
In general, the standards have been picking and choosing among the different features

60
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,380
of different versions.

61
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,060
And as a result, the standard versions will be not like any existing version, they'll

62
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,220
be someplace in the middle.

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,460
For example, a number of programs have options, and the standards will specify a smaller number

64
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,700
of options than those will all be the same on every version.

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:14,460
Joining us in the studio now is Karen Losarty, Karen is product manager with Sun Microsystems.

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Gary?

67
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,780
Karen, Unix has had sort of a bad reputation in the past for a number of items like reliability

68
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,980
and the lack of a good user interface and so forth.

69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,100
How has that changed with Unix in the last few years?

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,380
Well, Unix has gained a lot of momentum in the last several years, and there's recent

71
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
resistance for that.

72
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,580
As you know, it's a very powerful operating system, and it supports multitasking so that

73
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,140
you can do more than one function at a time.

74
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,060
It also runs on a variety of hardware platforms, and many vendors in the industry do support

75
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Unix today.

76
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,100
One of the most key things about Unix is that it supports a lot of hardware that run over

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,220
networks, very, very large networks.

78
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,580
What about the reliability issues?

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
Is that a problem anymore with Unix?

80
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,900
Not that we're finding at this time.

81
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
And how about the interface issue that Karen mentioned also?

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Well, yes.

83
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
That has been an issue.

84
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,220
As you know, in universities today, a lot of developers learn Unix, they write C applications

85
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,460
and so forth, and they move out into the industry and write applications.

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,580
So there's a lot of support from the developers, and users find it hostile, and many of them

87
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,180
have been very, very, very afraid of it.

88
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,100
And this is one of the things you addressed with the open look.

89
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Correct.

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,980
Now, Karen, before we get into the demo, could you describe basically what kind of hardware

91
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
we're dealing with here?

92
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Yes.

93
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,060
This is a 386i, Sun 386i, and it provides you the ability to run both DOS and Unix.

94
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,060
It's on the same screen.

95
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,340
So you could open a window and run a DOS application, and another window, run a Unix application.

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,180
And what would the approximate cost of a piece of hardware like this cost, if you're

97
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
running?

98
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Under $5,000.

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Okay.

100
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
Okay, let's take a look at what you got here.

101
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,420
This is a rather familiar looking interface, in fact, tell us about open look.

102
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Okay.

103
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,780
Open look is a graphical user interface that was designed by Sun and AT&T in a joint

104
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
development effort.

105
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,060
We also licensed technology from Xerox Corporation.

106
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,340
What I've done today is brought four applications that have actually implemented the open look

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
specification.

108
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,740
The open look is not a software product.

109
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,700
It's actually consists of two books.

110
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,020
It's a style guide for the developer on how to design an application and a specification

111
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,740
for the toolkit designer.

112
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,980
Okay, show us on the screen actually how you would use it.

113
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,540
So these are four applications.

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,660
We have here SunRite, which is what you see is what you get editor, SunPaint, which is

115
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,100
a paint application or what we call a raster application.

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,420
And this one is SunDraw, which is an object editor or a draw application.

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,740
This is a file manager.

118
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,020
This is critical.

119
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,340
This one allows you to see graphically the UNIX file system right on the machine.

120
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,780
As you know, most users that worked with UNIX and users today, raw commands on a command

121
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
line to get at their files.

122
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,260
It was all by memory.

123
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,740
This is one of the most integral parts of open look.

124
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay, show us how you'd use it now and get into one of these applications.

125
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,540
What we'll do is, first of all, what I'd like to show you is, as you see on this area right

126
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,220
here is a control area, and each one of these windows has one.

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,020
Notice that on there is buttons.

128
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,460
All these buttons have common labels, and as you can see, each one has file, view, edit.

129
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:10,060
What's remarkable about that is each application you go into, the learning curve goes way down.

130
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,380
So for example, if I wanted to close this window, I simply click on the window mark,

131
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,020
and it becomes an icon on the desktop.

132
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,740
Same thing again here, and you can put them away on your desktop and rearrange them again

133
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
any way you wish.

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Can you open up the paint box, for example, and let's take a look at, or do something.

135
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Yes, I'm very interested in saying that.

136
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,260
This is the kind of interface that most users are familiar with by now.

137
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Correct.

138
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
I mean, it's nothing new here.

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
You're in fact trying to make it comfortable with stuff that already exists.

140
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Yes.

141
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,940
Some of the things, though, that are very nice about open look, though, is I can preview

142
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
my operations.

143
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,740
For example, on the file, it says open or save.

144
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,300
On view, it can be a canvas that brings up the appropriate window.

145
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:55,620
On edit, you can actually pin up a menu, and you can move that to any location that you

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
wish.

147
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,980
What is beneficial for the user is that I do not have to go back up to the control area

148
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,700
to access the buttons all the time.

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,340
It's minimum mouse movement, which you don't have on other user interfaces.

150
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,820
Once I pull the pin, it goes away.

151
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,700
Same thing for each of the windows here.

152
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,980
Pull the pin, it disappears.

153
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Now, if we wanted to actually use this application, I can bring this up, select whichever one

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,220
I want to work with.

155
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,500
I can easily move it out of my way, because I might want to do some other things, and

156
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,300
draw right into the window.

157
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,300
At any time, I can also change the brush pattern, select any one of these, again, tell it to

158
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,020
go away, and change it.

159
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,180
Everything's very intuitive, very, very friendly.

160
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,980
One of the most important things, though, that I found working with the interface is

161
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,980
that other interfaces don't utilize is, with the file manager, you can actually use something

162
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,140
called drag and drop.

163
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,860
If you wanted to actually load a file into the window, all I have to do is grab the icon,

164
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,620
position it over the window, and it actually loads that file into the window automatically.

165
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,940
Now, if the entire file is not showing on the screen, and we'll just put this one to

166
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,100
the back, I can actually use the scroll bars at any time to manipulate the window to see

167
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,900
the rest of the file.

168
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,620
If I stretch the window with what we call the resize corners, in any one of the four

169
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,940
corners, then the actual scroll bars, if they're not needed, will go away.

170
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,660
In this case, not all of the file is still on the screen, so they're resident.

171
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,980
Are there a lot of applications being written out for OpenLook?

172
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Yes.

173
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,620
Actually, we have over 1,500 applications that are being converted to support OpenLook,

174
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,940
and what's real exciting is the applications that you see here today are shipping.

175
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,500
This is not vaporware, they're available.

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,260
We also have had early developers kits that our developers are taking, then they're actually

177
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
working and designing applications today.

178
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,700
Just returning very quickly, the price, I'm very amazed at the $5,000 price tag, it seems

179
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
to be.

180
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,340
Well, we have a vast array of workstations that Sun offers, and you can start at a very

181
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,380
low end and go very, very expensive.

182
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
This would not have certainly been the $5,000 one.

183
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,380
Correct.

184
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,500
Karen, thank you very much for joining us.

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,100
We're familiar with Unix, of course, under many names and under many versions, and one

186
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,380
of the popular versions of Unix is called SCO Xenix, developed by a company called the

187
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,800
Santa Cruz operation.

188
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,220
We have a report from Wendy Woods.

189
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,620
Open Desktop is the latest attempt to sell Unix to mainstream corporate America.

190
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,500
Open Desktop combines Xenix, Santa Cruz operations, form of Unix, which runs on PCs, with other

191
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,540
industry standard tools, and a graphical user interface called Motif.

192
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,260
It's all designed to offer a palatable form of Unix for general consumption.

193
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,180
These open system offerings have never before been available in this kind of a platform,

194
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,060
this widely available, pre-integrated, ready to go, and that's really the value added of

195
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,500
Open Desktop.

196
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,700
It's not a new product piece in itself, but it's the collection and standardization of

197
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,780
all the open system standards that are available today.

198
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,540
With Open Desktop, Windows display various applications running either on one's own PC

199
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,860
or on a mainframe.

200
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,220
Files are shared seamlessly between hardware platforms.

201
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,580
The power of the 80386 is tapped.

202
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,020
The Open Desktop environment is expected to be complete by September, and SCO's track

203
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,580
record of success has attracted some big players to participate in the project, among them

204
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,100
Deck and Tandy.

205
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,700
Santa Cruz operation has doubled its sales for each of the last 10 years, and has gone

206
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,980
from having just a few to now over 800 employees.

207
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,820
But perhaps the biggest measure of its success comes from Giant Microsoft Corporation, which

208
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,020
has just purchased nearly 20% of the company.

209
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,580
In Santa Cruz, California, for the Computer Chronicles, I'm Wendy Woods.

210
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,940
Joining us in the studio now is Janet Dobbs.

211
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,980
Janet's a product manager with Hewlett Packard.

212
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,100
Janet, before we get into the motif he has in her face, I'm Hewlett Packard.

213
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,380
I know it's on the screen here, way in the background, there's a little bit of Unix there,

214
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,940
it's like a directory.

215
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,740
And so we all know that the Unix is underlying this whole user interface, which of course

216
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,940
is different from Unix.

217
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,700
It's a different piece of software.

218
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,220
Why does Unix provide a good base for your product?

219
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,140
Unix is a powerful operating system in that it allows for large amounts of memory and

220
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:49,740
large programs, which are used in technical environments, factory floors, large databases.

221
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:56,780
It's powerful, it's fast, it's unfriendly, so it's been very successful in more technical

222
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
environments.

223
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,340
That's why the user interface is in front of it.

224
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,620
Okay now could you tell us, like we had in the last segment, what are we working with

225
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
here in terms of hardware?

226
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,460
There's obviously some equipment on the floor here.

227
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,180
This is an HP360, it has a 68030 Motorola processor in it, it's running about 33 megahertz.

228
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,180
And what's cost to this configuration?

229
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:24,540
Series 300 workstations range from about 5000 up to 60 to 70,000, and a configuration like

230
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,220
this goes from 10 to 15,000.

231
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,340
Tell us about Motif now and the interface, in particular how is your approach different

232
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,660
from what we just saw before in OpenLook?

233
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,980
OSF Motif is a combination of technologies from both DEC and HP.

234
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,100
If you notice on the screen the 3D borders around the windows, it's an enhanced look

235
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,940
of the graphical user interface common in the PC environment from Microsoft, both Microsoft

236
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,100
Windows and Presentation Manager.

237
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:01,700
So it takes advantage of the large installed base in the PC market and all the work that's

238
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,140
been done in graphical user interfaces there.

239
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,860
Is that the major difference, the graphic look, we see it looks quite different or functionally

240
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,020
is it really the same basic idea?

241
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,060
The behavior is based on that found in the PC market.

242
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,860
So a user that has been familiar with working with PCs can walk up to a Unix workstation

243
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,900
and not be concerned that it's OS2 or Unix or whatever, what they see on the screen is

244
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,180
what they're used to seeing and they know how to open applications, move around in them.

245
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,380
Did you do that for us and show us how you actually use Motif?

246
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,140
For example if I want to move a window and say I'm a PC user I know that I put the mouse

247
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,340
pointer on the title bar, click on that with the left button and I can move that window

248
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,620
around on the screen.

249
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,540
I know that I can go to the left upper corner, hold the left mouse button down and I get

250
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,580
a system menu which for each window contains things like restore, move, size.

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,580
If I want to iconify a window I click in the, there's a minimize and maximize button that

252
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,900
are found in presentation manager and on the left side it's minimize and I can click and

253
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I iconify that window and it moves into an icon.

254
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,700
I can bring a window to the foreground by clicking in that window.

255
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,380
The light source moves into the border so I can tell which window or which application

256
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,100
is active at that point.

257
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,300
By clicking in the upper right corner I can allow an application to maximize or take over

258
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,220
the display.

259
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,100
Can you access that sort of raw Unix window there and actually work inside it and go behind

260
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Motif?

261
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,620
I have a terminal window right here that I click in and make that window active and

262
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,500
at that point I can type in any of the commands in the Unix operating system.

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,020
What is the status of Motif for me, where is this as a product?

264
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,780
Motif will be available from OSF this summer, HP and Corvallis Oregon is under contract

265
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,380
with OSF to merge the deck and the HP tool kits and we'll be turning that over to OSF

266
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
in July.

267
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,380
That's an acronym for Open Systems Foundation.

268
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Can you tell us a little bit about that group?

269
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,500
The group was formed just about a year ago to ensure that software development environments

270
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,820
were open, available for input from different workstation vendors to ensure that there were

271
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,820
standards that would exist to help end users and software developers in creating programs.

272
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,700
Especially around Unix and AIX in particular.

273
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,580
And are there other applications you talked about, primarily Unix of course being in that

274
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,580
technical environment.

275
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,780
Is HP working on new, broader applications that will run under Unix and take advantage

276
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
of these?

277
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,060
We're working on applications and other third party developers are working on applications.

278
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,500
With a user interface like this, more users will have access to the power of a Unix workstation

279
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,340
and therefore I think we'll find workstations in more environments such as maybe office

280
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
environments.

281
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Janet, thank you very much.

282
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,980
In just a minute, we'll take a look at the new Macintosh 2CX and see the Macintosh implementation

283
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
of Unix.

284
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
AUX, stay with us.

285
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,580
With us in the studio now is Bill Jacobs.

286
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,380
Bill is product line manager with Apple.

287
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,140
Next to Bill, Carrie Christian, author and research associate at the Rockefeller University

288
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
in New York.

289
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,860
Problems with Unix in the past has been all these different versions, homegrown versions

290
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,100
and so forth.

291
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,180
And then there becomes problems with things like the libraries and so forth.

292
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,980
Being able to pass one program to another Unix system.

293
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,860
Now, is there any standardization that has been taking place now recently?

294
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,700
Well, there's quite a bit of standardization.

295
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,500
In fact, there's really too much of it because the system is broken into two separate camps.

296
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,780
And we have on one side an alliance between AT&T which is the originator of Unix with

297
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,700
Sun, which is one of the major technical innovators in this area.

298
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,940
Which was the open look version we saw at the beginning of the show.

299
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,100
That's right.

300
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:16,020
And on the other side, there's a fairly large group of companies that have, are not pleased

301
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
with this.

302
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,140
They're afraid of the power going to these two companies to their detriment.

303
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,740
And they formed another alliance called the Open Software Foundation, OSF.

304
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,460
And in that group, you have IBM plus a number of the other very major players in this business.

305
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,500
And that was the motif we just saw on the HP machine.

306
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,260
What about next step on the next machine?

307
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,100
That's yet a third version, isn't it?

308
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,940
Well, it uses a product called Mach, which is a variant of Unix.

309
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,980
It's different enough from Unix that you would probably classify it as in a somewhat different

310
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
category.

311
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,260
Now, Bill, you have a, this is the first machine we've actually seen on the table.

312
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,420
Well, it's a Mac 2X, and we really haven't seen that on the show yet.

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,460
So maybe you can just run us, take a, give us a look inside the box there.

314
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Okay.

315
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,780
The product we have here is the new Macintosh 2CX.

316
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
It is fundamentally.

317
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,100
Obviously, a lot smaller than the two.

318
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,980
Fundamentally, the same electrical product in terms of capabilities as the Macintosh

319
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,740
2X, except that by reducing the number of slots, we've greatly reduced the cost and

320
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,100
thus the price of the machine.

321
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,220
It is a much more clean internal design, much more easy to install things like hard disks

322
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,740
which simply snap in place and the cable connects.

323
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,820
Even the power supply, there's no screws holding it in.

324
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,940
It's held in by plastic snap bosses.

325
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,580
So, what we've done is not only reduce the price of the system through fixing some of

326
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,420
the RAM problems that the whole industry suffered under, but also by building the machine,

327
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,100
more simply, reduce its price.

328
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,060
Does that sacrifice anything in terms of performance for?

329
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
No.

330
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,500
This is, in terms of performance, is exactly the same as the Macintosh 2CX and those.

331
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Two X, you mean.

332
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
This is the two CX.

333
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
This is the two CX.

334
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,580
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,780
Same performance as the Macintosh 2X, which is 10 to 20 percent greater than the Macintosh

336
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
2 was.

337
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,300
So what is AUX, you call it?

338
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,140
Yes, Apple's Unix product is AUX.

339
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
So can you give us a demo?

340
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Sure.

341
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,020
What we're going to demo here is something you've seen variants of already today, so

342
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,620
I'll not belabor the point.

343
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,420
This is a particular application called Magic.

344
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,580
It is a higher education product for designing integrated circuits and represents, fundamentally,

345
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,580
one of the key uses of Unix today, and that is for technical professionals to do the types

346
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,940
of work they're involved in.

347
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,580
This is based on an X11.3 implementation.

348
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,460
We mentioned X Windows is the underlying standard on which OpenLook and Motif both be based.

349
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,780
This is a currently available product.

350
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,380
We just introduced it and started shipping it a couple of weeks ago.

351
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,340
Full X11.3 runs on multiple screens.

352
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,420
What's the relationship here now?

353
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,740
You're running Unix, AUX, but how's the relationship between the Mac operating system and Unix?

354
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
What's going on inside?

355
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Okay.

356
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm going to show you that.

357
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:57,300
What I'll just do here is exit the X11 implementation and go show you the other side of the fence

358
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:04,460
for us here by exiting, or I guess you have to put the mouse in the box before that works.

359
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,060
The X11 implementation runs on the machine and to exit that and then begin running Macintosh

360
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,300
applications as you see about 10 seconds.

361
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,660
We're now at a Unix terminal shell window as most Unix users are fairly comfortable with.

362
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,460
I've loaded up a set of applications here.

363
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,940
The important point about what I'm going to show you is these applications are not Unix

364
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
applications.

365
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,340
The first one I should probably show is MacDraw 2.

366
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
This is a Claris product.

367
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,100
So you got the screen there?

368
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Yeah, I'm sorry.

369
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,580
In order to run Claris MacDraw 2 on an AUX system, you simply go down to Egghead Software

370
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,700
and you buy the version of MacDraw 2 that you buy for your Macintosh Plus, your Macintosh

371
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,940
GSC.

372
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,180
From that, you move the files for the product off the floppy onto the Unix hard disk and

373
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
then run them there.

374
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,900
Here's an example.

375
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,500
While you're doing that, Bill, what's the advantage of doing that, running it under

376
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,660
Unix instead of just under the Macintosh?

377
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,980
The crucial advantage is that the end user gets to run both the applications that he

378
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,140
knows and loves from the Unix world and the personal productivity software of the Macintosh.

379
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,820
We studied very carefully the technical user's world and what he does day to day and he spends

380
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,420
about 70 to 80 percent of his time doing, writing, drawing, presenting.

381
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,500
So even though he's a Unix techie, he has all these other things to do.

382
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,340
So we're now basically in a Macintosh application and have all the user interface of the Macintosh

383
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,740
at our fingertips.

384
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,980
Let's open just a file here.

385
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
This is under MacDraw.

386
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
These are MacDraw 2 files.

387
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,260
This is some art that was created by an artist for some purpose and illustrates what you

388
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,580
can do in MacDraw.

389
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,740
The key point is you can now do it on a Unix system from a $300 application instead of

390
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
a $2,000 application.

391
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,180
You only have about a half a minute left, Karen.

392
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,420
I want to ask you to kind of summarize from the user's point of view we've seen just in

393
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,220
this half hour, you know, four different approaches to using Unix.

394
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,220
What's a user to do here in terms of trying to get involved in the benefits of Unix?

395
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,380
Well there are a couple of things.

396
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,420
One is that most Unix systems are not being used in environments where there are no computers

397
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
already.

398
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
So you have to think about what you have.

399
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,740
If you've got a shop that's been using Apple products, people are familiar with the Mac.

400
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,420
AUX is a natural.

401
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,500
On the same side, if you've got a company where it's coming in from the technical side,

402
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,260
they may be familiar with many technical drafting applications like you'd have on a Sun system.

403
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,780
Sun or HP or companies like that are also a natural.

404
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,940
If people have heavy involvement in PCs, they've been using PC software.

405
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,380
Things like Xenix and VPIX are able to run the PC software in the way that AUX can run

406
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
Mac software.

407
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,300
So I think for most users, you need to go with the alliances that you're already familiar

408
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,220
with, go with some of these vendors.

409
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,100
The other thing is to keep track of the numbers as best you can because in this war of OSF,

410
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,500
AT&T, it's going to be determined by software vendors who gets the most applications on

411
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,140
their product.

412
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,340
And so if you look at the numbers six months from year, a year from now, you should be

413
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,860
able to tell which of these two products is who's really winning in the marketplace.

414
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,460
And that's going to determine it.

415
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,660
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

416
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,660
That's our look at Unix.

417
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,180
We'll be back with this week's computer news in just a moment.

418
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:18,820
In the Random Access file this week, many new product announcements tied to the just

419
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,900
completed Spring Comdex show in Chicago.

420
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,820
Intel stole most of the headlines with its new 8486 chip containing more than a million

421
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
transistors.

422
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,020
The Intel 486 now goes head to head with the new Motorola 68040 chip for the next generation

423
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,500
of personal computers.

424
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,300
However, analysts say it will likely be several years before software is written to take advantage

425
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,500
of the new faster chips.

426
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,300
Several vendors including Tandy, Grid and Dell introduced new PCs based on the Intel

427
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,100
386SX chip, which is a 32-bit chip using a 16-bit data path.

428
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,660
And compact Olivetti and Acer showed off new 33MHz 386 machines.

429
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,700
Sharp became the first to actually demonstrate a color LCD laptop.

430
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,660
The PC-8000 is a 386 machine with a 14-inch color screen supporting VGA.

431
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,900
Sharp said their technology was different from the active Matrix LCDs used in miniature

432
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,340
television sets.

433
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,580
Sharp said the color laptop would be available by the end of the year for under $10,000.

434
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,140
Toshiba showed off its new 4Mbit DRAM chips.

435
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,780
The new chips make it possible to put as much as 14 megs inside a Toshiba T5200 laptop.

436
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,500
In traveling software announced an upgrade of its Laplink program.

437
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,100
The new version is called Laplink 3, and it will clone itself onto another computer so

438
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,900
that if you have two different disk formats and only one copy of Laplink, you can still

439
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,960
transfer files by first cloning the Laplink software onto another machine.

440
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,740
In other news this week, Motorola announced a 50MHz version of its 6803O chip.

441
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,500
That's the fastest clock speed in the industry.

442
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,740
Commodore has released a new Angus graphics chip for the Amiga that solves the memory

443
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,860
limitation problems with the current graphics chip.

444
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,860
The new Angus chip lets you use up to a megabyte of memory just for graphics.

445
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,460
A company called MacMotion has used HyperCard to program a new 9-axis robot system.

446
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,340
The company says HyperCard has enabled programming costs to be cut so dramatically that the cost

447
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,420
of the robot system may be reduced by a factor of 10.

448
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,980
No semiconductor says it's building chips for the national security agency that self-destruct.

449
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,220
Designed presumably for use by spies, the chips come apart if someone tries to open

450
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,740
up the machine.

451
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Finally, Stanford University is conducting the first ever totally computerized election.

452
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,580
The election is only for student government, but state and county election officials are

453
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,900
watching the results.

454
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,020
The Stanford system is using 70 Macintosh computers as voting stations, with special software

455
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,060
written by a Stanford sophomore.

456
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,660
The designers say the benefits are not only instant results, but fewer wasted ballots

457
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,820
since the software is smart enough not to let the voter do something which would invalidate

458
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,060
the ballot.

459
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,460
There is a paper and pencil backup system for the total computer phobe who has never

460
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,900
touched a mouse.

461
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,460
That's it for this week's Random Access.

462
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,140
I'm Maria Gabriel for the Computer Chronicles.

463
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,420
The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,

464
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,540
and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.

465
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:29,420
In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information

466
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,740
on new hardware, software, and technologies.

467
