0	19720	This is what I was thinking in the middle of the IOHR lecture is that the
19720	36760	These are the offices of Frame Technology in San Jose, California.
36760	41700	They have Macintosh computers here, sunwork stations, PC compatibles, but the common thread
41700	44800	that ties all their systems together is Unix.
44800	46860	All of a sudden, Unix is hot.
46860	50800	A nasty old operating system that used to be considered too difficult for most people
50800	56040	to use is slowly emerging as an operating system of choice, as users discover its power
56040	59700	and as vendors start to peddle it under a friendlier user interface.
59700	64500	Today we take a look at the rebirth of Unix on this edition of the Computer Chronicles.
76860	92640	The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw-Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,
92640	95740	and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.
95740	101620	In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information
101620	108980	on new hardware, software, and technologies.
108980	112780	Welcome to the Computer Chronicles, I'm Stuart Schiffay, and this is Gary Kildall.
112780	117100	Gary, this is Rick Davis of Frame Technology Corporation, and Rick is using what is unquestionably
117100	121020	the most talked about new computer of the year, the next computer from Steve Jobs.
121020	124060	Lots of interesting features we could point out about the next, but I want to focus on
124060	125540	the fact that it runs under Unix.
125540	129380	Unix has been around 18 years or more, but primarily in the university community, the
129380	132500	techie community, all of a sudden everyone is interested in Unix.
132500	133500	Why?
133500	136660	Well, Stuart, as you know, the traditional problem with Unix and PCs is that Unix really
136660	141420	requires a lot of computing power, a lot of central memory, a lot of backup storage,
141420	144580	of high performance processor, and we just haven't had that in PCs.
144580	148200	Now we start to see the workstations come into the high-end PC market and the demand
148200	150860	for multitasking, multi-user systems.
150860	155060	Unix is written in C, gives us portability, relative portability across a lot of different
155060	157540	platforms like the Next, the Sun Apollo, and so forth.
157820	161980	Now we're also seeing standards evolve like object file formats, graphic standards, windowing
161980	163340	standards, and so forth.
163340	166860	It makes really Unix very viable in the high-end PC market.
166860	170620	We're going to take a look at the power of Unix in its traditional workstation environment.
170620	174880	We'll see some of these new graphic user interfaces, and we'll take a look at the implementation
174880	177180	of one version of Unix on the Macintosh.
177180	181100	We begin with a background look at the evolution of Unix, and for that report we go to the
181100	185740	University of California at Berkeley.
185780	192220	It began its life at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, won the endorsement of AT&T, and was
192220	198140	adopted by universities around the country who appreciated its portability and its multitasking
198140	199660	talents.
199660	205420	It is Unix, an operating system with so many variants you need a family tree to trace its
205420	206980	origins.
206980	212580	One of the earliest centers of Unix development is the University of California at Berkeley,
212620	219100	responsible for one of the main branches of Unix called BSD for Berkeley Software Distribution.
219100	224020	Well, Berkeley got a fairly early version of Unix from Bell Labs and started writing
224020	227140	additional programs for it, started adding things.
227140	231420	When a larger version of many computers came out, Berkeley added a number of new features
231420	234620	to the system that took advantage of the new computer.
234620	238580	And we did software the way people wanted the software here.
238580	241980	As a result, there were a number of other universities and research labs that were interested
241980	243380	in the same thing.
243380	248300	The Unix operating system has special appeal to programmers because of its many programming
248300	249860	tools.
249860	255860	Unix is also multitasking, so several applications can be running simultaneously.
255860	261700	It is particularly suited to multi-user environments, and it offers structured programming, a way
261700	265780	to divide problems into smaller parcels.
265780	270500	On the other hand, the consequence of such diverse streams of development has been a
270500	272860	lack of standards.
272860	277860	To combine the best elements of those diverse strands is the latest challenge facing Unix.
277860	281500	In general, the standards have been picking and choosing among the different features
281500	283380	of different versions.
283380	287060	And as a result, the standard versions will be not like any existing version, they'll
287060	289220	be someplace in the middle.
289220	294460	For example, a number of programs have options, and the standards will specify a smaller number
294460	297700	of options than those will all be the same on every version.
300500	314460	Joining us in the studio now is Karen Losarty, Karen is product manager with Sun Microsystems.
314460	315460	Gary?
315460	320780	Karen, Unix has had sort of a bad reputation in the past for a number of items like reliability
320780	323980	and the lack of a good user interface and so forth.
323980	326100	How has that changed with Unix in the last few years?
326100	330380	Well, Unix has gained a lot of momentum in the last several years, and there's recent
330420	331420	resistance for that.
331420	335580	As you know, it's a very powerful operating system, and it supports multitasking so that
335580	338140	you can do more than one function at a time.
338140	343060	It also runs on a variety of hardware platforms, and many vendors in the industry do support
343060	344060	Unix today.
344060	350100	One of the most key things about Unix is that it supports a lot of hardware that run over
350100	352220	networks, very, very large networks.
352220	353580	What about the reliability issues?
353580	355700	Is that a problem anymore with Unix?
355700	356900	Not that we're finding at this time.
356900	359100	And how about the interface issue that Karen mentioned also?
359100	360100	Well, yes.
360100	361100	That has been an issue.
361100	366220	As you know, in universities today, a lot of developers learn Unix, they write C applications
366220	369460	and so forth, and they move out into the industry and write applications.
369460	374580	So there's a lot of support from the developers, and users find it hostile, and many of them
374580	376180	have been very, very, very afraid of it.
376180	378100	And this is one of the things you addressed with the open look.
378100	379100	Correct.
379100	381980	Now, Karen, before we get into the demo, could you describe basically what kind of hardware
381980	382980	we're dealing with here?
382980	383980	Yes.
383980	389060	This is a 386i, Sun 386i, and it provides you the ability to run both DOS and Unix.
389060	390060	It's on the same screen.
390060	394340	So you could open a window and run a DOS application, and another window, run a Unix application.
394340	397180	And what would the approximate cost of a piece of hardware like this cost, if you're
397180	398180	running?
398180	399180	Under $5,000.
399180	400180	Okay.
400180	401180	Okay, let's take a look at what you got here.
401180	404420	This is a rather familiar looking interface, in fact, tell us about open look.
404420	405420	Okay.
405420	408780	Open look is a graphical user interface that was designed by Sun and AT&T in a joint
408780	409780	development effort.
409780	413060	We also licensed technology from Xerox Corporation.
413060	417340	What I've done today is brought four applications that have actually implemented the open look
417340	418340	specification.
418340	420740	The open look is not a software product.
420740	422700	It's actually consists of two books.
422700	427020	It's a style guide for the developer on how to design an application and a specification
427020	428740	for the toolkit designer.
428740	430980	Okay, show us on the screen actually how you would use it.
430980	432540	So these are four applications.
432540	437660	We have here SunRite, which is what you see is what you get editor, SunPaint, which is
437660	443100	a paint application or what we call a raster application.
443100	446420	And this one is SunDraw, which is an object editor or a draw application.
446420	447740	This is a file manager.
447740	449020	This is critical.
449020	455340	This one allows you to see graphically the UNIX file system right on the machine.
455340	460780	As you know, most users that worked with UNIX and users today, raw commands on a command
460780	461780	line to get at their files.
461780	463260	It was all by memory.
463260	465740	This is one of the most integral parts of open look.
465740	468060	Okay, show us how you'd use it now and get into one of these applications.
468060	473540	What we'll do is, first of all, what I'd like to show you is, as you see on this area right
473540	477220	here is a control area, and each one of these windows has one.
477220	479020	Notice that on there is buttons.
479020	484460	All these buttons have common labels, and as you can see, each one has file, view, edit.
484460	490060	What's remarkable about that is each application you go into, the learning curve goes way down.
490060	497380	So for example, if I wanted to close this window, I simply click on the window mark,
497380	500020	and it becomes an icon on the desktop.
500020	504740	Same thing again here, and you can put them away on your desktop and rearrange them again
504740	505740	any way you wish.
505740	508740	Can you open up the paint box, for example, and let's take a look at, or do something.
508740	509740	Yes, I'm very interested in saying that.
509740	512260	This is the kind of interface that most users are familiar with by now.
512260	513260	Correct.
513260	514260	I mean, it's nothing new here.
514260	515260	You're in fact trying to make it comfortable with stuff that already exists.
515260	516260	Yes.
516260	518940	Some of the things, though, that are very nice about open look, though, is I can preview
518940	519940	my operations.
519940	522740	For example, on the file, it says open or save.
522740	527300	On view, it can be a canvas that brings up the appropriate window.
527300	535620	On edit, you can actually pin up a menu, and you can move that to any location that you
536500	537500	wish.
537500	540980	What is beneficial for the user is that I do not have to go back up to the control area
540980	542700	to access the buttons all the time.
542700	547340	It's minimum mouse movement, which you don't have on other user interfaces.
547340	549820	Once I pull the pin, it goes away.
549820	551700	Same thing for each of the windows here.
551700	552980	Pull the pin, it disappears.
552980	561980	Now, if we wanted to actually use this application, I can bring this up, select whichever one
561980	563220	I want to work with.
563220	567500	I can easily move it out of my way, because I might want to do some other things, and
567500	570300	draw right into the window.
570300	577300	At any time, I can also change the brush pattern, select any one of these, again, tell it to
577300	580020	go away, and change it.
580020	583180	Everything's very intuitive, very, very friendly.
583180	587980	One of the most important things, though, that I found working with the interface is
587980	592980	that other interfaces don't utilize is, with the file manager, you can actually use something
593020	595140	called drag and drop.
595140	599860	If you wanted to actually load a file into the window, all I have to do is grab the icon,
599860	606620	position it over the window, and it actually loads that file into the window automatically.
606620	612940	Now, if the entire file is not showing on the screen, and we'll just put this one to
612940	619100	the back, I can actually use the scroll bars at any time to manipulate the window to see
619100	620900	the rest of the file.
620900	625620	If I stretch the window with what we call the resize corners, in any one of the four
625620	630940	corners, then the actual scroll bars, if they're not needed, will go away.
630940	634660	In this case, not all of the file is still on the screen, so they're resident.
634660	637980	Are there a lot of applications being written out for OpenLook?
637980	638980	Yes.
638980	643620	Actually, we have over 1,500 applications that are being converted to support OpenLook,
643620	647940	and what's real exciting is the applications that you see here today are shipping.
647940	650500	This is not vaporware, they're available.
650500	655260	We also have had early developers kits that our developers are taking, then they're actually
655260	657260	working and designing applications today.
657260	661700	Just returning very quickly, the price, I'm very amazed at the $5,000 price tag, it seems
661700	662700	to be.
662700	666340	Well, we have a vast array of workstations that Sun offers, and you can start at a very
666340	668380	low end and go very, very expensive.
668380	670380	This would not have certainly been the $5,000 one.
670380	671380	Correct.
671380	673500	Karen, thank you very much for joining us.
673500	677100	We're familiar with Unix, of course, under many names and under many versions, and one
677100	681380	of the popular versions of Unix is called SCO Xenix, developed by a company called the
681380	682800	Santa Cruz operation.
682800	687220	We have a report from Wendy Woods.
687220	692620	Open Desktop is the latest attempt to sell Unix to mainstream corporate America.
692620	699500	Open Desktop combines Xenix, Santa Cruz operations, form of Unix, which runs on PCs, with other
699500	705540	industry standard tools, and a graphical user interface called Motif.
705540	710260	It's all designed to offer a palatable form of Unix for general consumption.
710260	716180	These open system offerings have never before been available in this kind of a platform,
716180	721060	this widely available, pre-integrated, ready to go, and that's really the value added of
721060	722500	Open Desktop.
722500	727700	It's not a new product piece in itself, but it's the collection and standardization of
727700	731780	all the open system standards that are available today.
731780	737540	With Open Desktop, Windows display various applications running either on one's own PC
737540	739860	or on a mainframe.
739860	743220	Files are shared seamlessly between hardware platforms.
743220	746580	The power of the 80386 is tapped.
746580	752020	The Open Desktop environment is expected to be complete by September, and SCO's track
752020	757580	record of success has attracted some big players to participate in the project, among them
757580	759100	Deck and Tandy.
759100	764700	Santa Cruz operation has doubled its sales for each of the last 10 years, and has gone
764700	768980	from having just a few to now over 800 employees.
768980	773820	But perhaps the biggest measure of its success comes from Giant Microsoft Corporation, which
773820	778020	has just purchased nearly 20% of the company.
778020	781580	In Santa Cruz, California, for the Computer Chronicles, I'm Wendy Woods.
789100	794940	Joining us in the studio now is Janet Dobbs.
794940	796980	Janet's a product manager with Hewlett Packard.
796980	801100	Janet, before we get into the motif he has in her face, I'm Hewlett Packard.
801100	804380	I know it's on the screen here, way in the background, there's a little bit of Unix there,
804380	805940	it's like a directory.
805940	809740	And so we all know that the Unix is underlying this whole user interface, which of course
809740	810940	is different from Unix.
810940	813700	It's a different piece of software.
813700	817220	Why does Unix provide a good base for your product?
817580	822140	Unix is a powerful operating system in that it allows for large amounts of memory and
822140	829740	large programs, which are used in technical environments, factory floors, large databases.
829740	836780	It's powerful, it's fast, it's unfriendly, so it's been very successful in more technical
836780	837780	environments.
837780	840340	That's why the user interface is in front of it.
840340	843620	Okay now could you tell us, like we had in the last segment, what are we working with
843620	844620	here in terms of hardware?
844620	846460	There's obviously some equipment on the floor here.
846700	854180	This is an HP360, it has a 68030 Motorola processor in it, it's running about 33 megahertz.
854180	857180	And what's cost to this configuration?
857180	864540	Series 300 workstations range from about 5000 up to 60 to 70,000, and a configuration like
864540	866220	this goes from 10 to 15,000.
866220	870340	Tell us about Motif now and the interface, in particular how is your approach different
870340	872660	from what we just saw before in OpenLook?
872860	877980	OSF Motif is a combination of technologies from both DEC and HP.
877980	885100	If you notice on the screen the 3D borders around the windows, it's an enhanced look
885100	890940	of the graphical user interface common in the PC environment from Microsoft, both Microsoft
890940	893100	Windows and Presentation Manager.
893100	901700	So it takes advantage of the large installed base in the PC market and all the work that's
901740	904140	been done in graphical user interfaces there.
904140	907860	Is that the major difference, the graphic look, we see it looks quite different or functionally
907860	910020	is it really the same basic idea?
910020	913060	The behavior is based on that found in the PC market.
913060	917860	So a user that has been familiar with working with PCs can walk up to a Unix workstation
917860	922900	and not be concerned that it's OS2 or Unix or whatever, what they see on the screen is
922900	928180	what they're used to seeing and they know how to open applications, move around in them.
928180	932380	Did you do that for us and show us how you actually use Motif?
932380	938140	For example if I want to move a window and say I'm a PC user I know that I put the mouse
938140	943340	pointer on the title bar, click on that with the left button and I can move that window
943340	945620	around on the screen.
945620	951540	I know that I can go to the left upper corner, hold the left mouse button down and I get
951580	956580	a system menu which for each window contains things like restore, move, size.
956580	963580	If I want to iconify a window I click in the, there's a minimize and maximize button that
965220	971900	are found in presentation manager and on the left side it's minimize and I can click and
971900	978900	I iconify that window and it moves into an icon.
979900	984700	I can bring a window to the foreground by clicking in that window.
984700	989380	The light source moves into the border so I can tell which window or which application
989380	992100	is active at that point.
992100	997300	By clicking in the upper right corner I can allow an application to maximize or take over
997300	999220	the display.
999220	1004100	Can you access that sort of raw Unix window there and actually work inside it and go behind
1004100	1005100	Motif?
1005100	1010620	I have a terminal window right here that I click in and make that window active and
1010620	1015500	at that point I can type in any of the commands in the Unix operating system.
1015500	1019020	What is the status of Motif for me, where is this as a product?
1019020	1024780	Motif will be available from OSF this summer, HP and Corvallis Oregon is under contract
1024780	1030380	with OSF to merge the deck and the HP tool kits and we'll be turning that over to OSF
1030380	1031380	in July.
1032380	1037380	That's an acronym for Open Systems Foundation.
1037380	1040380	Can you tell us a little bit about that group?
1040380	1046500	The group was formed just about a year ago to ensure that software development environments
1046500	1052820	were open, available for input from different workstation vendors to ensure that there were
1052820	1057820	standards that would exist to help end users and software developers in creating programs.
1057820	1061700	Especially around Unix and AIX in particular.
1061700	1064580	And are there other applications you talked about, primarily Unix of course being in that
1064580	1065580	technical environment.
1065580	1069780	Is HP working on new, broader applications that will run under Unix and take advantage
1069780	1070780	of these?
1070780	1076060	We're working on applications and other third party developers are working on applications.
1076060	1081500	With a user interface like this, more users will have access to the power of a Unix workstation
1081500	1085340	and therefore I think we'll find workstations in more environments such as maybe office
1085340	1086340	environments.
1086860	1087860	Janet, thank you very much.
1087860	1092980	In just a minute, we'll take a look at the new Macintosh 2CX and see the Macintosh implementation
1092980	1093980	of Unix.
1093980	1094980	AUX, stay with us.
1107540	1109580	With us in the studio now is Bill Jacobs.
1109580	1111380	Bill is product line manager with Apple.
1111380	1115140	Next to Bill, Carrie Christian, author and research associate at the Rockefeller University
1115140	1116140	in New York.
1116260	1119860	Problems with Unix in the past has been all these different versions, homegrown versions
1119860	1121100	and so forth.
1121100	1124180	And then there becomes problems with things like the libraries and so forth.
1124180	1126980	Being able to pass one program to another Unix system.
1126980	1130860	Now, is there any standardization that has been taking place now recently?
1130860	1132700	Well, there's quite a bit of standardization.
1132700	1137500	In fact, there's really too much of it because the system is broken into two separate camps.
1137500	1142780	And we have on one side an alliance between AT&T which is the originator of Unix with
1142820	1146700	Sun, which is one of the major technical innovators in this area.
1146700	1148940	Which was the open look version we saw at the beginning of the show.
1148940	1150100	That's right.
1150100	1156020	And on the other side, there's a fairly large group of companies that have, are not pleased
1156020	1157020	with this.
1157020	1161140	They're afraid of the power going to these two companies to their detriment.
1161140	1165740	And they formed another alliance called the Open Software Foundation, OSF.
1165740	1169460	And in that group, you have IBM plus a number of the other very major players in this business.
1169460	1172500	And that was the motif we just saw on the HP machine.
1172500	1174260	What about next step on the next machine?
1174260	1176100	That's yet a third version, isn't it?
1176100	1179940	Well, it uses a product called Mach, which is a variant of Unix.
1179940	1183980	It's different enough from Unix that you would probably classify it as in a somewhat different
1183980	1184980	category.
1184980	1189260	Now, Bill, you have a, this is the first machine we've actually seen on the table.
1189260	1192420	Well, it's a Mac 2X, and we really haven't seen that on the show yet.
1192420	1195460	So maybe you can just run us, take a, give us a look inside the box there.
1195460	1196460	Okay.
1196460	1198780	The product we have here is the new Macintosh 2CX.
1198780	1199780	It is fundamentally.
1199780	1203100	Obviously, a lot smaller than the two.
1203100	1207980	Fundamentally, the same electrical product in terms of capabilities as the Macintosh
1207980	1213740	2X, except that by reducing the number of slots, we've greatly reduced the cost and
1213740	1215100	thus the price of the machine.
1215100	1220220	It is a much more clean internal design, much more easy to install things like hard disks
1220220	1222740	which simply snap in place and the cable connects.
1222740	1224820	Even the power supply, there's no screws holding it in.
1224820	1226940	It's held in by plastic snap bosses.
1226980	1232580	So, what we've done is not only reduce the price of the system through fixing some of
1232580	1236420	the RAM problems that the whole industry suffered under, but also by building the machine,
1236420	1238100	more simply, reduce its price.
1238100	1241060	Does that sacrifice anything in terms of performance for?
1241060	1242060	No.
1242060	1246500	This is, in terms of performance, is exactly the same as the Macintosh 2CX and those.
1246500	1247500	Two X, you mean.
1247500	1248500	This is the two CX.
1248500	1249500	This is the two CX.
1249500	1250580	I'm sorry.
1250580	1254780	Same performance as the Macintosh 2X, which is 10 to 20 percent greater than the Macintosh
1254780	1255780	2 was.
1256620	1258300	So what is AUX, you call it?
1258300	1262140	Yes, Apple's Unix product is AUX.
1262140	1263140	So can you give us a demo?
1263140	1264140	Sure.
1264140	1267020	What we're going to demo here is something you've seen variants of already today, so
1267020	1268620	I'll not belabor the point.
1268620	1271420	This is a particular application called Magic.
1271420	1277580	It is a higher education product for designing integrated circuits and represents, fundamentally,
1277580	1281580	one of the key uses of Unix today, and that is for technical professionals to do the types
1281580	1283940	of work they're involved in.
1283940	1286580	This is based on an X11.3 implementation.
1286580	1293460	We mentioned X Windows is the underlying standard on which OpenLook and Motif both be based.
1293460	1294780	This is a currently available product.
1294780	1298380	We just introduced it and started shipping it a couple of weeks ago.
1298380	1301340	Full X11.3 runs on multiple screens.
1301340	1302420	What's the relationship here now?
1302420	1307740	You're running Unix, AUX, but how's the relationship between the Mac operating system and Unix?
1307740	1308740	What's going on inside?
1308740	1309740	Okay.
1309740	1310740	I'm going to show you that.
1310740	1317300	What I'll just do here is exit the X11 implementation and go show you the other side of the fence
1317300	1324460	for us here by exiting, or I guess you have to put the mouse in the box before that works.
1324460	1329060	The X11 implementation runs on the machine and to exit that and then begin running Macintosh
1329060	1332300	applications as you see about 10 seconds.
1332300	1336660	We're now at a Unix terminal shell window as most Unix users are fairly comfortable with.
1336660	1339460	I've loaded up a set of applications here.
1339460	1342940	The important point about what I'm going to show you is these applications are not Unix
1342940	1343940	applications.
1343940	1347340	The first one I should probably show is MacDraw 2.
1347340	1348340	This is a Claris product.
1348340	1350100	So you got the screen there?
1350100	1351100	Yeah, I'm sorry.
1351100	1356580	In order to run Claris MacDraw 2 on an AUX system, you simply go down to Egghead Software
1356580	1360700	and you buy the version of MacDraw 2 that you buy for your Macintosh Plus, your Macintosh
1360700	1361940	GSC.
1361940	1366180	From that, you move the files for the product off the floppy onto the Unix hard disk and
1366180	1367180	then run them there.
1367380	1369900	Here's an example.
1369900	1372500	While you're doing that, Bill, what's the advantage of doing that, running it under
1372500	1374660	Unix instead of just under the Macintosh?
1374660	1377980	The crucial advantage is that the end user gets to run both the applications that he
1377980	1383140	knows and loves from the Unix world and the personal productivity software of the Macintosh.
1383140	1386820	We studied very carefully the technical user's world and what he does day to day and he spends
1386820	1391420	about 70 to 80 percent of his time doing, writing, drawing, presenting.
1391420	1394500	So even though he's a Unix techie, he has all these other things to do.
1394540	1400340	So we're now basically in a Macintosh application and have all the user interface of the Macintosh
1400340	1401740	at our fingertips.
1401740	1404980	Let's open just a file here.
1404980	1405980	This is under MacDraw.
1405980	1407780	These are MacDraw 2 files.
1407780	1411260	This is some art that was created by an artist for some purpose and illustrates what you
1411260	1412580	can do in MacDraw.
1412580	1417740	The key point is you can now do it on a Unix system from a $300 application instead of
1417740	1418740	a $2,000 application.
1418740	1420180	You only have about a half a minute left, Karen.
1420180	1423420	I want to ask you to kind of summarize from the user's point of view we've seen just in
1423420	1426220	this half hour, you know, four different approaches to using Unix.
1426220	1430220	What's a user to do here in terms of trying to get involved in the benefits of Unix?
1430220	1431380	Well there are a couple of things.
1431380	1435420	One is that most Unix systems are not being used in environments where there are no computers
1435420	1436420	already.
1436420	1437420	So you have to think about what you have.
1437420	1441740	If you've got a shop that's been using Apple products, people are familiar with the Mac.
1441740	1443420	AUX is a natural.
1443420	1446500	On the same side, if you've got a company where it's coming in from the technical side,
1446500	1452260	they may be familiar with many technical drafting applications like you'd have on a Sun system.
1452260	1455780	Sun or HP or companies like that are also a natural.
1455780	1459940	If people have heavy involvement in PCs, they've been using PC software.
1459940	1465380	Things like Xenix and VPIX are able to run the PC software in the way that AUX can run
1465380	1466380	Mac software.
1466380	1470300	So I think for most users, you need to go with the alliances that you're already familiar
1470300	1472220	with, go with some of these vendors.
1472220	1479100	The other thing is to keep track of the numbers as best you can because in this war of OSF,
1479100	1485500	AT&T, it's going to be determined by software vendors who gets the most applications on
1485500	1487140	their product.
1487140	1492340	And so if you look at the numbers six months from year, a year from now, you should be
1492340	1496860	able to tell which of these two products is who's really winning in the marketplace.
1496860	1498460	And that's going to determine it.
1498460	1499660	Gentlemen, thank you very much.
1499660	1500660	That's our look at Unix.
1500660	1503180	We'll be back with this week's computer news in just a moment.
1509220	1518820	In the Random Access file this week, many new product announcements tied to the just
1518820	1521900	completed Spring Comdex show in Chicago.
1521900	1526820	Intel stole most of the headlines with its new 8486 chip containing more than a million
1526820	1527820	transistors.
1527820	1534020	The Intel 486 now goes head to head with the new Motorola 68040 chip for the next generation
1534020	1535500	of personal computers.
1535500	1540300	However, analysts say it will likely be several years before software is written to take advantage
1540300	1542500	of the new faster chips.
1542500	1547300	Several vendors including Tandy, Grid and Dell introduced new PCs based on the Intel
1547300	1553100	386SX chip, which is a 32-bit chip using a 16-bit data path.
1553100	1558660	And compact Olivetti and Acer showed off new 33MHz 386 machines.
1558660	1562700	Sharp became the first to actually demonstrate a color LCD laptop.
1562700	1568660	The PC-8000 is a 386 machine with a 14-inch color screen supporting VGA.
1568660	1572900	Sharp said their technology was different from the active Matrix LCDs used in miniature
1572900	1574340	television sets.
1574340	1579580	Sharp said the color laptop would be available by the end of the year for under $10,000.
1579580	1583140	Toshiba showed off its new 4Mbit DRAM chips.
1583140	1589780	The new chips make it possible to put as much as 14 megs inside a Toshiba T5200 laptop.
1589780	1593500	In traveling software announced an upgrade of its Laplink program.
1593500	1598100	The new version is called Laplink 3, and it will clone itself onto another computer so
1598100	1602900	that if you have two different disk formats and only one copy of Laplink, you can still
1602900	1607960	transfer files by first cloning the Laplink software onto another machine.
1607960	1613740	In other news this week, Motorola announced a 50MHz version of its 6803O chip.
1613740	1616500	That's the fastest clock speed in the industry.
1616500	1620740	Commodore has released a new Angus graphics chip for the Amiga that solves the memory
1620740	1623860	limitation problems with the current graphics chip.
1623860	1628860	The new Angus chip lets you use up to a megabyte of memory just for graphics.
1628860	1634460	A company called MacMotion has used HyperCard to program a new 9-axis robot system.
1634460	1639340	The company says HyperCard has enabled programming costs to be cut so dramatically that the cost
1639340	1643420	of the robot system may be reduced by a factor of 10.
1643420	1648980	No semiconductor says it's building chips for the national security agency that self-destruct.
1648980	1653220	Designed presumably for use by spies, the chips come apart if someone tries to open
1653220	1654740	up the machine.
1654740	1659740	Finally, Stanford University is conducting the first ever totally computerized election.
1659740	1663580	The election is only for student government, but state and county election officials are
1663580	1664900	watching the results.
1664900	1670020	The Stanford system is using 70 Macintosh computers as voting stations, with special software
1670020	1672060	written by a Stanford sophomore.
1672060	1676660	The designers say the benefits are not only instant results, but fewer wasted ballots
1676660	1680820	since the software is smart enough not to let the voter do something which would invalidate
1680820	1682060	the ballot.
1682060	1686460	There is a paper and pencil backup system for the total computer phobe who has never
1686460	1687900	touched a mouse.
1687900	1689460	That's it for this week's Random Access.
1689460	1694140	I'm Maria Gabriel for the Computer Chronicles.
1694140	1700420	The Computer Chronicles is made possible in part by McGraw Hill, publishers of Byte Magazine,
1700420	1703540	and VIX, the Byte Information Exchange.
1703540	1709420	In print and online, Byte and VIX serve computer professionals worldwide with detailed information
1709420	1713740	on new hardware, software, and technologies.
