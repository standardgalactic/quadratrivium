Checking Burns & McDonnell/The End of the World Is Just the Beginning.txt
1. **General Election and Independents**: The discussion touched on the idea that independent voters, who often switch sides from one election to another, were dissatisfied with President Biden's economic policies according to exit polling. Despite their discontent, many still voted for Democratic candidates in the midterms, indicating a potential trend of voting against their own economic interests for other reasons, such as ensuring their ability to vote in off-year elections.

2. **Trump's Support and the GOP**: It was noted that former President Trump is likely to lose most states in the 2024 presidential election but could still carry about a dozen. The Republican Party, particularly its moderate faction known as Rhinos, will have to decide whether to wait out the current trend or move in a different direction within the next two years.

3. **China and Germany's Future**: Regarding China, the discussion was grim, with predictions of a potential collapse due to over-reliance on energy and food production inputs. Such a collapse could result in a neo-Maoist tyranny, especially in the northern provinces where most of the population resides, and possible warlord factions emerging. The southern coastal cities might integrate with foreign powers to secure necessities like food and energy.

Germany's decline is expected to be more organized due to its efficient nature, with individual sectors becoming non-competitive one after another. This process has already begun and is likely to continue, with the possibility of Germany gradually fading away unless a security crisis changes the trajectory.

The overall tone was one of historical perspective, noting that both China and Germany have faced multiple collapses and resurgences in their past, and drawing on those historical patterns to speculate on potential future scenarios.
