WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Okay, we're ready to get started with our afternoon agenda and I am really pleased to

00:15.000 --> 00:20.320
invite again to our best practice forum, Mr. Peter Zion.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.120
Peter is an incredibly unique individual for those of you that had the pleasure of experiencing

00:26.120 --> 00:30.080
his presentation last year in Colorado.

00:30.080 --> 00:37.000
We got a lot of great feedback on how he was able to pack the meaning of life, the beginning

00:37.000 --> 00:41.800
of the world, why paperclips cost what they do, and the world from A to Z and back again

00:41.800 --> 00:44.560
and doesn't in a concise manner that makes everybody want more.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.480
So we thought, hey, let's have him come out again this year and see what he's got in store

00:48.480 --> 00:49.480
for us.

00:49.480 --> 00:54.160
So really excited about it, hope you get as much from it this year as you did last year.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.280
For those of you who are new, I hope you do the same.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.160
So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome Peter Zion to the stage.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
Peter.

01:02.160 --> 01:13.760
Hey, everybody, you know, no one ever brings me in because they want to feel comfortable.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.560
So it's always a little odd when I'm back, but this is the industry that is the most

01:19.560 --> 01:22.040
notorious for being gluttonous for punishment.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.360
So let's just go ahead and jump right in.

01:25.360 --> 01:30.160
We're dealing with the end of a lot of things in the next five years.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.960
Here's the partial list.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.760
We're going to talk about the ones in the blue arrows, but this is basically my life

01:36.760 --> 01:39.040
these days.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.880
When you end a system, the globalized system, not everything makes it to the other side.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.040
Things look different.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.480
Some things do better, but everything changes.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.560
And the problem is that all of our business plans assume that we're going back to where

01:54.560 --> 01:59.320
we were five years ago, and that's not in the math.

01:59.320 --> 02:05.520
So my goal here today is to give you an idea, some spotlights on the things that definitely

02:05.520 --> 02:10.120
won't go back and how some other things are going to transform and maybe make your life

02:10.120 --> 02:11.920
a little bit easier.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.920
And we can come back to some of these in Q&A if I don't get to them.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.680
So anyway, let's start with the simplest conclusion here.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.200
If the product that you need comes on one of these, that's what's going away.

02:24.200 --> 02:30.840
Internationalized supply chains, Asia-heavy, trans-oceanic, trans-specific, anything that

02:30.840 --> 02:35.280
is on this, you have to question whether it's ever going to be delivered.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.000
We now are in a situation where transformers are 36 to 42 months out.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.920
Most of those are probably not going to arrive, and you need to plan accordingly.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.160
If it comes on one of these, you're probably okay.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.320
Roughly 80% of the trade between America and Mexico is on truck, and there's a number of

02:53.320 --> 02:58.240
reasons why that's not great from a logistical point of view, but just for identifying what's

02:58.240 --> 03:01.440
going to last.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.000
Everything in that category probably will.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
So there, that's the cheat version.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.640
You can go look at your supply chains and make your choices accordingly.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.200
Let's go ahead and jump into the rest of it though.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.200
I know you guys have seen, everyone here has seen me at least once, right?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
No.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
No?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
Well, okay.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.080
This is for you.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.040
This is a standard demographic profile.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.560
You got children at the bottom, young adults, mature adults, retirees at the top, men on

03:28.560 --> 03:32.400
one side, women on the other, mortality built into a pyramid.

03:32.400 --> 03:38.640
And when you have a pyramidal demographic like this, there's a few common characteristics.

03:38.640 --> 03:45.000
Number one, it's consumption driven because populations below age 40 consume a lot.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.720
They're raising kids, they're buying cars, they're building homes.

03:49.720 --> 03:55.120
That spending drives most modern systems, 70% in the case of the United States.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.880
But their workers don't have a lot of expertise, so the value add is pretty low.

04:00.880 --> 04:06.360
They have to import capital because most capital in a system comes from people over age 40.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.880
People who are the kids have left home and the house has been paid down.

04:09.880 --> 04:19.480
And so in a system like this, consumption driven, low investment, high imports, inflationary.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.360
This is Korea in the 50s at the dawn of the globalized era.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.680
Globalization meant that we could move off the farm and into towns to take industrial

04:27.680 --> 04:28.880
jobs.

04:28.880 --> 04:34.480
And when you do that, kids go from being free labor to an expense and adults aren't dumb,

04:34.480 --> 04:38.120
so two generations on, here's where the Koreans are now.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.480
Very different model.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.200
People age 40 to 65 have decades of work experience.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.920
They're capital rich.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.320
That pays for investment, that pays for the tax base.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.920
But there aren't a lot of young people to consume, so you get a more disinflationary

04:53.920 --> 05:00.800
economic model that has to export because there's not enough people locally to buy all the stuff.

05:00.800 --> 05:06.480
The whole world has gone down this Korean path at different speeds from different starting

05:06.480 --> 05:07.640
points.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.880
But the point is this capital rich environment that we become used to, this was always never

05:11.880 --> 05:14.440
more than a moment in time.

05:14.440 --> 05:20.640
And it ends this decade because everyone in the advanced world is aging out.

05:20.640 --> 05:26.400
And later this decade, the Koreans, the Germans, the Italians, the Russians, the Chinese will

05:26.400 --> 05:32.040
all age out of being investment rich and will be retirement heavy.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.840
And we have no idea what that looks like from an economic point of view.

05:34.840 --> 05:38.480
It's never happened in human history ever.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.840
Now in the United States, we're kind of in the middle.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.280
Largely because we have more elbow room.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.080
And this means that we're in a different situation from everybody else.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.800
But that still means some of the same lessons apply.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.760
So number one, the boomers are retiring, largest generation we've ever had, largest worker group

05:55.760 --> 06:00.040
we've ever had, largest investment base we've ever had.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.120
Half of them have already moved into retirement.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.480
The rest will over the next six years.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.520
And so we know capital costs have to go up.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.520
What we've seen so far, we're only about halfway.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.280
So capital costs have about tripled in the last three years.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.320
It's going to triple again.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.240
Plan for that.

06:19.240 --> 06:25.280
Second, largest generation ever, another way of saying largest workforce ever.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.280
And if you look at the kids at the bottom, the Zoomers, that's our smallest generation

06:29.280 --> 06:30.760
ever.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.040
It's simple math.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.760
Between the boomers leaving and the Zoomers coming in last year, we lost out of the workforce

06:35.760 --> 06:37.240
a half a million workers.

06:37.240 --> 06:41.280
It'll be about that same loss again, excuse me, this year.

06:41.280 --> 06:47.120
And that number will increase every year for the next 11 before the annual shortfall peaks

06:47.120 --> 06:52.240
at about 900,000 in roughly 2034.

06:52.240 --> 06:58.560
Then that number will start to shrink, but we don't expect it to start to grow again

06:58.560 --> 07:05.200
in terms of the labor force in large numbers until 2045.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.280
So higher, borrow, higher, borrow, higher, borrow.

07:09.280 --> 07:15.240
These are the cheapest capital costs and the cheapest labor costs we will have for at least

07:15.240 --> 07:16.240
a decade.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.440
And in some cases too.

07:19.320 --> 07:25.120
Third, the quality of the incoming labor is very different.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.040
Now the boomers have dominated everything for so long, we think of their examples as

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
normal.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
They're a social generation.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.440
Their kids, the millennials, are a social generation.

07:34.440 --> 07:39.520
The incoming ones, the Zoomers are not a social generation.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.920
They're a little pathological.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.040
And they are not group workers.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.160
They don't want to work anywhere where they're going to see us, another person or the sky.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.840
Which makes it hard for you guys to do what you're going to do.

07:53.840 --> 07:59.600
So again, labor is the cheapest and most familiar to you right now that it's going to be for

07:59.600 --> 08:01.280
the next 20 years.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.440
Hire everyone you can.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.240
And then finally there's technology.

08:06.240 --> 08:11.360
Technology as a sector requires two things.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.280
First of all, scads of people in their 20s and early 30s who have malleable minds who

08:16.280 --> 08:21.160
are social, who can work together, who can imagine the future and then build that into

08:21.160 --> 08:27.640
a prototype and operationalize it and bring it into mass manufacturing.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.800
That has been the millennials for the last 20 years.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.800
And they're aging out.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.520
The oldest millennials this year turn 44.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.640
We're starting to see the leading edge of their midlife crises.

08:40.640 --> 08:44.000
And it's delicious.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
But it also means that that younger block of social people just doesn't exist in the

08:49.000 --> 08:50.560
way it has in the past.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.120
And the second that you need for tech is capital.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.000
Because until you get to that mass manufacturer, there's no income.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.600
You have to pay for all of that up front and the money just isn't there anymore.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.600
So even if everything else goes perfectly smoothly, we know we're entering into a tech

09:04.600 --> 09:08.080
winter for at least the next 15 years.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.400
The pace of advancement is going to slow considerably.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.960
That assumes that it doesn't reverse.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.880
Here are the big four economies that we care about.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.720
The US is obviously the healthiest of the rich world.

09:19.720 --> 09:26.160
Mexico, notice how it goes down, hits a 30-year-old and then it goes straight down, pros and

09:26.160 --> 09:27.160
cons of that model.

09:27.160 --> 09:31.000
Basically, what you're seeing is Mexico was a latecomer to industrialization.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.600
They really didn't start the move from farm to city until after one in the 90s.

09:37.240 --> 09:42.040
If they keep aging at that rate in 50 years, we're going to have a very big problem.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.400
But in the meantime, when you've got a lot of people who are entering their 20s and 30s

09:45.400 --> 09:50.120
who don't have a lot of kids, it's a much more consumption-heavy pattern.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.800
And so Mexico became our largest trading partner last year.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.720
It is a role they will not give up on our lives.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.560
There may be some problems down the road in the 20s, 70s.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.480
We got time to figure that out, so do they.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.560
The Germans do not.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.520
The Germans are aging faster than the Koreans.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.760
This was always going to be their last decade as an industrial economy.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.120
It's not that they're running out of kids.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.080
That happened in the 80s.

10:16.080 --> 10:21.040
They're now running out of working-aged adults.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.680
If you get stuff from Germany, it's time to move on.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.920
And then there's the Chinese.

10:26.920 --> 10:33.600
This was already one of the fastest aging societies in the historical record.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.800
And two months ago, the Chinese updated the data.

10:36.800 --> 10:45.560
They've had a 70% drop in the birth rate since just 2017.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.440
That tells me two things.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.840
Number one, China will cease to be a coherent economic power, a coherent nation state this

10:54.840 --> 11:01.720
decade, and the Han ethnicity will probably vanish from the world this century.

11:01.720 --> 11:07.080
It could happen a lot faster, because the Shanghai Academy of Sciences, all the brainiacs

11:07.080 --> 11:10.800
who are responsible for interpreting the data, even the new data is wrong.

11:10.800 --> 11:15.320
We've overcounted the population by over 100 million people, and these yellow bars probably

11:15.320 --> 11:18.760
don't even exist.

11:18.760 --> 11:24.920
That has obviously a whole boatload of complications and consequences.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.920
Let's go through them.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.760
Let's start with consumption.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.520
This is vehicular miles traveled.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.280
They're down to 40% of their peak.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.160
Now, obviously, COVID is part of that.

11:36.160 --> 11:42.880
But in the six months since COVID lockdowns ended, they haven't picked up at all.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.880
Why?

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
Demographics.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.920
The people who are most likely to be mobile are people in their 20s.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.400
And we're now discovering that over the course of the last six years, they've run out.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.640
Or you can look at the purchasing power.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.160
Here's vehicle sales.

11:56.160 --> 12:00.480
Now whenever a country modernizes in the current age, everybody wants the same four things.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.880
They want a smartphone.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.200
They want a refrigerator.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.140
They want climate control, typically AC, and they want a car.

12:08.140 --> 12:11.600
The red line here is the 12-month moving average.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.920
You'll notice not only have they not recovered to pre-COVID levels, they peaked a year and

12:15.920 --> 12:19.320
a half before COVID.

12:19.320 --> 12:24.880
Now if you think back on the last five, six years, a lot of it has gone down.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.880
We've had the Trump administration, which was like living inside of a bullhorn.

12:28.880 --> 12:33.800
We had COVID, which scrambled all the data, even if everyone was being conscientious about

12:33.800 --> 12:37.120
it, which no one was.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.960
China has disappeared into a cult of personality.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.600
And the information that we normally would be able to assess either hasn't been there

12:43.600 --> 12:44.720
or has been overshadowed.

12:44.720 --> 12:49.000
But now that COVID's behind us and the Trump administration is behind us, we're getting

12:49.000 --> 12:51.960
a kind of a look under everybody's hood.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.880
And we're discovering in the last five, six years, we've hit a lot of turning points that

12:55.880 --> 12:58.360
we kind of missed.

12:58.360 --> 13:05.080
In the case of China, they now say that the Chinese population peaked last year.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.800
But as they're interpreting the data five years on, they're discovering actually that

13:09.800 --> 13:13.280
probably happened 12 years ago.

13:13.280 --> 13:19.520
They found out that the American population became younger than the average Chinese citizen

13:19.520 --> 13:21.440
probably four years ago.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.920
Turns out that was probably back in 2006.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.960
China has surpassed China to become the largest population this year.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.800
That probably happened in 2014.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.160
We're finally getting a kind of a clear look.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.080
And we've missed China's peak.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.520
And it's not that we're at a plateau, it's we're already on the backside of that mountain.

13:43.520 --> 13:48.320
And it's only going to accelerate because if you have a 70% drop in the birth rate,

13:48.320 --> 13:51.640
you are looking at national oblivion.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.520
Now, how do you get something like this to grow if there's no consumption?

13:55.520 --> 13:57.760
Well, you've got three types of economic growth.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.960
Your first one's consumption led.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
That's the United States.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.120
That's Mexico.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.680
The second one is export led.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
That's Germany.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
That's Korea.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.040
And the third one is investment led.

14:08.040 --> 14:12.720
You basically throw money to build infrastructure, to build industrial plant.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.240
And that activity of the expansion is what drives the system.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.640
And that has always been China's number one source of growth.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.880
Most of it is driven by debt.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.720
And this is a debt graphic.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.000
So the orange line, that's corporate, the gray line is government, and the blue is household.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.120
I need to put this all in perspective because this doesn't look very dramatic, does it?

14:32.120 --> 14:37.600
Well, number one, let's look at corporate because that's the biggest chunk.

14:37.600 --> 14:44.160
Back at the beginning of this data in 2006, that was already more debt in absolute terms,

14:44.160 --> 14:47.840
not relative, absolute terms than the entire American corporate world.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.520
And it then doubled.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.120
Second, this is in percent of GDP.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.760
So if the Chinese have been having 5% to 10% growth a year, that means the debt has been

14:57.760 --> 15:00.260
going up by 10% to 20% a year.

15:00.260 --> 15:03.240
So the absolute numbers are much bigger than this suggests.

15:03.240 --> 15:11.440
Third, the government debt, that's a bigger build than Trump.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.360
That's a bigger build than Obama.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.040
And it's all local debt.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.440
Say what you will about the federal government's debt program.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.440
Is it responsible?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.440
No.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.960
But they have the Fed to bail them out if they need to because ultimately federal debt

15:26.960 --> 15:31.440
is backed by the currency where the global currency, the Federal Reserve, can change

15:31.440 --> 15:34.160
the money supply with a click of a button.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.800
You can't do that if it's Chicago.

15:38.800 --> 15:46.960
And so they've added $10.5 trillion of local debt in 15 years, which is about three times

15:47.000 --> 15:50.440
what our total local debt exposure is.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.400
And then finally there's households.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.240
Now their household debt has now surpassed US household debt.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.360
But the crazy thing is, that's the good news.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.640
You guys been watching what's been happening with real estate in China lately?

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
Oh my god.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.600
Okay, so you know, ghost cities, we've all heard about them.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.400
The red circles are where no one lives in a ghost city.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.960
And the orange circles are where governments have moved in but no one has followed.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.760
Now, two things from this.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.560
Number one, most of the real estate was paid for with cash.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.560
It was not lent.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.240
It's owned outright.

16:29.240 --> 16:33.520
When you have an investment-led system that distorts the capital structure so much, people

16:33.520 --> 16:38.080
are desperate to find ways to preserve and grow their money.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.640
The Chinese government prevents people from sending money abroad, so they have to find

16:42.640 --> 16:47.040
something at home that usually go for real estate.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.120
So for your average Chinese citizen, over 85% of their savings is in some sort of real

16:51.120 --> 16:54.040
estate function.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.680
Here's the crazy part.

16:55.680 --> 17:01.400
The overbuild in subprime was 3 to 4% of the housing stock in the United States, and we

17:01.400 --> 17:03.920
know how that felt.

17:03.920 --> 17:09.440
The overbuild in China is 100% to 200%.

17:09.440 --> 17:18.920
They have enough spare condos to house somewhere between one and a half and three billion people.

17:18.920 --> 17:26.480
The market value of product in that sort of environment, it's probably 10% to 20% of what

17:26.480 --> 17:28.640
they paid for it.

17:28.640 --> 17:34.920
So when this goes down, it's not so much that it's a financial hit to the country.

17:34.920 --> 17:40.800
No, because it's not on the debt sheet, but it destroys the sum total of the population's

17:40.800 --> 17:43.440
life savings.

17:43.440 --> 17:50.440
So on top of everything else that the Chinese have going on, you're looking at 1.5 billion

17:50.440 --> 17:58.160
people who are probably going to be a little upset in the not-too-distant future.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.760
And that's assuming there's not a war, which there probably will be.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.320
This is an energy flow graphic.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.680
So the green bars on the left, those are net oil exports.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.360
The red on the right are net oil imports.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.800
You'll notice how conveniently close together they are.

18:11.800 --> 18:17.440
It's about a 5,500 to 7,000-mile sale from the Persian Gulf energy fields to the Northeast

18:17.440 --> 18:20.520
Asians based on where you start and where you stop.

18:20.520 --> 18:28.120
Now, this route is how everything is shipped right now, the coastal route.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.200
It's the short route.

18:31.200 --> 18:36.520
The Chinese have dozens of weapons systems that can interfere with that route.

18:36.520 --> 18:41.160
So if we get into a shooting war because of something with the Iranians or the Saudis

18:41.160 --> 18:44.600
or let's say Russian energy goes offline and prices go up, there's not enough left for

18:44.600 --> 18:50.200
everybody, you get a roving naval war between the Japanese and the Chinese, the tankers won't

18:50.200 --> 18:58.440
use that route, they'll take this longer route that avoids the Chinese coast.

18:58.440 --> 19:04.560
China has a big Navy, 600 ships, twice ours, but about two-thirds of those vessels would

19:04.560 --> 19:08.440
fit in this room.

19:08.440 --> 19:13.000
Not at the same time don't be dumb.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.960
The point is they don't have range.

19:15.960 --> 19:21.280
Only about 8 to 10% of those ships can sail more than 1,000 miles without a refuel.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.800
That 1,000-mile range assumes that they're going slow in a straight line to save fuel,

19:24.800 --> 19:27.840
not that they're like dodging missiles.

19:27.840 --> 19:32.080
The Chinese cannot project power, they can't control their own sea lanes, they are utterly

19:32.080 --> 19:36.680
dependent upon freedom of the seas in order to function.

19:36.680 --> 19:42.080
And so if we do get a shooting war, the energy stops, their entire transport system shuts

19:42.080 --> 19:47.520
down, the natural gas that they import in a liquid-fied form goes away, their chemical

19:47.520 --> 19:53.320
sector dies the next day, and China will disassociate within a year.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.400
And since they import 80% of the stuff they used to grow their own food, we also get a

19:57.400 --> 20:02.520
family that kills hundreds of millions of people within two years.

20:02.520 --> 20:09.080
Now, the Chinese government was well aware of this five years ago, but over the last

20:09.080 --> 20:16.800
five years, it stopped functioning as a government because Xi has purged the system so thoroughly

20:16.800 --> 20:22.720
of anyone who is even theoretically competent in order to prevent anyone from rising up

20:22.720 --> 20:26.080
from below to potentially challenge him or replace him.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.840
And in doing so, he has so terrified the bureaucracy at this point that no one will bring him

20:30.840 --> 20:33.480
information at all.

20:33.480 --> 20:38.920
As a result, the system is breaking down, and their ability to collect data, much less

20:38.920 --> 20:41.880
process it and publish it, has basically stopped.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.080
Now, some of these things are ego-driven.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.600
So for example, the Chinese just stopped collecting information on COVID because they didn't want

20:49.600 --> 20:52.720
everyone to know how many people died when they did their opening.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
We just don't know.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.280
We don't even have an educated guess, honestly.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.160
But some of this stuff really matters, youth unemployment.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.840
We don't know what the status of the next generation is.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.280
Patents, which supposedly you need for an information-based society.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.520
The information is no longer collected.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.020
Bond purchases.

21:10.020 --> 21:13.960
How the hell do you have a bond market if you don't know what's on offer and who is

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
buying what?

21:14.960 --> 21:19.240
That was supposedly how they were going to get away from an investment-led system to

21:19.240 --> 21:20.560
have a different debt market.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.240
That's gone.

21:22.240 --> 21:27.440
But the ones that scare me the most are more personal.

21:27.440 --> 21:35.200
Personal biographies, college dissertations, because that's how young people get a foot

21:35.200 --> 21:38.400
in the system and move up.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.680
And G's made sure that they can't so they can never challenge him.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.080
So it's just him.

21:45.080 --> 21:52.720
Now, my biggest criticism of Barack Obama is he believed he was the smartest person

21:52.720 --> 21:54.320
in the room and he would tell people that.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.400
His first meeting with the Joint Chief, you know, he got all the three and the four stars

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
in the room.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.800
He said, I'm smarter than all of you.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.760
I can do your jobs better than all of you.

22:02.760 --> 22:07.200
Let's assume for the moment that Barack Obama was correct.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.320
So you're going to do everyone's jobs here and your own.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.080
No, no, no.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.360
G has done that for the entire country.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.040
Decisions cannot be made without him.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.120
The reason he didn't show up to the G20 summit wasn't because he was mad at the Indians.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.760
Well, although he was.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.840
It's because he had to do it at home because he's the only one who can make decisions.

22:29.840 --> 22:34.720
And I think the best way to kind of explain how this is leading to a state collapse is

22:34.720 --> 22:37.880
that stupid balloon.

22:37.880 --> 22:42.880
Now, I'm not a balloon expert.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.000
It's just not in my field.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.320
And neither is the American president.

22:47.320 --> 22:51.040
But we had pretty much the same response when the thing crossed over from Canada.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.560
But I'm sure Canada's at fault for this somehow.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.640
It was like, shoot the thing down.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.640
Let's see what we're dealing with.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.800
I mean, the balloon was 350 feet across.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.480
It was dangling something the size of an Embraer jet was like 14 times the size of the plane

23:07.480 --> 23:14.160
that I flew on here yesterday, which was tiny unless it's dangling from a balloon.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.800
So I mean, obviously, it was a spy platform.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.200
So let's shoot it down and see what we got.

23:20.200 --> 23:26.360
The DOD and the CIA, Secretary and Director, went to President Biden, like, Mr. President,

23:26.360 --> 23:27.360
please don't shoot this thing down.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.520
I mean, we're not threatened.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.240
We really are not concerned about this.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.240
We know where it's going.

23:32.240 --> 23:36.280
It's going to float over the missile silos in Montana.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.880
But Mr. President, unless you're planning on like firing a few dozen nukes in the next

23:39.880 --> 23:42.000
few days, those hatches are going to be closed.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.200
They're always closed, Mr. President.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.880
The Chinese will get photos of closed hatches from seven miles away.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.600
We are not scared about this.

23:50.600 --> 23:55.640
But Mr. President, there's an opportunity here, because if you let this thing go on

23:55.640 --> 24:01.960
its merry way, we'll put a spy helicopter below it and a spy plane above it and every

24:01.960 --> 24:07.200
whisper sensor we have, and we will track over the next nine days, and we'll copy all

24:07.200 --> 24:11.640
their cryptography, we'll trace the signals through the civilian transfer information

24:11.640 --> 24:15.760
exchange network, we'll see which satellites they're using, and we will trace it back not

24:15.760 --> 24:18.640
to the city, not to the block, not to the building, not to the floor, not to the office,

24:18.640 --> 24:21.920
to the terminal that is doing the controls.

24:21.920 --> 24:25.440
And Mr. President, we have the best hackers in the world.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.040
We will hack that bit of a terminal.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.320
We will find out who is on it, and then we will trace them using signals intelligence

24:32.320 --> 24:35.320
and map out their whole world.

24:35.320 --> 24:45.640
Mr. President, the Chinese have handed us the intelligence breakthrough of the decade.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.080
All you have to do is let the thing flow.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.960
And then when it gets over in North Carolina, we'll shoot it down and we'll get the hardware

24:50.960 --> 24:53.900
too, which we did.

24:53.900 --> 25:02.400
We now know that Xi was unaware of the balloon's existence until after it was shot down.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.240
He's that much in the dark.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.360
No one would tell him.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.640
We now know that their Ministry of Defense was unaware of it until it crossed into American

25:08.640 --> 25:09.640
airspace.

25:09.640 --> 25:14.200
It was just some in the intelligence bureau who thought this is what Wolf Warrior diplomacy

25:14.200 --> 25:15.200
means.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.640
This is how you stick it to the Americans.

25:17.640 --> 25:22.920
We're seeing breakdowns like this at every government level in every economic sector.

25:22.920 --> 25:30.880
The capacity of the Chinese to make decisions to flow information has stopped.

25:30.880 --> 25:36.600
This was the dumbest thing I have seen any country do in the last 20 years.

25:36.600 --> 25:42.520
And if you think back on the last two decades, there has been so much dumb.

25:42.520 --> 25:47.600
This is what state failure looks like in the early stages.

25:47.600 --> 25:57.480
So yes, China, 10 years tops, but it can end so much faster.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.120
Let's talk credit.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.920
This is the American private credit curve.

26:01.920 --> 26:06.360
From the beginning in 2000 to that bump in the middle, that's the subprime build.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.880
We doubled total private credit in seven years.

26:08.880 --> 26:09.880
It was too much.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.600
It was too fast.

26:11.600 --> 26:16.640
And we had a recession that knocked 5% off of headline GDP because of it.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.240
Since then, we've picked up the growth, but at something a lot more similar to the century

26:20.240 --> 26:21.240
average.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.480
It doesn't mean I think we have no concerns in the space.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.640
This is just to give us a benchmark.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.960
Doubling seven years, 5% recession.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.120
Got it?

26:32.120 --> 26:35.560
Same data, different scale.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.560
Here are the Canadians.

26:37.560 --> 26:41.400
Now, you'll notice in the early part of the stage, they were doing something similar

26:41.400 --> 26:43.600
to us, but a little bit lower.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.400
In fact, up until 2007, the Canadians, I would argue, had the healthiest banking sector in

26:48.400 --> 26:51.080
the world, good risk management.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.160
And then we had the great recession.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.320
And the Canadians did something that was very Canadian.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.600
Americans just had the worst recession ever.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.320
We can totally have a worse recession.

27:01.320 --> 27:07.600
And they dismantled all of the risk management they had put into place over the last 30 years,

27:07.600 --> 27:12.600
pulled down on every mistake that we made, and their credit swelled, and it contributed

27:12.600 --> 27:15.360
to the housing crisis they're having now.

27:15.360 --> 27:22.640
Then they got to about 2014, like, oh, oh, oh, maybe we don't want to win this one.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.320
And they dialed it back.

27:24.320 --> 27:29.560
I'd say they're not out of the woods yet, but it looks better now than it did a decade

27:29.560 --> 27:30.560
ago.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.600
Here are the Germans.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.880
If you're in Germany and you want to buy a house, you don't get your 20% together and

27:37.880 --> 27:40.160
go to the bank for the other 80.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.560
You tell the bank that you want to buy a house and you're like, great.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.120
So what you need to do is figure out what your mortgage would be if we gave you the

27:47.120 --> 27:51.160
loan and deposit that with us on the first of the month, and then again the next month

27:51.160 --> 27:55.120
and then the next month and the next month for 60 months.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.280
Then we will talk about your loan application.

27:58.280 --> 28:03.880
You have to prove that you're not a credit risk for five years first.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.240
There are problems in the German system.

28:06.240 --> 28:10.560
A credit overbuild is not one of them.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.720
But it is in Greece.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.560
Sevenfold increase of credit in seven years.

28:14.560 --> 28:19.120
So far, their economic adjustments down has knocked 60% off of GDP.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.720
I would have said three years ago had another 20% to go, but then COVID happened and all

28:22.720 --> 28:25.160
the numbers.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.720
Here is Australia.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.400
One of the fun things about the United States during subprime is at the height of the crisis

28:32.400 --> 28:39.280
in August of 2007, the FDIC chair, the Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve chair all

28:39.280 --> 28:44.560
crowded around a two-top in a bar in Washington and over the course of about a 45-minute conversation

28:44.560 --> 28:50.840
worked out the bare bones of what eventually became TARP, which was our restitution program

28:50.840 --> 28:52.400
for subprime.

28:52.400 --> 28:56.400
That was the model that we followed until the end of the crisis.

28:56.400 --> 29:02.440
It said in very American terms that if you f*** up, you lose.

29:02.440 --> 29:08.200
So whether you were the lender or the lendi, there were losses taken.

29:08.200 --> 29:14.520
The government money was only there for people to reconstitute.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.800
And if you made a mistake, you didn't get everything back.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.480
It was something to stabilize the financial sector and not bail out individuals or corporations.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.040
And broadly speaking, it worked.

29:26.080 --> 29:32.600
Now, the Australians did something very similar when they set up their restitution program,

29:32.600 --> 29:36.920
but they didn't call anyone to account.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.760
Every mortgage was backed 100%.

29:39.760 --> 29:47.040
Furthermore, they changed the laws, so if you could prove that you could pay your mortgage

29:47.040 --> 29:55.640
with a 100% government guarantee, you automatically qualified for a second mortgage and a third

29:55.640 --> 29:58.720
and a fourth.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.240
They haven't had their adjustment yet.

30:01.240 --> 30:07.240
And when they do, oh, my God, here is Brazil.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.960
You know, we're all, like, ripped up about our politics.

30:09.960 --> 30:15.240
The fact that we might be facing, probably we'll be facing another Biden-Trump showdown

30:15.240 --> 30:19.320
in the general, old hat for the Brazilians.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.480
They've already done it twice.

30:21.480 --> 30:28.120
And their candidates, one guy was campaigning from prison where he had been convicted of

30:28.120 --> 30:30.600
corruption, not indicted, convicted.

30:30.600 --> 30:34.480
And the other guy said that the real problem with those Nazis is they were just way too

30:34.480 --> 30:38.040
soft on their domestic opponents.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.080
The Nazi won the first round.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.840
The guy in prison ran the second time.

30:43.840 --> 30:52.320
I'd argue that Brazil has already entered the first of two decades of lost time.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.360
Here's India.

30:54.360 --> 30:59.120
Prime Minister Modi adopted something very similar to what the Australians did, but you

30:59.120 --> 31:03.960
only got the money if you were one of his friends.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.320
And here are the Chinese.

31:07.320 --> 31:13.040
Let me adjust this for you.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.360
Are you kidding me?

31:16.360 --> 31:22.480
How anyone thinks that China is a serious player on the international playground is

31:22.480 --> 31:24.220
beyond me.

31:24.220 --> 31:29.080
We are looking at the equivalent of Enron in the 11th hour.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.200
The question is, when it falls, what does it do?

31:33.200 --> 31:35.360
I'm not really worried about it from a strategic point of view.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.000
They can't really reach anyone.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.480
I'd be a little nervous.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.720
I'm from Taiwan, obviously.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.920
But I'm more worried about the economic consequences.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.400
And we're starting to see the faint outlines of what that's going to look like.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.400
So good and bad.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
Let's start with the good.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.680
I'm not worried about finance.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.320
And that's courtesy, ironically, of the Russians.

31:53.320 --> 31:58.320
When the Ukraine war started, every Western financial institution cut their exposure to

31:58.320 --> 32:00.400
Russian banks to zero.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.800
The Chinese flooded into the space to take over.

32:03.800 --> 32:08.120
And that meant that every Western institution was like, whoa, that's like screaming for

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
sanctions.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.480
We cut our connections to the Chinese as well.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.840
And here we are, a year and a half into the war.

32:14.840 --> 32:20.760
And the total exposure of all Western banks to all Chinese banks is less than 1% of their

32:20.760 --> 32:23.880
global holdings.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.000
That's a happy circumstance.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
I like that.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.320
I'm also not worried about merchandise exports to the Chinese because it's a very protectionist

32:30.320 --> 32:31.320
system.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.320
They build anything they possibly can.

32:32.320 --> 32:38.400
They import as little as they can, which means that the total exposure, the entire world

32:38.400 --> 32:44.800
to the Chinese consumer is only about 3.5% of Chinese GDP, which is the lowest goods

32:44.800 --> 32:47.440
exposure of any country today.

32:47.440 --> 32:51.480
It's not zero, but it's manageable.

32:51.480 --> 32:55.800
If you're in the world of commodities, different situation.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.240
It's investment-driven, building things that they don't need.

32:58.240 --> 33:02.360
So whether it's copper or steel or aluminum, they are the world's largest player, often

33:02.360 --> 33:05.240
the world's largest importer.

33:05.760 --> 33:10.160
Even if we have to rebuild a lot of industrial plant in other places, the industrial plant

33:10.160 --> 33:14.080
we build in other places is going to be based on economics and efficiency rather than just

33:14.080 --> 33:15.080
build.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.480
We're not going to need as much.

33:17.480 --> 33:22.360
And so those sectors are going to have some serious downward adjustments.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.360
Food's kind of in the middle.

33:23.360 --> 33:27.640
The Chinese are the world's largest importer of almost every food product.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.720
Their diet has expanded massively in the last 35 years.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.360
And that is probably going to break down, but consider this.

33:35.360 --> 33:41.840
The last thing a government does before it collapses is somehow take steps to restrict

33:41.840 --> 33:44.840
the population's access to food.

33:44.840 --> 33:48.840
So of the things that are going to break, it's probably the last one to go, and it'll

33:48.840 --> 33:53.680
be a little bit of a softer landing because we still need food.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.440
Tech's going to be an issue.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.800
The Chinese are not technically advanced.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.240
Most of what they do in manufacturing is relatively low value.

34:02.240 --> 34:07.120
And they bring in tech from everyone they can to build that industrial plant.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.800
And in terms of tech supply change, they tend to be on the assembly side of things with

34:10.800 --> 34:14.800
more advanced stuff coming from Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, and the rest.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.760
That whole ecosystem is going to end.

34:18.760 --> 34:25.200
And there aren't enough fingers and eyes in the world to do assembly on the scale we've

34:25.200 --> 34:27.160
become used to.

34:27.160 --> 34:30.720
And that's going to probably be what hurts us most of all.

34:30.720 --> 34:34.800
This is a document from the American Enterprise Institute on inflation.

34:34.800 --> 34:40.120
The yellow arrows are the average inflation since the year 2000, so roughly a 75% increase

34:40.120 --> 34:43.000
in inflation over the 22 years.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.120
Everything that is below that line has gotten cheaper.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.280
Everything above that line has gotten more expensive.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.560
Over simplifying here, but above the line, those are the things that require fingers

34:52.560 --> 34:53.800
and eyes.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.240
Healthcare, for example, requires people.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.400
There's no way around that.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.920
And everything below it is something you plug into the wall that beeps and worse.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.720
Something that's manufactured.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.280
And the Chinese are a critical component of all of that.

35:07.280 --> 35:12.360
The biggest hole we're going to have when the Chinese go is the complex supply chains

35:12.360 --> 35:17.880
in the world of electronics is going to find a new way to put things together.

35:17.880 --> 35:22.200
And we haven't developed a new model for that in 60 years.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.160
And we're going to have to.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.680
Now, that doesn't mean it's going to be a disaster because one of the many things we

35:27.680 --> 35:33.760
found out about COVID is that the technology that we've had in pocket for years suddenly

35:33.760 --> 35:35.680
can be used at scale.

35:35.680 --> 35:39.800
I think the best example I can give you is textiles.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.880
Back before NAFTA, most of our textile processing wears in places like Kentucky where it was

35:43.880 --> 35:45.280
done by hand.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.840
And then NAFTA happened and it all moved to Mexico because it was cheaper.

35:48.840 --> 35:53.920
And then the WTO happened and it all moved to China and India because it was cheaper.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.480
But with COVID, it just stopped coming.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.880
And we still wanted clothes, so we had to figure out a different method.

36:00.880 --> 36:05.800
And we discovered that if you build a two-acre facility that's automated with a staff of

36:05.800 --> 36:12.920
two, one software engineer, one mechanic, that one facility could produce finished clothes

36:12.920 --> 36:19.200
at a lower cost per garment than 200 seamstresses in Bangladesh.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.280
You bring in the cotton, the machines turn it into the thread, turn it into yarn, turn

36:23.280 --> 36:27.600
it into cloth, cut it into clothes, assemble it, even do some of the finishing.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.480
We would have never known that before 2020.

36:30.480 --> 36:34.920
Hopefully, we will figure things like that out in other sectors.

36:34.920 --> 36:41.080
But that means we need a lot of investment and an era of constrained capital in order

36:41.080 --> 36:47.800
to happen at scale in every single manufacturing sector.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.080
We've started.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.440
The blue line is what happened with the shale sector.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.280
About 2012, that is when the majority of the natural gas consumed on this continent came

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
from shale.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.400
A lot of that's waste gas.

36:59.400 --> 37:03.880
And so we tripled our investment in a couple of years and it hasn't fallen back.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.120
The refining sector, the chemicals effects are all expanding very quickly.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.680
It's actually the biggest build we've seen ever in the history of the country, faster

37:10.680 --> 37:13.180
than World War II.

37:13.180 --> 37:17.440
The gray bar is kind of the everything else category and it's sliding up.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.440
You'll notice that in the last couple of years, it's picked up quite a bit.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.400
This is where we're all noticing it, though.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.640
This is electronics and computing.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.480
Now a lot of people are like, isn't this all the IRA and the CHIPS Act and that's some

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
of it.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.800
Can I even get back here?

37:31.800 --> 37:32.800
Yeah.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
Okay.

37:33.800 --> 37:37.080
This spot right here, that's where the CHIPS Act and the IRA were passed.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.240
So all of this happened before.

37:40.240 --> 37:44.480
The industry, the industrial base is expanding significantly.

37:44.480 --> 37:48.440
But we need that kind of jack up for absolutely everything.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.560
There will be winners and losers.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.120
There's no way around that.

37:55.120 --> 37:59.720
On the high end, if you want a semiconductor fab facility, you need a lot of people in

37:59.720 --> 38:02.880
their 20s and 30s who are really clever.

38:02.880 --> 38:07.680
And the greatest concentration of those people in the country is the Colorado Front Range

38:07.680 --> 38:09.000
and the Arizona Sun Corridor.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.320
I know everybody thinks about Arizona and they think old people.

38:12.320 --> 38:19.840
They do have a lot of old people in Arizona, however, they're all white.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.880
Arizona actually has a very healthy demography.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
It doesn't have a labor shortage.

38:22.880 --> 38:27.600
It has a bilingual training problem, different problem.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.400
And so you're seeing these areas pick up most of the investment for that because they've

38:31.400 --> 38:33.040
got a lot of green space.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.880
It's not taking over farms, so the land is cheap.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.960
And most of the people who move in are in their 20s and their 30s and they tend to be

38:39.960 --> 38:41.280
very highly educated.

38:41.280 --> 38:46.920
That's where the concentration of labor for that sector happens to be and policy is matching.

38:46.920 --> 38:51.480
You want to do automotive, you're looking at either the Great Lake Regions or the South.

38:51.480 --> 38:54.640
Now the Great Lake Regions is all unionized.

38:54.640 --> 39:00.400
And so everything that has to do with internal combustion engines is going there.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.240
And we've seen that expand massively.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
Pros and cons.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.360
Pros, there's a lot of industrial plant there.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.840
You can rehabilitate a lot of the brown space.

39:10.840 --> 39:15.720
It's actually a relatively light carry from an investment point of view.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.920
The downside is they're not moving into any of the new stuff.

39:18.920 --> 39:23.000
And they probably can't, not just because it's unions, but because there's a population

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
lid.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.280
This area has seen outmigration pretty robust over the last 30 years.

39:27.280 --> 39:32.440
There aren't enough young people to stock a lot of new industrial plant.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.360
For that, you go to the South.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.640
And so most of the foreign investment is in the South.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.840
Most of the new battery facilities in the South, almost the EV construction is in the

39:39.840 --> 39:41.720
South.

39:41.720 --> 39:46.360
But the place that is just going to kick ass and take names is the Texas Triangle, especially

39:46.360 --> 39:47.960
Houston.

39:47.960 --> 39:53.040
Because you've got almost 20 million people, about a third of whom have immigrated within

39:53.040 --> 39:55.600
the last 10 years, tends to be younger than the national average.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.820
They have a footprint in Mexico.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.980
They can access that part of the supply chain.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.940
And Houston has a foot in the energy corridors as well.

40:01.940 --> 40:08.580
So all of the inputs that you need for all of the stuff we need to do is already there.

40:08.580 --> 40:12.020
Now, let's talk about the Mexicans.

40:12.020 --> 40:13.980
This is a population density map.

40:13.980 --> 40:18.700
The deep red, those are the urban cores, the yellow are small towns and suburbs.

40:18.700 --> 40:24.020
And if you look north of the border, that pattern, dense urban cores, suburbs, small

40:24.020 --> 40:30.460
towns, as a geography, as a geographer, excuse me, that tells me that it rains.

40:30.460 --> 40:34.740
Rain makes farms, farms make small towns, small towns make suburbs, suburbs make inner

40:34.740 --> 40:36.240
cities.

40:36.240 --> 40:41.740
South of the border, you don't have that because it's desert.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.740
Pros and cons.

40:42.740 --> 40:46.580
Pros, it's oligarchic.

40:46.580 --> 40:51.180
There's no interaction among the urban centers in Mexico.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.460
Local interconnections are very, very thin.

40:53.460 --> 40:57.260
So only a few families run everything and have since independence over a century and

40:57.260 --> 40:58.660
a half ago.

40:58.660 --> 41:01.580
Which means if you're an American and you're looking for a partner, all you have to do

41:01.580 --> 41:06.100
is go south, figure out who's in charge, knock on the door, introduce yourself.

41:06.100 --> 41:11.300
Two weeks later, you'll be leaving with a blistering hangover, a godchild, because you're

41:11.300 --> 41:15.020
part of the family now, and a fistful of signed contracts that you know you can rely

41:15.020 --> 41:19.420
upon because you now have a personal connection.

41:19.420 --> 41:26.340
This downside of that though is once you gobbled up the labor in that urban area, you're done.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.940
Mexicans are not mobile in the way that Americans are.

41:28.940 --> 41:32.540
They don't move within their country very much to take jobs because the infrastructure

41:32.540 --> 41:34.620
doesn't support it.

41:34.620 --> 41:38.460
And the cities stop and then you just have desert.

41:38.460 --> 41:41.780
There's no intermingling at the edges.

41:41.780 --> 41:46.020
And the Texans have been working on this for 40 years.

41:46.020 --> 41:50.980
And they have already gobbled up probably 80% of the labor that was available.

41:50.980 --> 41:54.540
Which means if we're going to rely on the Mexicans to do what we need to do, and oh

41:54.540 --> 41:59.420
my god, we need to rely on the Mexicans to do what we need to do, the northern section

41:59.420 --> 42:01.060
of the country is not the solution.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.340
It's got to be the center.

42:03.340 --> 42:06.780
The problem is that the infrastructure isn't there to support it.

42:06.780 --> 42:09.860
There are only three, I'll point, the three black lines.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.780
Those are the only three intermodal freight facilities within the entire country.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.500
They don't interconnect.

42:16.500 --> 42:22.100
They just go south on a specific corridor and they don't really branch off.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.420
And if the northern Mexicans have already been metabolized, we have to make it all the

42:25.420 --> 42:26.780
way down to Mexico City.

42:26.780 --> 42:29.260
That's 1,000 miles away.

42:29.260 --> 42:35.220
Which means we need to invest at least trillion dollars in Mexican infrastructure in order

42:35.220 --> 42:41.380
to reach at scale the 50, 60 million people who live in the center of the country.

42:41.380 --> 42:44.660
And we have to do so in a way that doesn't make the Mexicans think that we're trying

42:44.660 --> 42:50.180
to take over, which is kind of what we're trying to do.

42:50.180 --> 42:52.740
This is going to be touchy.

42:52.740 --> 42:58.500
But if we don't pull it off, we will not have the labor to do what we need to do.

42:58.500 --> 43:03.380
Because if we still want stuff in a post-China world, we need help to build it.

43:03.380 --> 43:06.260
We need a differentiated labor market.

43:06.260 --> 43:12.220
And the Mexicans are the only ones within arms reach that can help with that.

43:12.220 --> 43:16.900
There are other players that are further abroad, but we can't integrate with them the same

43:16.900 --> 43:19.260
way we can integrate with a neighbor.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.380
The Southeast Asian countries look pretty good to me.

43:23.380 --> 43:27.700
Thailand is the fastest aging one, but it still has at least another 25 years.

43:27.700 --> 43:29.340
The Indonesians and the Vietnamese are great.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.460
In fact, the Vietnamese are kind of scary.

43:33.460 --> 43:37.460
They've expanded their higher educational system with technical skills in mind.

43:37.460 --> 43:41.220
40% of college grads in Vietnam are STEM graduates.

43:41.220 --> 43:45.500
They are attempting, and it looks like they're going to pull it off, to leapfrog over China

43:45.500 --> 43:47.460
from a technological point of view.

43:47.460 --> 43:52.300
And they will probably achieve that within the next three or four years.

43:52.300 --> 43:57.020
There's also a geography situation that is very helpful.

43:57.020 --> 44:02.540
On the left, you're looking at a vegetation map, basically, and the green is tropics.

44:02.540 --> 44:07.420
And when you think about building infrastructure in tropics, in mountains, on peninsulas, on

44:07.420 --> 44:12.540
islands, it's an expensive, ugly business because you really can't get economies of

44:12.540 --> 44:14.540
scale.

44:14.540 --> 44:17.100
But there's pros and cons to that, too.

44:17.100 --> 44:20.060
The con is that these countries have never gone to war with one another, like they have

44:20.060 --> 44:22.300
in, say, Europe or Northeast Asia.

44:22.300 --> 44:25.500
There's not a lot of bad blood.

44:25.500 --> 44:30.220
And that means that almost everyone started out in tropical agriculture.

44:30.220 --> 44:33.900
And if there's one thing that everyone in tropical agriculture can agree on is that no

44:33.900 --> 44:37.380
one wants to be in tropical agriculture.

44:37.380 --> 44:42.380
In temperate zone agriculture, there's a value chain.

44:42.380 --> 44:43.380
You don't have to do it all by hand.

44:43.380 --> 44:44.380
You can get a tractor.

44:44.380 --> 44:45.380
You can get a combine.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.380
You can get a spreader.

44:46.380 --> 44:52.020
And the tropics, no, no, no, no, no, tropical fruits, harvested by hand, tended to by hand,

44:52.020 --> 44:53.020
transported by hand.

44:53.020 --> 44:56.500
You can't have a combine harvesting mangoes.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.940
It's all unskilled labor.

44:58.940 --> 45:02.700
And so whenever people in tropical ag have a chance, they move out.

45:02.700 --> 45:03.700
And they go to the cities.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.540
And that means population density.

45:05.540 --> 45:10.660
Their cities are wildly overpopulated for the skill set of the labor.

45:10.660 --> 45:16.020
And that means this is the most competitive part of the world for value-added manufacturing.

45:16.020 --> 45:18.180
This is where we're going to see a big footprint expand.

45:18.180 --> 45:19.180
Already has.

45:19.180 --> 45:21.420
You're talking about a billion people.

45:21.420 --> 45:26.700
There are already more people in coastal Southeast Asia than there are in coastal China.

45:26.700 --> 45:30.380
They're probably the biggest winners in the world after Mexico.

45:30.380 --> 45:33.340
But it will look different.

45:33.340 --> 45:35.500
Population density, again.

45:35.500 --> 45:39.620
You'll notice that there aren't threads.

45:39.620 --> 45:44.420
When you look at a more normal population structure in an industrialized or industrializing country,

45:44.420 --> 45:48.980
you get your urban hub and you've got threads of highways that are densely settled going

45:48.980 --> 45:51.060
out to the next population center.

45:51.060 --> 45:55.940
And that allows for what we consider to be multi-step supply chains because there's multiple

45:55.940 --> 45:58.620
population centers linked together tightly.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.540
You can move things back and forth through the system.

46:00.540 --> 46:02.180
That doesn't happen in Mexico.

46:02.180 --> 46:03.180
It's desert.

46:03.180 --> 46:04.180
It's mountainous.

46:04.180 --> 46:05.380
It's jungle.

46:05.380 --> 46:06.620
Combination thereof.

46:06.620 --> 46:13.820
And so each urban core will be good, very good at one or two things.

46:13.820 --> 46:20.060
And that's it because they don't have access to a complementary system.

46:20.060 --> 46:24.940
So what we do in the United States is we might make the frame.

46:24.940 --> 46:27.540
We send it across, they put in the spark plugs.

46:27.540 --> 46:30.260
They send it back, we put in the computer system.

46:30.260 --> 46:33.700
We send it back, they put in the seats.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.700
And it's going to different cities each time.

46:35.700 --> 46:39.620
And it's that back and forth that makes it work.

46:39.620 --> 46:42.220
But they can't do that at scale within their own system.

46:42.220 --> 46:44.940
They have to have that partner.

46:44.940 --> 46:47.580
The Vietnamese do not.

46:47.580 --> 46:50.980
It's a much more traditional system from our point of view.

46:50.980 --> 46:55.860
And so the Vietnamese can do top to bottom manufacturing, the only thing they have to

46:55.860 --> 47:00.180
worry about are the components that they can't make themselves, which are substantial.

47:00.180 --> 47:05.740
But you can have Vietnam as almost a one-stop shop for most of what we need.

47:05.740 --> 47:10.020
We're just going to kind of add the dusting of the tech that's necessary to make it work.

47:10.020 --> 47:12.020
It's cheaper to do.

47:12.020 --> 47:15.620
Unfortunately, it's 7,000 miles further away.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.900
So we can't do the back and forth.

47:17.900 --> 47:18.900
Two different models.

47:19.900 --> 47:20.900
All right.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.700
Let's talk products.

47:22.700 --> 47:27.500
If you're at the top of this, you don't know who your third tier suppliers are, much less

47:27.500 --> 47:28.500
your 13th.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.740
If you're at the bottom, you can probably fit your entire supply chain on the back of a

47:31.740 --> 47:34.300
cocktail napkin after throwing back a few bourbons.

47:34.300 --> 47:38.420
If you're on the left, or excuse me, on the right, you're already within the NAFTA system.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.980
If you're on the right, you're dependent on the Chinese.

47:41.980 --> 47:42.980
Couple examples.

47:42.980 --> 47:44.300
Energy.

47:44.300 --> 47:47.140
Energy is made with American capital.

47:47.140 --> 47:52.620
It's on American pipelines, American workers going to American refineries, ending up with

47:52.620 --> 47:55.540
an American consumer.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.940
And that is not simple at all.

47:57.940 --> 48:06.860
1,400 supply chain steps for the iPhone, 91% of which involve mainland China in some fashion.

48:06.860 --> 48:08.820
The new iPhone just came out a couple weeks ago.

48:08.820 --> 48:11.500
You might want to buy two.

48:11.500 --> 48:16.660
We're probably getting close to the point where this is the last one.

48:16.660 --> 48:17.660
Here's everybody else.

48:17.660 --> 48:20.180
I'm going to pull out a few of these.

48:20.180 --> 48:21.180
Automotive.

48:21.180 --> 48:24.700
Courtesy of NAFTA 2.

48:24.700 --> 48:29.340
Over 90% of the supply chains for autos sold in North America are manufactured in North

48:29.340 --> 48:30.340
America.

48:30.340 --> 48:33.140
Don't mean to suggest we're not going to have some hiccups, but the core of it has already

48:33.140 --> 48:35.140
worked and the rest is just network effects.

48:35.140 --> 48:36.580
That's not bad.

48:36.580 --> 48:40.500
In terms of foreign investors, the Europeans are of the belief that they can bring in all

48:40.500 --> 48:43.020
the parts and just assemble it here.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.500
That's not going to work very well.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.540
The Asians have figured out that they need to actually do the manufacturing here.

48:47.540 --> 48:52.220
So they're probably north of 70% manufactured within North America, where most European

48:52.220 --> 48:55.540
companies are less than 10.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.260
Heavy vehicles are going to be a problem, though.

48:58.260 --> 49:03.300
When you have globalization, it's very common for countries to put their thumbs on the scale

49:03.300 --> 49:07.100
to encourage parts of the industrial plant to be in their countries, especially if it's

49:07.100 --> 49:10.540
something they can technologically do without a lot of help.

49:10.540 --> 49:15.700
As big as they are, a forklift is actually simpler than a passenger car in terms of the

49:15.700 --> 49:18.340
equipment and the construction.

49:18.340 --> 49:22.300
Since not everybody needs a forklift, it's not like you're going to have these facilities

49:22.300 --> 49:23.300
everywhere.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.740
The Chinese really have dominated that space.

49:26.740 --> 49:31.700
Forklifts, dump trucks, construction equipment, agriculture equipment, we're going to have

49:31.700 --> 49:38.500
a real problem when the Chinese go away, but it is a relatively easy fix because anyone

49:38.500 --> 49:43.700
who can do automotive at scale can also do heavy equipment at scale.

49:43.700 --> 49:47.380
It's just a question of the numbers being right, and nothing like half of the stuff

49:47.380 --> 49:53.260
vanishing from the world is going to make the numbers right.

49:53.260 --> 49:55.020
That's where I'm worried the most.

49:55.020 --> 50:01.100
A successful electronics and computing sector requires a lot of different labor price points

50:01.380 --> 50:05.340
because the person who does the plastic molding is not the person who does the die cast or

50:05.340 --> 50:10.940
pulls the wire or builds the chip or does the software or polishes the lenses.

50:10.940 --> 50:15.460
That's a different step with a different skill set at a different price point.

50:15.460 --> 50:20.360
One of the many reasons that the East Asians are so good at this is you've got 11 different

50:20.360 --> 50:28.860
labor sets within one extended market, and they can all specialize at what they do best.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.480
We don't have that in North America.

50:30.480 --> 50:34.080
We have two price points, us, Mexico.

50:34.080 --> 50:38.240
That's it, and so we have to change how this is all done.

50:38.240 --> 50:44.760
The textiles example gives me hope that we can, but I have no idea in hell how because

50:44.760 --> 50:51.120
we haven't had to figure it out yet, but we're going to have to real soon, and we're probably

50:51.120 --> 50:56.240
going to have to do it without Northern Mexico because that's already spoken for.

50:57.240 --> 51:01.000
All right, here's where things get a little messy.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.160
Not all semiconductors are made equal.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.480
We all hear about the Chips Act and what the Biden administration wants to do.

51:06.480 --> 51:12.280
That's for a very, very specific kind of chip, 10 nanometer and smaller, the most advanced

51:12.280 --> 51:13.280
one in the world.

51:13.280 --> 51:19.320
Now, today, 92% of those come from Taiwan, 8% from South Korea.

51:19.320 --> 51:22.240
If every facility that is under construction in the United States because of the Chips

51:22.240 --> 51:28.320
Act ultimately comes to fruition, we will be making less than 5% of the global total.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.080
It's a start, it's not huge.

51:32.080 --> 51:35.720
The Koreans and the Taiwanese have been working on this for a long time.

51:35.720 --> 51:37.760
Here's the problem.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.920
The Taiwanese manufacture most of them.

51:40.920 --> 51:47.440
They fabricate most of them, but most of the technology that allows them to do so is not

51:47.440 --> 51:49.080
Taiwanese.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.840
They just have the end production.

51:51.840 --> 51:58.920
There's a coalition of over 9,000 companies worldwide, half of which only produce one

51:58.920 --> 52:03.680
product for one customer that ends up in a Taiwanese facility.

52:03.680 --> 52:09.680
You pull any of those out of the constellation, the whole thing stops until you repair the

52:09.680 --> 52:10.680
constellation.

52:10.680 --> 52:15.080
We're going to have to rebuild an entire environment in order to continue putting these

52:15.080 --> 52:18.480
chips together.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.240
That's going to take a decade.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.560
All it takes is one country falling out.

52:21.600 --> 52:25.360
I'm personally most concerned about the Germans on this one.

52:25.360 --> 52:30.600
On the other extreme, you've got the dumb chips, the 90 nanometer and bigger.

52:30.600 --> 52:35.960
This is your Internet of Things, your smart blender, the shower brush that sings to you,

52:35.960 --> 52:37.280
your smart lights.

52:37.280 --> 52:44.280
80% of those are made by the Chinese and they can do that without outside help.

52:44.280 --> 52:47.160
The other 20% is kind of a split between Japan and the United States.

52:47.160 --> 52:51.120
If the Chinese were to vanish tomorrow, obviously the Internet of Things would just die.

52:51.160 --> 52:56.000
I would argue that's not that big of a deal.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.120
We have the technology.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.120
We have the knowledge.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.400
We don't have to reinvent anything.

53:00.400 --> 53:04.320
We just need a couple of years to build low-end fab facilities.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.840
The Mexicans are very interested in getting into that space.

53:06.840 --> 53:13.440
The problem that they face is bilingual technical language skills.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.040
If you've got kids who are looking for a way to make a lot of money really quick, tell

53:17.160 --> 53:22.520
them to learn how to assemble chips and to do it in Spanish and go down there and be translators

53:22.520 --> 53:26.800
because that is going to be the single biggest friction point in the bilateral relationship

53:26.800 --> 53:29.080
for the next decade or two.

53:29.080 --> 53:35.440
Then everything in the middle, 10 to 90, that's your car.

53:35.440 --> 53:36.600
That's your planes.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.240
That's most power management systems.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.320
That's smart meters.

53:40.320 --> 53:46.680
We're probably okay there because those are made in Germany and Italy and here in Japan

53:46.720 --> 53:51.640
and Korea, Taiwan, even a little bit in China with imported gear.

53:51.640 --> 53:54.640
That looks okay.

53:54.640 --> 54:00.800
It's the high-end I'm really worried about because those high-end chips, that's AI.

54:00.800 --> 54:04.680
All these server farms are getting built to do AI at scale?

54:04.680 --> 54:05.680
No.

54:05.680 --> 54:07.440
We're not going to have the chips for it.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.840
That's the iPhone.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.840
We're not going to have the chips for them.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.720
That's electric vehicles.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.520
Electric vehicles have two to three grand-worth of chips and they're all either the very high-end

54:17.520 --> 54:21.160
or the very low-end.

54:21.160 --> 54:25.960
We won't be able to sustain it and everything that comes from it.

54:25.960 --> 54:30.960
For you guys's world more specifically, here's your lives.

54:30.960 --> 54:36.960
Yeah, there's no way to fix that fast.

54:36.960 --> 54:40.760
Order from everyone.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Get away.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Counting on half of them not making it.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.440
That's the biggest sticking point you guys have by far.

54:48.440 --> 54:49.920
This doesn't look that great either.

54:49.920 --> 54:54.680
This is space the Chinese dominate utterly and replacing that at scale is not a two-year

54:54.680 --> 54:56.760
program.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.120
It's not just the manufacturer.

54:58.120 --> 55:02.080
The assembly requires a lot of fingers and eyes and a lot of quality control and there

55:02.080 --> 55:06.040
is no other country in the world that can step into that space quickly.

55:06.040 --> 55:10.000
We're talking about a significant build-out that's not just capital-intensive but is very

55:10.040 --> 55:17.040
labor-intensive and it is not clear where, if, that can happen with today's technology.

55:19.800 --> 55:22.800
This stuff we kind of do in our sleep.

55:22.800 --> 55:26.600
That's weird.

55:26.600 --> 55:33.600
It's advancing on my cheat screen but it's not advancing on the big one.

55:34.600 --> 55:41.600
Do you guys need to do it manually from now on?

55:41.600 --> 55:44.600
There's a disconnect.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.600
They keep inviting me to events and like, no.

55:52.600 --> 55:56.600
Okay, there we go.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.600
Okay, the stuff in the middle.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.600
I'm sorry.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.600
This is the stuff we do in our sleep.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.600
The United States is a weird economy in that we're very, very high-end and very, very low-end

56:04.600 --> 56:05.600
at the same time.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.600
We have a lot of elbow room.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.600
We have a lot of forest.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.600
We have a lot of wood.

56:08.600 --> 56:12.100
And courtesy of the shale industry, we have a lot of things that are energy-intensive that

56:12.100 --> 56:13.600
were the world's most competitive.

56:13.600 --> 56:16.600
None of that's in danger.

56:16.600 --> 56:21.600
This is the stuff that the Mexicans are going to be helping us with.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.600
The slower China breaks down, the more time we have to build the industrial plant that

56:25.600 --> 56:29.600
we need to give you guys the guts of what you need.

56:29.600 --> 56:34.600
That means working with the Mexicans as forward-looking as possible to build the stuff out so we don't

56:34.600 --> 56:38.600
start the day that stuff from China just vanishes.

56:38.600 --> 56:39.600
Oops.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.600
Here we go.

56:41.600 --> 56:47.600
My biggest concern about China is the information blocket in there has now become so intense

56:47.600 --> 56:50.600
that we just can't get information at all.

56:50.600 --> 56:55.600
And we might not find out that the government has collapsed until the stuff just stops arriving.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.600
We're not going to have a lot of warning.

56:58.600 --> 56:59.600
Okay.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.600
Uh-oh.

57:00.600 --> 57:04.600
All kinds of weird stuff is happening down here now.

57:04.600 --> 57:08.600
Can you guys bounce it forward for me?

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
There we go.

57:10.600 --> 57:11.600
All right.

57:11.600 --> 57:17.600
I showed you guys this last year, population density map on this side, economic map on this

57:17.600 --> 57:18.600
side.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.600
The areas that are populated are also the areas that are economically viable.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.600
It's a pure weather thing.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.600
Russia has weather.

57:24.600 --> 57:28.600
People live where it's left.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.600
The Russian strategy is pretty straightforward.

57:31.600 --> 57:36.600
Expand out of the weather or the area that's decent until you hit a series of geographic

57:36.600 --> 57:38.600
barriers that you can't shove tanks through.

57:38.600 --> 57:44.600
And then forward position your military in the access points between them.

57:44.600 --> 57:48.600
Ukraine is in the unfortunate position of not controlling those access points, but it's

57:48.600 --> 57:51.600
on the way to one in Romania and one in Poland.

57:51.600 --> 57:55.600
So whenever the Russians are done with Ukraine, if they can win, they will move on to the

57:55.600 --> 58:00.600
next line of countries, five of which are in NATO.

58:00.600 --> 58:03.600
American, Western, foreign policy is very simple.

58:03.600 --> 58:06.600
Prevent them from having that opportunity.

58:06.600 --> 58:12.600
Now, here we have the Ukrainian demographic structure.

58:12.600 --> 58:17.600
After independence in 1992 over a third of the population either left or died, some of

58:17.600 --> 58:20.600
the lowest birth rates we've ever seen.

58:20.600 --> 58:25.600
Another third of the population since the war has fled as refugees, mostly women and

58:25.600 --> 58:26.600
children.

58:26.600 --> 58:29.600
So this is pre-war data.

58:29.600 --> 58:35.600
We're very close to the point in Ukraine where they will not have the population density

58:35.600 --> 58:43.600
that is required to maintain industrial level infrastructure.

58:43.600 --> 58:49.600
So whether it is food or steel or coal or stuff transiting, Ukraine is not going to

58:50.600 --> 58:55.600
survive the next 30 years, even if they win the war.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.600
There's another problem in that space.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.600
This is, hang on, my hair is falling apart here.

59:00.600 --> 59:04.600
This is the Russian permafrost.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.600
It's a geological phenomenon.

59:06.600 --> 59:10.600
You go 10 to 30 feet down and you hit a layer where it never melts.

59:10.600 --> 59:14.600
But the top chunk melts in the summer and turns into a bog.

59:14.600 --> 59:18.600
It is the most difficult environment in the world for mineral extraction.

59:18.600 --> 59:23.600
So the Russians have the most expensive upfront cost to bring stuff online.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.600
You basically have to wait for it to freeze solid.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.600
You run a berm out to your production site.

59:29.600 --> 59:34.600
You run a rail line or a pipe or a road along that berm and then you have a pad that you

59:34.600 --> 59:40.600
drill from when it's frozen because you can't drill through mud.

59:40.600 --> 59:45.600
It's a very dynamic landscape because if an aquifer cracks open, everything just kind

59:45.600 --> 59:47.600
of slides and follows the aquifer.

59:47.600 --> 59:52.600
Or maybe it drains down, in which case you just get a single pit that opens.

59:52.600 --> 59:55.600
Or maybe there's no aquifer and you just get a warm summer.

59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.600
And the vegetation that's been frozen for eons starts to thaw, starts to decompose.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.600
Decomposing vegetable matter gives off methane and the whole land buckles.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:12.600
Which means that the Russians have the highest maintenance costs for any mineral production in the world.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.600
Here's the problem, Russian population structure.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:26.600
Now, about the time that people who were 15 were getting born, 2004, 2005,

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.600
that's when the Russians stopped collecting data and just started making it up.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:37.600
So you've got that big gouge in the 20-somethings, post-Cold War birth rate collapse,

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.600
and then you have fabricated data.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.600
There probably are only half as many children as this data would suggest.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.600
The Russian educational system collapsed back in 1985.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.600
So we had a collapse in the birth rate, a collapse of the educational system.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Which means that the youngest people in Russia who actually have technical skills at scale,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.600
they turned 62 this year.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.600
The year before the Russians started fabricating data,

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.600
the life expectancy for the average Russian male was 67.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.600
They already had the worst skilled labor pool relative to their population and their needs in the world.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.600
And they're very close from simply losing all of it.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.600
The maintenance on the Russian systems, the development on the Russian systems,

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.600
hasn't been done by the Russians for the most part.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.600
It's been done by BP or ExxonMobil and especially the Dutch and the Germans,

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.600
and all that went to zero when the war started.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.600
So whether it's sanctions, war damage, or simple lack of maintenance,

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.600
we need to prepare for a world where everything that the world has become

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.600
reliant upon from the Russians, palladium, platinum, oil, gas, even timber,

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.600
just doesn't come anymore.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600
There's another angle to it that's a little uglier.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.600
Now this guy, you can see where the ethnic Russian territories are in the top left.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.600
You've got Turkic minorities off to the east and the south.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.600
The problem is this is not an ethnic map, it's a population change map.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.600
The green zones are where population growth is happening roughly on pair with Florida and has for four decades.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:22.600
And the red zones are population losses rushfully equivalent to Detroit and has been for four decades.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:29.600
Almost all the raw materials are produced in the green zones that are not controlled by ethnic Russians,

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.600
where they're experiencing population growth, but they're shipped through and processed in the red zones,

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.600
where the last bits of the skilled labor pool are that is in terminal decline.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.600
So you can add demographics to the reasons that we need to kiss the Russian stuff goodbye as well,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.600
not to mention that this is going to be a very politically unstable region in the not too distant future because of the mismatch.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.600
One of the many reasons that the Russians feel that the Ukraine war is necessary

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.600
is if they can get to kind of that outer crustal defense that they used to have in the Soviet period,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.600
then they can focus their forces internally to police this demographic flip.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.600
They're fighting for time. If they can pull this off, they probably buy themselves another 50 years.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.600
If they fail, they're gone within 20.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Alright, let me take a big dump on green tech.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600
We talked about this a little bit last time I saw you guys.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600
I think I even showed you this graphic.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:34.600
I mean, oversimplifying here, but thermal power, internal combustion engines, not all that complicated.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600
You let a match, you start a fire, you capture the heat in some way.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.600
Can't do that with an EV system, can't do that with green tech.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:47.600
The process of producing the energy, transmitting the energy, storing the energy

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.600
requires an order of magnitude more materials and different materials.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.600
We're looking here at an EV versus an ICE vehicle.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600
You can just see it a glance.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:05.600
And then here's the same kind of idea, but for generation with solar and wind at the top, conventional thermal at the bottom.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.600
We need three times as much copper by 2030.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600
We need 20 times as much lithium.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.600
We need 10 times as much nickel.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.600
There isn't enough on the planet to pull that off.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600
And the Russians are a top three producer of these things.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.600
So it can't happen.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:31.600
It's not physically possible with today's technology for the world.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:38.600
There is one way it might be possible for us.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.600
This is where all the stuff comes from that is not what we would consider to be part of our friends and family network.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:52.600
If we use our military, which is done with the war on terror, which is recruited and rested and rearmed, and we go and conquer all of these places,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:00.600
and we run a Belgian imperial style extraction empire and bring all of it home,

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.600
then we can do the green transition, but no one else.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600
Now, this is not a recommendation.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.600
I'm just saying that the path we're on, this is the only way that it works.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.600
And even that would not be enough because you still have to turn it into processed material.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
Lithium ore is useless.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600
You have to turn it into lithium metal.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.600
The red bars are the stuff where that processing happens in either China or Russia.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600
And even that's not enough.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
You have to talk about finance.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.600
Here you're looking at the full cycle cost for natural gas combined cycle plant.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.600
The blue is the construction, the siding, the building.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.600
The gray is the fuel, full life cycle.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.600
This is a model you're familiar with.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
This is what you all do.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600
The idea is it's a subscription model.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600
You pay as you go.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600
That doesn't work for green tech.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.600
For green tech, it's almost all up front.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.600
This is wind.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Capital costs have tripled.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600
They will triple again.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:06.600
I think most of the plans that were put out there four years ago assumed that there would never be a 100 basis point increase in capital costs.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600
We've now gone up by 500.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.600
We have another 500 to go.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
The market can't support this.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.600
The IRA will help maybe sand down some edges.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.600
But we're going to have to do something that in the United States we really don't like doing.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.600
We're going to have to choose what we want to focus on.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.600
The smart play would be to put it solar panels where it's sunny, not in Massachusetts,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.600
put wind turbines where it's windy, not in Florida,

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.600
and wire the power to where we actually live.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600
But we're not going to do that.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.600
That's the smart thing.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600
Another matrix.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.600
If you're at the top, you want the government out of your personal life.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.600
If you're at the bottom, you think the government should regulate social norms in some way.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.600
If you're on the right, you want the government out of your wallet.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.600
If you're on the left, you think the government should intervene in people's wallets

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.600
to get the resources it needs to remake society in some way.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.600
You can combine these things.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:12.600
If you're at the bottom right, an economic and a social conservative,

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:18.600
you're opposed to food stamps on principle because famine builds character.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.600
If you're at the top left, a social liberal and an economic conservative,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:30.600
you're all of the bureaucrats and washing together for a big party where you'll serve arsenic cake.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.600
Here are our political factions.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.600
The single biggest effect that Donald Trump had is he elevated a faction to prominence

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.600
that really hadn't voted before.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.600
Most of the people who voted for him the first time he ran for president

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.600
hadn't voted in the previous four presidential elections.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.600
A lot of different estimates for how many people that is,

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.600
but all of them are north of 10 million voters.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.600
They are now not simply the single largest voting bloc in the country.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.600
They've taken over the Republican Party because in calling to these people,

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.600
Trump ended up picking fights with what he would call the rhinos.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.600
People who were the traditional leaders of the policy.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.600
He ejected them from his White House.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.600
He ran, he campaigned against their candidates in Congress

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.600
and he completely purged them from the Republican national conventions.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.600
They're not even present in the decision-making apparatus of the party now.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.600
And in effect, they've become swing voters.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:39.600
But he was able to attract other factions that were closer to his social conservative core supporters.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600
And a lot of people have switched sides.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600
This is the MAGA coalition.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.600
This is the Republican Party of today.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.600
This has lots of consequences.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.600
Let's focus on three.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.600
First, the unions are swing voters.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.600
That hasn't happened in a century and a half.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600
We're entering a period where we need to double the size of the industrial plant.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.600
How many of those jobs do you think are at Blue Collar?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.600
We have a labor shortage and we will for at least another decade, probably two.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.600
We're going to see the greatest increase in union activity and union power

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.600
in the history of the Republic in the next 10 to 20 years.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600
The business community are swing voters now.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.600
That hasn't happened in the last 150 years.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.600
And this is crazy because the unions versus business, that tug of war, that is modern economics.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.600
Their discussions, their debates, their compromises, their negotiations,

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.600
that is our economic policy for five generations.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.600
And these people are right now not even in the room.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.600
Part of the reason why economic policy out of both the Obama and the Trump administration

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:55.600
just seems so nuts is because there's no one in either administration that can do math.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.600
In fact, on both sides, they're kind of offended by the concept

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.600
that you need to be able to do math to run an economy.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.600
The group that most fancies themselves economists

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.600
in the Biden administration today are the Greens.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.600
Until such time as the unions or the business or both end up in one coalition or the other,

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.600
economic policymaking, decisions, choices about where we need to focus

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.600
are going to be completely divorced from reality.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.600
And this is going to last bare minimum for another presidential cycle.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.600
Now, we will get through this.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.600
The idea that the two economically most capable, competent, and numerous voting blocks

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.600
on these topics are going to remain outside the political system, that's silly.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.600
But it's going to take time for us to figure out where they're going to land.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:50.600
And the political coalition is going to look very, very different on the other side.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:58.600
So best of luck, because not only will you not be getting good guidance or regulation,

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.600
there isn't a logic to it.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.600
And that's just the environment you're operating in at a time

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.600
when you're going to have to at least double the grid.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.600
No pressure.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Okay, if you're looking for more, the link on the left goes to the newsletter and video log.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.600
It is free and I will never share your data with anyone.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.600
And this guy, if you see or read something that you're like, I would have paid for that,

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.600
if you think you would have paid, send it here, Medshare.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.600
They are a charity that I support.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.600
They provide medical assistance to communities who have lost the ability to look after themselves for reasons that are not their fault.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:42.600
So, for example, if the Russians bomb your power grid like they started doing again last week in Ukraine,

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:49.600
Medshare steps in with diesel generators and fuel for hospitals.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.600
How are we feeling?

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.600
Okay, I'm going to make the PDFs of this available for everybody.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.600
I have no problem with taking photos or whatever.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.600
But let's go ahead and do some Q&A.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.600
We have about 15 minutes for questions, so I don't know if you want to put the QR code up for submitting online,

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600
but anyone want to raise your hand?

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.600
Oh, you can ask without me knowing what it is?

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.600
We do have one that came in through the app, and it is way more fun if you just ask them live,

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600
so feel free to raise your hand.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.600
But the one that came through on the app is how important is it going to be to be able to speak Spanish in the United States

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.600
or have Latina leaders within our private organizations based on everything that you're talking about today?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.600
Yeah, so the Hispanic population in the United States, well, I mean, let's be honest, it's mostly, it's 80% Mexicans.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.600
The Mexican population in the United States is the fastest growing demographic.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.600
It is the youngest demographic.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:50.600
It is the demographic that is seen in increase in its value add and its educational system most quickly.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.600
And then, of course, it's obviously an interface with Mexico proper.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.600
So it really matters where you are, the closer to the Southwest border you happen to be, the bigger this issue is,

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.600
but it is going to be an issue for everyone.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.600
They're also the consumers of the future.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.600
Now, couple things to keep in mind.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:13.600
Number one, they are the demographic that we have absorbed in this country most quickly.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:20.600
Spanish disappears from Mexican migrants typically within one to two generations.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.600
That's the fastest ever.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:30.600
One of the really weird cultural things with Hispanics and especially with Mexicans is a lot of them think of the term gringo as an aspiration,

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.600
not as a pejorative.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:42.600
And if you ask a second generation Hispanic, they will probably on census forms say they're white.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.600
They see it as a cultural term, not a racial term.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.600
Now, does that mean I don't think you should work on Spanish skills?

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600
Not what I'm saying.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.600
I'm saying it might not be as critical on this side of the border as you think it is.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.600
The other side of the border, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:06.600
And let's be honest, the interface with the Hispanics of Mexico is going to be far more productive, far more cost effective,

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.600
and far more important than anything we have ever done with East Asia.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.600
And based on demographics, it will be for at least the next half century.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.600
So that is the future of not just your market and a large part of your workforce, but what allows you to do everything else.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.600
So yes, I would invest in it.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.600
I'm just saying you might not need it for what you think you need it for.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.600
Hi, I'm Jim Mooney from New York Transchool.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.600
You're saying no, who's asking you the question?

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.600
What role do you think AI plays in some of these equations going forward?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600
Oh, I forgot that.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.600
It's a big, a lot of concern everywhere for everything.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.600
Okay, so it probably isn't going to because those AI chips, the 10 nanometers and smaller,

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.600
those are the ones we're most likely to lose and not have for about a decade

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.600
while we rebuild the structured environment that allows us to build them at scale.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.600
Now, they're not going to go to zero, but we're going to have to choose what we're going to put them into.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600
Do we put into EVs?

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:17.600
Do we put into power management systems where, you know, there's one of those chips is in every smart meter for a house that also has solar panels.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.600
So that in theory is a bigger market than what we do for iPhones.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.600
Or do we put them in electric vehicles?

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600
Or do we put them in surfer farms?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.600
Because we're not going to have enough for all of that.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.600
We're going to have enough probably for one of those applications.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.600
And until we have that shortage, we haven't made up that decision.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:44.600
But the idea that we're going to be doing this at scale and have massive surfer farms with millions of these chips, that can't happen.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.600
Now, with chat GPT, we're seeing that this technology is probably now past the operational stage.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.600
So all we need are the chips.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.600
The question is, how long is it going to take us to rebuild that pipeline?

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.600
And I would say eight to 12 years.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.600
Daniel Sierra, Burns and McDonald.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600
Sorry, over here.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600
My apologies.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600
Thanks.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.600
So I guess you're talking about the Mexican market and the labor there.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.600
What happens after we use all that up, I guess, per se?

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.600
What's the next country that you see coming in the road?

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.600
Well, all of this is very inflationary because we're trying to do a lot with limited supply of capital and labor.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.600
If we do succeed in building the infrastructure down into central Mexico,

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.600
and the industrial plant does take form the way that the market seems like it's going to push for.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.600
It's going to be the same thing we did here.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:42.600
When we gobbled up all available labor in roughly 1990, just going to put a stake in the ground,

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.600
we found out we had to go up market.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.600
And we had to get better at using capital and labor more effectively,

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.600
and that's when we saw our productivity skyrocket.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.600
I would expect that we would have a secondary issue like that in the United States,

01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.600
and then Mexico will go through a 1990 style boom as they are forced to move up the value added scale.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.600
Now, Mexico over the last 30 years has moved up the value added scale at a faster rate than any country ever before.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.600
They're on average, I'd say, twice as productive as the average Chinese,

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.600
and their compensation is less than half as much.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.600
So they're already skewing towards being amazing.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.600
This will just speed it up, but it will be inflationary.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.600
Brandon Young, Young Management.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.600
Question for you is around technical education.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.600
Where are you seeing the trends going?

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:42.600
Will we run out of the younger generation wanting to go into more technical related roles like engineering, power utility?

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.600
Talk about that and when that's going to end.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.600
It's not going to end in the next 15 years.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600
Two things.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:56.600
Number one, the type of work we're probably going to see have the most price pressure is machine shops.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.600
It's a skill set that expands pretty quickly but on small scale,

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.600
and we're going to have to do a lot of the manufacturing and the maintenance

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.600
for things that you would normally just buy an entirely new component relatively close to your headquarters

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600
because it's going to have to be a patch job.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.600
We're not going to have the production that's necessary.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.600
Second, you're probably all going to have to do established training programs,

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:26.600
not in high schools but in elementary schools to build your own inflow for these jobs

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.600
because in an environment of very strict and increasing labor shortages,

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:37.600
whoever gets their hooks into the kids first is likely to be the ones who then get the labor when it's time.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.600
And the time to start on that was yesterday.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.600
We won't see...

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.600
We have to wait for the millennials' kids to enter the market.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.600
That's 2045.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:19:00.600
And so you're all fighting for a small pool of anti-social children.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Hi, Nelson Gomez, IEC engineering construction.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.600
So you seem like you're bearish on China, right?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.600
That's a word you could use, yeah.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:24.600
And to borrow your phrase, you said Russia is buying time by their current war.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:34.600
How do you view that kind of thought process applying to China as if Taiwan is a $14 trillion semiconductor market

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:40.600
and you're saying they don't have enough adults in 5, 10, 15, 20 years?

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.600
So how do you see that playing out and them making a move towards Taiwan in the next, I don't know, 5, 10 years?

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:55.600
So because of the information vacuum in China now, it's impossible to know whether or not there's going to be an attack

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.600
because Xi doesn't talk with anyone.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.600
There's no one's phone you can bug to find out what he's thinking.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.600
Also, if the Chinese were to make a move on Taiwan, even if they captured in a matter of six weeks without a shot fired,

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.600
they don't know how to operate those semiconductor facilities because they can't operate their own.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.600
They use imported labor to do all of the quality checks on all of the wafers.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.600
And the ones in Taiwan are the world's most advanced.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.600
The ones in China are very much the other side.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.600
So if they got them, they would just be big paper weights and obviously that would remove semiconductors for the rest of us,

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.600
but it wouldn't really help them technologically.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.600
And it would trigger, among other things, the United States to act militarily.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.600
And it's not like we would confront the Chinese and the South China Sea or anything.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.600
We'd probably just put a couple of destroyers in the Indian Ocean Basin and cut the energy flow

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.600
and cut the ability of them to import the things that need to grow their own food.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.600
So China would be facing a national collapse within a couple of years if they do pull the trigger on Taiwan.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.600
Normally, I would say that this would mean that they wouldn't even consider it.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.600
But again, Xi is now in an information black box and we can't rule it out.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:05.600
All I can tell you for sure is that one way or another, some country involved in the supply chain somewhere is going to crack.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:12.600
I'm actually more concerned about Germany than I am about Taiwan, but it would have the same impact.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:18.600
The Germans specifically make the lenses that allow all of the lithography to happen.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.600
No lenses, no lithography, no lithography, no chips.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:29.600
The hope, because people seem to like me to say things that are hopeful,

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:37.600
is that there is a new lithography technology that is coming out that has fewer parts

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.600
and doesn't require neon, which we're dependent on the Russians and the Chinese for,

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.600
that might, might, might have a simpler supply chain.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:53.600
But if we, like, ironed out all the kings of that today, it's not going to be applied at scale in Taiwan within three years.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:22:02.600
So there, there are potentially ways forward here, but I find it unlikely that we're going to be able to avoid a disruption in that specific market.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.600
It's just, it's too vulnerable to too many things.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.600
But probably not that one. Probably.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.600
If it does happen, well, then it's all gone.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.600
Over here.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.600
Hey, Peter, you talked a lot about Xi Jinping in China.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.600
I just wondered what your thoughts are on Vladimir Putin in Russia and what's going on.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:29.600
Okay, well, I mean, all world leaders, Democratic or otherwise, have problems with narcissism and ego.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.600
We're not immune to that.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.600
The question is how honest you are about your own capacity.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:45.600
So Putin has also established a bit of a cult of personality and has also purged the system of people who might rise up to replace them.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.600
But he started from a much lower base, which has shaped how much he's willing to carve out.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.600
So at the end of the Cold War, well, sorry, let me go back.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:02.600
1983, there was a coup in the Soviet Union and the intelligence services took over, purged all the other factions from the Communist Party.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.600
This is the un-drop-off coup.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.600
And he, a drop-off, Charnamird and Gorbachev, they were the first three, ran the country until the end.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:16.600
Putin is part of that clique and the intelligence professionals took over after the fall and have run it until now.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.600
And Putin has bit by bit removed people who he thought was threatening.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.600
And he hasn't done a lot to bring up a new generation from below.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:30.600
So Putin's inner circle today is less than 10 people, half of whom are utterly incompetent.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.600
But if you ever see anything by Dmitri Medvedev, the former president, he's the most incompetent of them.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.600
You can ignore whatever he says.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.600
But there are a few of them that actually do provide him with advice and context.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:55.600
So I think the best example I can give you is if you go back to the March, just after the war began, when Putin was making all the nuclear threats,

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.600
the U.S. ambassador was dispatched and the message was something like this.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Like, Mr. President, just think of things from a little different angle here.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.600
You remember back in January when you decided and you gave the order for the day the war was going to start

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.600
and you were in the bunker under the Kremlin that was completely sealed.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.600
It was walk-in safe, no electronics, no notes.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.600
And an hour after you left that meeting, we published the notes of the meeting in the media.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.600
That was our way of telling you that we know where your person is at any given moment.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:40.600
So if you think you can fling a nuke into the Western Hemisphere and the first half doesn't, we send back, are going to go anywhere except straight up.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.600
You're out of your mind, so stop it.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.600
The point is that Putin has meetings.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:56.600
He has people, he's discussed things, which means you can crack into the fact system in the email, you can tap the phones, there's ways to learn.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:03.600
And as bad as the demographic situation is in Russia, there's still a massive producer and exporter of food and energy,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.600
whereas China now has no inner circle, no communication, no way to find out anything,

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.600
and are the world's largest importer of pretty much everything that keeps people alive.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:25.600
So in the worst case scenario for the Russians, they will still persist longer than in the best case scenario for the Chinese.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.600
China's almost over.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.600
The Russians have at least another decade and a half to two decades.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.600
But this is still probably the last generation of Russian leadership.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:52.600
So Peter, with the labor shortages you articulated and sort of this focus on ESG across the world,

01:25:52.600 --> 01:26:07.600
how do you reconcile the idea of one undocumented workers or forced labor really being something that folks want to purge out of their supply chain?

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Is that, am I going to ask is it possible, but is it happy talk to say that?

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:20.600
No, I think it's reasonable. Two things to keep in mind. Number one, forced labor, different hemisphere.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.600
A lot of the stuff from that other hemisphere is going to stop anyway.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.600
And forced labor is going to be some of the least of our concerns when it comes to human rights issues.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.600
So I would expect those supply chains to wither for independent reasons.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Second, business community swing voters.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.600
One of the things that people missed about Governor DeSantis of Florida is that he hasn't gone to war with Disney.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600
He's gone to war with the Florida business community.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.600
ESG, is it doing a good job? Questionable.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.600
Is it taking us to where we need to go? I don't know.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:04.600
But since the business community is no longer part of the conversation, they are trying to figure out where they fit into American society.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.600
ESG is a component of that. It's an internal conversation.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:16.600
And so every business is approaching this from their own way based on their own circumstances, their own geography, their own politics, their own workforce.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.600
And of course they're all coming up with different conclusions, some of which are...

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:34.600
But when people on the left or the right yell at business about ESG, business just gets pissed off because they're doing the best they can when they're not allowed in the room.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:46.600
So when I hear people like Rahman Swani or DeSantis screaming about ESG, it's like all you are doing is making it easier for the business community to never support the Republican Party again.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:59.600
So there are consequences, and we're going to see them in the presidential and the general election next year, but they're going to be unpredictable in a way that we're not used to seeing out of that community.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.600
We're used to the business community being the adults in the room.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:14.600
Now, more specifically to your question about child labor, since there are no standards in ESG, since every company comes at it from their own angle for their own reasons,

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.600
there is no pattern in my opinion.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:24.600
So we're going to be waiting to see what happens in terms of international capacity to build this stuff,

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.600
and those countries are not going to snap an in neat order or all at once.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:43.600
So I hate to say this, this is a tier three supplier issue, and there is not going to be a database that allows us to map this on its way down.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:48.600
Hi, Andrea Hubianco from RWE.

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.600
I have a question.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:58.600
Do you think IQ Demographics plays a role into this global dynamic and also some population attributes like the flexibility, adaptability.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.600
That's all cultural stuff.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600
And yes, it does.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:12.600
It's a lot harder to map out than just the sheer numbers, but there's certainly indications that different cultures are better or worse at doing different things at different stages of the projection cycle.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.600
For example, Americans are very good at brain work.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.600
We have the highest value added designers in the world.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.600
The Mexicans are great at production.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.600
They're the highest value added manufacturers in the world.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:34.600
But if you were to increase the cost of labor in Mexico by a factor of five, they'd probably give us a run for our money.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.600
It's not an issue of us or them being smarter or dumber than the other one.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:45.600
They're at a different stage of their economic cycles and their growth, and we have different infrastructures to work with.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:55.600
So I've never seen a study that looks at race from an IQ point of view that has ever held up.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.600
Every time I've ever seen it, they've kind of thrown it out.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:01.600
It's at best noise, but that doesn't mean we're all in the same place.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.600
Hi, Peter. Kyle Penn from Bronson, McDonald.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:14.600
What would you say is the biggest impact to your models, your hypotheses based on who wins the next presidential election?

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600
Oh, I mean, I can tell you exactly who's going to win.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.600
It's going to be Biden. It's going to be a landslide.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.600
And we've known this for over a year.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:30.600
So one of the things about January 6th is it happened just after an election, so its effects haven't been fully felt in terms of who votes for who.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:42.600
But when we got to the midterms, despite expecting a red wave, we had a red burp in the house and a red loss in the Senate.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:50.600
And what we found out is that the independence in the United States had changed considerably.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:56.600
Couple things. Number one, Trump has basically told independence that the general election doesn't matter,

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:02.600
which means that the independents don't matter because the general election is the only place the independents have a voice.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.600
And so they reacted to that.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:17.600
In exit polling, something crazy like 85% of independents said that they despised the White House's economic policies

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.600
and felt that they hurt independents more than anyone else.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.600
And independents are fickle.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.600
They almost always switch sides every election.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.600
They get buyer's remorse.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:36.600
And in the time before they had voted for Biden, and now they were clearly fed up with them, but almost all of them voted for Democrats anyway.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:45.600
There's a saying in the State Department in the Middle East that we support one person, one vote, but not just one time.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:54.600
And if the independents were going to show up in numbers to vote against their own personal economic best interests in order to make sure they could vote again,

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.600
in an off year, you can bet they're going to do so in the general.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.600
Trump will probably carry no more than 12 states.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.600
And then the Republican Party is going to have to decide what to do with that.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.600
And the people who are...

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
Oh no, I broke it.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:24.600
The people who are here, the Rhinos, are going to have to decide if they want to try to wait it out, which hasn't worked yet, or move on.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.600
And we'll know within two years.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.600
Alright, I think we're going to do one more question.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.600
Okay.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.600
Good afternoon, Steve Thornhill with Burns and McDonald.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.600
I guess you keep talking about China's going to collapse, Germany's going to collapse.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.600
What does that look like? Is that anarchy? Is that revolution?

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.600
Well, let's start with the Germans, because that's probably simpler.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:54.600
Assuming for the moment that there's not a general European war, it will be a very organized decline, because they're German.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.600
And we will see individual sectors that the Germans are no longer competitive fall off one after another.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.600
That's already happened in chemicals. That's already happened in processing.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.600
I'd say the next really big one will probably be automotive.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.600
Automotive requires customers.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.600
And in Europe, that was tapped out a long time ago, and in China, it's been tapped out now for five years.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:21.600
And if they reclocate their supply chains to North America like the Japanese have, that means German workers aren't doing it anymore.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.600
So they're going to probably, things like transformers will probably be able to see some of the last things that they do at scale.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:32.600
And they just fade away, unless there's a security crisis, in which case God knows.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:42.600
China's collapsed over 20 times in its history, and every time it's gone down, they've lost at least a quarter of their population.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:50.600
Just playing the odds, because there's enough of a data set that you can do that with Chinese collapses,

01:33:50.600 --> 01:34:00.600
you get a civilizational break that kills over half the population, because they're so dependent on energy and food stuffs and food production inputs now.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:06.600
The North probably gets the worst of that. That's where about two-thirds of the population lives.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.600
And it'll probably fall into kind of a neo-Maus tyranny.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.600
And remember that G has purged everyone who's capable.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.600
So there's no backup governments, even at the local level, waiting in the wings, which probably means warlords.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.600
Again, Chinese history suggests that.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:27.600
And then the southern cities from Shanghai to Hong Kong, they don't back up to a hinterland.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.600
They're kind of divorced from the rest of the Chinese system always have been.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.600
And I would expect them to integrate with foreign powers in order to get food and energy.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.600
They'll trade their labor and their infrastructure to participate in someone else's supply chain.

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600
Historically speaking, that's usually how it's gone.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.600
These cities have gotten the majority of their calories from foreign partners for most of the last 1600 years.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.600
The communist period is a real aberration in terms of actually being united with the Chinese whole.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.600
That's probably how it goes down.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.600
But again, this is happening over 20 times. There's a lot of potential paths.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.600
That's not the worst one.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.600
Awesome. Let's give Peter a round of applause. Thank you so much.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600
Thank you.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600
Thank you.
