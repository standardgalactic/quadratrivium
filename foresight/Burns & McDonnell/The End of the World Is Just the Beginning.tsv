0	15000	Okay, we're ready to get started with our afternoon agenda and I am really pleased to
15000	20320	invite again to our best practice forum, Mr. Peter Zion.
20320	26120	Peter is an incredibly unique individual for those of you that had the pleasure of experiencing
26120	30080	his presentation last year in Colorado.
30080	37000	We got a lot of great feedback on how he was able to pack the meaning of life, the beginning
37000	41800	of the world, why paperclips cost what they do, and the world from A to Z and back again
41800	44560	and doesn't in a concise manner that makes everybody want more.
44560	48480	So we thought, hey, let's have him come out again this year and see what he's got in store
48480	49480	for us.
49480	54160	So really excited about it, hope you get as much from it this year as you did last year.
54160	56280	For those of you who are new, I hope you do the same.
56280	61160	So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome Peter Zion to the stage.
61160	62160	Peter.
62160	73760	Hey, everybody, you know, no one ever brings me in because they want to feel comfortable.
73760	79560	So it's always a little odd when I'm back, but this is the industry that is the most
79560	82040	notorious for being gluttonous for punishment.
82040	85360	So let's just go ahead and jump right in.
85360	90160	We're dealing with the end of a lot of things in the next five years.
90160	91960	Here's the partial list.
91960	96760	We're going to talk about the ones in the blue arrows, but this is basically my life
96760	99040	these days.
99040	104880	When you end a system, the globalized system, not everything makes it to the other side.
104880	106040	Things look different.
106040	109480	Some things do better, but everything changes.
109480	114560	And the problem is that all of our business plans assume that we're going back to where
114560	119320	we were five years ago, and that's not in the math.
119320	125520	So my goal here today is to give you an idea, some spotlights on the things that definitely
125520	130120	won't go back and how some other things are going to transform and maybe make your life
130120	131920	a little bit easier.
131920	135920	And we can come back to some of these in Q&A if I don't get to them.
135920	139680	So anyway, let's start with the simplest conclusion here.
139680	144200	If the product that you need comes on one of these, that's what's going away.
144200	150840	Internationalized supply chains, Asia-heavy, trans-oceanic, trans-specific, anything that
150840	155280	is on this, you have to question whether it's ever going to be delivered.
155280	161000	We now are in a situation where transformers are 36 to 42 months out.
161000	164920	Most of those are probably not going to arrive, and you need to plan accordingly.
165920	169160	If it comes on one of these, you're probably okay.
169160	173320	Roughly 80% of the trade between America and Mexico is on truck, and there's a number of
173320	178240	reasons why that's not great from a logistical point of view, but just for identifying what's
178240	181440	going to last.
181440	184000	Everything in that category probably will.
184000	186400	So there, that's the cheat version.
186400	190640	You can go look at your supply chains and make your choices accordingly.
190640	192200	Let's go ahead and jump into the rest of it though.
192200	196200	I know you guys have seen, everyone here has seen me at least once, right?
196200	197200	No.
197200	198200	No?
198200	199200	Well, okay.
199200	202080	This is for you.
202080	205040	This is a standard demographic profile.
205040	208560	You got children at the bottom, young adults, mature adults, retirees at the top, men on
208560	212400	one side, women on the other, mortality built into a pyramid.
212400	218640	And when you have a pyramidal demographic like this, there's a few common characteristics.
218640	225000	Number one, it's consumption driven because populations below age 40 consume a lot.
225000	229720	They're raising kids, they're buying cars, they're building homes.
229720	235120	That spending drives most modern systems, 70% in the case of the United States.
235120	240880	But their workers don't have a lot of expertise, so the value add is pretty low.
240880	246360	They have to import capital because most capital in a system comes from people over age 40.
246400	249880	People who are the kids have left home and the house has been paid down.
249880	259480	And so in a system like this, consumption driven, low investment, high imports, inflationary.
259480	264360	This is Korea in the 50s at the dawn of the globalized era.
264360	267680	Globalization meant that we could move off the farm and into towns to take industrial
267680	268880	jobs.
268880	274480	And when you do that, kids go from being free labor to an expense and adults aren't dumb,
274480	278120	so two generations on, here's where the Koreans are now.
278120	280480	Very different model.
280480	284200	People age 40 to 65 have decades of work experience.
284200	285920	They're capital rich.
285920	289320	That pays for investment, that pays for the tax base.
289320	293920	But there aren't a lot of young people to consume, so you get a more disinflationary
293920	300800	economic model that has to export because there's not enough people locally to buy all the stuff.
300800	306480	The whole world has gone down this Korean path at different speeds from different starting
306480	307640	points.
307640	311880	But the point is this capital rich environment that we become used to, this was always never
311880	314440	more than a moment in time.
314440	320640	And it ends this decade because everyone in the advanced world is aging out.
320640	326400	And later this decade, the Koreans, the Germans, the Italians, the Russians, the Chinese will
326400	332040	all age out of being investment rich and will be retirement heavy.
332040	334840	And we have no idea what that looks like from an economic point of view.
334840	338480	It's never happened in human history ever.
338480	342840	Now in the United States, we're kind of in the middle.
342840	345280	Largely because we have more elbow room.
345280	348080	And this means that we're in a different situation from everybody else.
348080	350800	But that still means some of the same lessons apply.
350800	355760	So number one, the boomers are retiring, largest generation we've ever had, largest worker group
355760	360040	we've ever had, largest investment base we've ever had.
360040	362120	Half of them have already moved into retirement.
362120	364480	The rest will over the next six years.
364480	367520	And so we know capital costs have to go up.
367520	371520	What we've seen so far, we're only about halfway.
371520	374280	So capital costs have about tripled in the last three years.
374280	377320	It's going to triple again.
377320	379240	Plan for that.
379240	385280	Second, largest generation ever, another way of saying largest workforce ever.
385280	389280	And if you look at the kids at the bottom, the Zoomers, that's our smallest generation
389280	390760	ever.
390760	392040	It's simple math.
392040	395760	Between the boomers leaving and the Zoomers coming in last year, we lost out of the workforce
395760	397240	a half a million workers.
397240	401280	It'll be about that same loss again, excuse me, this year.
401280	407120	And that number will increase every year for the next 11 before the annual shortfall peaks
407120	412240	at about 900,000 in roughly 2034.
412240	418560	Then that number will start to shrink, but we don't expect it to start to grow again
418560	425200	in terms of the labor force in large numbers until 2045.
425200	429280	So higher, borrow, higher, borrow, higher, borrow.
429280	435240	These are the cheapest capital costs and the cheapest labor costs we will have for at least
435240	436240	a decade.
436240	438440	And in some cases too.
439320	445120	Third, the quality of the incoming labor is very different.
445120	449040	Now the boomers have dominated everything for so long, we think of their examples as
449040	450040	normal.
450040	451040	They're a social generation.
451040	454440	Their kids, the millennials, are a social generation.
454440	459520	The incoming ones, the Zoomers are not a social generation.
459520	462920	They're a little pathological.
462920	465040	And they are not group workers.
465040	470160	They don't want to work anywhere where they're going to see us, another person or the sky.
470160	473840	Which makes it hard for you guys to do what you're going to do.
473840	479600	So again, labor is the cheapest and most familiar to you right now that it's going to be for
479600	481280	the next 20 years.
481280	483440	Hire everyone you can.
483440	486240	And then finally there's technology.
486240	491360	Technology as a sector requires two things.
491360	496280	First of all, scads of people in their 20s and early 30s who have malleable minds who
496280	501160	are social, who can work together, who can imagine the future and then build that into
501160	507640	a prototype and operationalize it and bring it into mass manufacturing.
507640	510800	That has been the millennials for the last 20 years.
510800	511800	And they're aging out.
511800	516520	The oldest millennials this year turn 44.
516520	520640	We're starting to see the leading edge of their midlife crises.
520640	524000	And it's delicious.
524000	529000	But it also means that that younger block of social people just doesn't exist in the
529000	530560	way it has in the past.
530560	533120	And the second that you need for tech is capital.
533120	536000	Because until you get to that mass manufacturer, there's no income.
536000	540600	You have to pay for all of that up front and the money just isn't there anymore.
540600	544600	So even if everything else goes perfectly smoothly, we know we're entering into a tech
544600	548080	winter for at least the next 15 years.
548080	552400	The pace of advancement is going to slow considerably.
552400	554960	That assumes that it doesn't reverse.
554960	556880	Here are the big four economies that we care about.
556880	559720	The US is obviously the healthiest of the rich world.
559720	566160	Mexico, notice how it goes down, hits a 30-year-old and then it goes straight down, pros and
566160	567160	cons of that model.
567160	571000	Basically, what you're seeing is Mexico was a latecomer to industrialization.
571000	576600	They really didn't start the move from farm to city until after one in the 90s.
577240	582040	If they keep aging at that rate in 50 years, we're going to have a very big problem.
582040	585400	But in the meantime, when you've got a lot of people who are entering their 20s and 30s
585400	590120	who don't have a lot of kids, it's a much more consumption-heavy pattern.
590120	592800	And so Mexico became our largest trading partner last year.
592800	595720	It is a role they will not give up on our lives.
595720	600560	There may be some problems down the road in the 20s, 70s.
600560	603480	We got time to figure that out, so do they.
603480	605560	The Germans do not.
605560	607520	The Germans are aging faster than the Koreans.
607520	611760	This was always going to be their last decade as an industrial economy.
611760	614120	It's not that they're running out of kids.
614120	616080	That happened in the 80s.
616080	621040	They're now running out of working-aged adults.
621040	625680	If you get stuff from Germany, it's time to move on.
625680	626920	And then there's the Chinese.
626920	633600	This was already one of the fastest aging societies in the historical record.
633600	636800	And two months ago, the Chinese updated the data.
636800	645560	They've had a 70% drop in the birth rate since just 2017.
645560	648440	That tells me two things.
648440	654840	Number one, China will cease to be a coherent economic power, a coherent nation state this
654840	661720	decade, and the Han ethnicity will probably vanish from the world this century.
661720	667080	It could happen a lot faster, because the Shanghai Academy of Sciences, all the brainiacs
667080	670800	who are responsible for interpreting the data, even the new data is wrong.
670800	675320	We've overcounted the population by over 100 million people, and these yellow bars probably
675320	678760	don't even exist.
678760	684920	That has obviously a whole boatload of complications and consequences.
684920	685920	Let's go through them.
685920	687760	Let's start with consumption.
687760	691520	This is vehicular miles traveled.
691520	693280	They're down to 40% of their peak.
693280	696160	Now, obviously, COVID is part of that.
696160	702880	But in the six months since COVID lockdowns ended, they haven't picked up at all.
702880	703880	Why?
703880	704880	Demographics.
704880	707920	The people who are most likely to be mobile are people in their 20s.
707920	712400	And we're now discovering that over the course of the last six years, they've run out.
712400	714640	Or you can look at the purchasing power.
714640	716160	Here's vehicle sales.
716160	720480	Now whenever a country modernizes in the current age, everybody wants the same four things.
720480	721880	They want a smartphone.
721880	723200	They want a refrigerator.
723200	728140	They want climate control, typically AC, and they want a car.
728140	731600	The red line here is the 12-month moving average.
731600	735920	You'll notice not only have they not recovered to pre-COVID levels, they peaked a year and
735920	739320	a half before COVID.
739320	744880	Now if you think back on the last five, six years, a lot of it has gone down.
744880	748880	We've had the Trump administration, which was like living inside of a bullhorn.
748880	753800	We had COVID, which scrambled all the data, even if everyone was being conscientious about
753800	757120	it, which no one was.
757120	759960	China has disappeared into a cult of personality.
759960	763600	And the information that we normally would be able to assess either hasn't been there
763600	764720	or has been overshadowed.
764720	769000	But now that COVID's behind us and the Trump administration is behind us, we're getting
769000	771960	a kind of a look under everybody's hood.
771960	775880	And we're discovering in the last five, six years, we've hit a lot of turning points that
775880	778360	we kind of missed.
778360	785080	In the case of China, they now say that the Chinese population peaked last year.
785080	789800	But as they're interpreting the data five years on, they're discovering actually that
789800	793280	probably happened 12 years ago.
793280	799520	They found out that the American population became younger than the average Chinese citizen
799520	801440	probably four years ago.
801440	805920	Turns out that was probably back in 2006.
805920	809960	China has surpassed China to become the largest population this year.
809960	812800	That probably happened in 2014.
812800	816160	We're finally getting a kind of a clear look.
816160	819080	And we've missed China's peak.
819080	823520	And it's not that we're at a plateau, it's we're already on the backside of that mountain.
823520	828320	And it's only going to accelerate because if you have a 70% drop in the birth rate,
828320	831640	you are looking at national oblivion.
831640	835520	Now, how do you get something like this to grow if there's no consumption?
835520	837760	Well, you've got three types of economic growth.
837760	838960	Your first one's consumption led.
838960	839960	That's the United States.
839960	841120	That's Mexico.
841120	843680	The second one is export led.
843680	844680	That's Germany.
844680	845680	That's Korea.
845680	848040	And the third one is investment led.
848040	852720	You basically throw money to build infrastructure, to build industrial plant.
852720	855240	And that activity of the expansion is what drives the system.
855240	859640	And that has always been China's number one source of growth.
859640	860880	Most of it is driven by debt.
860880	862720	And this is a debt graphic.
862720	868000	So the orange line, that's corporate, the gray line is government, and the blue is household.
868000	872120	I need to put this all in perspective because this doesn't look very dramatic, does it?
872120	877600	Well, number one, let's look at corporate because that's the biggest chunk.
877600	884160	Back at the beginning of this data in 2006, that was already more debt in absolute terms,
884160	887840	not relative, absolute terms than the entire American corporate world.
887840	889520	And it then doubled.
890320	894120	Second, this is in percent of GDP.
894120	897760	So if the Chinese have been having 5% to 10% growth a year, that means the debt has been
897760	900260	going up by 10% to 20% a year.
900260	903240	So the absolute numbers are much bigger than this suggests.
903240	911440	Third, the government debt, that's a bigger build than Trump.
911440	914360	That's a bigger build than Obama.
914360	917040	And it's all local debt.
917040	919440	Say what you will about the federal government's debt program.
919440	920440	Is it responsible?
920440	921440	No.
921440	926960	But they have the Fed to bail them out if they need to because ultimately federal debt
926960	931440	is backed by the currency where the global currency, the Federal Reserve, can change
931440	934160	the money supply with a click of a button.
934160	938800	You can't do that if it's Chicago.
938800	946960	And so they've added $10.5 trillion of local debt in 15 years, which is about three times
947000	950440	what our total local debt exposure is.
950440	952400	And then finally there's households.
952400	956240	Now their household debt has now surpassed US household debt.
956240	960360	But the crazy thing is, that's the good news.
960360	963640	You guys been watching what's been happening with real estate in China lately?
963640	964640	Oh my god.
964640	967600	Okay, so you know, ghost cities, we've all heard about them.
967600	971400	The red circles are where no one lives in a ghost city.
971400	976960	And the orange circles are where governments have moved in but no one has followed.
976960	979760	Now, two things from this.
979760	984560	Number one, most of the real estate was paid for with cash.
984560	986560	It was not lent.
986560	989240	It's owned outright.
989240	993520	When you have an investment-led system that distorts the capital structure so much, people
993520	998080	are desperate to find ways to preserve and grow their money.
998080	1002640	The Chinese government prevents people from sending money abroad, so they have to find
1002640	1007040	something at home that usually go for real estate.
1007040	1011120	So for your average Chinese citizen, over 85% of their savings is in some sort of real
1011120	1014040	estate function.
1014040	1015680	Here's the crazy part.
1015680	1021400	The overbuild in subprime was 3 to 4% of the housing stock in the United States, and we
1021400	1023920	know how that felt.
1023920	1029440	The overbuild in China is 100% to 200%.
1029440	1038920	They have enough spare condos to house somewhere between one and a half and three billion people.
1038920	1046480	The market value of product in that sort of environment, it's probably 10% to 20% of what
1046480	1048640	they paid for it.
1048640	1054920	So when this goes down, it's not so much that it's a financial hit to the country.
1054920	1060800	No, because it's not on the debt sheet, but it destroys the sum total of the population's
1060800	1063440	life savings.
1063440	1070440	So on top of everything else that the Chinese have going on, you're looking at 1.5 billion
1070440	1078160	people who are probably going to be a little upset in the not-too-distant future.
1078160	1082760	And that's assuming there's not a war, which there probably will be.
1082760	1084320	This is an energy flow graphic.
1084320	1087680	So the green bars on the left, those are net oil exports.
1087680	1089360	The red on the right are net oil imports.
1089360	1091800	You'll notice how conveniently close together they are.
1091800	1097440	It's about a 5,500 to 7,000-mile sale from the Persian Gulf energy fields to the Northeast
1097440	1100520	Asians based on where you start and where you stop.
1100520	1108120	Now, this route is how everything is shipped right now, the coastal route.
1108120	1111200	It's the short route.
1111200	1116520	The Chinese have dozens of weapons systems that can interfere with that route.
1116520	1121160	So if we get into a shooting war because of something with the Iranians or the Saudis
1121160	1124600	or let's say Russian energy goes offline and prices go up, there's not enough left for
1124600	1130200	everybody, you get a roving naval war between the Japanese and the Chinese, the tankers won't
1130200	1138440	use that route, they'll take this longer route that avoids the Chinese coast.
1138440	1144560	China has a big Navy, 600 ships, twice ours, but about two-thirds of those vessels would
1144560	1148440	fit in this room.
1148440	1153000	Not at the same time don't be dumb.
1153000	1155960	The point is they don't have range.
1155960	1161280	Only about 8 to 10% of those ships can sail more than 1,000 miles without a refuel.
1161280	1164800	That 1,000-mile range assumes that they're going slow in a straight line to save fuel,
1164800	1167840	not that they're like dodging missiles.
1167840	1172080	The Chinese cannot project power, they can't control their own sea lanes, they are utterly
1172080	1176680	dependent upon freedom of the seas in order to function.
1176680	1182080	And so if we do get a shooting war, the energy stops, their entire transport system shuts
1182080	1187520	down, the natural gas that they import in a liquid-fied form goes away, their chemical
1187520	1193320	sector dies the next day, and China will disassociate within a year.
1193320	1197400	And since they import 80% of the stuff they used to grow their own food, we also get a
1197400	1202520	family that kills hundreds of millions of people within two years.
1202520	1209080	Now, the Chinese government was well aware of this five years ago, but over the last
1209080	1216800	five years, it stopped functioning as a government because Xi has purged the system so thoroughly
1216800	1222720	of anyone who is even theoretically competent in order to prevent anyone from rising up
1222720	1226080	from below to potentially challenge him or replace him.
1226080	1230840	And in doing so, he has so terrified the bureaucracy at this point that no one will bring him
1230840	1233480	information at all.
1233480	1238920	As a result, the system is breaking down, and their ability to collect data, much less
1238920	1241880	process it and publish it, has basically stopped.
1241880	1245080	Now, some of these things are ego-driven.
1245080	1249600	So for example, the Chinese just stopped collecting information on COVID because they didn't want
1249600	1252720	everyone to know how many people died when they did their opening.
1252720	1253720	We just don't know.
1253720	1256280	We don't even have an educated guess, honestly.
1256280	1259160	But some of this stuff really matters, youth unemployment.
1259160	1261840	We don't know what the status of the next generation is.
1261840	1265280	Patents, which supposedly you need for an information-based society.
1265280	1268520	The information is no longer collected.
1268520	1270020	Bond purchases.
1270020	1273960	How the hell do you have a bond market if you don't know what's on offer and who is
1273960	1274960	buying what?
1274960	1279240	That was supposedly how they were going to get away from an investment-led system to
1279240	1280560	have a different debt market.
1280560	1282240	That's gone.
1282240	1287440	But the ones that scare me the most are more personal.
1287440	1295200	Personal biographies, college dissertations, because that's how young people get a foot
1295200	1298400	in the system and move up.
1298400	1302680	And G's made sure that they can't so they can never challenge him.
1302680	1305080	So it's just him.
1305080	1312720	Now, my biggest criticism of Barack Obama is he believed he was the smartest person
1312720	1314320	in the room and he would tell people that.
1314320	1317400	His first meeting with the Joint Chief, you know, he got all the three and the four stars
1317400	1318400	in the room.
1318400	1319800	He said, I'm smarter than all of you.
1319800	1322760	I can do your jobs better than all of you.
1322760	1327200	Let's assume for the moment that Barack Obama was correct.
1327200	1332320	So you're going to do everyone's jobs here and your own.
1332320	1334080	No, no, no.
1334080	1337360	G has done that for the entire country.
1337360	1340040	Decisions cannot be made without him.
1340040	1344120	The reason he didn't show up to the G20 summit wasn't because he was mad at the Indians.
1344120	1345760	Well, although he was.
1345760	1349840	It's because he had to do it at home because he's the only one who can make decisions.
1349840	1354720	And I think the best way to kind of explain how this is leading to a state collapse is
1354720	1357880	that stupid balloon.
1357880	1362880	Now, I'm not a balloon expert.
1362880	1365000	It's just not in my field.
1365000	1367320	And neither is the American president.
1367320	1371040	But we had pretty much the same response when the thing crossed over from Canada.
1371040	1374560	But I'm sure Canada's at fault for this somehow.
1374560	1377640	It was like, shoot the thing down.
1377640	1379640	Let's see what we're dealing with.
1379640	1382800	I mean, the balloon was 350 feet across.
1382800	1387480	It was dangling something the size of an Embraer jet was like 14 times the size of the plane
1387480	1394160	that I flew on here yesterday, which was tiny unless it's dangling from a balloon.
1394160	1396800	So I mean, obviously, it was a spy platform.
1396800	1400200	So let's shoot it down and see what we got.
1400200	1406360	The DOD and the CIA, Secretary and Director, went to President Biden, like, Mr. President,
1406360	1407360	please don't shoot this thing down.
1407360	1408520	I mean, we're not threatened.
1408520	1411240	We really are not concerned about this.
1411240	1412240	We know where it's going.
1412240	1416280	It's going to float over the missile silos in Montana.
1416280	1419880	But Mr. President, unless you're planning on like firing a few dozen nukes in the next
1419880	1422000	few days, those hatches are going to be closed.
1422000	1424200	They're always closed, Mr. President.
1424200	1427880	The Chinese will get photos of closed hatches from seven miles away.
1427880	1430600	We are not scared about this.
1430600	1435640	But Mr. President, there's an opportunity here, because if you let this thing go on
1435640	1441960	its merry way, we'll put a spy helicopter below it and a spy plane above it and every
1441960	1447200	whisper sensor we have, and we will track over the next nine days, and we'll copy all
1447200	1451640	their cryptography, we'll trace the signals through the civilian transfer information
1451640	1455760	exchange network, we'll see which satellites they're using, and we will trace it back not
1455760	1458640	to the city, not to the block, not to the building, not to the floor, not to the office,
1458640	1461920	to the terminal that is doing the controls.
1461920	1465440	And Mr. President, we have the best hackers in the world.
1465440	1468040	We will hack that bit of a terminal.
1468040	1472320	We will find out who is on it, and then we will trace them using signals intelligence
1472320	1475320	and map out their whole world.
1475320	1485640	Mr. President, the Chinese have handed us the intelligence breakthrough of the decade.
1485640	1488080	All you have to do is let the thing flow.
1488080	1490960	And then when it gets over in North Carolina, we'll shoot it down and we'll get the hardware
1490960	1493900	too, which we did.
1493900	1502400	We now know that Xi was unaware of the balloon's existence until after it was shot down.
1502400	1504240	He's that much in the dark.
1504240	1505360	No one would tell him.
1505360	1508640	We now know that their Ministry of Defense was unaware of it until it crossed into American
1508640	1509640	airspace.
1509640	1514200	It was just some in the intelligence bureau who thought this is what Wolf Warrior diplomacy
1514200	1515200	means.
1515200	1517640	This is how you stick it to the Americans.
1517640	1522920	We're seeing breakdowns like this at every government level in every economic sector.
1522920	1530880	The capacity of the Chinese to make decisions to flow information has stopped.
1530880	1536600	This was the dumbest thing I have seen any country do in the last 20 years.
1536600	1542520	And if you think back on the last two decades, there has been so much dumb.
1542520	1547600	This is what state failure looks like in the early stages.
1547600	1557480	So yes, China, 10 years tops, but it can end so much faster.
1557480	1559120	Let's talk credit.
1559120	1561920	This is the American private credit curve.
1561920	1566360	From the beginning in 2000 to that bump in the middle, that's the subprime build.
1566360	1568880	We doubled total private credit in seven years.
1568880	1569880	It was too much.
1569880	1571600	It was too fast.
1571600	1576640	And we had a recession that knocked 5% off of headline GDP because of it.
1576640	1580240	Since then, we've picked up the growth, but at something a lot more similar to the century
1580240	1581240	average.
1581240	1584480	It doesn't mean I think we have no concerns in the space.
1584480	1586640	This is just to give us a benchmark.
1586640	1589960	Doubling seven years, 5% recession.
1589960	1592120	Got it?
1592120	1595560	Same data, different scale.
1595560	1597560	Here are the Canadians.
1597560	1601400	Now, you'll notice in the early part of the stage, they were doing something similar
1601400	1603600	to us, but a little bit lower.
1603600	1608400	In fact, up until 2007, the Canadians, I would argue, had the healthiest banking sector in
1608400	1611080	the world, good risk management.
1611080	1613160	And then we had the great recession.
1613160	1616320	And the Canadians did something that was very Canadian.
1616320	1617600	Americans just had the worst recession ever.
1617600	1621320	We can totally have a worse recession.
1621320	1627600	And they dismantled all of the risk management they had put into place over the last 30 years,
1627600	1632600	pulled down on every mistake that we made, and their credit swelled, and it contributed
1632600	1635360	to the housing crisis they're having now.
1635360	1642640	Then they got to about 2014, like, oh, oh, oh, maybe we don't want to win this one.
1642640	1644320	And they dialed it back.
1644320	1649560	I'd say they're not out of the woods yet, but it looks better now than it did a decade
1649560	1650560	ago.
1650560	1653600	Here are the Germans.
1653600	1657880	If you're in Germany and you want to buy a house, you don't get your 20% together and
1657880	1660160	go to the bank for the other 80.
1660160	1663560	You tell the bank that you want to buy a house and you're like, great.
1663560	1667120	So what you need to do is figure out what your mortgage would be if we gave you the
1667120	1671160	loan and deposit that with us on the first of the month, and then again the next month
1671160	1675120	and then the next month and the next month for 60 months.
1675120	1678280	Then we will talk about your loan application.
1678280	1683880	You have to prove that you're not a credit risk for five years first.
1683880	1686240	There are problems in the German system.
1686240	1690560	A credit overbuild is not one of them.
1690560	1692720	But it is in Greece.
1692720	1694560	Sevenfold increase of credit in seven years.
1694560	1699120	So far, their economic adjustments down has knocked 60% off of GDP.
1699120	1702720	I would have said three years ago had another 20% to go, but then COVID happened and all
1702720	1705160	the numbers.
1705160	1707720	Here is Australia.
1708080	1712400	One of the fun things about the United States during subprime is at the height of the crisis
1712400	1719280	in August of 2007, the FDIC chair, the Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve chair all
1719280	1724560	crowded around a two-top in a bar in Washington and over the course of about a 45-minute conversation
1724560	1730840	worked out the bare bones of what eventually became TARP, which was our restitution program
1730840	1732400	for subprime.
1732400	1736400	That was the model that we followed until the end of the crisis.
1736400	1742440	It said in very American terms that if you f*** up, you lose.
1742440	1748200	So whether you were the lender or the lendi, there were losses taken.
1748200	1754520	The government money was only there for people to reconstitute.
1754520	1758800	And if you made a mistake, you didn't get everything back.
1758800	1763480	It was something to stabilize the financial sector and not bail out individuals or corporations.
1763480	1766040	And broadly speaking, it worked.
1766080	1772600	Now, the Australians did something very similar when they set up their restitution program,
1772600	1776920	but they didn't call anyone to account.
1776920	1779760	Every mortgage was backed 100%.
1779760	1787040	Furthermore, they changed the laws, so if you could prove that you could pay your mortgage
1787040	1795640	with a 100% government guarantee, you automatically qualified for a second mortgage and a third
1795640	1798720	and a fourth.
1798720	1801240	They haven't had their adjustment yet.
1801240	1807240	And when they do, oh, my God, here is Brazil.
1807240	1809960	You know, we're all, like, ripped up about our politics.
1809960	1815240	The fact that we might be facing, probably we'll be facing another Biden-Trump showdown
1815240	1819320	in the general, old hat for the Brazilians.
1819320	1821480	They've already done it twice.
1821480	1828120	And their candidates, one guy was campaigning from prison where he had been convicted of
1828120	1830600	corruption, not indicted, convicted.
1830600	1834480	And the other guy said that the real problem with those Nazis is they were just way too
1834480	1838040	soft on their domestic opponents.
1838040	1840080	The Nazi won the first round.
1840080	1843840	The guy in prison ran the second time.
1843840	1852320	I'd argue that Brazil has already entered the first of two decades of lost time.
1852320	1854360	Here's India.
1854360	1859120	Prime Minister Modi adopted something very similar to what the Australians did, but you
1859120	1863960	only got the money if you were one of his friends.
1863960	1867320	And here are the Chinese.
1867320	1873040	Let me adjust this for you.
1873040	1876360	Are you kidding me?
1876360	1882480	How anyone thinks that China is a serious player on the international playground is
1882480	1884220	beyond me.
1884220	1889080	We are looking at the equivalent of Enron in the 11th hour.
1889080	1893200	The question is, when it falls, what does it do?
1893200	1895360	I'm not really worried about it from a strategic point of view.
1895360	1897000	They can't really reach anyone.
1897000	1898480	I'd be a little nervous.
1898480	1900720	I'm from Taiwan, obviously.
1900720	1902920	But I'm more worried about the economic consequences.
1902920	1906400	And we're starting to see the faint outlines of what that's going to look like.
1906400	1907400	So good and bad.
1907400	1908400	Let's start with the good.
1908400	1910680	I'm not worried about finance.
1910680	1913320	And that's courtesy, ironically, of the Russians.
1913320	1918320	When the Ukraine war started, every Western financial institution cut their exposure to
1918320	1920400	Russian banks to zero.
1920400	1923800	The Chinese flooded into the space to take over.
1923800	1928120	And that meant that every Western institution was like, whoa, that's like screaming for
1928120	1929120	sanctions.
1929120	1932480	We cut our connections to the Chinese as well.
1932480	1934840	And here we are, a year and a half into the war.
1934840	1940760	And the total exposure of all Western banks to all Chinese banks is less than 1% of their
1940760	1943880	global holdings.
1943880	1945000	That's a happy circumstance.
1945000	1946000	I like that.
1946000	1950320	I'm also not worried about merchandise exports to the Chinese because it's a very protectionist
1950320	1951320	system.
1951320	1952320	They build anything they possibly can.
1952320	1958400	They import as little as they can, which means that the total exposure, the entire world
1958400	1964800	to the Chinese consumer is only about 3.5% of Chinese GDP, which is the lowest goods
1964800	1967440	exposure of any country today.
1967440	1971480	It's not zero, but it's manageable.
1971480	1975800	If you're in the world of commodities, different situation.
1975800	1978240	It's investment-driven, building things that they don't need.
1978240	1982360	So whether it's copper or steel or aluminum, they are the world's largest player, often
1982360	1985240	the world's largest importer.
1985760	1990160	Even if we have to rebuild a lot of industrial plant in other places, the industrial plant
1990160	1994080	we build in other places is going to be based on economics and efficiency rather than just
1994080	1995080	build.
1995080	1997480	We're not going to need as much.
1997480	2002360	And so those sectors are going to have some serious downward adjustments.
2002360	2003360	Food's kind of in the middle.
2003360	2007640	The Chinese are the world's largest importer of almost every food product.
2007640	2011720	Their diet has expanded massively in the last 35 years.
2011720	2015360	And that is probably going to break down, but consider this.
2015360	2021840	The last thing a government does before it collapses is somehow take steps to restrict
2021840	2024840	the population's access to food.
2024840	2028840	So of the things that are going to break, it's probably the last one to go, and it'll
2028840	2033680	be a little bit of a softer landing because we still need food.
2033680	2035440	Tech's going to be an issue.
2035440	2038800	The Chinese are not technically advanced.
2038800	2042240	Most of what they do in manufacturing is relatively low value.
2042240	2047120	And they bring in tech from everyone they can to build that industrial plant.
2047120	2050800	And in terms of tech supply change, they tend to be on the assembly side of things with
2050800	2054800	more advanced stuff coming from Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, and the rest.
2054800	2058760	That whole ecosystem is going to end.
2058760	2065200	And there aren't enough fingers and eyes in the world to do assembly on the scale we've
2065200	2067160	become used to.
2067160	2070720	And that's going to probably be what hurts us most of all.
2070720	2074800	This is a document from the American Enterprise Institute on inflation.
2074800	2080120	The yellow arrows are the average inflation since the year 2000, so roughly a 75% increase
2080120	2083000	in inflation over the 22 years.
2083000	2086120	Everything that is below that line has gotten cheaper.
2086120	2089280	Everything above that line has gotten more expensive.
2089280	2092560	Over simplifying here, but above the line, those are the things that require fingers
2092560	2093800	and eyes.
2093800	2096240	Healthcare, for example, requires people.
2096240	2098400	There's no way around that.
2098400	2101920	And everything below it is something you plug into the wall that beeps and worse.
2101920	2103720	Something that's manufactured.
2103720	2107280	And the Chinese are a critical component of all of that.
2107280	2112360	The biggest hole we're going to have when the Chinese go is the complex supply chains
2112360	2117880	in the world of electronics is going to find a new way to put things together.
2117880	2122200	And we haven't developed a new model for that in 60 years.
2122200	2124160	And we're going to have to.
2124160	2127680	Now, that doesn't mean it's going to be a disaster because one of the many things we
2127680	2133760	found out about COVID is that the technology that we've had in pocket for years suddenly
2133760	2135680	can be used at scale.
2135680	2139800	I think the best example I can give you is textiles.
2139800	2143880	Back before NAFTA, most of our textile processing wears in places like Kentucky where it was
2143880	2145280	done by hand.
2145280	2148840	And then NAFTA happened and it all moved to Mexico because it was cheaper.
2148840	2153920	And then the WTO happened and it all moved to China and India because it was cheaper.
2153920	2156480	But with COVID, it just stopped coming.
2156480	2160880	And we still wanted clothes, so we had to figure out a different method.
2160880	2165800	And we discovered that if you build a two-acre facility that's automated with a staff of
2165800	2172920	two, one software engineer, one mechanic, that one facility could produce finished clothes
2172920	2179200	at a lower cost per garment than 200 seamstresses in Bangladesh.
2179200	2183280	You bring in the cotton, the machines turn it into the thread, turn it into yarn, turn
2183280	2187600	it into cloth, cut it into clothes, assemble it, even do some of the finishing.
2187600	2190480	We would have never known that before 2020.
2190480	2194920	Hopefully, we will figure things like that out in other sectors.
2194920	2201080	But that means we need a lot of investment and an era of constrained capital in order
2201080	2207800	to happen at scale in every single manufacturing sector.
2207800	2210080	We've started.
2210080	2213440	The blue line is what happened with the shale sector.
2213440	2217280	About 2012, that is when the majority of the natural gas consumed on this continent came
2217280	2218280	from shale.
2218280	2219400	A lot of that's waste gas.
2219400	2223880	And so we tripled our investment in a couple of years and it hasn't fallen back.
2223880	2227120	The refining sector, the chemicals effects are all expanding very quickly.
2227120	2230680	It's actually the biggest build we've seen ever in the history of the country, faster
2230680	2233180	than World War II.
2233180	2237440	The gray bar is kind of the everything else category and it's sliding up.
2237440	2240440	You'll notice that in the last couple of years, it's picked up quite a bit.
2240440	2243400	This is where we're all noticing it, though.
2243400	2245640	This is electronics and computing.
2245640	2249480	Now a lot of people are like, isn't this all the IRA and the CHIPS Act and that's some
2249480	2250480	of it.
2250480	2251800	Can I even get back here?
2251800	2252800	Yeah.
2252800	2253800	Okay.
2253800	2257080	This spot right here, that's where the CHIPS Act and the IRA were passed.
2257080	2260240	So all of this happened before.
2260240	2264480	The industry, the industrial base is expanding significantly.
2264480	2268440	But we need that kind of jack up for absolutely everything.
2268440	2272560	There will be winners and losers.
2272560	2275120	There's no way around that.
2275120	2279720	On the high end, if you want a semiconductor fab facility, you need a lot of people in
2279720	2282880	their 20s and 30s who are really clever.
2282880	2287680	And the greatest concentration of those people in the country is the Colorado Front Range
2287680	2289000	and the Arizona Sun Corridor.
2289000	2292320	I know everybody thinks about Arizona and they think old people.
2292320	2299840	They do have a lot of old people in Arizona, however, they're all white.
2299840	2301880	Arizona actually has a very healthy demography.
2301880	2302880	It doesn't have a labor shortage.
2302880	2307600	It has a bilingual training problem, different problem.
2307600	2311400	And so you're seeing these areas pick up most of the investment for that because they've
2311400	2313040	got a lot of green space.
2313040	2315880	It's not taking over farms, so the land is cheap.
2315880	2319960	And most of the people who move in are in their 20s and their 30s and they tend to be
2319960	2321280	very highly educated.
2321280	2326920	That's where the concentration of labor for that sector happens to be and policy is matching.
2326920	2331480	You want to do automotive, you're looking at either the Great Lake Regions or the South.
2331480	2334640	Now the Great Lake Regions is all unionized.
2334640	2340400	And so everything that has to do with internal combustion engines is going there.
2340400	2344240	And we've seen that expand massively.
2344240	2345240	Pros and cons.
2345240	2347360	Pros, there's a lot of industrial plant there.
2347360	2350840	You can rehabilitate a lot of the brown space.
2350840	2355720	It's actually a relatively light carry from an investment point of view.
2355720	2358920	The downside is they're not moving into any of the new stuff.
2358920	2363000	And they probably can't, not just because it's unions, but because there's a population
2363000	2364000	lid.
2364000	2367280	This area has seen outmigration pretty robust over the last 30 years.
2367280	2372440	There aren't enough young people to stock a lot of new industrial plant.
2372440	2374360	For that, you go to the South.
2374360	2376640	And so most of the foreign investment is in the South.
2376640	2379840	Most of the new battery facilities in the South, almost the EV construction is in the
2379840	2381720	South.
2381720	2386360	But the place that is just going to kick ass and take names is the Texas Triangle, especially
2386360	2387960	Houston.
2387960	2393040	Because you've got almost 20 million people, about a third of whom have immigrated within
2393040	2395600	the last 10 years, tends to be younger than the national average.
2395600	2396820	They have a footprint in Mexico.
2396820	2398980	They can access that part of the supply chain.
2398980	2401940	And Houston has a foot in the energy corridors as well.
2401940	2408580	So all of the inputs that you need for all of the stuff we need to do is already there.
2408580	2412020	Now, let's talk about the Mexicans.
2412020	2413980	This is a population density map.
2413980	2418700	The deep red, those are the urban cores, the yellow are small towns and suburbs.
2418700	2424020	And if you look north of the border, that pattern, dense urban cores, suburbs, small
2424020	2430460	towns, as a geography, as a geographer, excuse me, that tells me that it rains.
2430460	2434740	Rain makes farms, farms make small towns, small towns make suburbs, suburbs make inner
2434740	2436240	cities.
2436240	2441740	South of the border, you don't have that because it's desert.
2441740	2442740	Pros and cons.
2442740	2446580	Pros, it's oligarchic.
2446580	2451180	There's no interaction among the urban centers in Mexico.
2451180	2453460	Local interconnections are very, very thin.
2453460	2457260	So only a few families run everything and have since independence over a century and
2457260	2458660	a half ago.
2458660	2461580	Which means if you're an American and you're looking for a partner, all you have to do
2461580	2466100	is go south, figure out who's in charge, knock on the door, introduce yourself.
2466100	2471300	Two weeks later, you'll be leaving with a blistering hangover, a godchild, because you're
2471300	2475020	part of the family now, and a fistful of signed contracts that you know you can rely
2475020	2479420	upon because you now have a personal connection.
2479420	2486340	This downside of that though is once you gobbled up the labor in that urban area, you're done.
2486340	2488940	Mexicans are not mobile in the way that Americans are.
2488940	2492540	They don't move within their country very much to take jobs because the infrastructure
2492540	2494620	doesn't support it.
2494620	2498460	And the cities stop and then you just have desert.
2498460	2501780	There's no intermingling at the edges.
2501780	2506020	And the Texans have been working on this for 40 years.
2506020	2510980	And they have already gobbled up probably 80% of the labor that was available.
2510980	2514540	Which means if we're going to rely on the Mexicans to do what we need to do, and oh
2514540	2519420	my god, we need to rely on the Mexicans to do what we need to do, the northern section
2519420	2521060	of the country is not the solution.
2521060	2523340	It's got to be the center.
2523340	2526780	The problem is that the infrastructure isn't there to support it.
2526780	2529860	There are only three, I'll point, the three black lines.
2529860	2533780	Those are the only three intermodal freight facilities within the entire country.
2533780	2536500	They don't interconnect.
2536500	2542100	They just go south on a specific corridor and they don't really branch off.
2542100	2545420	And if the northern Mexicans have already been metabolized, we have to make it all the
2545420	2546780	way down to Mexico City.
2546780	2549260	That's 1,000 miles away.
2549260	2555220	Which means we need to invest at least trillion dollars in Mexican infrastructure in order
2555220	2561380	to reach at scale the 50, 60 million people who live in the center of the country.
2561380	2564660	And we have to do so in a way that doesn't make the Mexicans think that we're trying
2564660	2570180	to take over, which is kind of what we're trying to do.
2570180	2572740	This is going to be touchy.
2572740	2578500	But if we don't pull it off, we will not have the labor to do what we need to do.
2578500	2583380	Because if we still want stuff in a post-China world, we need help to build it.
2583380	2586260	We need a differentiated labor market.
2586260	2592220	And the Mexicans are the only ones within arms reach that can help with that.
2592220	2596900	There are other players that are further abroad, but we can't integrate with them the same
2596900	2599260	way we can integrate with a neighbor.
2599260	2603380	The Southeast Asian countries look pretty good to me.
2603380	2607700	Thailand is the fastest aging one, but it still has at least another 25 years.
2607700	2609340	The Indonesians and the Vietnamese are great.
2609340	2613460	In fact, the Vietnamese are kind of scary.
2613460	2617460	They've expanded their higher educational system with technical skills in mind.
2617460	2621220	40% of college grads in Vietnam are STEM graduates.
2621220	2625500	They are attempting, and it looks like they're going to pull it off, to leapfrog over China
2625500	2627460	from a technological point of view.
2627460	2632300	And they will probably achieve that within the next three or four years.
2632300	2637020	There's also a geography situation that is very helpful.
2637020	2642540	On the left, you're looking at a vegetation map, basically, and the green is tropics.
2642540	2647420	And when you think about building infrastructure in tropics, in mountains, on peninsulas, on
2647420	2652540	islands, it's an expensive, ugly business because you really can't get economies of
2652540	2654540	scale.
2654540	2657100	But there's pros and cons to that, too.
2657100	2660060	The con is that these countries have never gone to war with one another, like they have
2660060	2662300	in, say, Europe or Northeast Asia.
2662300	2665500	There's not a lot of bad blood.
2665500	2670220	And that means that almost everyone started out in tropical agriculture.
2670220	2673900	And if there's one thing that everyone in tropical agriculture can agree on is that no
2673900	2677380	one wants to be in tropical agriculture.
2677380	2682380	In temperate zone agriculture, there's a value chain.
2682380	2683380	You don't have to do it all by hand.
2683380	2684380	You can get a tractor.
2684380	2685380	You can get a combine.
2685380	2686380	You can get a spreader.
2686380	2692020	And the tropics, no, no, no, no, no, tropical fruits, harvested by hand, tended to by hand,
2692020	2693020	transported by hand.
2693020	2696500	You can't have a combine harvesting mangoes.
2696500	2698940	It's all unskilled labor.
2698940	2702700	And so whenever people in tropical ag have a chance, they move out.
2702700	2703700	And they go to the cities.
2703700	2705540	And that means population density.
2705540	2710660	Their cities are wildly overpopulated for the skill set of the labor.
2710660	2716020	And that means this is the most competitive part of the world for value-added manufacturing.
2716020	2718180	This is where we're going to see a big footprint expand.
2718180	2719180	Already has.
2719180	2721420	You're talking about a billion people.
2721420	2726700	There are already more people in coastal Southeast Asia than there are in coastal China.
2726700	2730380	They're probably the biggest winners in the world after Mexico.
2730380	2733340	But it will look different.
2733340	2735500	Population density, again.
2735500	2739620	You'll notice that there aren't threads.
2739620	2744420	When you look at a more normal population structure in an industrialized or industrializing country,
2744420	2748980	you get your urban hub and you've got threads of highways that are densely settled going
2748980	2751060	out to the next population center.
2751060	2755940	And that allows for what we consider to be multi-step supply chains because there's multiple
2755940	2758620	population centers linked together tightly.
2758620	2760540	You can move things back and forth through the system.
2760540	2762180	That doesn't happen in Mexico.
2762180	2763180	It's desert.
2763180	2764180	It's mountainous.
2764180	2765380	It's jungle.
2765380	2766620	Combination thereof.
2766620	2773820	And so each urban core will be good, very good at one or two things.
2773820	2780060	And that's it because they don't have access to a complementary system.
2780060	2784940	So what we do in the United States is we might make the frame.
2784940	2787540	We send it across, they put in the spark plugs.
2787540	2790260	They send it back, we put in the computer system.
2790260	2793700	We send it back, they put in the seats.
2793700	2795700	And it's going to different cities each time.
2795700	2799620	And it's that back and forth that makes it work.
2799620	2802220	But they can't do that at scale within their own system.
2802220	2804940	They have to have that partner.
2804940	2807580	The Vietnamese do not.
2807580	2810980	It's a much more traditional system from our point of view.
2810980	2815860	And so the Vietnamese can do top to bottom manufacturing, the only thing they have to
2815860	2820180	worry about are the components that they can't make themselves, which are substantial.
2820180	2825740	But you can have Vietnam as almost a one-stop shop for most of what we need.
2825740	2830020	We're just going to kind of add the dusting of the tech that's necessary to make it work.
2830020	2832020	It's cheaper to do.
2832020	2835620	Unfortunately, it's 7,000 miles further away.
2835620	2837900	So we can't do the back and forth.
2837900	2838900	Two different models.
2839900	2840900	All right.
2840900	2842700	Let's talk products.
2842700	2847500	If you're at the top of this, you don't know who your third tier suppliers are, much less
2847500	2848500	your 13th.
2848500	2851740	If you're at the bottom, you can probably fit your entire supply chain on the back of a
2851740	2854300	cocktail napkin after throwing back a few bourbons.
2854300	2858420	If you're on the left, or excuse me, on the right, you're already within the NAFTA system.
2858420	2861980	If you're on the right, you're dependent on the Chinese.
2861980	2862980	Couple examples.
2862980	2864300	Energy.
2864300	2867140	Energy is made with American capital.
2867140	2872620	It's on American pipelines, American workers going to American refineries, ending up with
2872620	2875540	an American consumer.
2875540	2877940	And that is not simple at all.
2877940	2886860	1,400 supply chain steps for the iPhone, 91% of which involve mainland China in some fashion.
2886860	2888820	The new iPhone just came out a couple weeks ago.
2888820	2891500	You might want to buy two.
2891500	2896660	We're probably getting close to the point where this is the last one.
2896660	2897660	Here's everybody else.
2897660	2900180	I'm going to pull out a few of these.
2900180	2901180	Automotive.
2901180	2904700	Courtesy of NAFTA 2.
2904700	2909340	Over 90% of the supply chains for autos sold in North America are manufactured in North
2909340	2910340	America.
2910340	2913140	Don't mean to suggest we're not going to have some hiccups, but the core of it has already
2913140	2915140	worked and the rest is just network effects.
2915140	2916580	That's not bad.
2916580	2920500	In terms of foreign investors, the Europeans are of the belief that they can bring in all
2920500	2923020	the parts and just assemble it here.
2923020	2924500	That's not going to work very well.
2924500	2927540	The Asians have figured out that they need to actually do the manufacturing here.
2927540	2932220	So they're probably north of 70% manufactured within North America, where most European
2932220	2935540	companies are less than 10.
2935540	2938260	Heavy vehicles are going to be a problem, though.
2938260	2943300	When you have globalization, it's very common for countries to put their thumbs on the scale
2943300	2947100	to encourage parts of the industrial plant to be in their countries, especially if it's
2947100	2950540	something they can technologically do without a lot of help.
2950540	2955700	As big as they are, a forklift is actually simpler than a passenger car in terms of the
2955700	2958340	equipment and the construction.
2958340	2962300	Since not everybody needs a forklift, it's not like you're going to have these facilities
2962300	2963300	everywhere.
2963300	2966740	The Chinese really have dominated that space.
2966740	2971700	Forklifts, dump trucks, construction equipment, agriculture equipment, we're going to have
2971700	2978500	a real problem when the Chinese go away, but it is a relatively easy fix because anyone
2978500	2983700	who can do automotive at scale can also do heavy equipment at scale.
2983700	2987380	It's just a question of the numbers being right, and nothing like half of the stuff
2987380	2993260	vanishing from the world is going to make the numbers right.
2993260	2995020	That's where I'm worried the most.
2995020	3001100	A successful electronics and computing sector requires a lot of different labor price points
3001380	3005340	because the person who does the plastic molding is not the person who does the die cast or
3005340	3010940	pulls the wire or builds the chip or does the software or polishes the lenses.
3010940	3015460	That's a different step with a different skill set at a different price point.
3015460	3020360	One of the many reasons that the East Asians are so good at this is you've got 11 different
3020360	3028860	labor sets within one extended market, and they can all specialize at what they do best.
3028860	3030480	We don't have that in North America.
3030480	3034080	We have two price points, us, Mexico.
3034080	3038240	That's it, and so we have to change how this is all done.
3038240	3044760	The textiles example gives me hope that we can, but I have no idea in hell how because
3044760	3051120	we haven't had to figure it out yet, but we're going to have to real soon, and we're probably
3051120	3056240	going to have to do it without Northern Mexico because that's already spoken for.
3057240	3061000	All right, here's where things get a little messy.
3061000	3063160	Not all semiconductors are made equal.
3063160	3066480	We all hear about the Chips Act and what the Biden administration wants to do.
3066480	3072280	That's for a very, very specific kind of chip, 10 nanometer and smaller, the most advanced
3072280	3073280	one in the world.
3073280	3079320	Now, today, 92% of those come from Taiwan, 8% from South Korea.
3079320	3082240	If every facility that is under construction in the United States because of the Chips
3082240	3088320	Act ultimately comes to fruition, we will be making less than 5% of the global total.
3088320	3092080	It's a start, it's not huge.
3092080	3095720	The Koreans and the Taiwanese have been working on this for a long time.
3095720	3097760	Here's the problem.
3097760	3100920	The Taiwanese manufacture most of them.
3100920	3107440	They fabricate most of them, but most of the technology that allows them to do so is not
3107440	3109080	Taiwanese.
3109080	3111840	They just have the end production.
3111840	3118920	There's a coalition of over 9,000 companies worldwide, half of which only produce one
3118920	3123680	product for one customer that ends up in a Taiwanese facility.
3123680	3129680	You pull any of those out of the constellation, the whole thing stops until you repair the
3129680	3130680	constellation.
3130680	3135080	We're going to have to rebuild an entire environment in order to continue putting these
3135080	3138480	chips together.
3138480	3140240	That's going to take a decade.
3140240	3141560	All it takes is one country falling out.
3141600	3145360	I'm personally most concerned about the Germans on this one.
3145360	3150600	On the other extreme, you've got the dumb chips, the 90 nanometer and bigger.
3150600	3155960	This is your Internet of Things, your smart blender, the shower brush that sings to you,
3155960	3157280	your smart lights.
3157280	3164280	80% of those are made by the Chinese and they can do that without outside help.
3164280	3167160	The other 20% is kind of a split between Japan and the United States.
3167160	3171120	If the Chinese were to vanish tomorrow, obviously the Internet of Things would just die.
3171160	3176000	I would argue that's not that big of a deal.
3176000	3178120	We have the technology.
3178120	3179120	We have the knowledge.
3179120	3180400	We don't have to reinvent anything.
3180400	3184320	We just need a couple of years to build low-end fab facilities.
3184320	3186840	The Mexicans are very interested in getting into that space.
3186840	3193440	The problem that they face is bilingual technical language skills.
3193440	3197040	If you've got kids who are looking for a way to make a lot of money really quick, tell
3197160	3202520	them to learn how to assemble chips and to do it in Spanish and go down there and be translators
3202520	3206800	because that is going to be the single biggest friction point in the bilateral relationship
3206800	3209080	for the next decade or two.
3209080	3215440	Then everything in the middle, 10 to 90, that's your car.
3215440	3216600	That's your planes.
3216600	3218240	That's most power management systems.
3218240	3220320	That's smart meters.
3220320	3226680	We're probably okay there because those are made in Germany and Italy and here in Japan
3226720	3231640	and Korea, Taiwan, even a little bit in China with imported gear.
3231640	3234640	That looks okay.
3234640	3240800	It's the high-end I'm really worried about because those high-end chips, that's AI.
3240800	3244680	All these server farms are getting built to do AI at scale?
3244680	3245680	No.
3245680	3247440	We're not going to have the chips for it.
3247440	3248840	That's the iPhone.
3248840	3251840	We're not going to have the chips for them.
3251840	3253720	That's electric vehicles.
3253760	3257520	Electric vehicles have two to three grand-worth of chips and they're all either the very high-end
3257520	3261160	or the very low-end.
3261160	3265960	We won't be able to sustain it and everything that comes from it.
3265960	3270960	For you guys's world more specifically, here's your lives.
3270960	3276960	Yeah, there's no way to fix that fast.
3276960	3280760	Order from everyone.
3281000	3283000	Get away.
3283000	3286000	Counting on half of them not making it.
3286000	3288440	That's the biggest sticking point you guys have by far.
3288440	3289920	This doesn't look that great either.
3289920	3294680	This is space the Chinese dominate utterly and replacing that at scale is not a two-year
3294680	3296760	program.
3296760	3298120	It's not just the manufacturer.
3298120	3302080	The assembly requires a lot of fingers and eyes and a lot of quality control and there
3302080	3306040	is no other country in the world that can step into that space quickly.
3306040	3310000	We're talking about a significant build-out that's not just capital-intensive but is very
3310040	3317040	labor-intensive and it is not clear where, if, that can happen with today's technology.
3319800	3322800	This stuff we kind of do in our sleep.
3322800	3326600	That's weird.
3326600	3333600	It's advancing on my cheat screen but it's not advancing on the big one.
3334600	3341600	Do you guys need to do it manually from now on?
3341600	3344600	There's a disconnect.
3349600	3352600	They keep inviting me to events and like, no.
3352600	3356600	Okay, there we go.
3356600	3358600	Okay, the stuff in the middle.
3358600	3359600	I'm sorry.
3359600	3361600	This is the stuff we do in our sleep.
3361600	3364600	The United States is a weird economy in that we're very, very high-end and very, very low-end
3364600	3365600	at the same time.
3365600	3366600	We have a lot of elbow room.
3366600	3367600	We have a lot of forest.
3367600	3368600	We have a lot of wood.
3368600	3372100	And courtesy of the shale industry, we have a lot of things that are energy-intensive that
3372100	3373600	were the world's most competitive.
3373600	3376600	None of that's in danger.
3376600	3381600	This is the stuff that the Mexicans are going to be helping us with.
3381600	3385600	The slower China breaks down, the more time we have to build the industrial plant that
3385600	3389600	we need to give you guys the guts of what you need.
3389600	3394600	That means working with the Mexicans as forward-looking as possible to build the stuff out so we don't
3394600	3398600	start the day that stuff from China just vanishes.
3398600	3399600	Oops.
3399600	3401600	Here we go.
3401600	3407600	My biggest concern about China is the information blocket in there has now become so intense
3407600	3410600	that we just can't get information at all.
3410600	3415600	And we might not find out that the government has collapsed until the stuff just stops arriving.
3415600	3418600	We're not going to have a lot of warning.
3418600	3419600	Okay.
3419600	3420600	Uh-oh.
3420600	3424600	All kinds of weird stuff is happening down here now.
3424600	3428600	Can you guys bounce it forward for me?
3428600	3430600	There we go.
3430600	3431600	All right.
3431600	3437600	I showed you guys this last year, population density map on this side, economic map on this
3437600	3438600	side.
3438600	3441600	The areas that are populated are also the areas that are economically viable.
3441600	3443600	It's a pure weather thing.
3443600	3444600	Russia has weather.
3444600	3448600	People live where it's left.
3448600	3451600	The Russian strategy is pretty straightforward.
3451600	3456600	Expand out of the weather or the area that's decent until you hit a series of geographic
3456600	3458600	barriers that you can't shove tanks through.
3458600	3464600	And then forward position your military in the access points between them.
3464600	3468600	Ukraine is in the unfortunate position of not controlling those access points, but it's
3468600	3471600	on the way to one in Romania and one in Poland.
3471600	3475600	So whenever the Russians are done with Ukraine, if they can win, they will move on to the
3475600	3480600	next line of countries, five of which are in NATO.
3480600	3483600	American, Western, foreign policy is very simple.
3483600	3486600	Prevent them from having that opportunity.
3486600	3492600	Now, here we have the Ukrainian demographic structure.
3492600	3497600	After independence in 1992 over a third of the population either left or died, some of
3497600	3500600	the lowest birth rates we've ever seen.
3500600	3505600	Another third of the population since the war has fled as refugees, mostly women and
3505600	3506600	children.
3506600	3509600	So this is pre-war data.
3509600	3515600	We're very close to the point in Ukraine where they will not have the population density
3515600	3523600	that is required to maintain industrial level infrastructure.
3523600	3529600	So whether it is food or steel or coal or stuff transiting, Ukraine is not going to
3530600	3535600	survive the next 30 years, even if they win the war.
3535600	3537600	There's another problem in that space.
3537600	3540600	This is, hang on, my hair is falling apart here.
3540600	3544600	This is the Russian permafrost.
3544600	3546600	It's a geological phenomenon.
3546600	3550600	You go 10 to 30 feet down and you hit a layer where it never melts.
3550600	3554600	But the top chunk melts in the summer and turns into a bog.
3554600	3558600	It is the most difficult environment in the world for mineral extraction.
3558600	3563600	So the Russians have the most expensive upfront cost to bring stuff online.
3563600	3566600	You basically have to wait for it to freeze solid.
3566600	3569600	You run a berm out to your production site.
3569600	3574600	You run a rail line or a pipe or a road along that berm and then you have a pad that you
3574600	3580600	drill from when it's frozen because you can't drill through mud.
3580600	3585600	It's a very dynamic landscape because if an aquifer cracks open, everything just kind
3585600	3587600	of slides and follows the aquifer.
3587600	3592600	Or maybe it drains down, in which case you just get a single pit that opens.
3592600	3595600	Or maybe there's no aquifer and you just get a warm summer.
3595600	3600600	And the vegetation that's been frozen for eons starts to thaw, starts to decompose.
3600600	3605600	Decomposing vegetable matter gives off methane and the whole land buckles.
3605600	3612600	Which means that the Russians have the highest maintenance costs for any mineral production in the world.
3613600	3618600	Here's the problem, Russian population structure.
3618600	3626600	Now, about the time that people who were 15 were getting born, 2004, 2005,
3626600	3630600	that's when the Russians stopped collecting data and just started making it up.
3630600	3637600	So you've got that big gouge in the 20-somethings, post-Cold War birth rate collapse,
3637600	3639600	and then you have fabricated data.
3639600	3644600	There probably are only half as many children as this data would suggest.
3644600	3648600	The Russian educational system collapsed back in 1985.
3648600	3651600	So we had a collapse in the birth rate, a collapse of the educational system.
3651600	3657600	Which means that the youngest people in Russia who actually have technical skills at scale,
3657600	3660600	they turned 62 this year.
3660600	3664600	The year before the Russians started fabricating data,
3664600	3668600	the life expectancy for the average Russian male was 67.
3668600	3673600	They already had the worst skilled labor pool relative to their population and their needs in the world.
3673600	3677600	And they're very close from simply losing all of it.
3677600	3681600	The maintenance on the Russian systems, the development on the Russian systems,
3681600	3684600	hasn't been done by the Russians for the most part.
3684600	3688600	It's been done by BP or ExxonMobil and especially the Dutch and the Germans,
3688600	3691600	and all that went to zero when the war started.
3691600	3695600	So whether it's sanctions, war damage, or simple lack of maintenance,
3695600	3700600	we need to prepare for a world where everything that the world has become
3700600	3706600	reliant upon from the Russians, palladium, platinum, oil, gas, even timber,
3706600	3709600	just doesn't come anymore.
3709600	3712600	There's another angle to it that's a little uglier.
3712600	3718600	Now this guy, you can see where the ethnic Russian territories are in the top left.
3718600	3722600	You've got Turkic minorities off to the east and the south.
3722600	3727600	The problem is this is not an ethnic map, it's a population change map.
3727600	3734600	The green zones are where population growth is happening roughly on pair with Florida and has for four decades.
3734600	3742600	And the red zones are population losses rushfully equivalent to Detroit and has been for four decades.
3742600	3749600	Almost all the raw materials are produced in the green zones that are not controlled by ethnic Russians,
3749600	3755600	where they're experiencing population growth, but they're shipped through and processed in the red zones,
3755600	3761600	where the last bits of the skilled labor pool are that is in terminal decline.
3761600	3765600	So you can add demographics to the reasons that we need to kiss the Russian stuff goodbye as well,
3765600	3772600	not to mention that this is going to be a very politically unstable region in the not too distant future because of the mismatch.
3772600	3776600	One of the many reasons that the Russians feel that the Ukraine war is necessary
3776600	3781600	is if they can get to kind of that outer crustal defense that they used to have in the Soviet period,
3781600	3788600	then they can focus their forces internally to police this demographic flip.
3788600	3794600	They're fighting for time. If they can pull this off, they probably buy themselves another 50 years.
3794600	3799600	If they fail, they're gone within 20.
3799600	3801600	Alright, let me take a big dump on green tech.
3801600	3804600	We talked about this a little bit last time I saw you guys.
3804600	3806600	I think I even showed you this graphic.
3806600	3814600	I mean, oversimplifying here, but thermal power, internal combustion engines, not all that complicated.
3814600	3818600	You let a match, you start a fire, you capture the heat in some way.
3818600	3822600	Can't do that with an EV system, can't do that with green tech.
3822600	3827600	The process of producing the energy, transmitting the energy, storing the energy
3827600	3831600	requires an order of magnitude more materials and different materials.
3831600	3834600	We're looking here at an EV versus an ICE vehicle.
3834600	3836600	You can just see it a glance.
3836600	3845600	And then here's the same kind of idea, but for generation with solar and wind at the top, conventional thermal at the bottom.
3845600	3848600	We need three times as much copper by 2030.
3848600	3850600	We need 20 times as much lithium.
3850600	3853600	We need 10 times as much nickel.
3853600	3856600	There isn't enough on the planet to pull that off.
3856600	3860600	And the Russians are a top three producer of these things.
3860600	3864600	So it can't happen.
3864600	3871600	It's not physically possible with today's technology for the world.
3871600	3878600	There is one way it might be possible for us.
3878600	3884600	This is where all the stuff comes from that is not what we would consider to be part of our friends and family network.
3884600	3892600	If we use our military, which is done with the war on terror, which is recruited and rested and rearmed, and we go and conquer all of these places,
3892600	3900600	and we run a Belgian imperial style extraction empire and bring all of it home,
3900600	3905600	then we can do the green transition, but no one else.
3905600	3908600	Now, this is not a recommendation.
3908600	3911600	I'm just saying that the path we're on, this is the only way that it works.
3911600	3916600	And even that would not be enough because you still have to turn it into processed material.
3916600	3917600	Lithium ore is useless.
3917600	3919600	You have to turn it into lithium metal.
3919600	3924600	The red bars are the stuff where that processing happens in either China or Russia.
3924600	3926600	And even that's not enough.
3926600	3928600	You have to talk about finance.
3928600	3933600	Here you're looking at the full cycle cost for natural gas combined cycle plant.
3933600	3936600	The blue is the construction, the siding, the building.
3936600	3940600	The gray is the fuel, full life cycle.
3940600	3942600	This is a model you're familiar with.
3942600	3944600	This is what you all do.
3944600	3946600	The idea is it's a subscription model.
3946600	3948600	You pay as you go.
3948600	3950600	That doesn't work for green tech.
3950600	3952600	For green tech, it's almost all up front.
3952600	3955600	This is wind.
3955600	3956600	Capital costs have tripled.
3956600	3958600	They will triple again.
3958600	3966600	I think most of the plans that were put out there four years ago assumed that there would never be a 100 basis point increase in capital costs.
3966600	3967600	We've now gone up by 500.
3967600	3970600	We have another 500 to go.
3970600	3972600	The market can't support this.
3972600	3976600	The IRA will help maybe sand down some edges.
3976600	3980600	But we're going to have to do something that in the United States we really don't like doing.
3980600	3985600	We're going to have to choose what we want to focus on.
3985600	3991600	The smart play would be to put it solar panels where it's sunny, not in Massachusetts,
3991600	3996600	put wind turbines where it's windy, not in Florida,
3996600	3999600	and wire the power to where we actually live.
3999600	4000600	But we're not going to do that.
4000600	4002600	That's the smart thing.
4002600	4003600	Another matrix.
4003600	4007600	If you're at the top, you want the government out of your personal life.
4007600	4012600	If you're at the bottom, you think the government should regulate social norms in some way.
4012600	4015600	If you're on the right, you want the government out of your wallet.
4015600	4020600	If you're on the left, you think the government should intervene in people's wallets
4020600	4023600	to get the resources it needs to remake society in some way.
4023600	4026600	You can combine these things.
4026600	4032600	If you're at the bottom right, an economic and a social conservative,
4032600	4038600	you're opposed to food stamps on principle because famine builds character.
4038600	4043600	If you're at the top left, a social liberal and an economic conservative,
4043600	4050600	you're all of the bureaucrats and washing together for a big party where you'll serve arsenic cake.
4050600	4053600	Here are our political factions.
4053600	4059600	The single biggest effect that Donald Trump had is he elevated a faction to prominence
4059600	4061600	that really hadn't voted before.
4061600	4064600	Most of the people who voted for him the first time he ran for president
4064600	4067600	hadn't voted in the previous four presidential elections.
4067600	4070600	A lot of different estimates for how many people that is,
4070600	4072600	but all of them are north of 10 million voters.
4072600	4077600	They are now not simply the single largest voting bloc in the country.
4077600	4082600	They've taken over the Republican Party because in calling to these people,
4082600	4087600	Trump ended up picking fights with what he would call the rhinos.
4087600	4093600	People who were the traditional leaders of the policy.
4093600	4095600	He ejected them from his White House.
4095600	4099600	He ran, he campaigned against their candidates in Congress
4099600	4103600	and he completely purged them from the Republican national conventions.
4103600	4108600	They're not even present in the decision-making apparatus of the party now.
4108600	4112600	And in effect, they've become swing voters.
4112600	4119600	But he was able to attract other factions that were closer to his social conservative core supporters.
4119600	4122600	And a lot of people have switched sides.
4122600	4124600	This is the MAGA coalition.
4124600	4127600	This is the Republican Party of today.
4127600	4129600	This has lots of consequences.
4129600	4132600	Let's focus on three.
4132600	4135600	First, the unions are swing voters.
4135600	4138600	That hasn't happened in a century and a half.
4138600	4142600	We're entering a period where we need to double the size of the industrial plant.
4142600	4145600	How many of those jobs do you think are at Blue Collar?
4145600	4151600	We have a labor shortage and we will for at least another decade, probably two.
4151600	4156600	We're going to see the greatest increase in union activity and union power
4156600	4161600	in the history of the Republic in the next 10 to 20 years.
4161600	4164600	The business community are swing voters now.
4164600	4166600	That hasn't happened in the last 150 years.
4166600	4172600	And this is crazy because the unions versus business, that tug of war, that is modern economics.
4172600	4176600	Their discussions, their debates, their compromises, their negotiations,
4176600	4180600	that is our economic policy for five generations.
4180600	4184600	And these people are right now not even in the room.
4184600	4188600	Part of the reason why economic policy out of both the Obama and the Trump administration
4188600	4195600	just seems so nuts is because there's no one in either administration that can do math.
4195600	4198600	In fact, on both sides, they're kind of offended by the concept
4198600	4201600	that you need to be able to do math to run an economy.
4201600	4205600	The group that most fancies themselves economists
4205600	4210600	in the Biden administration today are the Greens.
4210600	4215600	Until such time as the unions or the business or both end up in one coalition or the other,
4215600	4220600	economic policymaking, decisions, choices about where we need to focus
4220600	4224600	are going to be completely divorced from reality.
4224600	4228600	And this is going to last bare minimum for another presidential cycle.
4228600	4231600	Now, we will get through this.
4231600	4236600	The idea that the two economically most capable, competent, and numerous voting blocks
4236600	4240600	on these topics are going to remain outside the political system, that's silly.
4240600	4244600	But it's going to take time for us to figure out where they're going to land.
4244600	4250600	And the political coalition is going to look very, very different on the other side.
4250600	4258600	So best of luck, because not only will you not be getting good guidance or regulation,
4258600	4261600	there isn't a logic to it.
4261600	4266600	And that's just the environment you're operating in at a time
4266600	4269600	when you're going to have to at least double the grid.
4269600	4271600	No pressure.
4271600	4278600	Okay, if you're looking for more, the link on the left goes to the newsletter and video log.
4278600	4281600	It is free and I will never share your data with anyone.
4281600	4286600	And this guy, if you see or read something that you're like, I would have paid for that,
4286600	4289600	if you think you would have paid, send it here, Medshare.
4289600	4291600	They are a charity that I support.
4291600	4296600	They provide medical assistance to communities who have lost the ability to look after themselves for reasons that are not their fault.
4296600	4302600	So, for example, if the Russians bomb your power grid like they started doing again last week in Ukraine,
4302600	4309600	Medshare steps in with diesel generators and fuel for hospitals.
4309600	4313600	How are we feeling?
4313600	4316600	Okay, I'm going to make the PDFs of this available for everybody.
4316600	4318600	I have no problem with taking photos or whatever.
4318600	4321600	But let's go ahead and do some Q&A.
4321600	4328600	We have about 15 minutes for questions, so I don't know if you want to put the QR code up for submitting online,
4328600	4330600	but anyone want to raise your hand?
4330600	4336600	Oh, you can ask without me knowing what it is?
4336600	4342600	We do have one that came in through the app, and it is way more fun if you just ask them live,
4342600	4343600	so feel free to raise your hand.
4343600	4349600	But the one that came through on the app is how important is it going to be to be able to speak Spanish in the United States
4349600	4354600	or have Latina leaders within our private organizations based on everything that you're talking about today?
4354600	4359600	Yeah, so the Hispanic population in the United States, well, I mean, let's be honest, it's mostly, it's 80% Mexicans.
4359600	4362600	The Mexican population in the United States is the fastest growing demographic.
4362600	4364600	It is the youngest demographic.
4364600	4370600	It is the demographic that is seen in increase in its value add and its educational system most quickly.
4370600	4373600	And then, of course, it's obviously an interface with Mexico proper.
4373600	4380600	So it really matters where you are, the closer to the Southwest border you happen to be, the bigger this issue is,
4380600	4382600	but it is going to be an issue for everyone.
4382600	4384600	They're also the consumers of the future.
4384600	4386600	Now, couple things to keep in mind.
4386600	4393600	Number one, they are the demographic that we have absorbed in this country most quickly.
4393600	4400600	Spanish disappears from Mexican migrants typically within one to two generations.
4400600	4402600	That's the fastest ever.
4402600	4410600	One of the really weird cultural things with Hispanics and especially with Mexicans is a lot of them think of the term gringo as an aspiration,
4410600	4412600	not as a pejorative.
4412600	4422600	And if you ask a second generation Hispanic, they will probably on census forms say they're white.
4422600	4425600	They see it as a cultural term, not a racial term.
4425600	4428600	Now, does that mean I don't think you should work on Spanish skills?
4428600	4429600	Not what I'm saying.
4429600	4433600	I'm saying it might not be as critical on this side of the border as you think it is.
4433600	4437600	The other side of the border, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.
4437600	4446600	And let's be honest, the interface with the Hispanics of Mexico is going to be far more productive, far more cost effective,
4446600	4451600	and far more important than anything we have ever done with East Asia.
4451600	4457600	And based on demographics, it will be for at least the next half century.
4457600	4464600	So that is the future of not just your market and a large part of your workforce, but what allows you to do everything else.
4464600	4466600	So yes, I would invest in it.
4466600	4471600	I'm just saying you might not need it for what you think you need it for.
4471600	4473600	Hi, I'm Jim Mooney from New York Transchool.
4473600	4476600	You're saying no, who's asking you the question?
4477600	4482600	What role do you think AI plays in some of these equations going forward?
4482600	4483600	Oh, I forgot that.
4483600	4488600	It's a big, a lot of concern everywhere for everything.
4488600	4493600	Okay, so it probably isn't going to because those AI chips, the 10 nanometers and smaller,
4493600	4497600	those are the ones we're most likely to lose and not have for about a decade
4497600	4501600	while we rebuild the structured environment that allows us to build them at scale.
4501600	4505600	Now, they're not going to go to zero, but we're going to have to choose what we're going to put them into.
4505600	4507600	Do we put into EVs?
4507600	4517600	Do we put into power management systems where, you know, there's one of those chips is in every smart meter for a house that also has solar panels.
4517600	4522600	So that in theory is a bigger market than what we do for iPhones.
4522600	4525600	Or do we put them in electric vehicles?
4525600	4526600	Or do we put them in surfer farms?
4526600	4528600	Because we're not going to have enough for all of that.
4528600	4531600	We're going to have enough probably for one of those applications.
4531600	4534600	And until we have that shortage, we haven't made up that decision.
4534600	4544600	But the idea that we're going to be doing this at scale and have massive surfer farms with millions of these chips, that can't happen.
4544600	4550600	Now, with chat GPT, we're seeing that this technology is probably now past the operational stage.
4550600	4553600	So all we need are the chips.
4553600	4556600	The question is, how long is it going to take us to rebuild that pipeline?
4556600	4562600	And I would say eight to 12 years.
4562600	4564600	Daniel Sierra, Burns and McDonald.
4564600	4565600	Sorry, over here.
4565600	4566600	My apologies.
4566600	4567600	Thanks.
4567600	4571600	So I guess you're talking about the Mexican market and the labor there.
4571600	4575600	What happens after we use all that up, I guess, per se?
4575600	4577600	What's the next country that you see coming in the road?
4577600	4582600	Well, all of this is very inflationary because we're trying to do a lot with limited supply of capital and labor.
4582600	4586600	If we do succeed in building the infrastructure down into central Mexico,
4586600	4591600	and the industrial plant does take form the way that the market seems like it's going to push for.
4591600	4594600	It's going to be the same thing we did here.
4594600	4602600	When we gobbled up all available labor in roughly 1990, just going to put a stake in the ground,
4602600	4604600	we found out we had to go up market.
4604600	4607600	And we had to get better at using capital and labor more effectively,
4607600	4610600	and that's when we saw our productivity skyrocket.
4610600	4614600	I would expect that we would have a secondary issue like that in the United States,
4614600	4620600	and then Mexico will go through a 1990 style boom as they are forced to move up the value added scale.
4620600	4627600	Now, Mexico over the last 30 years has moved up the value added scale at a faster rate than any country ever before.
4627600	4631600	They're on average, I'd say, twice as productive as the average Chinese,
4631600	4634600	and their compensation is less than half as much.
4634600	4639600	So they're already skewing towards being amazing.
4639600	4644600	This will just speed it up, but it will be inflationary.
4644600	4646600	Brandon Young, Young Management.
4646600	4650600	Question for you is around technical education.
4650600	4653600	Where are you seeing the trends going?
4653600	4662600	Will we run out of the younger generation wanting to go into more technical related roles like engineering, power utility?
4662600	4664600	Talk about that and when that's going to end.
4664600	4668600	It's not going to end in the next 15 years.
4668600	4669600	Two things.
4669600	4676600	Number one, the type of work we're probably going to see have the most price pressure is machine shops.
4676600	4679600	It's a skill set that expands pretty quickly but on small scale,
4679600	4683600	and we're going to have to do a lot of the manufacturing and the maintenance
4683600	4689600	for things that you would normally just buy an entirely new component relatively close to your headquarters
4689600	4691600	because it's going to have to be a patch job.
4691600	4694600	We're not going to have the production that's necessary.
4694600	4699600	Second, you're probably all going to have to do established training programs,
4699600	4706600	not in high schools but in elementary schools to build your own inflow for these jobs
4706600	4710600	because in an environment of very strict and increasing labor shortages,
4710600	4717600	whoever gets their hooks into the kids first is likely to be the ones who then get the labor when it's time.
4717600	4721600	And the time to start on that was yesterday.
4721600	4725600	We won't see...
4725600	4728600	We have to wait for the millennials' kids to enter the market.
4728600	4730600	That's 2045.
4730600	4740600	And so you're all fighting for a small pool of anti-social children.
4740600	4744600	Hi, Nelson Gomez, IEC engineering construction.
4744600	4748600	So you seem like you're bearish on China, right?
4748600	4752600	That's a word you could use, yeah.
4752600	4764600	And to borrow your phrase, you said Russia is buying time by their current war.
4764600	4774600	How do you view that kind of thought process applying to China as if Taiwan is a $14 trillion semiconductor market
4774600	4780600	and you're saying they don't have enough adults in 5, 10, 15, 20 years?
4780600	4785600	So how do you see that playing out and them making a move towards Taiwan in the next, I don't know, 5, 10 years?
4785600	4795600	So because of the information vacuum in China now, it's impossible to know whether or not there's going to be an attack
4795600	4797600	because Xi doesn't talk with anyone.
4797600	4800600	There's no one's phone you can bug to find out what he's thinking.
4800600	4805600	Also, if the Chinese were to make a move on Taiwan, even if they captured in a matter of six weeks without a shot fired,
4805600	4809600	they don't know how to operate those semiconductor facilities because they can't operate their own.
4809600	4813600	They use imported labor to do all of the quality checks on all of the wafers.
4813600	4815600	And the ones in Taiwan are the world's most advanced.
4815600	4818600	The ones in China are very much the other side.
4818600	4823600	So if they got them, they would just be big paper weights and obviously that would remove semiconductors for the rest of us,
4823600	4826600	but it wouldn't really help them technologically.
4826600	4831600	And it would trigger, among other things, the United States to act militarily.
4831600	4835600	And it's not like we would confront the Chinese and the South China Sea or anything.
4835600	4838600	We'd probably just put a couple of destroyers in the Indian Ocean Basin and cut the energy flow
4838600	4842600	and cut the ability of them to import the things that need to grow their own food.
4842600	4848600	So China would be facing a national collapse within a couple of years if they do pull the trigger on Taiwan.
4848600	4851600	Normally, I would say that this would mean that they wouldn't even consider it.
4851600	4856600	But again, Xi is now in an information black box and we can't rule it out.
4856600	4865600	All I can tell you for sure is that one way or another, some country involved in the supply chain somewhere is going to crack.
4865600	4872600	I'm actually more concerned about Germany than I am about Taiwan, but it would have the same impact.
4872600	4878600	The Germans specifically make the lenses that allow all of the lithography to happen.
4879600	4883600	No lenses, no lithography, no lithography, no chips.
4883600	4889600	The hope, because people seem to like me to say things that are hopeful,
4889600	4897600	is that there is a new lithography technology that is coming out that has fewer parts
4897600	4901600	and doesn't require neon, which we're dependent on the Russians and the Chinese for,
4901600	4906600	that might, might, might have a simpler supply chain.
4906600	4913600	But if we, like, ironed out all the kings of that today, it's not going to be applied at scale in Taiwan within three years.
4913600	4922600	So there, there are potentially ways forward here, but I find it unlikely that we're going to be able to avoid a disruption in that specific market.
4922600	4926600	It's just, it's too vulnerable to too many things.
4926600	4930600	But probably not that one. Probably.
4930600	4934600	If it does happen, well, then it's all gone.
4934600	4935600	Over here.
4935600	4938600	Hey, Peter, you talked a lot about Xi Jinping in China.
4938600	4942600	I just wondered what your thoughts are on Vladimir Putin in Russia and what's going on.
4942600	4949600	Okay, well, I mean, all world leaders, Democratic or otherwise, have problems with narcissism and ego.
4949600	4953600	We're not immune to that.
4953600	4956600	The question is how honest you are about your own capacity.
4956600	4965600	So Putin has also established a bit of a cult of personality and has also purged the system of people who might rise up to replace them.
4965600	4971600	But he started from a much lower base, which has shaped how much he's willing to carve out.
4971600	4975600	So at the end of the Cold War, well, sorry, let me go back.
4975600	4982600	1983, there was a coup in the Soviet Union and the intelligence services took over, purged all the other factions from the Communist Party.
4982600	4984600	This is the un-drop-off coup.
4984600	4990600	And he, a drop-off, Charnamird and Gorbachev, they were the first three, ran the country until the end.
4990600	4996600	Putin is part of that clique and the intelligence professionals took over after the fall and have run it until now.
4996600	5000600	And Putin has bit by bit removed people who he thought was threatening.
5000600	5003600	And he hasn't done a lot to bring up a new generation from below.
5003600	5010600	So Putin's inner circle today is less than 10 people, half of whom are utterly incompetent.
5010600	5015600	But if you ever see anything by Dmitri Medvedev, the former president, he's the most incompetent of them.
5015600	5017600	You can ignore whatever he says.
5017600	5022600	But there are a few of them that actually do provide him with advice and context.
5022600	5035600	So I think the best example I can give you is if you go back to the March, just after the war began, when Putin was making all the nuclear threats,
5036600	5039600	the U.S. ambassador was dispatched and the message was something like this.
5039600	5045600	Like, Mr. President, just think of things from a little different angle here.
5045600	5051600	You remember back in January when you decided and you gave the order for the day the war was going to start
5051600	5056600	and you were in the bunker under the Kremlin that was completely sealed.
5056600	5059600	It was walk-in safe, no electronics, no notes.
5059600	5065600	And an hour after you left that meeting, we published the notes of the meeting in the media.
5065600	5072600	That was our way of telling you that we know where your person is at any given moment.
5072600	5080600	So if you think you can fling a nuke into the Western Hemisphere and the first half doesn't, we send back, are going to go anywhere except straight up.
5080600	5083600	You're out of your mind, so stop it.
5083600	5087600	The point is that Putin has meetings.
5088600	5096600	He has people, he's discussed things, which means you can crack into the fact system in the email, you can tap the phones, there's ways to learn.
5096600	5103600	And as bad as the demographic situation is in Russia, there's still a massive producer and exporter of food and energy,
5103600	5109600	whereas China now has no inner circle, no communication, no way to find out anything,
5109600	5114600	and are the world's largest importer of pretty much everything that keeps people alive.
5114600	5125600	So in the worst case scenario for the Russians, they will still persist longer than in the best case scenario for the Chinese.
5125600	5130600	China's almost over.
5130600	5135600	The Russians have at least another decade and a half to two decades.
5138600	5142600	But this is still probably the last generation of Russian leadership.
5142600	5152600	So Peter, with the labor shortages you articulated and sort of this focus on ESG across the world,
5152600	5167600	how do you reconcile the idea of one undocumented workers or forced labor really being something that folks want to purge out of their supply chain?
5167600	5174600	Is that, am I going to ask is it possible, but is it happy talk to say that?
5174600	5180600	No, I think it's reasonable. Two things to keep in mind. Number one, forced labor, different hemisphere.
5180600	5185600	A lot of the stuff from that other hemisphere is going to stop anyway.
5185600	5190600	And forced labor is going to be some of the least of our concerns when it comes to human rights issues.
5190600	5193600	So I would expect those supply chains to wither for independent reasons.
5194600	5197600	Second, business community swing voters.
5197600	5204600	One of the things that people missed about Governor DeSantis of Florida is that he hasn't gone to war with Disney.
5204600	5208600	He's gone to war with the Florida business community.
5208600	5213600	ESG, is it doing a good job? Questionable.
5213600	5216600	Is it taking us to where we need to go? I don't know.
5216600	5224600	But since the business community is no longer part of the conversation, they are trying to figure out where they fit into American society.
5224600	5229600	ESG is a component of that. It's an internal conversation.
5229600	5236600	And so every business is approaching this from their own way based on their own circumstances, their own geography, their own politics, their own workforce.
5236600	5241600	And of course they're all coming up with different conclusions, some of which are...
5241600	5254600	But when people on the left or the right yell at business about ESG, business just gets pissed off because they're doing the best they can when they're not allowed in the room.
5254600	5266600	So when I hear people like Rahman Swani or DeSantis screaming about ESG, it's like all you are doing is making it easier for the business community to never support the Republican Party again.
5266600	5279600	So there are consequences, and we're going to see them in the presidential and the general election next year, but they're going to be unpredictable in a way that we're not used to seeing out of that community.
5279600	5283600	We're used to the business community being the adults in the room.
5283600	5294600	Now, more specifically to your question about child labor, since there are no standards in ESG, since every company comes at it from their own angle for their own reasons,
5294600	5297600	there is no pattern in my opinion.
5297600	5304600	So we're going to be waiting to see what happens in terms of international capacity to build this stuff,
5304600	5309600	and those countries are not going to snap an in neat order or all at once.
5309600	5323600	So I hate to say this, this is a tier three supplier issue, and there is not going to be a database that allows us to map this on its way down.
5324600	5328600	Hi, Andrea Hubianco from RWE.
5328600	5329600	I have a question.
5329600	5338600	Do you think IQ Demographics plays a role into this global dynamic and also some population attributes like the flexibility, adaptability.
5338600	5340600	That's all cultural stuff.
5340600	5341600	And yes, it does.
5341600	5352600	It's a lot harder to map out than just the sheer numbers, but there's certainly indications that different cultures are better or worse at doing different things at different stages of the projection cycle.
5352600	5355600	For example, Americans are very good at brain work.
5355600	5359600	We have the highest value added designers in the world.
5359600	5363600	The Mexicans are great at production.
5363600	5367600	They're the highest value added manufacturers in the world.
5367600	5374600	But if you were to increase the cost of labor in Mexico by a factor of five, they'd probably give us a run for our money.
5374600	5378600	It's not an issue of us or them being smarter or dumber than the other one.
5378600	5385600	They're at a different stage of their economic cycles and their growth, and we have different infrastructures to work with.
5385600	5395600	So I've never seen a study that looks at race from an IQ point of view that has ever held up.
5395600	5397600	Every time I've ever seen it, they've kind of thrown it out.
5397600	5401600	It's at best noise, but that doesn't mean we're all in the same place.
5402600	5406600	Hi, Peter. Kyle Penn from Bronson, McDonald.
5406600	5414600	What would you say is the biggest impact to your models, your hypotheses based on who wins the next presidential election?
5414600	5416600	Oh, I mean, I can tell you exactly who's going to win.
5416600	5419600	It's going to be Biden. It's going to be a landslide.
5419600	5422600	And we've known this for over a year.
5422600	5430600	So one of the things about January 6th is it happened just after an election, so its effects haven't been fully felt in terms of who votes for who.
5430600	5442600	But when we got to the midterms, despite expecting a red wave, we had a red burp in the house and a red loss in the Senate.
5442600	5450600	And what we found out is that the independence in the United States had changed considerably.
5450600	5456600	Couple things. Number one, Trump has basically told independence that the general election doesn't matter,
5456600	5462600	which means that the independents don't matter because the general election is the only place the independents have a voice.
5462600	5465600	And so they reacted to that.
5465600	5477600	In exit polling, something crazy like 85% of independents said that they despised the White House's economic policies
5477600	5481600	and felt that they hurt independents more than anyone else.
5481600	5484600	And independents are fickle.
5484600	5487600	They almost always switch sides every election.
5487600	5489600	They get buyer's remorse.
5489600	5496600	And in the time before they had voted for Biden, and now they were clearly fed up with them, but almost all of them voted for Democrats anyway.
5496600	5505600	There's a saying in the State Department in the Middle East that we support one person, one vote, but not just one time.
5505600	5514600	And if the independents were going to show up in numbers to vote against their own personal economic best interests in order to make sure they could vote again,
5514600	5519600	in an off year, you can bet they're going to do so in the general.
5519600	5524600	Trump will probably carry no more than 12 states.
5524600	5528600	And then the Republican Party is going to have to decide what to do with that.
5528600	5531600	And the people who are...
5531600	5533600	Oh no, I broke it.
5533600	5544600	The people who are here, the Rhinos, are going to have to decide if they want to try to wait it out, which hasn't worked yet, or move on.
5544600	5547600	And we'll know within two years.
5547600	5550600	Alright, I think we're going to do one more question.
5550600	5552600	Okay.
5552600	5555600	Good afternoon, Steve Thornhill with Burns and McDonald.
5555600	5559600	I guess you keep talking about China's going to collapse, Germany's going to collapse.
5559600	5564600	What does that look like? Is that anarchy? Is that revolution?
5564600	5567600	Well, let's start with the Germans, because that's probably simpler.
5567600	5574600	Assuming for the moment that there's not a general European war, it will be a very organized decline, because they're German.
5574600	5579600	And we will see individual sectors that the Germans are no longer competitive fall off one after another.
5579600	5582600	That's already happened in chemicals. That's already happened in processing.
5582600	5585600	I'd say the next really big one will probably be automotive.
5585600	5588600	Automotive requires customers.
5588600	5593600	And in Europe, that was tapped out a long time ago, and in China, it's been tapped out now for five years.
5593600	5601600	And if they reclocate their supply chains to North America like the Japanese have, that means German workers aren't doing it anymore.
5601600	5606600	So they're going to probably, things like transformers will probably be able to see some of the last things that they do at scale.
5606600	5612600	And they just fade away, unless there's a security crisis, in which case God knows.
5612600	5622600	China's collapsed over 20 times in its history, and every time it's gone down, they've lost at least a quarter of their population.
5622600	5630600	Just playing the odds, because there's enough of a data set that you can do that with Chinese collapses,
5630600	5640600	you get a civilizational break that kills over half the population, because they're so dependent on energy and food stuffs and food production inputs now.
5640600	5646600	The North probably gets the worst of that. That's where about two-thirds of the population lives.
5646600	5649600	And it'll probably fall into kind of a neo-Maus tyranny.
5649600	5653600	And remember that G has purged everyone who's capable.
5653600	5659600	So there's no backup governments, even at the local level, waiting in the wings, which probably means warlords.
5659600	5662600	Again, Chinese history suggests that.
5662600	5667600	And then the southern cities from Shanghai to Hong Kong, they don't back up to a hinterland.
5667600	5671600	They're kind of divorced from the rest of the Chinese system always have been.
5671600	5676600	And I would expect them to integrate with foreign powers in order to get food and energy.
5676600	5680600	They'll trade their labor and their infrastructure to participate in someone else's supply chain.
5680600	5682600	Historically speaking, that's usually how it's gone.
5682600	5688600	These cities have gotten the majority of their calories from foreign partners for most of the last 1600 years.
5689600	5695600	The communist period is a real aberration in terms of actually being united with the Chinese whole.
5695600	5698600	That's probably how it goes down.
5698600	5702600	But again, this is happening over 20 times. There's a lot of potential paths.
5702600	5705600	That's not the worst one.
5705600	5708600	Awesome. Let's give Peter a round of applause. Thank you so much.
5708600	5710600	Thank you.
5718600	5720600	Thank you.
