1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,440
I am very moved by your kind words, it's a great honor which you have bestowed on me.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:28,320
I feel even somewhat embarrassed, especially with so many eminent colleagues here.

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,880
I don't know if I deserve this honor, perhaps my merit has been to be interested in irreversible

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,280
processes already at an early stage, when this subject was not very popular.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,360
I'd like to remember a conference which I had been organized at the University of Maryland

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:01,120
in 1946 which was dealing with irreversible processes and at the end of my lecture some

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,560
of the most famous thermodynamics of this time stood up and said, I really don't understand

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
why this young man is interested in irreversible processes.

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,480
After all, irreversible processes are transients and after some time you come to equilibrium

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,400
why therefore not be directly interested in equilibrium.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,600
I was so astonished that I had not really the presence of mind to say, well we are all transients,

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,440
therefore it's rather natural to be interested in our human condition.

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,520
At this stage, well to use the expression used by Professor Feigenbaum, everybody was convinced

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,600
that there was one universality and this universality was equilibrium.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,000
If you perturb the system, well like let's say pendulum is friction, it goes back to its

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
equilibrium position.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,120
If you perturb a liquid, a gas, it goes back to equilibrium.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,760
So we were very astonished that when we studied non-equilibrium processes it came to the conclusion

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,400
that at the well-defined distance from equilibrium some quite different happened.

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,160
And as was mentioned, these different, these new things which happened was as Professor

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,880
Gover already mentioned that there is a possibility of new coherent structures.

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,040
And this is generally the case if there is some non-linear feedback.

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,000
For example, x becomes y, y becomes x, proteins give nucleic acids, nucleic acids give proteins.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Then the type of laws to which we are used generally are no more valid and you come to

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,680
some very unexpected phenomena such as we see now today with the Jabotinsky-Belouzov reaction

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,800
of chemical oseations that we can see also, space structure, spirals, waves of all kind.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,480
And we are only at the beginning.

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,600
And it is very interesting that this really has shattered our ideas about that is for example

29
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,960
the chemical reaction.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Generally we had the idea that a chemical reaction is a random encounter of molecules

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,720
where to produce organized patterns coherent time series, of course this is not adequate.

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,000
There must exist long-range correlations which are absent at equilibrium.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,800
I like to say in a slightly, I would say anthropomorphic way that matter at equilibrium is blind,

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,040
but far from equilibrium it begins to see.

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,120
And if we push the system further away from equilibrium by pushing matters who is a reactor

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,160
more rapidly or by heating some part including some other, we have some other type, more

37
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,120
complex type of processes which appear and chaos is one of them.

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,640
Well, personally I have some hesitation to emphasize the word chaos because chaos has

39
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,720
a little negative connotation.

40
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,560
It is the difficulty of prediction which is emphasized by this connotation.

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,040
I like to speak more about self-organization, about the possibility that for given boundary

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,800
conditions and for a given mechanism you may have more and more possible structures with

43
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,560
broken time symmetries.

44
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,400
When I was young my teachers were very proud when they could prove that for given boundary

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,680
conditions and a given mechanism you had only one solution.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,600
Now we are very proud when we can show that for a given mechanism and given boundary conditions

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
there are many.

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,720
When I was invited to give a talk here I had to make a difficult choice.

49
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:26,200
I could either speak to you about non-equilibrium structures and the relation with chaos and

50
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,400
this is today a very fashionable subject.

51
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,960
These ideas have been applied in many fields.

52
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,360
Another possibility which was open was to try to give you an idea about the work in which

53
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,360
I am involved with my co-workers and two of my closest co-workers are here, Professor

54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,320
Petrowski and Hazegaba and to speak to you more about things which make me believe that

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,880
indeed chaos may be a new science and as a subject of the conference is really chaos

56
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,280
the new science I decided to try to do this.

57
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,360
However this is not an easy task.

58
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,640
Let me start with the following remark.

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,960
After all you have seen these beautiful structures described by Mandelbrot yesterday.

60
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,280
You have also heard about his non-linear equations and the road to chaos beautifully described

61
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
by Feigenbaum.

62
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,560
But you can ask the question what is the relation between all these interesting and remarkable

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,920
phenomena and the basic description of nature as embedded in Newton's equations or in quantum

64
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,560
mechanics.

65
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,080
And here I would like to emphasize that the type of processes described yesterday by Feigenbaum

66
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,320
occur only when there is a broken time symmetry.

67
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,560
It is then that you have the Stokes-Navier equation, then that you have a reaction diffusion

68
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
equation.

69
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,280
Therefore irreversibility is very important, that is what I already just mentioned, that

70
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,000
is when you go away from equilibrium that you have all these new phenomena.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What means irreversibility?

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,760
Reversibility means that there is a natural time ordering.

73
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,960
It is obvious that we can say that industrial revolution came after the Neolithic time.

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,800
It is obvious that we can make a distinction between young men and an older one.

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,040
But is this time ordering basic in nature or is this time ordering simply in our mind?

76
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,720
And that is really a question which has been discussed since centuries.

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,040
And the reason why it has been discussed is that if you take the simplest phenomena such

78
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,800
as a pendulum, well, it can start here, go there, or go from here to there, and you cannot

79
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,520
say what's really earlier.

80
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:02,440
It seems that once you go to the basic description, then you essentially lose the direction of

81
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
time.

82
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,360
And this is also true in quantum mechanics.

83
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,200
Therefore, the question is really time real, time is irreversibility.

84
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,680
Now this question was really openly posed with the discovery of thermodynamics in the 19th

85
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,880
century in 1865, when Closier made his famous statement that the entropy of the universe

86
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,480
is increasing and therefore brought in a kind of evolutionary view of the universe.

87
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,640
But you know the great mathematicians of this time, the great physicists, didn't pay any

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
attention to this.

89
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,880
This was a science produced by engineers in physical chemists which are very low on the

90
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,640
scale, you see, of, I would say, of hierarchy in natural sciences.

91
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,520
Therefore, one of the merits of Boltzmann was, who was certainly a great physicist,

92
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,800
was to ask, what is after all essential about that?

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,880
Is there something really fundamental?

94
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,600
He was very much influenced by Darwin, and he tried to make a kind of evolutionary picture

95
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,000
involving populations, not of living beings, but population of molecules.

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,080
He came out with his kinetic theory.

97
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:33,280
But people were rapidly pointing out to him that this was incompatible with the basic time

98
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,680
symmetry of Newton's equation.

99
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,800
And he became gradually more and more unhappy about the situation.

100
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,560
He was really like a man who had two loves, two women he loved at the same time.

101
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,240
On one side, he knew very well the basic equation of physics and the properties, on the other

102
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,280
hand, he believed in an evolutionary world, and he could not have made up his mind.

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,560
That gave really a kind of tragic flavor to his life.

104
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,840
And the defeat of Boltzmann was considered by his hair, to some extent, as a triumph,

105
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:19,480
as a triumph of the idea that time is in our mind, when Einstein, much closer to us, has

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,720
written time as irreversibility is an illusion.

107
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,240
I always found curious that this conclusion was so readily accepted, because if you really

108
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,560
think that time is an illusion, well, human life is an illusion, and with it all the attempts

109
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,080
we can make to find more about the world.

110
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,880
That is a remark which Karl Popper has made and which is completely correct.

111
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,200
And I think if there was no crisis due to the defeat of Boltzmann, this came from the

112
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,000
fact that the physicists were convinced that the aim of physics was to express the description

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,840
of the nature in terms of universal time-reversible laws.

114
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:14,360
And this comes back really to the ideology of the period in which science, as it exists

115
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,640
even today, was conceived in the 17th century.

116
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,800
At this time, life was emphasized very much, the fact that for God nothing can be hidden,

117
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,760
that essentially, for a well-informed observer, what will ever happen is already present in

118
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
the present.

119
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,040
Therefore, in a sense, the time has to be eliminated.

120
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,760
And this idea to describe everything in terms of universal laws was really the goal, the

121
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,320
ambition of physics.

122
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,920
And often it seemed that physics was very close to discover really that it was right,

123
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:02,400
that we were at a point where we could reduce the universe to this universal time-reversible

124
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
laws.

125
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,560
And every time something went wrong.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,040
In a sense, quantum mechanics had to introduce the observer, the strange role of the observer,

127
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,400
of measurement, and so on, which I shall come back later.

128
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,320
And general relativity came finally to the idea of the Big Bang, which is certainly a

129
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
temporal event.

130
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,880
Last year's conference in Minnesota had a very provocative title, The End of Science.

131
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,640
I don't believe that we can speak about the end of science, but we can certainly speak

132
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,120
about the end of certain forms of rationality associated to classical ideology.

133
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:53,320
And I think it is building up of a new rationality, of a new view of nature, cause, as it is generally

134
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,840
understood, certainly plays an important role.

135
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:07,160
Well, as I already mentioned, the question is this all in our mind, or not, as today

136
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,440
a different, has today different aspects than it had at the time of Boltzmann.

137
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Because we know precisely that going away from equilibrium, going away from situations

138
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,800
which are timeless, nature takes new forms.

139
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,640
We have all these non-equilibrium structures, which I call dissipative structures, which

140
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:38,960
come in, which present a lot of broken symmetries, which are maybe temporal sequences or space

141
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,160
problems and so on.

142
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:51,760
Therefore, the question is where to look, how to incorporate time inside dynamics.

143
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,600
And let me give you a very simple example where you can see that this can be incorporated

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,280
in type of systems, which one calls unstable dynamical systems.

145
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:12,080
And the discovery of unstable dynamical systems is really one of the great discoveries of

146
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,720
the end of last century and of this century.

147
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,560
It's quite remarkable, this century is associated to two great conceptual revolutions, quantum

148
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,280
mechanics and relativity, but classical sciences like thermodynamics or classical mechanics

149
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,200
have also undergone quite a bit of change.

150
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,840
And this change, as I shall show at the end of my lecture, is likely to change quantum

151
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,440
mechanics and relativity.

152
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Let me explain you what an unstable dynamical system is, and I don't know if this is very

153
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
clear.

154
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,200
And you see, it is a geometrical transformation in which you take a square, you squash it,

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,320
you put the right hand above the left, and you obtain more and more this type of stripes,

156
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,720
you see, you fragment it more and more.

157
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,120
And you can immediately understand the two points which were closed in the beginning will

158
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,440
show up in different stripes there at the end.

159
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:29,400
And these systems are characterized by instability, which has been mentioned yesterday by Feigenbaum

160
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,120
and Jappunov exponent.

161
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:39,360
That means that if I take two points very close, initially they will go there exponentially

162
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,840
and the lambda here is a kind of inverse of a temporal horizon, and in this case takes

163
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,040
a very simple value.

164
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,560
And this is an unstable dynamical system, it's a chaotic system because you can no more

165
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,080
associate to it at all the regularity of periodic motions, like the motion of the earth around

166
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
the sun.

167
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:11,200
It is a highly unstable system, particles go away, and it's very, very stochastic.

168
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:18,560
It is an example of what's called a Kolmogorov flow, and this gives me the opportunity to

169
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:28,160
mention the enormous, the extraordinary work of Kolmogorov, because K stands for Kolmogorov.

170
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,360
And I, to say also how much I regret that in the popular literature about his subject,

171
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,480
his work is not sufficiently mentioned.

172
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Because Kolmogorov really was the first to understand that two concepts which seem to

173
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,600
be of opposite are in fact, can in fact be closely related, and this is very important.

174
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,200
And one is the idea of regularity, which we generally associate to dynamic motions like

175
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,640
periodic motions, and the idea of stochasticity.

176
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,200
This system is a highly random system.

177
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,680
In fact, when you follow, I have no time to show it, but if you follow the trajectory

178
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:18,960
of points, you can show that the next position of the point is as random as you would play

179
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
on a roulette.

180
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,560
That is the reason why this system is also called a Bernoulli system, Bernoulli referring

181
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,760
of course to games of chess.

182
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,400
So this is already an example of an unstable system.

183
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,680
Now the important point is that for such unstable system we can introduce a new concept of time.

184
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,280
In addition to the idea of time as motion, as changing from this first picture to the

185
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,520
second to the third and so on, we can introduce a time which is not related.

186
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:03,160
It is related to the motion, which is related to the topology, to the number of stripes,

187
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,560
to the type of conformation, which is a global judgment.

188
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,480
It's like when you look on somebody and you want to guess what is his age, you should

189
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,400
not look only on his hair or on his fingers or that, it's a global judgment.

190
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,120
And here the vein which the red and the white distribute is a global judgment.

191
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,880
And in fact, as my colleague Mithra has shown, you can introduce a time operator that's of

192
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,680
no importance, which measures the number of fragmentations which you have to do to obtain

193
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,640
a given picture.

194
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,600
So there appears a second time, a time which is no more related to motion but which is related

195
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,560
to something more qualitative.

196
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,000
And I would like to show you now that in most systems which we meet, in nature, we can also

197
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,560
introduce this type of second time and this can be introduced for unstable dynamical systems.

198
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:14,960
And that is the vein which time enters now into the fundamental description of nature.

199
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,520
And here I come to the second giant of unstable dynamical systems and that is certainly Poincaré.

200
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:30,240
And in 1892, Poincaré asked a very interesting question.

201
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,400
He didn't ask it in this general form but it is equivalent.

202
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,560
He asked the question, can we eliminate interactions in dynamical systems?

203
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,600
As you know, a dynamical system is described by the energy which physicists call Hamiltonian

204
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,560
and which contains momenta kinetic energy of the particles and interaction, potential

205
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
energy.

206
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:02,240
And he asked, can we make a transformation, a canonical transformation, a one which keeps

207
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,680
the usual form of physics such that you can eliminate the potential energy?

208
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,920
And his answer was no.

209
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,800
And that is very fortunate because in a sense if the answer would be yes, that would mean

210
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:26,680
that the universe would be identical, isomorphic to a system of non-interacting particles and

211
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
this would mean that there would be no coherence.

212
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,960
If there would be no coherence, then there would be no chemistry, there would be no life

213
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,640
and there would be no noble conferences.

214
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
So it has some good and bad aspects.

215
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,520
But anyway, Poincaré pointed out that we cannot do it and he showed something much

216
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
more.

217
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,320
Poincaré showed why you cannot do it and you cannot do it not because of the forces

218
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,680
but because of resonances.

219
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,840
Every child knows what a resonance is when he puts in motion a swing.

220
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,040
This year I've drawn two harmoniques, which are in resonance.

221
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,480
The mathematical definition is that you have two objects or two degrees of freedom, of

222
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,120
course you can have many more, which have frequencies omega 1, omega 2.

223
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,320
And if there is some integers and 1 and 2 such that the sum is equal to 0 and one of

224
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,920
them integers have to be different from 0, then we have resonance.

225
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,960
Now the existence of this resonance, of this strong coupling, because of resonance, as

226
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,200
I mentioned, is not related to the existence or non-existence of forces, that's a different

227
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
problem.

228
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,200
And this means to the famous problem, which Poincaré called the problem of dynamics,

229
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,000
it is the problem of small denominators, why?

230
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,440
Because if you consider a dynamical system, and suppose the dynamical system is made up

231
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,120
by two parts, one which is integrated, you have eliminated the interactions, and then

232
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,000
you put a small perturbation, which contains the interaction, and you want now to eliminate

233
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,680
these interactions.

234
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:23,360
Then when you make the perturbation calculation to try to eliminate it, you come always to

235
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,280
situations in which this small den, which in this resonance condition appears in the

236
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
denominator.

237
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,720
If this is 0 in the denominator, that means then it is infinite, the expression is infinite,

238
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,360
that leads to the problem of small denominators, they are 4 to infinities.

239
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:48,640
And that is, it is these infinities which make a system non-integral.

240
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,400
Of course I have no time, it was on the point to make this more precise, but let me simply

241
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,720
say that if there are enough resonances, then the system becomes non-integral.

242
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,280
What does it mean?

243
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:15,360
It means that you can no more eliminate interactions by methods in which you would choose perturbation

244
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,040
and expand everything in powers of the perturbation constant.

245
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:32,320
So the situation remains there, till the fundamental work again by Kolmogorov in 1954.

246
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:40,160
In 1954 Kolmogorov, soon followed by Arnold and Moser, created what is called now the

247
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,760
camp theory, which is one of the most beautiful theories of physics and mathematics, and which

248
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,960
was the first positive answer to Poincaré's impossibility theorem.

249
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,560
Because what Kolmogorov has shown is that if the coupling is small, then in spite of

250
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:11,000
Poincaré's non-integrability, most motion will remain periodic, like in celestial dynamics.

251
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Only a small variety would become erratic, chaotic.

252
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:25,280
So in a sense, this permits to solve now this non-linear, non-integrable system to some

253
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
extent.

254
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:36,640
But there is something extremely new in the work of Kolmogorov, and what is so new is

255
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,360
that essentially you had the problem of the small denominators, which as I mentioned is

256
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,480
that's called the fundamental problem of mechanics by Poincaré, then you had the camp theory,

257
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:57,280
and as a result of this you have now, most motions become regular, if the interaction

258
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
is small.

259
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:05,160
But there are always now in addition random trajectories, trajectories which wonder seemingly

260
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,840
erratically in the system, and that is of course then the appearance of stochasticity,

261
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:20,240
of probability, of chaos through the Lyapunov exponent, through this divergence of trajectories.

262
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,680
And this is of course therefore a fundamental discovery, and when you look on the type of

263
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,080
diagrams which have been shown already yesterday by Feigenbaum, you see for example here you

264
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,880
see that's called the Poincaré section, you see these points are all the intersections

265
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,200
of a trajectory with a plane coming from a single trajectory, you find some islands

266
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,000
which corresponds to a more regular motion, but most of the points seem to be distributed

267
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,320
just at random on the surface.

268
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,760
So essentially the great discovery of Kamm was stochasticity, that stochasticity and

269
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
dynamics they are not opposed.

270
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,440
Now the type of problem which my colleagues and I have been considering is just the opposite

271
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,520
of the Kamm problem.

272
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:24,480
In the Kamm problem you can still say something when the interaction is weak, when most of

273
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:32,440
the motions remain periodic, but what happens if there are more erratic motions, well you

274
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:39,600
can follow this on the computer, but you cannot say it very much analytically, but therefore

275
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,720
it's interesting to consider another extreme case, and this extreme case is the case in

276
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,560
which all motions are erratic.

277
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:57,280
And that happens in a class of systems which is extremely, I will say popular, which is

278
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,720
extremely present, which we find nearly always in physics.

279
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,440
And there are the situations in which there are so many resonances, that each resonance

280
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,360
is in between other resonances, let me give you an example, a particle, a harmonic oscillator

281
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,680
in a field, but if I consider a harmonic oscillator in a field, the field is a continuum and there

282
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,400
will be frequencies of the field as close as I want from the frequency of the harmonic

283
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,360
oscillator, and therefore I cannot more speak about periodic motions at all, in mathematical

284
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,320
terms you have to say the spectrum is continuous, and you have continuous sets of resonances

285
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,440
that are of no importance, the physical ideas that no resonance appear everywhere, and disappears

286
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,040
I would say in most problems of classical or quantum mechanics, for example if you consider

287
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:05,960
a quantum transition, an unstable state which is destroyed by emission of light, then you

288
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:13,320
have resonance between the energy of the state and the energy of the photon which is emitted,

289
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:20,320
and to calculate the lifetime you have to make an integration, I will go into the details

290
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,120
about, and you have to make an integration over the frequencies of the field, and the

291
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,200
same is also true in kinetic theory, kinetic theory is essentially a theory of resonances

292
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,760
in which particles come together, collide, come together, collide, go away, and when

293
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,600
you analyze the mechanism, and I shall come back to this, it's a resonant mechanism, a

294
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,280
resonant transfer of energy between the particles, so these so called large Poincaré systems

295
00:28:53,280 --> 00:29:02,280
are prevalent in nature, and now it appears something very curious, and very interesting,

296
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,200
and that is a fact, that essentially it can speak about integrable systems, that is most

297
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,560
of classical physics, classical quantum mechanics, and then we have this breaking point, Poincaré's

298
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:23,920
non-integrability theorem, out of this breaking point comes the theory of come, 54 and later,

299
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,720
which leads to dynamical chaos, and then comes the theory in which we have been interested,

300
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,680
which I immediately to emphasize, this is a really a collective work in which Mr Petrovsky

301
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,840
has played a very important role, and we come to the large Poincaré systems, and that is

302
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,000
an interesting point, which I shall try now to explain in the rest of my lecture, not

303
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,440
to technical vain, is that for this limiting case, we can find new methods of integration,

304
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:05,240
we can exactly solve again this problem, and the solution of this problem is quite different

305
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,240
from the solution of the classical problem, many things which are true for integrable

306
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,880
systems, like for example, variational principles, that the particle takes the shortest path

307
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,200
and such kind of thing, are no more true for this type of systems, but on the contrary,

308
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,440
this type of systems are more stochastic, they are more probabilistic, you cannot say

309
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,520
so much as you can say about integrable systems, and not only they are more probabilistic and

310
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,560
more stochastic, but they are also in the sense of course corresponding to much more

311
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,800
irregular motions, and they have, and that is the main point for us, they have a direction

312
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:54,600
of time, therefore a large Poincaré system lead to the incorporation of dynamics in the

313
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:04,560
frame of, the incorporation of time in the frame of dynamics, now how to make this integration,

314
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,640
what do I mean by this new methods of integration, and here I would like to give you first a

315
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,160
small example, and then present the general recipe, the small example which I want to

316
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:25,640
take will be taken from quantum mechanics, now you know quantum mechanics is really a

317
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,160
revolution in the way of thinking, in the sense that in quantum mechanics we associate

318
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,440
to each physical quantity, to each observable as one says, an operator, instead of being

319
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,400
simply a number, it is an abstract quantity called an operator, you should not be afraid

320
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,600
by the word operator, operator is simply a multiplication, a derivation, something like

321
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:55,600
that, and then the main problem of quantum mechanics becomes an eigenvalue problem, the

322
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:03,280
operator acts on some function, derivative of some kind of thing like that, and then

323
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,280
for some function you regenerate simply the initial function, then it is called an eigenfunction,

324
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,600
it is regenerated apart a multiplicative constant, and this constant is then called an eigenvalue,

325
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,560
and what do I mean by this, speak about the spectrum which is formed by the eigenvalues

326
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:30,560
which may be discrete or continuous, and interestingly enough Poincaré's non-integrability criterion

327
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:37,560
applies to quantum mechanics for continuous spectrum, precisely in the case in which each

328
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
for example a harmonic oscillator is embedded in the field of the oscillator and you cannot

329
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:55,520
really disentangle one from the other, and you have exactly the same problem, suppose

330
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,520
a Hamiltonian is the sum of an integrable Hamiltonian plus some perturbation, then can

331
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:10,520
you solve this problem, in general you cannot solve it, and in fact this is one of our difficulties

332
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,680
in modern field theory, modern field theory can solve all problems of free fields, but

333
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,480
it was already mentioned yesterday, if you come to the problem of interacting fields

334
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,000
then it is extremely difficult, in general you cannot do anything, therefore the problem

335
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
is, and this is related to Poincaré, because you can no more expand the solution in powers

336
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,960
of the coupling constant and you cannot obtain a conversion, this expansion.

337
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Now the point in which we have been interested always was the problem of time, and so we

338
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:55,120
came to this idea which seems at first a little strange, but not so, when you remember the

339
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,400
example of the Baker which I gave you before, can we not solve the problem by incorporating

340
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,720
the time, the internal time, a kind of functional time into the problem of integration, to explain

341
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,720
you what I have in mind, let us think about a very simple problem, we can have a stone

342
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,480
falling and outgoing waves, we can in principle have incoming waves which would make the stone

343
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,680
going away, but that is not what we generally observe, what we observe is stone falling

344
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:45,680
and outgoing waves, therefore what we observe is a very defined natural order, natural order,

345
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,600
stone first, waves later, not waves first and stone later, when you now think about a quantum

346
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,840
jump radiation, you expect also a natural order, you expect that you have first have

347
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,960
an unstable state, and then you have the emission of the wave, that was the idea of

348
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,720
all, the wave would be a kind of retarded wave going away, now when you write this problem

349
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,360
in perturbation, you come out to the small denominator and therefore to the Poichard

350
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,480
divergence, here the denominator is the difference between the frequency associated with the particle

351
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,480
and the frequencies associated to the field, therefore the question arises, how can you

352
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,720
cure Poichard's divergence, well as I said, you can cure it and what we have shown, you

353
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:49,120
can cure it exactly, rigorously, into all orders by modifying the small denominators,

354
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,240
modifying the small denominators by associating to each denominator a physical process, so

355
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,680
then you go from 1 to k, you go to the future, then you go from the field to the particle,

356
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,880
you go, so the excited state you go to the past, and this then immediately leads to ideas

357
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,880
about mathematical methods for introducing time or here I cannot go into details, analytic

358
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,680
continuation, forget about it if you don't know it, so essentially you can give a meaning

359
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,680
to Poichard's denominator, and the remarkable feature is that this then eliminates all Poichard's

360
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,680
divergence, you come out now with eigenstates which are complex, which include damping,

361
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,480
which means it includes now dissipation, and have a broken time symmetry, what have you

362
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,980
done, you have essentially extended the type of transformation which Poichard had permitted,

363
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Poichard had permitted only let's say transformations which would keep the eigenvalue real by permitting

364
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:08,140
now a larger type of transformations, we can solve problems which you could not solve before,

365
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,980
and of course we recover what everybody knows, but in addition we recover the existence of

366
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:21,980
an entropy or an h function which decreases monotonously in time, when the particle is

367
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:28,820
decaying into the continuum and emitting its weight, now this is a very interesting point

368
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,820
even from the point of view of quantum mechanics, because in quantum mechanics there is a question

369
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:41,820
which was very much angering Schrodinger, are there quantum jumps, at first everybody,

370
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,700
both theories are quantum jumps, but when you think about Schrodinger's equation which

371
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:54,140
is a fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, it's a continuous equation, there are jumps,

372
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:01,140
and this has given rise to a lot of discussion between Schrodinger and Bohr, and they never

373
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,940
agreed, and Heisenberg wrote somewhere, well it's clear that they didn't agree, because

374
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:15,940
obviously the jumps come from our observation, and this is very difficult to accept, because

375
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:23,420
if quantum jumps are due to our observation, we ourselves are the cause of our existence,

376
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,260
because quantum jumps are the mechanism of all chemical reactions, which are the origin

377
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:36,220
of life, to say that it's because we observe reactions that they are quantum jumps, is that

378
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:42,620
because we observe nature that we exist, that I think is a relatively strange metaphysics

379
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:49,620
and I can hardly believe in it. John Bell has written a book which he called very nicely

380
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,180
speakable and unspeakable problems in quantum mechanics, and he makes a lot of fun out of

381
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,180
these ideas, and I think quite rightly. So in a sense, by making a more general transformation

382
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:12,180
into the complex plane, we can now say in this formulation there is a quantum jump, irreversibly

383
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:21,460
the particle will decay, and you cannot restore the initial situation after a sufficiently

384
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,460
long time. But this is a very simple example in which I can give a simple formulation to

385
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:36,460
the time sequence. I have an unstable state, which is decay. However, in general, it is

386
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:45,500
impossible to find such kind of very easy time order, and we have to turn to the statistical

387
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,500
description. What means the statistical description? That something which Gibbs has introduced many

388
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,500
years ago, instead of consuming one system, you consume many, many of them, you are not

389
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:05,500
interested in the fate of one example, but you are in the fate of the totality. And it

390
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:12,100
like what I explained yesterday about voting and so on, you are not interested in how every

391
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:18,100
single individual will vote that you are interested to know, if there will be 30% of yes, 70% of

392
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,700
no, or what so ever. And this then leads to the idea of a large phase space, and in this

393
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:30,460
phase space, many coordinates, many momenta, and it is described by density function. And

394
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,820
this density function depends on the particle positions, on the momenta, and you can apply

395
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:43,820
similar ideas to classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Now, how time enters into the

396
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,820
statistical description? In addition to the Newtonian time, and that is very easy to see.

397
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,820
I spoke about collisions, but collisions create correlations. Two particles which have

398
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:11,820
interacted, go away, but they keep, I would like to say, the memory of their interaction.

399
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,820
It's like two people, where the conversation, one of them goes to Australia, and the other

400
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,820
goes to Washington, but they keep the memory of their interaction, and they carry it around.

401
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:29,820
If I make a velocity inversion, then they will come again back together. And now the two

402
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,820
people meet a third one, it becomes a ternary interaction, a ternary correlation. The ternary

403
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,820
correlation becomes a fourth correlation. And so on, you can see this very well on the

404
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,820
computer calculation, how the correlations are building up. In a computer, you see that

405
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,820
binary correlations are building up very rapidly, for short distances, for longer distances,

406
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,820
it takes already much more time. Then ternary correlation takes more time, and so on. If

407
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:04,820
I would have here a glass of water, then I could say that this water is still aging. I can

408
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,820
make now a distinction between young water and old water. In old water, there are correlations

409
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,820
between millions and millions of particles which have appeared. In young water, when the

410
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:21,820
molecules have been brought together, they have no correlation. So in a sense, the time here,

411
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,820
at the analogue of the eternal time which I introduced for the Baker transformation, the

412
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:33,820
time here is the time not in the units, not in the motion, but in their relations. If you

413
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,820
take, for example, primitive society, Neolithic society, the people, they are about the same

414
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,820
as we are today from old water, you can guess. However, the relations, they are very different.

415
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,820
The correlations, they are very different. We are living today in a time, in a period in which

416
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:57,820
time is accelerating. And this acceleration of time is related to the fact that we create

417
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:04,820
more and more correlations. We have the mass media. Time is related to the global view we can

418
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:12,820
have on the events which are going on in the universe. Therefore, there is a way of introducing

419
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:19,820
an internal time in all these dynamical systems. And that is the flow of correlation. The flow

420
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:27,820
of correlation which is flowing this Newtonian time that introduces a new dimension, a new

421
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:34,820
aspect of this time. Exactly like in the Baker, you have the Newtonian time coming from the

422
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Baker transformation. In addition, you have this topological time related to the way in which

423
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:49,820
the stripes are distributed. And this, of course, without any mathematics, you can understand that

424
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:58,820
this will destroy the symmetry between past and future. If I start with an initial state which

425
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,820
had no correlations, a young state, then I go to a state B in which there are a lot of correlations

426
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,820
between molecules, my old glass of water. You see, it's not at all the same as if I start with the

427
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,820
old glass of water and I try to rejuvenate it by suppressing the correlation. I would need to have

428
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:23,820
an enormous control on all these correlations which I never have. In fact, the best correlations I can,

429
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,820
to some extent, control today are three-body correlations. In fact, this glass of water about

430
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:36,820
which I spoke has an hour of time which, if I leave it alone and prevent strictly evaporation,

431
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:43,820
has an hour of time which will go on till the end of the universe. Because this hour of time will go on

432
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,820
because the glass of water contains 10 exponents, 23 particles, and before I will have the right

433
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:56,820
correlations of billions of billions of particles that will really take time which goes beyond every

434
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:07,820
imagination. So, in a sense, the existence of these correlations introduces a new time element.

435
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:15,820
And again, once I know that there exists this new time element, I can, of course, introduce this into the

436
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:23,820
mathematics. I can solve the equation for the evolution of the system, for unstable dynamical

437
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:32,820
systems, for Poincare systems. I can solve them exactly, take into account a new way of treating

438
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:41,820
Poincare's denominators, again putting a small i epsilon plus, a small i epsilon minus, according to

439
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,820
the fact that they go from a binary correlation to a ternary, or from a ternary to a second order,

440
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:56,820
and so on. So, essentially, we can now solve rigorously the evolution of ensembles, and we can solve

441
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:05,820
this evolution of ensembles because we have, essentially, this idea that we can introduce into

442
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:13,820
unstable dynamical systems, a supplementary element, and that is the idea of temporal succession

443
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:22,820
expressing the relation between the elements and non-Newtonian, non-Einsteinian time. In fact, this goes

444
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:33,820
further. First of all, as I can only introduce this time element, this time ordering on the level of

445
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:40,820
statistical ensembles, I can no more go back to trajectories, I can no more go back to wave functions.

446
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:48,820
Therefore, I obtain an irreducible description which is statistical, which can no more be reduced,

447
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:56,820
neither to Schrodinger, neither to Newton. It is a stochastic description which is irreducible.

448
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,820
The basic description of unstable dynamical systems is a probabilistic statistical description.

449
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:12,820
That is, the new integration, as I have shown you a few minutes ago, there is a box, the box of classical

450
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:19,820
integrable systems of Schrodinger equation, Newton's equation, Lagrange, and so on. And then I have now a new

451
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:28,820
box, and this new box deals with highly unstable large Poickery systems, and this new box is, can be

452
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:36,820
again integrated as rigorously as Newton and Schrodinger have done it. However, the result of this

453
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:43,820
integration is quite different. The result of this integration is that it remains a stochastic system.

454
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:49,820
It remains a stochastic system, and you cannot reduce it, because if you would like to reduce it, you would

455
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:56,820
lose an information which only refers to the statistical ensemble, which does not refer to

456
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:07,820
trajectories or to refers to wave functions. Now, there is also another element, and this other element

457
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:15,820
is that essentially the description of what happens in such a system is quite different from the usual

458
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:24,820
description in Newtonian physics or Schrodinger physics, because here now, you see, resonance plays an

459
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:32,820
essential role. But what is resonance? Resonance is coming together of two space-time events which are now

460
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:41,820
correlated by resonance. Then somebody, for those of you who know a little statistical physics, they can

461
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:49,820
remember a little the form of diffusion equation for Kaplanck equation. They are equations which contain

462
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:56,820
the second derivative, not the first derivative, as Hamilton's equation. Why second? Because you have in fact

463
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:05,820
two, at least two elementary events which are linked by resonance. Therefore, you can no more decompose the

464
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:14,820
history of the world into independent events like Feynman diagrams. You can decompose into events which are

465
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:22,820
non-linearly, strongly coupled by resonance conditions. And this, of course, is a big change in respect to classical

466
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:31,820
description. Therefore, essentially, let me summarize. On one side, we have integrable systems with

467
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,820
trajectories and wave functions, and on the other hand, we have non-integrable systems, large Poincaré systems

468
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:45,820
for which you can introduce new integrations which lead to new solutions of the eigenvalue problem and to a

469
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:54,820
reducible description in terms of distribution function and to dissipation and entropy. Therefore, you can say

470
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:05,820
that the paradox which I started has to some extent been solved. In the old problem, in the old situation, you had

471
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:15,820
on one side the macroscopic level, the level in which there is time ordering, in which people become older, in which

472
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:23,820
the thermodynamic equilibrium is established, in which if I introduce a difference of concentration, it is leveled out.

473
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:31,820
And you had a time, a description, a fundamental description, a microscopic description, which was time reversible.

474
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,820
Now, I must say that was my driving force over the many years I thought about this problem. I never could understand how time

475
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:49,820
can arise from no time, how this time breaking, symmetry breaking, can arise from equations which have no symmetry

476
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:57,820
breaking in time, which are time reversible. That I could never understand. And that was really the paradox and the answer

477
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:07,820
of some people was to say, oh, the macroscopic level is all in our mind. It's all our imagination. The basic level is the level of eternity.

478
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:14,820
It's not the level of becoming. It's the level of being. That is the fundamental level. That was Einstein's point of view.

479
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:22,820
However, now we come to a different situation. We come to a situation in which you can say we have three levels.

480
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:32,820
We have one level, which is the statistical level, which is reducible, which has a broken time symmetry, which is still dynamical,

481
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:43,820
which applies to large chaotic systems. And by averaging over this, you obtain the macroscopic level with a broken time symmetry.

482
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:51,820
If you would start with trajectories, or as close as you want from trajectories of this wave function, they are destroyed by the

483
00:51:51,820 --> 00:52:00,820
crystallistic character, and you come here. Therefore, this is the statistical level, which now becomes the fundamental level of the description.

484
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:10,820
And here, let me, therefore, try to situate the problem of chaos now to avoid some misunderstanding.

485
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:22,820
In a sense, I think it is very important to make a distinction between dynamical or Hamiltonian chaos and dissipative chaos.

486
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:30,820
Dynamical chaos has dealt with the Scum theory and based on Poincare's theorem.

487
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:37,820
And on the other hand, dissipative chaos has been explained beautifully in some examples yesterday by Feigenbaum.

488
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:47,820
So in a sense, we see now that we have a two level chaos, that the chaos is a concept which contains two levels.

489
00:52:47,820 --> 00:53:00,820
One level is a dynamical chaos, as induced by resonance. The basic mechanism in nature is resonance, because that is present everywhere.

490
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:08,820
I mean, it is present from the three-body problem up to the end-body problem of fields of kinetic equations, and so on.

491
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:15,820
Even if you take the three-body problem, my colleague in Austin, Professor Zewihe, gave me a very beautiful example.

492
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:22,820
If you take the three-body problem, you have three particles going around, one of the other, whatever the initial condition.

493
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:28,820
After some time, one of the bodies will go away and you remain with the two-body problem.

494
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:37,820
Therefore, you have already a kind of arrow of time, even incorporated in so simple problems as the three-body problem.

495
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,820
And not to speak about the end-body problem.

496
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:49,820
Once you have this dynamical chaos, you can, from the dynamical chaos, generate all the beautiful equations which were mentioned yesterday.

497
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,820
The Fourier equation, the Stokes-Navier equation, the chemical equation.

498
00:53:53,820 --> 00:54:01,820
And then for them, you have different types of behavior according to your close to equilibrium, or far from equilibrium.

499
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:09,820
The first condition is that you need to generate the distance from equilibrium, and that is generated through the dynamical chaos.

500
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:15,820
Therefore, the dissipative chaos is a chaos mapped over chaos.

501
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,820
It is the second level of chaos. There are two fundamentally different types of chaos.

502
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:33,820
One is the fundamental chaos, which is related to Poincare's theorem, and to its existence of resonances or instabilities on the fundamental dynamical description.

503
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:39,820
And the other chaos is the outcome of the first chaos on the macroscopic level.

504
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:48,820
And this chaos, as I said, is not a good name, because the chaos as you see it in the macroscopic system is, in fact, order.

505
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:56,820
Because when you see, for example, the period doubling, which was beautifully described yesterday, it is already a highly ordered process.

506
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,820
A highly ordered process. I would like to call it more self-organization.

507
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:10,820
And coherent structures, space patterns, and so on, which we know in the last few months, remarkable progress has been realized in the discovery,

508
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:21,820
both on computers and in the laboratory, of space structures, beautiful space structures, also not only beautiful time structures.

509
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:29,820
You can call all this what emerges out of equilibrium as a process in self-organization.

510
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:37,820
Even the chaos, even when you think about very chaotic phenomena, they are much less chaotic than thermal noise.

511
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,820
In other words, they are already organized phenomena.

512
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:47,820
And therefore, what you see is that order is generated out of chaos.

513
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,820
In other words, here you have really chaos.

514
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:59,820
And out of this dynamical chaos, by putting in the order of time, you generate self-organizing structures.

515
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:12,820
Therefore, you have this strange universe in which, at all levels, we see the appearance of organization out of a microscopic background, which is essentially chaotic.

516
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:23,820
Now, you see, what is also important is that we see now that chaos is closely related to the problem of time,

517
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,820
and time is related to the problem of control, irreversibility.

518
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:33,820
We cannot avoid an unstable particle to disappear.

519
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:42,820
We cannot avoid a three-part correlation to become, at a later time, earlier or later, a four-hour correlation, a fifth-hour correlation.

520
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,820
I like always the same sentence by Nabokov.

521
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:52,820
Nabokov is written, what is real cannot be controlled, and what can be controlled cannot be real.

522
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:58,820
And I think that is exactly the situation to which it becomes.

523
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:09,820
But what is also interesting is that this changes, of course, some of the basic features of quantum mechanics and of relativity.

524
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,820
I have no time to go into this.

525
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:20,820
Let me simply mention that in this introduction to the new physics, Paul Davis has written very correctly.

526
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:29,820
At the rock bottom, quantum mechanics provides a highly successful procedure for predicting the results of observation on microsystems.

527
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,820
But when we ask what actually happens when an observation takes place, we get nonsense.

528
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:40,820
After half a century of arguments, quantum observation debate remains as lively as ever.

529
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,820
The problems of the physics of the very small and the very large are formidable,

530
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:52,820
but it may be that this frontier, the interface of mind and matter, will turn out to be the most challenging legacy of the new physics.

531
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:01,820
This is very closely related to what I have discussed, because here now the basic level is in terms of probabilities.

532
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,820
It's no more in terms of amplitudes, like in ordinary quantum mechanics.

533
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:15,820
Therefore, the question how to go from amplitude to probabilities is automatically solved for unstable chaotic systems.

534
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:22,820
Therefore, you cannot give an exact recipe.

535
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,820
That is measurement apparatus.

536
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,820
It is a chaotic system.

537
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,820
It has to be a chaotic system.

538
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:39,820
It has to be, let's say, a large Poincare system in which the description is in terms of probabilities and cannot be reduced to quantum mechanics, to wave functions.

539
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:51,820
And you have no more this famous problem of the reduction of the wave packet and all the difficulty and the role of subjective observers and so on,

540
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:59,820
which was really a kind of strange story disturbing the scientific community since a few decades.

541
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:09,820
And similarly, when you think about relativity, relativity was always thinking in terms of points in spacetime, instantaneous events.

542
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:13,820
But when you have collisions, when you have resonances, there are no points.

543
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,820
There are connected points, which are connected by the strong resonance conditions.

544
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,820
And therefore, there is a change.

545
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:35,820
Now, therefore, let me conclude by saying our worldview had been essentially dominated both in classical and quantum mechanics by the theory of integrable systems.

546
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:54,820
By the theory of relatively simple systems in which resonances play no role, which are relatively regular, which we could associate to the ideas of determinism, of time reversibility, of universal laws and so on.

547
00:59:54,820 --> 01:00:03,820
What we see now is that this extremely, extremely important window, I would say, is still only a window.

548
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:17,820
It's only part of our physical universe that a much larger part is described by non-integral systems, non-integral systems which lead to different properties.

549
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:22,820
You can integrate them and that is very nice, but you lose some other properties.

550
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,820
As I said, you have no more Lagrangians, no more variational principles.

551
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:38,820
You have a different type of physics, but you have more unified physics because it incorporates thermodynamics, second law, probability and dynamics.

552
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:49,820
And therefore, it certainly creates progress in the direction of unification of our physical world.

553
01:00:49,820 --> 01:01:01,820
Well, I don't know if I've succeeded, but what I've tried to do is to show to you that indeed chaos may be the starting point of a new science.

554
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,820
Thank you very much.
