0	19440	I am very moved by your kind words, it's a great honor which you have bestowed on me.
19440	28320	I feel even somewhat embarrassed, especially with so many eminent colleagues here.
28320	36880	I don't know if I deserve this honor, perhaps my merit has been to be interested in irreversible
36880	45280	processes already at an early stage, when this subject was not very popular.
45280	52360	I'd like to remember a conference which I had been organized at the University of Maryland
52360	61120	in 1946 which was dealing with irreversible processes and at the end of my lecture some
61120	68560	of the most famous thermodynamics of this time stood up and said, I really don't understand
68560	72640	why this young man is interested in irreversible processes.
72640	79480	After all, irreversible processes are transients and after some time you come to equilibrium
79480	83400	why therefore not be directly interested in equilibrium.
83400	90600	I was so astonished that I had not really the presence of mind to say, well we are all transients,
90600	96440	therefore it's rather natural to be interested in our human condition.
96440	104520	At this stage, well to use the expression used by Professor Feigenbaum, everybody was convinced
104520	111600	that there was one universality and this universality was equilibrium.
111600	118000	If you perturb the system, well like let's say pendulum is friction, it goes back to its
118000	119000	equilibrium position.
119000	125120	If you perturb a liquid, a gas, it goes back to equilibrium.
125120	132760	So we were very astonished that when we studied non-equilibrium processes it came to the conclusion
132760	139400	that at the well-defined distance from equilibrium some quite different happened.
139400	145160	And as was mentioned, these different, these new things which happened was as Professor
145160	152880	Gover already mentioned that there is a possibility of new coherent structures.
152880	159040	And this is generally the case if there is some non-linear feedback.
159040	167000	For example, x becomes y, y becomes x, proteins give nucleic acids, nucleic acids give proteins.
167000	174080	Then the type of laws to which we are used generally are no more valid and you come to
174080	182680	some very unexpected phenomena such as we see now today with the Jabotinsky-Belouzov reaction
182680	190800	of chemical oseations that we can see also, space structure, spirals, waves of all kind.
190800	193480	And we are only at the beginning.
193480	200600	And it is very interesting that this really has shattered our ideas about that is for example
200600	202960	the chemical reaction.
202960	209560	Generally we had the idea that a chemical reaction is a random encounter of molecules
209560	217720	where to produce organized patterns coherent time series, of course this is not adequate.
217720	225000	There must exist long-range correlations which are absent at equilibrium.
225000	233800	I like to say in a slightly, I would say anthropomorphic way that matter at equilibrium is blind,
233800	239040	but far from equilibrium it begins to see.
239040	246120	And if we push the system further away from equilibrium by pushing matters who is a reactor
246120	253160	more rapidly or by heating some part including some other, we have some other type, more
253160	259120	complex type of processes which appear and chaos is one of them.
259120	267640	Well, personally I have some hesitation to emphasize the word chaos because chaos has
267640	270720	a little negative connotation.
270720	277560	It is the difficulty of prediction which is emphasized by this connotation.
277560	285040	I like to speak more about self-organization, about the possibility that for given boundary
285040	292800	conditions and for a given mechanism you may have more and more possible structures with
292800	295560	broken time symmetries.
295560	300400	When I was young my teachers were very proud when they could prove that for given boundary
300400	304680	conditions and a given mechanism you had only one solution.
304680	309600	Now we are very proud when we can show that for a given mechanism and given boundary conditions
309600	310960	there are many.
310960	317720	When I was invited to give a talk here I had to make a difficult choice.
317720	326200	I could either speak to you about non-equilibrium structures and the relation with chaos and
326200	329400	this is today a very fashionable subject.
329400	332960	These ideas have been applied in many fields.
332960	340360	Another possibility which was open was to try to give you an idea about the work in which
340360	345360	I am involved with my co-workers and two of my closest co-workers are here, Professor
345360	352320	Petrowski and Hazegaba and to speak to you more about things which make me believe that
352320	359880	indeed chaos may be a new science and as a subject of the conference is really chaos
359880	364280	the new science I decided to try to do this.
364280	368360	However this is not an easy task.
368360	370640	Let me start with the following remark.
370640	376960	After all you have seen these beautiful structures described by Mandelbrot yesterday.
376960	383280	You have also heard about his non-linear equations and the road to chaos beautifully described
383280	384280	by Feigenbaum.
384280	391560	But you can ask the question what is the relation between all these interesting and remarkable
391560	398920	phenomena and the basic description of nature as embedded in Newton's equations or in quantum
398920	401560	mechanics.
401560	408080	And here I would like to emphasize that the type of processes described yesterday by Feigenbaum
408080	413320	occur only when there is a broken time symmetry.
413320	418560	It is then that you have the Stokes-Navier equation, then that you have a reaction diffusion
418560	419560	equation.
419560	425280	Therefore irreversibility is very important, that is what I already just mentioned, that
425280	431000	is when you go away from equilibrium that you have all these new phenomena.
431000	432000	What means irreversibility?
432000	436760	Reversibility means that there is a natural time ordering.
436760	442960	It is obvious that we can say that industrial revolution came after the Neolithic time.
442960	447800	It is obvious that we can make a distinction between young men and an older one.
447800	455040	But is this time ordering basic in nature or is this time ordering simply in our mind?
455040	460720	And that is really a question which has been discussed since centuries.
460720	465040	And the reason why it has been discussed is that if you take the simplest phenomena such
465040	471800	as a pendulum, well, it can start here, go there, or go from here to there, and you cannot
471800	474520	say what's really earlier.
474520	482440	It seems that once you go to the basic description, then you essentially lose the direction of
482440	483440	time.
484320	487360	And this is also true in quantum mechanics.
487360	494200	Therefore, the question is really time real, time is irreversibility.
494200	502680	Now this question was really openly posed with the discovery of thermodynamics in the 19th
502680	509880	century in 1865, when Closier made his famous statement that the entropy of the universe
509880	517480	is increasing and therefore brought in a kind of evolutionary view of the universe.
517480	522640	But you know the great mathematicians of this time, the great physicists, didn't pay any
522640	523640	attention to this.
523640	529880	This was a science produced by engineers in physical chemists which are very low on the
529880	536640	scale, you see, of, I would say, of hierarchy in natural sciences.
536920	542520	Therefore, one of the merits of Boltzmann was, who was certainly a great physicist,
542520	546800	was to ask, what is after all essential about that?
546800	549880	Is there something really fundamental?
549880	555600	He was very much influenced by Darwin, and he tried to make a kind of evolutionary picture
555600	562000	involving populations, not of living beings, but population of molecules.
562000	565080	He came out with his kinetic theory.
565080	573280	But people were rapidly pointing out to him that this was incompatible with the basic time
573280	576680	symmetry of Newton's equation.
576680	582800	And he became gradually more and more unhappy about the situation.
582800	588560	He was really like a man who had two loves, two women he loved at the same time.
588560	594240	On one side, he knew very well the basic equation of physics and the properties, on the other
594240	600280	hand, he believed in an evolutionary world, and he could not have made up his mind.
600280	604560	That gave really a kind of tragic flavor to his life.
604560	611840	And the defeat of Boltzmann was considered by his hair, to some extent, as a triumph,
611840	619480	as a triumph of the idea that time is in our mind, when Einstein, much closer to us, has
619480	623720	written time as irreversibility is an illusion.
623720	631240	I always found curious that this conclusion was so readily accepted, because if you really
631240	637560	think that time is an illusion, well, human life is an illusion, and with it all the attempts
637560	641080	we can make to find more about the world.
641080	646880	That is a remark which Karl Popper has made and which is completely correct.
646880	654200	And I think if there was no crisis due to the defeat of Boltzmann, this came from the
654200	661000	fact that the physicists were convinced that the aim of physics was to express the description
661000	666840	of the nature in terms of universal time-reversible laws.
666840	674360	And this comes back really to the ideology of the period in which science, as it exists
674360	677640	even today, was conceived in the 17th century.
677640	683800	At this time, life was emphasized very much, the fact that for God nothing can be hidden,
683800	691760	that essentially, for a well-informed observer, what will ever happen is already present in
691760	692760	the present.
692760	698040	Therefore, in a sense, the time has to be eliminated.
698040	704760	And this idea to describe everything in terms of universal laws was really the goal, the
704760	708320	ambition of physics.
708320	714920	And often it seemed that physics was very close to discover really that it was right,
714920	722400	that we were at a point where we could reduce the universe to this universal time-reversible
722400	724480	laws.
724480	727560	And every time something went wrong.
727560	734040	In a sense, quantum mechanics had to introduce the observer, the strange role of the observer,
734040	737400	of measurement, and so on, which I shall come back later.
737400	743320	And general relativity came finally to the idea of the Big Bang, which is certainly a
743320	744800	temporal event.
744800	751880	Last year's conference in Minnesota had a very provocative title, The End of Science.
751880	757640	I don't believe that we can speak about the end of science, but we can certainly speak
757640	765120	about the end of certain forms of rationality associated to classical ideology.
765120	773320	And I think it is building up of a new rationality, of a new view of nature, cause, as it is generally
773320	777840	understood, certainly plays an important role.
777840	787160	Well, as I already mentioned, the question is this all in our mind, or not, as today
787160	793440	a different, has today different aspects than it had at the time of Boltzmann.
793440	800960	Because we know precisely that going away from equilibrium, going away from situations
800960	804800	which are timeless, nature takes new forms.
804800	809640	We have all these non-equilibrium structures, which I call dissipative structures, which
809640	818960	come in, which present a lot of broken symmetries, which are maybe temporal sequences or space
818960	821160	problems and so on.
821160	831760	Therefore, the question is where to look, how to incorporate time inside dynamics.
831760	838600	And let me give you a very simple example where you can see that this can be incorporated
838600	844280	in type of systems, which one calls unstable dynamical systems.
844280	852080	And the discovery of unstable dynamical systems is really one of the great discoveries of
852080	855720	the end of last century and of this century.
855720	862560	It's quite remarkable, this century is associated to two great conceptual revolutions, quantum
862560	870280	mechanics and relativity, but classical sciences like thermodynamics or classical mechanics
870280	875200	have also undergone quite a bit of change.
875200	880840	And this change, as I shall show at the end of my lecture, is likely to change quantum
880840	883440	mechanics and relativity.
883440	892720	Let me explain you what an unstable dynamical system is, and I don't know if this is very
892720	894720	clear.
894720	901200	And you see, it is a geometrical transformation in which you take a square, you squash it,
901200	907320	you put the right hand above the left, and you obtain more and more this type of stripes,
907320	909720	you see, you fragment it more and more.
909720	916120	And you can immediately understand the two points which were closed in the beginning will
916120	920440	show up in different stripes there at the end.
920440	929400	And these systems are characterized by instability, which has been mentioned yesterday by Feigenbaum
929400	931120	and Jappunov exponent.
931120	939360	That means that if I take two points very close, initially they will go there exponentially
939360	946840	and the lambda here is a kind of inverse of a temporal horizon, and in this case takes
946840	949040	a very simple value.
949040	954560	And this is an unstable dynamical system, it's a chaotic system because you can no more
954560	963080	associate to it at all the regularity of periodic motions, like the motion of the earth around
963080	964080	the sun.
964080	971200	It is a highly unstable system, particles go away, and it's very, very stochastic.
971200	978560	It is an example of what's called a Kolmogorov flow, and this gives me the opportunity to
978560	988160	mention the enormous, the extraordinary work of Kolmogorov, because K stands for Kolmogorov.
988160	994360	And I, to say also how much I regret that in the popular literature about his subject,
994360	997480	his work is not sufficiently mentioned.
997480	1003360	Because Kolmogorov really was the first to understand that two concepts which seem to
1003360	1010600	be of opposite are in fact, can in fact be closely related, and this is very important.
1010600	1017200	And one is the idea of regularity, which we generally associate to dynamic motions like
1017200	1021640	periodic motions, and the idea of stochasticity.
1021640	1025200	This system is a highly random system.
1025200	1029680	In fact, when you follow, I have no time to show it, but if you follow the trajectory
1029680	1038960	of points, you can show that the next position of the point is as random as you would play
1038960	1039960	on a roulette.
1039960	1045560	That is the reason why this system is also called a Bernoulli system, Bernoulli referring
1045560	1049760	of course to games of chess.
1049760	1054400	So this is already an example of an unstable system.
1054400	1061680	Now the important point is that for such unstable system we can introduce a new concept of time.
1061680	1069280	In addition to the idea of time as motion, as changing from this first picture to the
1069280	1075520	second to the third and so on, we can introduce a time which is not related.
1075520	1083160	It is related to the motion, which is related to the topology, to the number of stripes,
1083160	1088560	to the type of conformation, which is a global judgment.
1088560	1094480	It's like when you look on somebody and you want to guess what is his age, you should
1094480	1100400	not look only on his hair or on his fingers or that, it's a global judgment.
1100400	1106120	And here the vein which the red and the white distribute is a global judgment.
1106120	1111880	And in fact, as my colleague Mithra has shown, you can introduce a time operator that's of
1111880	1118680	no importance, which measures the number of fragmentations which you have to do to obtain
1118680	1120640	a given picture.
1120640	1128600	So there appears a second time, a time which is no more related to motion but which is related
1128600	1131560	to something more qualitative.
1131560	1138000	And I would like to show you now that in most systems which we meet, in nature, we can also
1138000	1147560	introduce this type of second time and this can be introduced for unstable dynamical systems.
1147560	1154960	And that is the vein which time enters now into the fundamental description of nature.
1154960	1162520	And here I come to the second giant of unstable dynamical systems and that is certainly Poincaré.
1162520	1170240	And in 1892, Poincaré asked a very interesting question.
1170240	1174400	He didn't ask it in this general form but it is equivalent.
1174400	1181560	He asked the question, can we eliminate interactions in dynamical systems?
1181560	1187600	As you know, a dynamical system is described by the energy which physicists call Hamiltonian
1187600	1194560	and which contains momenta kinetic energy of the particles and interaction, potential
1194560	1195560	energy.
1195560	1202240	And he asked, can we make a transformation, a canonical transformation, a one which keeps
1202240	1209680	the usual form of physics such that you can eliminate the potential energy?
1209680	1212920	And his answer was no.
1212920	1218800	And that is very fortunate because in a sense if the answer would be yes, that would mean
1218800	1226680	that the universe would be identical, isomorphic to a system of non-interacting particles and
1226680	1228680	this would mean that there would be no coherence.
1228680	1233960	If there would be no coherence, then there would be no chemistry, there would be no life
1233960	1236640	and there would be no noble conferences.
1236640	1240400	So it has some good and bad aspects.
1240400	1246520	But anyway, Poincaré pointed out that we cannot do it and he showed something much
1246520	1247520	more.
1247520	1255320	Poincaré showed why you cannot do it and you cannot do it not because of the forces
1255320	1258680	but because of resonances.
1258680	1264840	Every child knows what a resonance is when he puts in motion a swing.
1264840	1270040	This year I've drawn two harmoniques, which are in resonance.
1270040	1276480	The mathematical definition is that you have two objects or two degrees of freedom, of
1276480	1281120	course you can have many more, which have frequencies omega 1, omega 2.
1281120	1287320	And if there is some integers and 1 and 2 such that the sum is equal to 0 and one of
1287320	1292920	them integers have to be different from 0, then we have resonance.
1292920	1297960	Now the existence of this resonance, of this strong coupling, because of resonance, as
1297960	1303200	I mentioned, is not related to the existence or non-existence of forces, that's a different
1303200	1304200	problem.
1304200	1311200	And this means to the famous problem, which Poincaré called the problem of dynamics,
1311200	1315000	it is the problem of small denominators, why?
1315000	1321440	Because if you consider a dynamical system, and suppose the dynamical system is made up
1321440	1327120	by two parts, one which is integrated, you have eliminated the interactions, and then
1327120	1333000	you put a small perturbation, which contains the interaction, and you want now to eliminate
1333000	1335680	these interactions.
1335680	1343360	Then when you make the perturbation calculation to try to eliminate it, you come always to
1343360	1350280	situations in which this small den, which in this resonance condition appears in the
1350280	1351280	denominator.
1351640	1357720	If this is 0 in the denominator, that means then it is infinite, the expression is infinite,
1357720	1362360	that leads to the problem of small denominators, they are 4 to infinities.
1362360	1368640	And that is, it is these infinities which make a system non-integral.
1368640	1374400	Of course I have no time, it was on the point to make this more precise, but let me simply
1374400	1381720	say that if there are enough resonances, then the system becomes non-integral.
1381720	1385280	What does it mean?
1385280	1395360	It means that you can no more eliminate interactions by methods in which you would choose perturbation
1395360	1402040	and expand everything in powers of the perturbation constant.
1402040	1412320	So the situation remains there, till the fundamental work again by Kolmogorov in 1954.
1412320	1420160	In 1954 Kolmogorov, soon followed by Arnold and Moser, created what is called now the
1420160	1427760	camp theory, which is one of the most beautiful theories of physics and mathematics, and which
1427760	1433960	was the first positive answer to Poincaré's impossibility theorem.
1433960	1440560	Because what Kolmogorov has shown is that if the coupling is small, then in spite of
1440560	1451000	Poincaré's non-integrability, most motion will remain periodic, like in celestial dynamics.
1451000	1457400	Only a small variety would become erratic, chaotic.
1457400	1465280	So in a sense, this permits to solve now this non-linear, non-integrable system to some
1465280	1466280	extent.
1466280	1476640	But there is something extremely new in the work of Kolmogorov, and what is so new is
1476640	1483360	that essentially you had the problem of the small denominators, which as I mentioned is
1483360	1489480	that's called the fundamental problem of mechanics by Poincaré, then you had the camp theory,
1489480	1497280	and as a result of this you have now, most motions become regular, if the interaction
1497280	1498280	is small.
1498280	1505160	But there are always now in addition random trajectories, trajectories which wonder seemingly
1505160	1511840	erratically in the system, and that is of course then the appearance of stochasticity,
1511840	1520240	of probability, of chaos through the Lyapunov exponent, through this divergence of trajectories.
1520240	1526680	And this is of course therefore a fundamental discovery, and when you look on the type of
1526680	1532080	diagrams which have been shown already yesterday by Feigenbaum, you see for example here you
1532080	1537880	see that's called the Poincaré section, you see these points are all the intersections
1537880	1544200	of a trajectory with a plane coming from a single trajectory, you find some islands
1544200	1552000	which corresponds to a more regular motion, but most of the points seem to be distributed
1552000	1556320	just at random on the surface.
1556320	1563760	So essentially the great discovery of Kamm was stochasticity, that stochasticity and
1563760	1566960	dynamics they are not opposed.
1566960	1574440	Now the type of problem which my colleagues and I have been considering is just the opposite
1574440	1576520	of the Kamm problem.
1576520	1584480	In the Kamm problem you can still say something when the interaction is weak, when most of
1584480	1592440	the motions remain periodic, but what happens if there are more erratic motions, well you
1592440	1599600	can follow this on the computer, but you cannot say it very much analytically, but therefore
1599600	1606720	it's interesting to consider another extreme case, and this extreme case is the case in
1606720	1610560	which all motions are erratic.
1610560	1617280	And that happens in a class of systems which is extremely, I will say popular, which is
1617280	1623720	extremely present, which we find nearly always in physics.
1623720	1629440	And there are the situations in which there are so many resonances, that each resonance
1629440	1637360	is in between other resonances, let me give you an example, a particle, a harmonic oscillator
1637360	1643680	in a field, but if I consider a harmonic oscillator in a field, the field is a continuum and there
1643680	1650400	will be frequencies of the field as close as I want from the frequency of the harmonic
1650400	1657360	oscillator, and therefore I cannot more speak about periodic motions at all, in mathematical
1657360	1663320	terms you have to say the spectrum is continuous, and you have continuous sets of resonances
1663320	1670440	that are of no importance, the physical ideas that no resonance appear everywhere, and disappears
1670440	1676040	I would say in most problems of classical or quantum mechanics, for example if you consider
1676040	1685960	a quantum transition, an unstable state which is destroyed by emission of light, then you
1685960	1693320	have resonance between the energy of the state and the energy of the photon which is emitted,
1693320	1700320	and to calculate the lifetime you have to make an integration, I will go into the details
1700320	1707120	about, and you have to make an integration over the frequencies of the field, and the
1707120	1713200	same is also true in kinetic theory, kinetic theory is essentially a theory of resonances
1713200	1720760	in which particles come together, collide, come together, collide, go away, and when
1720760	1725600	you analyze the mechanism, and I shall come back to this, it's a resonant mechanism, a
1725600	1733280	resonant transfer of energy between the particles, so these so called large Poincaré systems
1733280	1742280	are prevalent in nature, and now it appears something very curious, and very interesting,
1742280	1748200	and that is a fact, that essentially it can speak about integrable systems, that is most
1748200	1755560	of classical physics, classical quantum mechanics, and then we have this breaking point, Poincaré's
1755560	1763920	non-integrability theorem, out of this breaking point comes the theory of come, 54 and later,
1763920	1770720	which leads to dynamical chaos, and then comes the theory in which we have been interested,
1771680	1778680	which I immediately to emphasize, this is a really a collective work in which Mr Petrovsky
1778680	1784840	has played a very important role, and we come to the large Poincaré systems, and that is
1784840	1791000	an interesting point, which I shall try now to explain in the rest of my lecture, not
1791000	1797440	to technical vain, is that for this limiting case, we can find new methods of integration,
1797440	1805240	we can exactly solve again this problem, and the solution of this problem is quite different
1805240	1810240	from the solution of the classical problem, many things which are true for integrable
1810240	1817880	systems, like for example, variational principles, that the particle takes the shortest path
1817880	1823200	and such kind of thing, are no more true for this type of systems, but on the contrary,
1823200	1828440	this type of systems are more stochastic, they are more probabilistic, you cannot say
1828440	1833520	so much as you can say about integrable systems, and not only they are more probabilistic and
1833520	1839560	more stochastic, but they are also in the sense of course corresponding to much more
1839560	1845800	irregular motions, and they have, and that is the main point for us, they have a direction
1845800	1854600	of time, therefore a large Poincaré system lead to the incorporation of dynamics in the
1854600	1864560	frame of, the incorporation of time in the frame of dynamics, now how to make this integration,
1864560	1871640	what do I mean by this new methods of integration, and here I would like to give you first a
1871720	1878160	small example, and then present the general recipe, the small example which I want to
1878160	1885640	take will be taken from quantum mechanics, now you know quantum mechanics is really a
1885640	1891160	revolution in the way of thinking, in the sense that in quantum mechanics we associate
1891160	1897440	to each physical quantity, to each observable as one says, an operator, instead of being
1897440	1903400	simply a number, it is an abstract quantity called an operator, you should not be afraid
1903400	1908600	by the word operator, operator is simply a multiplication, a derivation, something like
1908600	1915600	that, and then the main problem of quantum mechanics becomes an eigenvalue problem, the
1915600	1923280	operator acts on some function, derivative of some kind of thing like that, and then
1923280	1930280	for some function you regenerate simply the initial function, then it is called an eigenfunction,
1931600	1938600	it is regenerated apart a multiplicative constant, and this constant is then called an eigenvalue,
1938600	1943560	and what do I mean by this, speak about the spectrum which is formed by the eigenvalues
1943560	1950560	which may be discrete or continuous, and interestingly enough Poincaré's non-integrability criterion
1950560	1957560	applies to quantum mechanics for continuous spectrum, precisely in the case in which each
1961000	1968000	for example a harmonic oscillator is embedded in the field of the oscillator and you cannot
1968520	1975520	really disentangle one from the other, and you have exactly the same problem, suppose
1975520	1982520	a Hamiltonian is the sum of an integrable Hamiltonian plus some perturbation, then can
1983520	1990520	you solve this problem, in general you cannot solve it, and in fact this is one of our difficulties
1991000	1996680	in modern field theory, modern field theory can solve all problems of free fields, but
1996680	2001480	it was already mentioned yesterday, if you come to the problem of interacting fields
2001480	2006000	then it is extremely difficult, in general you cannot do anything, therefore the problem
2006000	2013000	is, and this is related to Poincaré, because you can no more expand the solution in powers
2013960	2020960	of the coupling constant and you cannot obtain a conversion, this expansion.
2020960	2027960	Now the point in which we have been interested always was the problem of time, and so we
2028120	2035120	came to this idea which seems at first a little strange, but not so, when you remember the
2037400	2044400	example of the Baker which I gave you before, can we not solve the problem by incorporating
2046720	2053720	the time, the internal time, a kind of functional time into the problem of integration, to explain
2053720	2060720	you what I have in mind, let us think about a very simple problem, we can have a stone
2064480	2071480	falling and outgoing waves, we can in principle have incoming waves which would make the stone
2071760	2078680	going away, but that is not what we generally observe, what we observe is stone falling
2078680	2085680	and outgoing waves, therefore what we observe is a very defined natural order, natural order,
2087600	2094600	stone first, waves later, not waves first and stone later, when you now think about a quantum
2095840	2102840	jump radiation, you expect also a natural order, you expect that you have first have
2103560	2108960	an unstable state, and then you have the emission of the wave, that was the idea of
2108960	2115720	all, the wave would be a kind of retarded wave going away, now when you write this problem
2115720	2121360	in perturbation, you come out to the small denominator and therefore to the Poichard
2121360	2127480	divergence, here the denominator is the difference between the frequency associated with the particle
2127480	2134480	and the frequencies associated to the field, therefore the question arises, how can you
2134720	2141720	cure Poichard's divergence, well as I said, you can cure it and what we have shown, you
2142120	2149120	can cure it exactly, rigorously, into all orders by modifying the small denominators,
2150240	2157240	modifying the small denominators by associating to each denominator a physical process, so
2157680	2164680	then you go from 1 to k, you go to the future, then you go from the field to the particle,
2164880	2170880	you go, so the excited state you go to the past, and this then immediately leads to ideas
2170880	2177880	about mathematical methods for introducing time or here I cannot go into details, analytic
2178680	2185680	continuation, forget about it if you don't know it, so essentially you can give a meaning
2185920	2192680	to Poichard's denominator, and the remarkable feature is that this then eliminates all Poichard's
2192680	2199680	divergence, you come out now with eigenstates which are complex, which include damping,
2200480	2206480	which means it includes now dissipation, and have a broken time symmetry, what have you
2206480	2212980	done, you have essentially extended the type of transformation which Poichard had permitted,
2212980	2219980	Poichard had permitted only let's say transformations which would keep the eigenvalue real by permitting
2221140	2228140	now a larger type of transformations, we can solve problems which you could not solve before,
2228300	2234980	and of course we recover what everybody knows, but in addition we recover the existence of
2234980	2241980	an entropy or an h function which decreases monotonously in time, when the particle is
2242540	2248820	decaying into the continuum and emitting its weight, now this is a very interesting point
2248820	2254820	even from the point of view of quantum mechanics, because in quantum mechanics there is a question
2254820	2261820	which was very much angering Schrodinger, are there quantum jumps, at first everybody,
2261980	2267700	both theories are quantum jumps, but when you think about Schrodinger's equation which
2267700	2274140	is a fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, it's a continuous equation, there are jumps,
2274140	2281140	and this has given rise to a lot of discussion between Schrodinger and Bohr, and they never
2282340	2288940	agreed, and Heisenberg wrote somewhere, well it's clear that they didn't agree, because
2288940	2295940	obviously the jumps come from our observation, and this is very difficult to accept, because
2296420	2303420	if quantum jumps are due to our observation, we ourselves are the cause of our existence,
2303500	2310260	because quantum jumps are the mechanism of all chemical reactions, which are the origin
2310260	2316220	of life, to say that it's because we observe reactions that they are quantum jumps, is that
2316220	2322620	because we observe nature that we exist, that I think is a relatively strange metaphysics
2322620	2329620	and I can hardly believe in it. John Bell has written a book which he called very nicely
2331180	2337180	speakable and unspeakable problems in quantum mechanics, and he makes a lot of fun out of
2337180	2344180	these ideas, and I think quite rightly. So in a sense, by making a more general transformation
2345180	2352180	into the complex plane, we can now say in this formulation there is a quantum jump, irreversibly
2354620	2361460	the particle will decay, and you cannot restore the initial situation after a sufficiently
2361460	2368460	long time. But this is a very simple example in which I can give a simple formulation to
2369460	2376460	the time sequence. I have an unstable state, which is decay. However, in general, it is
2378500	2385500	impossible to find such kind of very easy time order, and we have to turn to the statistical
2387500	2393500	description. What means the statistical description? That something which Gibbs has introduced many
2393500	2398500	years ago, instead of consuming one system, you consume many, many of them, you are not
2398500	2405500	interested in the fate of one example, but you are in the fate of the totality. And it
2406220	2412100	like what I explained yesterday about voting and so on, you are not interested in how every
2412100	2418100	single individual will vote that you are interested to know, if there will be 30% of yes, 70% of
2418100	2423700	no, or what so ever. And this then leads to the idea of a large phase space, and in this
2423700	2430460	phase space, many coordinates, many momenta, and it is described by density function. And
2430460	2436820	this density function depends on the particle positions, on the momenta, and you can apply
2436820	2443820	similar ideas to classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Now, how time enters into the
2444820	2451820	statistical description? In addition to the Newtonian time, and that is very easy to see.
2453820	2459820	I spoke about collisions, but collisions create correlations. Two particles which have
2464820	2471820	interacted, go away, but they keep, I would like to say, the memory of their interaction.
2471820	2476820	It's like two people, where the conversation, one of them goes to Australia, and the other
2476820	2482820	goes to Washington, but they keep the memory of their interaction, and they carry it around.
2482820	2489820	If I make a velocity inversion, then they will come again back together. And now the two
2489820	2495820	people meet a third one, it becomes a ternary interaction, a ternary correlation. The ternary
2495820	2501820	correlation becomes a fourth correlation. And so on, you can see this very well on the
2501820	2507820	computer calculation, how the correlations are building up. In a computer, you see that
2507820	2512820	binary correlations are building up very rapidly, for short distances, for longer distances,
2512820	2517820	it takes already much more time. Then ternary correlation takes more time, and so on. If
2517820	2524820	I would have here a glass of water, then I could say that this water is still aging. I can
2524820	2530820	make now a distinction between young water and old water. In old water, there are correlations
2530820	2535820	between millions and millions of particles which have appeared. In young water, when the
2535820	2541820	molecules have been brought together, they have no correlation. So in a sense, the time here,
2541820	2546820	at the analogue of the eternal time which I introduced for the Baker transformation, the
2546820	2553820	time here is the time not in the units, not in the motion, but in their relations. If you
2553820	2559820	take, for example, primitive society, Neolithic society, the people, they are about the same
2559820	2565820	as we are today from old water, you can guess. However, the relations, they are very different.
2565820	2571820	The correlations, they are very different. We are living today in a time, in a period in which
2571820	2577820	time is accelerating. And this acceleration of time is related to the fact that we create
2577820	2584820	more and more correlations. We have the mass media. Time is related to the global view we can
2584820	2592820	have on the events which are going on in the universe. Therefore, there is a way of introducing
2592820	2599820	an internal time in all these dynamical systems. And that is the flow of correlation. The flow
2599820	2607820	of correlation which is flowing this Newtonian time that introduces a new dimension, a new
2607820	2614820	aspect of this time. Exactly like in the Baker, you have the Newtonian time coming from the
2614820	2621820	Baker transformation. In addition, you have this topological time related to the way in which
2621820	2629820	the stripes are distributed. And this, of course, without any mathematics, you can understand that
2629820	2638820	this will destroy the symmetry between past and future. If I start with an initial state which
2638820	2644820	had no correlations, a young state, then I go to a state B in which there are a lot of correlations
2644820	2650820	between molecules, my old glass of water. You see, it's not at all the same as if I start with the
2650820	2656820	old glass of water and I try to rejuvenate it by suppressing the correlation. I would need to have
2656820	2663820	an enormous control on all these correlations which I never have. In fact, the best correlations I can,
2663820	2669820	to some extent, control today are three-body correlations. In fact, this glass of water about
2669820	2676820	which I spoke has an hour of time which, if I leave it alone and prevent strictly evaporation,
2676820	2683820	has an hour of time which will go on till the end of the universe. Because this hour of time will go on
2683820	2690820	because the glass of water contains 10 exponents, 23 particles, and before I will have the right
2690820	2696820	correlations of billions of billions of particles that will really take time which goes beyond every
2696820	2707820	imagination. So, in a sense, the existence of these correlations introduces a new time element.
2707820	2715820	And again, once I know that there exists this new time element, I can, of course, introduce this into the
2715820	2723820	mathematics. I can solve the equation for the evolution of the system, for unstable dynamical
2723820	2732820	systems, for Poincare systems. I can solve them exactly, take into account a new way of treating
2732820	2741820	Poincare's denominators, again putting a small i epsilon plus, a small i epsilon minus, according to
2741820	2747820	the fact that they go from a binary correlation to a ternary, or from a ternary to a second order,
2747820	2756820	and so on. So, essentially, we can now solve rigorously the evolution of ensembles, and we can solve
2756820	2765820	this evolution of ensembles because we have, essentially, this idea that we can introduce into
2765820	2773820	unstable dynamical systems, a supplementary element, and that is the idea of temporal succession
2773820	2782820	expressing the relation between the elements and non-Newtonian, non-Einsteinian time. In fact, this goes
2782820	2793820	further. First of all, as I can only introduce this time element, this time ordering on the level of
2793820	2800820	statistical ensembles, I can no more go back to trajectories, I can no more go back to wave functions.
2800820	2808820	Therefore, I obtain an irreducible description which is statistical, which can no more be reduced,
2808820	2816820	neither to Schrodinger, neither to Newton. It is a stochastic description which is irreducible.
2816820	2823820	The basic description of unstable dynamical systems is a probabilistic statistical description.
2823820	2832820	That is, the new integration, as I have shown you a few minutes ago, there is a box, the box of classical
2832820	2839820	integrable systems of Schrodinger equation, Newton's equation, Lagrange, and so on. And then I have now a new
2839820	2848820	box, and this new box deals with highly unstable large Poickery systems, and this new box is, can be
2848820	2856820	again integrated as rigorously as Newton and Schrodinger have done it. However, the result of this
2856820	2863820	integration is quite different. The result of this integration is that it remains a stochastic system.
2863820	2869820	It remains a stochastic system, and you cannot reduce it, because if you would like to reduce it, you would
2869820	2876820	lose an information which only refers to the statistical ensemble, which does not refer to
2876820	2887820	trajectories or to refers to wave functions. Now, there is also another element, and this other element
2887820	2895820	is that essentially the description of what happens in such a system is quite different from the usual
2895820	2904820	description in Newtonian physics or Schrodinger physics, because here now, you see, resonance plays an
2904820	2912820	essential role. But what is resonance? Resonance is coming together of two space-time events which are now
2912820	2921820	correlated by resonance. Then somebody, for those of you who know a little statistical physics, they can
2921820	2929820	remember a little the form of diffusion equation for Kaplanck equation. They are equations which contain
2929820	2936820	the second derivative, not the first derivative, as Hamilton's equation. Why second? Because you have in fact
2936820	2945820	two, at least two elementary events which are linked by resonance. Therefore, you can no more decompose the
2945820	2954820	history of the world into independent events like Feynman diagrams. You can decompose into events which are
2954820	2962820	non-linearly, strongly coupled by resonance conditions. And this, of course, is a big change in respect to classical
2962820	2971820	description. Therefore, essentially, let me summarize. On one side, we have integrable systems with
2971820	2977820	trajectories and wave functions, and on the other hand, we have non-integrable systems, large Poincaré systems
2977820	2985820	for which you can introduce new integrations which lead to new solutions of the eigenvalue problem and to a
2985820	2994820	reducible description in terms of distribution function and to dissipation and entropy. Therefore, you can say
2994820	3005820	that the paradox which I started has to some extent been solved. In the old problem, in the old situation, you had
3005820	3015820	on one side the macroscopic level, the level in which there is time ordering, in which people become older, in which
3015820	3023820	the thermodynamic equilibrium is established, in which if I introduce a difference of concentration, it is leveled out.
3023820	3031820	And you had a time, a description, a fundamental description, a microscopic description, which was time reversible.
3031820	3038820	Now, I must say that was my driving force over the many years I thought about this problem. I never could understand how time
3038820	3049820	can arise from no time, how this time breaking, symmetry breaking, can arise from equations which have no symmetry
3049820	3057820	breaking in time, which are time reversible. That I could never understand. And that was really the paradox and the answer
3057820	3067820	of some people was to say, oh, the macroscopic level is all in our mind. It's all our imagination. The basic level is the level of eternity.
3067820	3074820	It's not the level of becoming. It's the level of being. That is the fundamental level. That was Einstein's point of view.
3074820	3082820	However, now we come to a different situation. We come to a situation in which you can say we have three levels.
3082820	3092820	We have one level, which is the statistical level, which is reducible, which has a broken time symmetry, which is still dynamical,
3092820	3103820	which applies to large chaotic systems. And by averaging over this, you obtain the macroscopic level with a broken time symmetry.
3103820	3111820	If you would start with trajectories, or as close as you want from trajectories of this wave function, they are destroyed by the
3111820	3120820	crystallistic character, and you come here. Therefore, this is the statistical level, which now becomes the fundamental level of the description.
3120820	3130820	And here, let me, therefore, try to situate the problem of chaos now to avoid some misunderstanding.
3130820	3142820	In a sense, I think it is very important to make a distinction between dynamical or Hamiltonian chaos and dissipative chaos.
3142820	3150820	Dynamical chaos has dealt with the Scum theory and based on Poincare's theorem.
3150820	3157820	And on the other hand, dissipative chaos has been explained beautifully in some examples yesterday by Feigenbaum.
3157820	3167820	So in a sense, we see now that we have a two level chaos, that the chaos is a concept which contains two levels.
3167820	3180820	One level is a dynamical chaos, as induced by resonance. The basic mechanism in nature is resonance, because that is present everywhere.
3180820	3188820	I mean, it is present from the three-body problem up to the end-body problem of fields of kinetic equations, and so on.
3188820	3195820	Even if you take the three-body problem, my colleague in Austin, Professor Zewihe, gave me a very beautiful example.
3195820	3202820	If you take the three-body problem, you have three particles going around, one of the other, whatever the initial condition.
3202820	3208820	After some time, one of the bodies will go away and you remain with the two-body problem.
3208820	3217820	Therefore, you have already a kind of arrow of time, even incorporated in so simple problems as the three-body problem.
3217820	3220820	And not to speak about the end-body problem.
3220820	3229820	Once you have this dynamical chaos, you can, from the dynamical chaos, generate all the beautiful equations which were mentioned yesterday.
3229820	3233820	The Fourier equation, the Stokes-Navier equation, the chemical equation.
3233820	3241820	And then for them, you have different types of behavior according to your close to equilibrium, or far from equilibrium.
3241820	3249820	The first condition is that you need to generate the distance from equilibrium, and that is generated through the dynamical chaos.
3249820	3255820	Therefore, the dissipative chaos is a chaos mapped over chaos.
3255820	3260820	It is the second level of chaos. There are two fundamentally different types of chaos.
3260820	3273820	One is the fundamental chaos, which is related to Poincare's theorem, and to its existence of resonances or instabilities on the fundamental dynamical description.
3273820	3279820	And the other chaos is the outcome of the first chaos on the macroscopic level.
3279820	3288820	And this chaos, as I said, is not a good name, because the chaos as you see it in the macroscopic system is, in fact, order.
3288820	3296820	Because when you see, for example, the period doubling, which was beautifully described yesterday, it is already a highly ordered process.
3296820	3300820	A highly ordered process. I would like to call it more self-organization.
3300820	3310820	And coherent structures, space patterns, and so on, which we know in the last few months, remarkable progress has been realized in the discovery,
3310820	3321820	both on computers and in the laboratory, of space structures, beautiful space structures, also not only beautiful time structures.
3321820	3329820	You can call all this what emerges out of equilibrium as a process in self-organization.
3329820	3337820	Even the chaos, even when you think about very chaotic phenomena, they are much less chaotic than thermal noise.
3337820	3340820	In other words, they are already organized phenomena.
3340820	3347820	And therefore, what you see is that order is generated out of chaos.
3347820	3350820	In other words, here you have really chaos.
3350820	3359820	And out of this dynamical chaos, by putting in the order of time, you generate self-organizing structures.
3359820	3372820	Therefore, you have this strange universe in which, at all levels, we see the appearance of organization out of a microscopic background, which is essentially chaotic.
3373820	3383820	Now, you see, what is also important is that we see now that chaos is closely related to the problem of time,
3383820	3388820	and time is related to the problem of control, irreversibility.
3388820	3393820	We cannot avoid an unstable particle to disappear.
3393820	3402820	We cannot avoid a three-part correlation to become, at a later time, earlier or later, a four-hour correlation, a fifth-hour correlation.
3402820	3406820	I like always the same sentence by Nabokov.
3406820	3412820	Nabokov is written, what is real cannot be controlled, and what can be controlled cannot be real.
3412820	3418820	And I think that is exactly the situation to which it becomes.
3418820	3429820	But what is also interesting is that this changes, of course, some of the basic features of quantum mechanics and of relativity.
3429820	3432820	I have no time to go into this.
3432820	3440820	Let me simply mention that in this introduction to the new physics, Paul Davis has written very correctly.
3440820	3449820	At the rock bottom, quantum mechanics provides a highly successful procedure for predicting the results of observation on microsystems.
3449820	3454820	But when we ask what actually happens when an observation takes place, we get nonsense.
3454820	3460820	After half a century of arguments, quantum observation debate remains as lively as ever.
3460820	3464820	The problems of the physics of the very small and the very large are formidable,
3464820	3472820	but it may be that this frontier, the interface of mind and matter, will turn out to be the most challenging legacy of the new physics.
3472820	3481820	This is very closely related to what I have discussed, because here now the basic level is in terms of probabilities.
3481820	3485820	It's no more in terms of amplitudes, like in ordinary quantum mechanics.
3485820	3495820	Therefore, the question how to go from amplitude to probabilities is automatically solved for unstable chaotic systems.
3495820	3502820	Therefore, you cannot give an exact recipe.
3502820	3505820	That is measurement apparatus.
3505820	3507820	It is a chaotic system.
3507820	3509820	It has to be a chaotic system.
3509820	3519820	It has to be, let's say, a large Poincare system in which the description is in terms of probabilities and cannot be reduced to quantum mechanics, to wave functions.
3519820	3531820	And you have no more this famous problem of the reduction of the wave packet and all the difficulty and the role of subjective observers and so on,
3531820	3539820	which was really a kind of strange story disturbing the scientific community since a few decades.
3539820	3549820	And similarly, when you think about relativity, relativity was always thinking in terms of points in spacetime, instantaneous events.
3549820	3553820	But when you have collisions, when you have resonances, there are no points.
3553820	3558820	There are connected points, which are connected by the strong resonance conditions.
3558820	3562820	And therefore, there is a change.
3562820	3575820	Now, therefore, let me conclude by saying our worldview had been essentially dominated both in classical and quantum mechanics by the theory of integrable systems.
3575820	3594820	By the theory of relatively simple systems in which resonances play no role, which are relatively regular, which we could associate to the ideas of determinism, of time reversibility, of universal laws and so on.
3594820	3603820	What we see now is that this extremely, extremely important window, I would say, is still only a window.
3603820	3617820	It's only part of our physical universe that a much larger part is described by non-integral systems, non-integral systems which lead to different properties.
3617820	3622820	You can integrate them and that is very nice, but you lose some other properties.
3622820	3626820	As I said, you have no more Lagrangians, no more variational principles.
3626820	3638820	You have a different type of physics, but you have more unified physics because it incorporates thermodynamics, second law, probability and dynamics.
3638820	3649820	And therefore, it certainly creates progress in the direction of unification of our physical world.
3649820	3661820	Well, I don't know if I've succeeded, but what I've tried to do is to show to you that indeed chaos may be the starting point of a new science.
3661820	3662820	Thank you very much.
