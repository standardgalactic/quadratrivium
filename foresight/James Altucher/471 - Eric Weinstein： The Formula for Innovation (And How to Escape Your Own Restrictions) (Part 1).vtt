00:00.000 --> 00:04.260
I am so glad you convinced me that the family car

00:04.260 --> 00:06.060
should be the Defender 110.

00:06.060 --> 00:09.500
It is so beautiful inside, it's so comfortable,

00:09.500 --> 00:11.820
and it just feels indestructible.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.020
Yes, it really is.

00:13.020 --> 00:15.580
I've been waiting a long time for the new model to come out.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.420
The Defender 110, I'm telling you,

00:17.420 --> 00:19.380
it's my favorite car of all times.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.740
It's my third one.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.980
You know, I have stories of going off road.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.740
The guy managed the group.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.380
He was like, what are you doing in this beautiful car?

00:27.380 --> 00:28.500
I'm like, I'm going off road.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.340
He's like, are you sure?

00:29.340 --> 00:30.460
Because you can use one of ours,

00:30.460 --> 00:32.180
and then they look like Mad Max cars.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.460
I'm like, no, no, no, we're going to do this,

00:33.460 --> 00:34.620
and he was shocked.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.460
Wow.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.980
Well, it's great because the Defender

00:36.980 --> 00:39.900
has been reimagined for 21st century adventure,

00:39.900 --> 00:42.620
and its unparalleled off-road ability,

00:42.620 --> 00:45.860
as well as its robust interior, are invaluable,

00:45.860 --> 00:47.940
whether you're headed towards uncharted territory,

00:47.940 --> 00:50.500
or just a weekend of exploration.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.100
The Defender 110 tackles challenging surroundings

00:53.100 --> 00:54.980
with absolute confidence.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.860
The SUV conveys strength outside and in,

00:57.860 --> 00:59.300
featuring peerless technology,

00:59.300 --> 01:01.460
like an intuitive driver display,

01:01.460 --> 01:04.020
and an award-winning infotainment system.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.340
That's my favorite part, to keep you connected,

01:06.340 --> 01:08.700
no matter where the journey takes you.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.340
Adventure is unique to everyone, and so is the Defender.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.500
Choose from the two-door Defender 90,

01:14.500 --> 01:17.980
the four-door Defender 110, or the larger Defender 130,

01:17.980 --> 01:20.700
with the ability to seat up to eight passengers.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.860
You'll find uncompromising performance in all three.

01:23.860 --> 01:28.140
So pack up and go even further with the Defender 110.

This isn't your average business podcast,

01:57.460 --> 01:59.860
and he's not your average host.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.860
This is the James Altiger Show on the Choose Yourself Network.

02:05.940 --> 02:08.940
Today on the James Altiger Show.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.700
In many ways, permission to be an imposter

02:12.700 --> 02:15.580
is something you have to take for yourself.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.020
So if you're hearing this podcast,

02:17.020 --> 02:18.980
and if you feel like an imposter,

02:18.980 --> 02:20.940
instead of trying to fight it,

02:20.940 --> 02:23.700
just try experimenting when you're in the quiet of your own room.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.300
What if I am an imposter, then so what?

02:26.300 --> 02:30.340
Maybe the idea is that my faking it would be as good or better

02:30.340 --> 02:33.100
than somebody else's earnest attempt.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.980
So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting your fear

02:37.980 --> 02:39.100
of being an imposter,

02:39.100 --> 02:42.460
and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.

02:42.460 --> 02:47.060
You know, for any area, it seems like there's a set path,

02:47.060 --> 02:50.220
there's a set formula to become the top of that area.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.060
And I think, would you say being an imposter

02:54.060 --> 02:56.780
is when there are people who come into the area

02:56.780 --> 02:58.340
without taking that traditional path?

02:58.340 --> 02:59.500
Right, yeah.

02:59.500 --> 03:04.340
But never discount what somebody can do

03:04.340 --> 03:05.860
completely on their own.

03:05.860 --> 03:08.700
And I think when you first make a decision

03:08.700 --> 03:12.140
to burn the boat so there's no returning home, right?

03:12.140 --> 03:14.180
I think that's when things get really exciting

03:14.180 --> 03:15.900
because it's sink or swim,

03:15.900 --> 03:18.340
and people become incredibly inventive

03:18.380 --> 03:20.620
once they become isolated and terrified.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.900
When do you think you've burned boats?

03:22.900 --> 03:24.700
What was your first experience with it?

03:29.700 --> 03:31.580
So, I don't even know how to introduce you.

03:31.580 --> 03:32.900
You're Eric Weinstein,

03:32.900 --> 03:35.540
you're managing director of Weinstein.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.140
I keep forgetting that.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.500
Weinstein, Eric Weinstein,

03:39.500 --> 03:42.100
managing director of Teal Capital.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.340
You got your PhD in mathematical physics at Harvard.

03:45.340 --> 03:48.500
You've done, you're like a Renaissance man, I feel.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.620
You're kind of, I've listened to a whole bunch

03:50.620 --> 03:52.420
of excellent podcasts with you.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.460
Let's start off with Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Tim Ferriss.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.820
I highly recommend people listen to you on those podcasts too

03:58.820 --> 04:01.740
because to get the wide range of your knowledge,

04:01.740 --> 04:03.340
what other things should people say about you?

04:03.340 --> 04:04.900
How do people introduce you?

04:04.900 --> 04:06.100
You've done like a million things.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.020
Well, I don't know, I'm just a guy

04:08.020 --> 04:10.580
who's interested in canonical structures in the universe

04:10.580 --> 04:12.540
and try to find them wherever we can.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.940
So, what do you mean by canonical structure?

04:14.940 --> 04:16.900
And then I'll actually continue the intro.

04:16.900 --> 04:20.700
Well, just, I guess what I'm fascinated by

04:20.700 --> 04:25.700
is things that are extremely elegant, very powerful.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.860
There's an idea, I think, due to Richard Dawkins

04:29.860 --> 04:32.620
that you measure the power of an idea

04:32.620 --> 04:36.500
by what it explains divided by what it assumes.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.260
And so the most powerful ideas assume very little

04:39.260 --> 04:42.260
and tell you a tremendous amount when you unpack them.

04:42.260 --> 04:44.900
So, in general, if you're gonna try to get through life,

04:44.900 --> 04:48.340
you wanna find the most powerful ideas by that rubric.

04:48.340 --> 04:51.540
Okay, but let me unpack that a little bit.

04:53.940 --> 04:57.020
I've heard that before and,

04:57.020 --> 04:58.500
but with the addition that also

04:58.500 --> 05:00.340
it should have some predictive ability.

05:00.340 --> 05:03.540
So, a theory might explain a lot,

05:03.540 --> 05:07.420
like let's take Richard Dawkins in evolutionary psychology.

05:07.420 --> 05:10.180
It could explain a lot, but does it predict a lot?

05:10.180 --> 05:12.540
And would you include that in something

05:12.540 --> 05:14.900
that's an important mental model?

05:14.900 --> 05:17.140
Sure, I mean, I think it does predict a lot

05:17.140 --> 05:20.780
and I think a lot of it can be quite surprising.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.580
Before we get to evolutionary psychology,

05:22.580 --> 05:24.180
because that's always gonna be fraught

05:24.180 --> 05:26.900
as people don't want to imagine

05:26.900 --> 05:29.020
that their thoughts and behavior patterns

05:29.020 --> 05:30.940
are somewhat systematized.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.640
You just take something like the four chord song from music.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.220
I guarantee you that within the next year,

05:39.220 --> 05:42.380
someone will release a version of the four chord song

05:42.380 --> 05:47.260
that will go one, five, six, minor, four.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.260
And they'll have a worldwide hit with it.

05:49.260 --> 05:52.140
And it's predictive because that is a formula

05:52.140 --> 05:57.140
that is known to underlie all sorts of hits.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.500
And it's clearly not by accident or...

06:01.820 --> 06:05.140
So, have you read The Head Factory

06:05.140 --> 06:07.300
about these group of Swedish guys

06:07.300 --> 06:09.940
who basically produce every hits on

06:09.940 --> 06:11.900
and they basically use that structure,

06:11.900 --> 06:14.620
like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, like every hit?

06:14.620 --> 06:17.660
That's usually a bit more complex

06:17.660 --> 06:19.660
than simple four chord songs

06:19.660 --> 06:22.780
that can be strummed around the campfire.

06:22.780 --> 06:26.220
But yeah, I think that there are formulas

06:26.220 --> 06:28.280
and very often the formulas are sort of hidden

06:28.280 --> 06:30.920
as if they're machine tools that make the tools.

06:31.980 --> 06:36.120
So the idea that you have some Scandinavian group

06:36.120 --> 06:38.520
that has figured out the DNA of music

06:38.520 --> 06:41.540
and knows how to pump out hits at will is fascinating.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.740
Why should anyone have that power?

06:43.740 --> 06:45.340
And the idea that there is,

06:46.180 --> 06:48.900
well, that there are formulas is what's fascinating.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.140
So when I talk about canonical structures,

06:51.140 --> 06:54.060
I'm most interested in ways in which the world

06:54.060 --> 06:56.220
seems incredibly complicated,

06:56.220 --> 06:59.700
but in fact reduces to a very small set of assumptions.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.020
So what's another example?

07:02.020 --> 07:05.980
Well, the famous ones that people all know

07:05.980 --> 07:08.620
would be, for example, the periodic table,

07:08.620 --> 07:12.700
but maybe despite the fact that that tells you all

07:12.700 --> 07:13.780
about the chemical elements

07:13.780 --> 07:17.260
and gives you a lot of indication of how they'll combine,

07:17.260 --> 07:21.380
most people have never seen the left step periodic table,

07:21.380 --> 07:24.420
which makes clear the relationship between symmetries

07:24.420 --> 07:26.660
and orbitals and chemical elements.

07:26.660 --> 07:30.900
So that would be an example of a design innovation

07:30.900 --> 07:34.700
where just the presentation of the information

07:34.700 --> 07:36.940
lays bare the underlying structure.

07:36.940 --> 07:41.580
Or if we were talking music or not music language,

07:41.580 --> 07:43.740
the international phonemic alphabet

07:43.740 --> 07:46.020
is something that most people don't even know it exists,

07:46.020 --> 07:50.060
but it has to do with the mapping of the structure

07:50.060 --> 07:54.140
or our speech apparatus into a universal notation

07:54.140 --> 07:55.140
so that you can understand

07:55.140 --> 07:56.820
how to pronounce something in any language.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.700
And so I've heard you talk about that

07:58.700 --> 08:01.140
on Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.340
I think it's fascinating, but it also underlines,

08:03.340 --> 08:06.780
all these things underlined how much of a kind

08:06.900 --> 08:09.060
of polymath or renaissance person you are.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.540
Like, you have your PhD in mathematical physics,

08:11.540 --> 08:12.900
you have results there,

08:12.900 --> 08:17.380
but you've gotten from that to economics,

08:17.380 --> 08:20.900
to obviously a deep understanding of music and language

08:20.900 --> 08:23.020
and economics and finance

08:23.020 --> 08:24.860
and you're managing director of Teal Capitals

08:24.860 --> 08:26.860
who are involved in the investing world.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.540
And the way I know more about you

08:31.540 --> 08:34.580
as I actually heard you speak a few months ago in New York,

08:34.580 --> 08:37.740
Dave Rubin was on the stage, Melissa Chen was on the stage,

08:37.740 --> 08:39.740
and it was about this, you know,

08:39.740 --> 08:41.780
the so-called intellectual dark web,

08:41.780 --> 08:43.860
a phrase you coined,

08:43.860 --> 08:48.860
which is kind of about, if I was to describe it,

08:48.900 --> 08:53.500
basically the limitations on free speech

08:53.500 --> 08:58.500
that has polarized the US or even the world on both sides,

08:59.300 --> 09:00.860
but I would say maybe a little bit more

09:00.860 --> 09:02.500
since Trump got elected,

09:03.460 --> 09:04.940
the limitations of free speech

09:04.940 --> 09:07.860
are happening a little bit more on the left side, and...

09:07.860 --> 09:09.180
Just not a little bit.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.020
All right, not a little bit,

09:10.020 --> 09:13.140
but and to note, you're from the left side,

09:13.140 --> 09:15.100
I've been a Democrat all my life,

09:15.100 --> 09:19.020
but suddenly I find you cannot even,

09:19.020 --> 09:24.020
unless you agree with all 50 things on one team,

09:24.020 --> 09:26.660
you're ruined.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.820
But that's not even true.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.060
There's no way to agree with it

09:29.060 --> 09:31.460
because it's self-contradictory.

09:31.460 --> 09:32.300
Tell me what you mean.

09:33.020 --> 09:37.060
If you are men and women different

09:37.060 --> 09:38.740
or are men and women the same?

09:38.740 --> 09:41.740
So this new movement asserts

09:41.740 --> 09:44.340
both of those things at different times

09:44.340 --> 09:46.860
in order to make two different sets of points.

09:46.860 --> 09:49.460
If you want to make the point that leaving women out

09:51.460 --> 09:52.740
is a problem because you don't get

09:52.740 --> 09:53.900
the benefit of diversity,

09:53.900 --> 09:55.020
you say, do you have any idea

09:55.020 --> 09:57.100
how differently women think from men?

09:57.100 --> 09:58.740
You're losing all of that perspective,

09:58.740 --> 10:00.220
which is an interesting argument.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.220
And then when you see, let's say a workplace

10:03.220 --> 10:07.380
with a lack of balance between men and women,

10:07.380 --> 10:10.220
they'll claim will be men and women are exactly the same

10:10.220 --> 10:13.340
and the failure to hire women has to do

10:13.340 --> 10:17.260
with bigotry and prejudice.

10:17.260 --> 10:18.780
And so it's very interesting.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.900
You're making two separate arguments.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.060
Both of them are individually interesting.

10:23.060 --> 10:24.260
Then you say, well, look,

10:24.260 --> 10:25.740
I've heard you make two different arguments.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.540
Let's try to figure out how they combine

10:27.540 --> 10:28.820
or whether there's a contradiction

10:28.820 --> 10:30.020
or there's something to explore.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.940
And then people get very, very angry.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.740
They get very angry in it.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.300
The way you just put that

10:35.300 --> 10:38.500
kind of reminds me of arguments in relationships.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.860
So it's when two sides,

10:41.860 --> 10:45.060
the man and the woman say, disagree about something.

10:45.060 --> 10:48.780
And usually the way you resolve arguments is,

10:48.780 --> 10:50.460
okay, why do you disagree?

10:50.460 --> 10:51.460
Why do you disagree?

10:51.460 --> 10:52.620
What are all the options?

10:52.620 --> 10:54.060
And then you discuss what's the,

10:54.060 --> 10:56.020
what option is best for the unit

10:56.020 --> 10:57.540
kind of in the middle of that spectrum

10:57.540 --> 10:58.820
between one side and the other.

10:58.820 --> 11:02.100
But here we've come to a place societally

11:02.100 --> 11:07.020
where people are not willing to acknowledge

11:07.020 --> 11:09.300
that there are options in the middle.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.580
Yeah, I don't think it's really about options in the middle

11:11.580 --> 11:13.740
or compromise or common ground.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.540
I think that for some reason that we don't understand

11:16.540 --> 11:19.220
and interesting that both of us identify

11:19.220 --> 11:21.500
with being lifelong Democrats,

11:21.500 --> 11:25.020
something has gone completely insane inside of the left

11:25.020 --> 11:26.700
with respect to logic and reason.

11:26.740 --> 11:29.340
Just even to the point where bringing up logic,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.620
reason, contradiction,

11:30.620 --> 11:33.540
I'm told these are tools of power and oppression.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.380
And I don't even waste time

11:36.380 --> 11:38.220
within any argument that stupid.

11:38.220 --> 11:40.620
It's just, it's so far outside the bounds

11:40.620 --> 11:43.380
of what civilized people should be discussing,

11:43.380 --> 11:45.020
whether or not logic and reason,

11:45.020 --> 11:46.100
I mean, are we gonna be discussing

11:46.100 --> 11:48.580
whether arithmetic is biased?

11:48.580 --> 11:50.780
I have no idea where these people are going.

11:50.780 --> 11:53.020
Well, I wondered about this

11:53.020 --> 11:55.140
when thinking about this podcast,

11:55.260 --> 11:59.020
you're obviously involved in at least questioning

11:59.020 --> 12:00.140
what's going on with free speech.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.740
People like you and Jordan Peterson

12:01.740 --> 12:04.100
who's also been on the podcast and others.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.540
And my first inclination was to think,

12:07.540 --> 12:08.940
why do you care?

12:08.940 --> 12:12.820
Because I just avoid people who don't let me talk.

12:12.820 --> 12:16.220
But I guess in the workplace and in,

12:16.220 --> 12:20.420
if you're out there trying to make other points

12:20.420 --> 12:24.060
that you want people to consider what you're saying

12:24.100 --> 12:25.700
and value what you're saying,

12:25.700 --> 12:27.180
then there's some Twitter mob

12:27.180 --> 12:29.180
or just some societal mob in general

12:29.180 --> 12:31.580
that says, no, he said this 15 years ago,

12:31.580 --> 12:33.740
so we can't listen to anything else he ever says.

12:33.740 --> 12:36.060
I guess it is important to this.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.100
I mean, it's not even close.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.060
What we are potentially going to do

12:40.060 --> 12:45.060
in terms of our ability to destroy our institutions,

12:45.660 --> 12:47.660
suppress thought, descent,

12:49.180 --> 12:52.100
completely weaken ourselves

12:52.100 --> 12:54.180
and our scientific enterprises

12:54.180 --> 12:56.060
by creating a climate in which no one knows

12:56.060 --> 12:59.300
what the rules are from moment to moment.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.460
And anyone can come out of any nook of your past

13:03.460 --> 13:07.060
and accuse you and you feel like you have to answer.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.180
I think it's really important

13:08.180 --> 13:10.900
that people stop answering all of the accusations

13:10.900 --> 13:13.620
with information about their lives.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.340
Very often somebody will be accused and they'll say,

13:15.340 --> 13:16.860
well, actually I was here and I was there

13:16.860 --> 13:18.020
and I was doing this other thing.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.300
Why are you telling people?

13:19.340 --> 13:23.420
I mean, just if people want to accuse you of something,

13:23.420 --> 13:25.460
have them do it through the courts

13:25.460 --> 13:29.180
and have it be done with presumption of innocence.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.380
There's something that's going on

13:31.380 --> 13:34.860
in which we are now attacking people's ability

13:34.860 --> 13:39.260
to earn a living as a second judiciary process.

13:39.260 --> 13:42.180
And the idea is that if we can destroy your reputation,

13:42.180 --> 13:44.420
we may not be able to get you into a court of law,

13:44.420 --> 13:46.900
but we can keep you from feeding your family.

13:46.940 --> 13:51.940
And that is what I've been calling left cartheism.

13:52.020 --> 13:55.180
And because I come from the left,

13:55.180 --> 13:59.140
we learned to hate McCarthyism during the 1950s

13:59.140 --> 14:01.140
because it was used against us

14:01.140 --> 14:02.860
and it was used very specifically

14:02.860 --> 14:05.540
to destroy progressive families.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.740
The idea that people calling themselves progressives

14:08.740 --> 14:12.740
have rediscovered the tools of ruin

14:12.740 --> 14:15.660
that were previously used against progressives

14:15.700 --> 14:20.260
by an out of control anti-communist movement

14:20.260 --> 14:23.340
in the United States is beyond ridiculous.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.340
Well, it's interesting

14:24.340 --> 14:26.380
because it didn't just start now,

14:26.380 --> 14:29.180
although maybe it's at the peak that it's ever been.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.300
I mean, there's always been this notion of PC culture

14:32.300 --> 14:35.060
and you always kind of had to be careful around it.

14:35.060 --> 14:37.780
But it's just maybe it's gotten,

14:37.780 --> 14:39.300
I think since the election of Trump,

14:39.300 --> 14:41.140
it's gotten much more intense

14:41.140 --> 14:44.100
where you're either on one team or the other.

14:44.100 --> 14:48.540
And like you say, it's even hard to say what the team is

14:48.540 --> 14:53.540
because both sides could be construed with the same hate.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.260
But that sounds reactive to Trump.

14:55.260 --> 14:59.100
My claim is that Trump was called out of the vacuum

14:59.100 --> 15:02.740
and installed as president largely because of this madness.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.660
The reason I'm so against this madness

15:05.660 --> 15:09.940
is because it's going to elect us Trump or worse

15:09.940 --> 15:11.740
in the eyes of the left.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.420
In other words, if you start going after

15:14.420 --> 15:16.700
the bedrock of American labor,

15:16.700 --> 15:21.700
let's say famously Hillary's comment about deplorables,

15:23.100 --> 15:26.460
I believe that deplorables are democratic apostates

15:26.460 --> 15:28.260
who left the Democratic Party

15:28.260 --> 15:30.100
when it started abandoning labor

15:31.100 --> 15:34.620
and tried to make up the constituency deficit

15:34.620 --> 15:36.740
by embracing identity politics.

15:36.740 --> 15:38.100
And the claim is that labor

15:38.100 --> 15:40.540
was a super expensive constituency

15:40.540 --> 15:43.460
and identity politics is incredibly cheap.

15:43.460 --> 15:47.620
So the donor class wanted to swap out labor for identity.

15:47.620 --> 15:50.900
This is my wife's theory, Pia Milani's.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.980
But I think that-

15:53.980 --> 15:56.220
Although labor is a huge voting constituency.

15:56.220 --> 16:01.220
Well, it is, but if you have like white former coal miners

16:02.740 --> 16:04.260
in their 60s or something,

16:04.260 --> 16:06.860
and then you're making fun of them as deplorables

16:06.860 --> 16:11.860
because their church going, rifle owning,

16:13.180 --> 16:16.140
speak your mind, American bedrock.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.500
I think that it just shows

16:17.500 --> 16:20.180
that we're completely cut off from our own history,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.540
our own base.

16:21.540 --> 16:26.380
And you should never antagonize a group of people

16:26.380 --> 16:29.860
that's taken a really serious hit like this,

16:29.860 --> 16:31.860
which is in some sense,

16:31.860 --> 16:33.940
just a bedrock constituency in this country.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.500
You're opening the door of Pandora's box.

16:36.540 --> 16:39.220
I can't imagine anyone smart wanting to do that.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.060
Why do you?

16:40.060 --> 16:45.060
I mean, Hillary's obviously not the most successful

16:45.140 --> 16:46.060
campaign in the world,

16:46.060 --> 16:48.380
but she knows what she's doing enough to get nominated

16:48.380 --> 16:50.500
to be almost president.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.100
And why do you think she did that?

16:54.060 --> 16:59.060
I think that Hillary is part of a very long slide

17:00.020 --> 17:05.020
into middle brown nonsense that was used

17:05.300 --> 17:07.500
to blow out the genie coefficients,

17:07.500 --> 17:09.780
create a tremendous amount of income,

17:09.780 --> 17:12.740
inequality, and asset inequality in this country.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.620
I think that when Bill Clinton figured out

17:15.620 --> 17:20.620
how to finally stop the 12 year Republican juggernaut in 1992,

17:23.100 --> 17:25.980
he largely did it by copying so much

17:25.980 --> 17:28.700
of the Republican playbook that you have two versions

17:29.860 --> 17:31.660
of the pro inequality party.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.660
And I think that definitely the idea

17:33.700 --> 17:36.940
that Republicans remain the party of millionaires,

17:36.940 --> 17:39.180
but Democrats have become the party of billionaires

17:39.180 --> 17:40.780
is an interesting critique.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.940
Well, it's interesting because in 1992,

17:42.940 --> 17:45.500
I mean, at the time he was head of the,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.780
I think it was the Democrat National Caucus

17:48.780 --> 17:49.780
or Southern Caucus,

17:49.780 --> 17:52.300
some part of the Democratic party,

17:52.300 --> 17:54.580
that was kind of the conservative wing

17:54.580 --> 17:55.540
of a Democratic party.

17:55.540 --> 18:00.540
And the fact that they're now signaled to be so on the left,

18:01.540 --> 18:03.620
it was kind of an interesting.

18:03.620 --> 18:06.420
Yeah, but I don't even know what these words really mean.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.940
I think that we have two parties, Democrat and Republican,

18:08.940 --> 18:11.860
we can call them left and right, if you will.

18:11.860 --> 18:16.220
But to me, it's two faces of the looting party.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.900
Of the looting party.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.380
Okay, what do you mean by looting?

18:19.380 --> 18:21.180
Well, that we've been,

18:21.180 --> 18:23.380
we have this country with a tremendous amount of wealth.

18:23.380 --> 18:24.980
We have a problem with growth

18:24.980 --> 18:26.340
and that we're not really honest

18:26.340 --> 18:29.360
about confronting our problems with growth.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.040
So just like any family that has a family business

18:32.040 --> 18:33.560
that has made it wealthy,

18:33.560 --> 18:36.440
where the business starts to begin sputtering,

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
you have a very interesting period of time

18:38.440 --> 18:40.520
where you can use the wealth of the family,

18:40.520 --> 18:44.160
you can take loans against the assets,

18:44.160 --> 18:45.960
you can sell things off,

18:45.960 --> 18:48.240
and you can live in the style to which you become accustomed

18:48.240 --> 18:50.600
as you try to figure out how to restart the business.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.000
Well, that's, I think, what we've been doing

18:52.000 --> 18:55.520
for almost since the beginning of the 70s,

18:55.520 --> 18:57.240
certainly since the beginning of the 80s,

18:57.240 --> 18:58.560
is that we've been buying time,

18:58.560 --> 19:00.440
but not actually figuring out

19:00.440 --> 19:04.160
how to really restart hyper-aggressive growth.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.800
Where do you see that?

19:07.800 --> 19:10.080
How do you see that playing out?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.440
Well, I don't think we're as invested

19:11.440 --> 19:14.320
in real science and technology and Mavericks.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.120
We're not interested in employing

19:16.120 --> 19:18.560
the super disagreeable people

19:18.560 --> 19:20.520
who are strong enough to hold positions

19:20.520 --> 19:22.520
that no one agrees with them on,

19:22.520 --> 19:27.160
but are in fact necessary to overturn incorrect orthodoxies.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.160
We're interested in this kind of consensus,

19:30.160 --> 19:34.720
communal structure that's going to choke our ability

19:34.720 --> 19:37.640
to find new sources of economic growth.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.560
We want dangerous, difficult people,

19:40.560 --> 19:43.480
people who you don't necessarily feel safe,

19:45.120 --> 19:46.640
trusting your cat to.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.000
I mean, people who are aggressive.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.760
And I think often about Jim Watson.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.200
Jim Watson chooses to be incredibly unpleasant

19:56.200 --> 19:59.960
in many ways as the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.800
On the other hand,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.880
he's been fantastically productive over his life.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.440
And he's a great example of someone

20:07.440 --> 20:12.280
who gave himself permission to dominate areas of science

20:12.280 --> 20:15.080
or innovation where he wasn't necessarily

20:15.080 --> 20:18.080
the expert or that informed in those areas.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.000
And I think that's part of what makes someone dangerous,

20:21.000 --> 20:25.200
is to be able to step into an area, say things out loud,

20:25.200 --> 20:29.240
and yet not kind of challenge the top of the pyramid.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.160
Well, but he's also,

20:30.160 --> 20:33.280
he's offensive almost for the sake of being offensive.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.720
So I'm not saying,

20:34.720 --> 20:37.200
boy, this is the way to conduct yourself at a party

20:37.200 --> 20:40.520
or what a wonderful way to treat other people.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.960
I'm trying to say,

20:41.960 --> 20:45.800
if you want somebody who is balls to the wall

20:45.800 --> 20:48.640
and trying to break into new territory

20:48.640 --> 20:51.200
and do things at the highest level of human ability,

20:51.200 --> 20:53.160
you're gonna have to put up with some people like that.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.200
So let's talk about that for a second,

20:55.200 --> 20:56.400
because, and I think this is a little

20:56.400 --> 20:58.920
out of the intellectual dark web discussion,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.520
but I'm really fascinated by skill acquisition

21:01.520 --> 21:05.320
and the so-called 10,000-hour role of Anders Erickson,

21:05.320 --> 21:07.560
popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.400
You've succeeded in many different areas.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.840
You're an expert in many different areas.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.560
Obviously, you're super intelligent,

21:16.560 --> 21:19.440
but it seems like you've made conscious decision

21:19.440 --> 21:22.240
and permission in the same way that Watson might have

21:22.240 --> 21:25.760
to say, okay, I'm gonna become knowledgeable and an expert

21:25.760 --> 21:28.160
and even an investor in other areas

21:28.160 --> 21:30.240
other than differential geometry,

21:30.240 --> 21:32.560
which you studied and got your PhD in.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.720
But even there, I'm an imposter.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.800
Why is that?

21:35.800 --> 21:38.960
Well, I don't, for example, have a thesis advisor.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.080
You didn't have a thesis advisor?

21:40.080 --> 21:40.920
No.

21:40.920 --> 21:41.760
What happened?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.600
You were at Harvard.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.440
Yeah.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.280
You had some ideas.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.120
Nobody liked them.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.560
I think people were interested in the ideas,

21:48.560 --> 21:51.960
but I think that they were pretty radical in a lot of ways.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.520
I'm afraid to ask what the ideas were

21:54.520 --> 21:55.800
because they're gonna be way beyond.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.040
Look, I can say words around them.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.360
You're not gonna understand what the words mean,

21:58.360 --> 22:01.560
but let's imagine that you had some set of equations

22:01.560 --> 22:03.320
that was thought to only occur

22:03.320 --> 22:06.800
in particular sets of dimensions, whatever dimensions are.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.600
Okay, so you would have an assertion

22:08.600 --> 22:11.160
that these equations are peculiar to dimension four

22:11.160 --> 22:13.080
and don't exist anywhere else.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.000
And so maybe I try to show that, well, actually,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.280
versions of those equations exist in all dimensions.

22:18.320 --> 22:23.320
So that shibboleth or that perspective was challenged.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.960
And if I wanted to try to relate

22:25.960 --> 22:29.320
the kind of work we were doing in geometry

22:29.320 --> 22:32.360
to actual guesses about the world of particles

22:32.360 --> 22:35.800
and particle theory, that could cause a problem.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.800
And so in many ways, permission to be an imposter

22:42.080 --> 22:44.920
is something you have to take for yourself.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.560
And in particular, young women.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.440
So young women have confidence problems

22:50.440 --> 22:53.920
that I think are more severe even than young men

22:53.920 --> 22:56.400
because young men will often decide that they're capable,

22:56.400 --> 22:57.640
whether or not they are capable,

22:57.640 --> 23:00.320
whereas young women tend to be very acutely aware

23:00.320 --> 23:01.840
of all their imperfections.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.720
So evolutionary or cultural?

23:04.720 --> 23:06.360
I think a lot of it is evolutionary

23:06.360 --> 23:11.360
because I think women, females are purposed

23:11.680 --> 23:14.040
for child rearing in ways that males are not

23:14.040 --> 23:16.000
because maternity is certain and paternity

23:16.000 --> 23:18.440
was never certain before genetic testing.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.600
So I think that females tended to be

23:20.600 --> 23:23.720
the low variance version of a strategy

23:23.720 --> 23:26.160
where males tended to be the high variance version

23:26.160 --> 23:29.760
of that strategy because women couldn't afford to mess up.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.640
If you know about the rigors of early childhood,

23:33.640 --> 23:35.560
it's a really super demanding work.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.000
And so I think a lot of it is probably innate.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.360
And it's good that we have a high variance

23:41.360 --> 23:45.200
and a low variance version of these strategies.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.840
I think you'll find that women in general

23:46.840 --> 23:50.560
are much more reliable than most men on average.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.600
Now, with that said, I think one of the terrible things

23:54.600 --> 23:58.520
is that we don't give women permission to be imposters.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.000
So if you're hearing this podcast

24:00.000 --> 24:01.920
and if you feel like an imposter,

24:01.920 --> 24:06.200
instead of trying to fight it, just try experimenting

24:06.200 --> 24:07.720
when you're in the quiet of your own room.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.360
What if I am an imposter, then so what?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.960
Maybe the idea is that my faking it

24:13.960 --> 24:17.360
would be as good or better than somebody else's

24:17.360 --> 24:18.800
earnest attempts.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.120
I have a friend who taught herself forms of dance

24:23.120 --> 24:27.520
that she didn't have any formal training in,

24:27.520 --> 24:29.880
but it certainly looked like she knew what she was doing,

24:29.880 --> 24:31.960
but anybody who was actually trained

24:31.960 --> 24:33.240
in those forms of dance would know

24:33.240 --> 24:35.720
it was just completely made up.

24:35.720 --> 24:40.720
So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting

24:40.720 --> 24:42.280
your fear of being an imposter

24:42.280 --> 24:45.680
and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.

24:45.680 --> 24:50.680
You know, it's, you know, for any area,

24:51.520 --> 24:54.520
it seems like there's a set path,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.320
there's a set formula to become the top of that area.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.720
Do you succeed in that area?

24:58.720 --> 24:59.880
Politics was one example.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.960
You know, you supposedly needed to be in the house,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.880
in the Senate, and maybe a governor,

25:04.880 --> 25:06.400
then vice president, then a president.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.800
That was considered the typical path

25:07.800 --> 25:09.520
and with some variation,

25:09.520 --> 25:12.920
that's the path that many politicians have followed.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.280
With mathematics, you go to graduate school,

25:16.280 --> 25:18.440
you get a PhD, you become a professor,

25:18.440 --> 25:20.320
and now you're a mathematician.

25:20.320 --> 25:25.320
And I think what you say being an imposter is when,

25:26.360 --> 25:28.680
and this happens in every area,

25:28.680 --> 25:30.400
there are people who come into the area

25:30.400 --> 25:32.000
without taking that traditional path.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.560
Donald Trump, of course, became president

25:33.560 --> 25:35.320
without taking the traditional path.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.120
I'm sure there's mathematicians who have not,

25:38.120 --> 25:40.800
don't even have a PhD, but have discovered some solution

25:40.800 --> 25:42.000
to some theorem or whatever.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.920
The guy who came up with Green's Functions,

25:43.920 --> 25:46.560
which is a way of inverting a differential operator,

25:46.560 --> 25:49.960
if you will, I think was a miller in the middle of England,

25:49.960 --> 25:53.400
and he sent off a solution to Cambridge

25:53.400 --> 25:55.280
to some famous problem,

25:55.280 --> 25:57.560
and they wanted to appoint him to a professorship.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.720
And then he said, well, really, I didn't even go to college.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.600
And so they forced him to get a BA

26:01.600 --> 26:03.440
before they could make him a professor.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.400
That's fascinating.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.640
So was he just reading like math papers all his life?

26:06.680 --> 26:08.200
I think it was kind of unclear,

26:08.200 --> 26:13.200
but never discount what somebody can do completely

26:14.720 --> 26:15.560
on their own.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.600
If you think just like about Jimi Hendrix's strange

26:18.600 --> 26:21.480
stringing of his guitar from the right-handed guitar plate

26:21.480 --> 26:24.120
upside down and backwards as a left-hander,

26:24.120 --> 26:26.680
it immediately took him out of an ability

26:26.680 --> 26:29.600
to like watch what somebody else was doing

26:29.600 --> 26:32.840
and just copy it because it was so different.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.800
So in some sense, it's not that surprising

26:35.800 --> 26:37.240
that he would sound that unique

26:37.240 --> 26:39.640
because nobody else was even

26:39.640 --> 26:41.800
in his same universality class,

26:41.800 --> 26:44.280
or Stanley Jordan tunes the guitar,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.600
I think, uniformly in fourths,

26:46.600 --> 26:48.840
which is a very uncommon thing to do.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.440
And so it puts you in just a different class.

26:52.440 --> 26:56.040
And I think when you first make a decision

26:56.040 --> 27:00.520
to burn the boats, so there's no returning home, right?

27:00.520 --> 27:01.680
And like this is what the people did

27:01.680 --> 27:03.360
when they had the mutiny on the bounty

27:03.360 --> 27:06.200
when they hit Karen Island that they burned the bounty

27:06.200 --> 27:07.360
so nobody could leave.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.400
I think that that's when things get really exciting

27:12.400 --> 27:14.080
because it's sink or swim

27:14.080 --> 27:16.520
and people become incredibly inventive

27:16.520 --> 27:18.640
once they become isolated and terrified.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.560
So when do you think you've burned boats?

27:21.560 --> 27:23.600
What was your first experience with it?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.440
Oh, geez.

27:25.680 --> 27:30.680
I guess asserting that I was not good in math in high school.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.520
I'm calling bullshit on that.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.360
No.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.680
What was your SAT score on math?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.600
It's really not very impressive.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.520
I mean, I don't wanna talk about my SAT scores at age 53,

27:45.520 --> 27:46.720
James, what are we doing here?

27:46.720 --> 27:48.920
No, but you're saying that you weren't good at math?

27:48.920 --> 27:50.000
I can't believe that.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.600
It seems like you're like over math.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.240
Let's talk about learning disabilities

27:53.240 --> 27:56.680
because I'm sure that you have a decent podcast size, right?

27:56.680 --> 27:57.520
Yeah.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.160
All right, there are a lot of parents out there.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.080
Hey, I see you out there in radio land

28:02.080 --> 28:04.760
who have kids who they know are smart.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.760
They know are sharp and bright and creative and getting it.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.240
And those kids are bringing home grades

28:10.240 --> 28:12.320
that are just so depressing.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.440
And the parents are tearing their hair out

28:14.440 --> 28:16.200
because they're like, I can't get you into college.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.520
You're not doing your homework.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.480
Everything's coming back screwed up.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.320
Okay, that population is probably learning disabled

28:23.320 --> 28:25.200
in the standard parlance.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.120
But I think they're probably supposed

28:27.120 --> 28:28.760
to be our future innovators.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.360
I will make the gambit that I believe

28:30.360 --> 28:33.840
that most of the innovation or a lot of the innovation

28:33.840 --> 28:35.720
is always going to come from people

28:35.720 --> 28:39.200
who are going to be written off as learning incapable.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.400
And so be of good cheer.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.240
There's lots of ways to be smart

28:43.240 --> 28:45.080
and underperform like crazy.

28:45.080 --> 28:50.080
And I would much rather be appointed king of the losers.

28:50.200 --> 28:54.200
There's so much brain power in loser nation

28:54.200 --> 28:55.640
compared to winner nation.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.960
It's unbelievable.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.720
So you just have many more opportunities

28:59.720 --> 29:04.380
to unlock unused brilliance in the loser community

29:04.380 --> 29:05.980
or the learning disabled community

29:05.980 --> 29:08.400
or the people with low self-esteem.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.840
These are my people.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.760
And this is where I get really super excited

29:11.760 --> 29:14.480
because they're sitting on top of gold

29:14.480 --> 29:17.560
and they just can't get it together to convert.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.000
Well, so what would you say?

29:19.000 --> 29:23.800
So again, so maybe you burn bridges by going into math

29:23.800 --> 29:25.680
and saying, I'm gonna do this.

29:25.800 --> 29:26.960
I have some insights.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.800
So I committed to a program whereby I didn't think

29:29.800 --> 29:31.080
I was gonna finish college

29:31.080 --> 29:32.680
because there was a language requirement.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.960
I was doing terribly in French and I just...

29:35.960 --> 29:37.080
I had the same problem actually.

29:37.080 --> 29:37.920
Really?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.240
In French, I took five years

29:39.240 --> 29:41.280
and I got a D minus in college French

29:41.280 --> 29:43.160
after my fifth year in it.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.000
All right, so you're one of us.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.520
Look, but if you'd learned Indonesian

29:47.520 --> 29:49.520
you actually would have been in great shape.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.360
Why is that?

29:50.360 --> 29:51.840
Because the orthography is the same as ours.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.960
So they use the same Latin letters.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.120
It's not inflected for gender.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.520
It's not inflected for tense.

29:59.520 --> 30:04.520
It's not inflected for gender number K.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.200
It's just perfect.

30:07.200 --> 30:11.840
It's the most wonderful language to learn super rapidly

30:11.840 --> 30:13.760
and it's about the most beautiful place on earth.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.080
It might be the most beautiful place on earth.

30:16.080 --> 30:16.920
So it's okay.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.720
So you decide I'm gonna go into...

30:19.720 --> 30:22.280
I have these ideas about the universe and math.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.920
So I stopped taking required classes, I guess.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.840
I started taking all graduate courses.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.480
I loaded up like crazy in math

30:30.480 --> 30:33.560
and a little bit of advanced physics or something.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.840
And I didn't think I would graduate.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.760
And I just said, look, at least I wanna find out

30:38.760 --> 30:41.280
what the universe is all about while I'm here.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.880
And that turned out to pay out.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.720
So...

30:44.920 --> 30:46.360
So after you...

30:46.360 --> 30:49.120
So you got the PhD, you didn't have advisor

30:49.120 --> 30:51.360
so who kind of approved the PhD?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.520
Formerly a guy named Raul Bot

30:53.520 --> 30:54.720
who would be my, you know,

30:54.720 --> 30:56.760
he was formerly appointed as my advisor.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.840
The person who came closest to being my advisor

30:58.840 --> 31:00.760
was a guy named Dror Bar Natan

31:00.760 --> 31:04.000
who just helped me explain what I'd done

31:04.000 --> 31:05.840
to people who couldn't understand it.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.120
And, but it's, you know, it's very rare

31:09.120 --> 31:14.120
not to have an advisor in a subject like mathematics.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.160
And then, what was the first?

31:16.160 --> 31:18.080
So maybe you took some fellowships.

31:18.080 --> 31:23.080
You, but when did you start to branch out of mathematics?

31:24.240 --> 31:25.880
Well, I mean, I think I was always interested

31:25.880 --> 31:28.160
in anything that could be sort of systematized

31:28.160 --> 31:30.360
and explained that had a lot of power to it.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.320
I did some work in economics with my wife, Pia Malani.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.280
And we found a way to apply the geometry

31:38.280 --> 31:41.160
that is underlying particle theory

31:41.160 --> 31:43.520
to neoclassical economics.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.460
And we had a backwards compatible reformulation

31:47.460 --> 31:50.140
of neoclassical economics in a way that could solve

31:51.100 --> 31:53.460
something called the changing preference problem.

31:53.460 --> 31:55.060
What's the, what's the changing preference problem?

31:55.060 --> 31:57.740
Well, if you know that question

31:57.740 --> 31:59.220
that you get asked in politics,

31:59.220 --> 32:02.060
are you better off now than you were four years ago?

32:02.060 --> 32:06.460
Well, if your tastes change over that period of time,

32:06.460 --> 32:08.700
there's no way in economic theory,

32:08.700 --> 32:10.180
as it's currently practiced,

32:10.180 --> 32:14.300
to compare your welfare between two points in time

32:14.300 --> 32:15.860
where your tastes were different.

32:15.860 --> 32:18.700
It's only if your tastes stay exactly the same

32:18.700 --> 32:20.700
that you can make welfare comparisons.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.540
And since-

32:21.540 --> 32:24.680
So, like as an example, maybe four years earlier,

32:24.680 --> 32:26.860
you liked living in a house in the suburbs,

32:26.860 --> 32:29.100
but then suddenly you wanted to live in an apartment

32:29.100 --> 32:31.620
in Manhattan, it might not seem you're better off.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.460
It's hard to measure-

32:32.460 --> 32:34.860
Well, let's do kale and beef.

32:34.860 --> 32:37.500
Okay, so at some point you're thinking vegan is healthy,

32:37.500 --> 32:38.900
then you start reading a lot of stuff

32:38.900 --> 32:41.060
that maybe you think paleo is healthier.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.100
So before you put a huge premium on kale

32:43.100 --> 32:44.740
and a low premium on beef,

32:44.780 --> 32:46.380
and then five years later,

32:46.380 --> 32:50.020
you value beef more and kale less, okay?

32:50.020 --> 32:52.620
So any particular basket of goods,

32:52.620 --> 32:54.940
which has both kale and beef in it,

32:54.940 --> 32:56.580
gives you some level of happiness.

32:56.580 --> 32:58.820
But the problem that you find

32:58.820 --> 33:00.420
between periods of time where your tastes change,

33:00.420 --> 33:03.380
you don't know how to compare your two forms of happiness,

33:03.380 --> 33:04.220
because in some sense,

33:04.220 --> 33:07.260
you're too different as two different people.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.300
Right, but when someone says,

33:09.300 --> 33:11.180
are you better off than you were before,

33:11.180 --> 33:14.460
they usually mean probably income plus assets,

33:14.660 --> 33:16.300
adjusted for inflation.

33:16.300 --> 33:19.380
Well, if everything's a financial asset-

33:19.380 --> 33:20.580
Just in terms of economics, though.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.740
I understand, but if the idea is

33:22.740 --> 33:25.100
that you have cheaper airfare,

33:26.100 --> 33:27.900
but you're spending more on healthcare,

33:27.900 --> 33:31.540
and how much do I value travel versus health,

33:32.380 --> 33:34.420
it's not an easy question.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.700
So we solved the puzzle of how to do that

33:36.700 --> 33:38.180
at a theoretical level.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.900
Using the knowledge you gleaned

33:42.900 --> 33:45.340
from differential geometry or physics.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.180
Exactly, infinite dimensional gauge theory.

33:47.180 --> 33:49.900
So I love the idea of this,

33:49.900 --> 33:51.900
because I'm a big believer in,

33:53.420 --> 33:54.780
we were talking before the podcast,

33:54.780 --> 33:57.700
you had just tried doing stand-up comedy.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.500
Obviously, you had never done it before.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.140
There's a certain amount of skills involved,

34:02.140 --> 34:03.820
but you've done public speaking before.

34:03.820 --> 34:08.820
You've had a vast array of experiences and knowledge

34:09.220 --> 34:10.900
that you were able to bring onto the stage with you

34:10.900 --> 34:12.880
that maybe other comedians didn't.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.400
So in a sense, you did the same thing.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.080
You borrowed from other categories you were expert in

34:18.080 --> 34:19.880
that the audience maybe wasn't,

34:19.880 --> 34:24.720
and you were able to use that to perform like an expert

34:24.720 --> 34:25.960
on the stage that time.

34:25.960 --> 34:29.280
So in this case, you borrowed from physics and math

34:29.280 --> 34:32.440
without necessarily having an economics PhD,

34:32.440 --> 34:35.640
and were able to do something interesting.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.560
Yeah, I think nature has very few games

34:37.560 --> 34:38.880
that she knows how to play well.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.520
And so if you learn those games, you're quite correct.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.360
You can't necessarily just take them wholesale

34:44.360 --> 34:46.920
from one field to another, but you can port them

34:46.920 --> 34:48.800
in that you have to make certain adaptations

34:48.800 --> 34:50.440
to use them in a new place.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.760
So for example, jokes, pattern recognition.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.280
How many jokes, you have an incident that happens,

34:58.280 --> 35:00.360
you have a tiny variation on the first incident.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.800
So two incidents sets up an expectation.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.400
The third one treats the first two formally,

35:05.400 --> 35:07.720
and then does something completely absurd,

35:07.720 --> 35:10.640
which you didn't realize also fits the pattern.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.680
That doesn't sound like a joke,

35:12.680 --> 35:14.520
but the number of Jewish jokes

35:14.520 --> 35:16.360
that that unpacks to is enormous.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.560
These days, we're all investors,

35:30.560 --> 35:32.240
trying to be smart with our money

35:32.240 --> 35:34.120
despite our worst impulses.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.320
But at iShares, we believe that deep down inside

35:37.320 --> 35:40.000
of every investor is a better investor.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.920
One that's just waiting to be let out.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.200
Explore iShares ETFs and insights,

35:49.200 --> 35:51.320
and let your best investor out.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.200
Visit iShares.com for more information.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.640
You know what I love about fantasy sports?

36:00.640 --> 36:03.040
Is that even though I'm not gonna be a great basketball player

36:03.040 --> 36:05.720
or a baseball player or a football player or whatever,

36:05.720 --> 36:09.880
I feel like I get to participate and make decisions

36:09.880 --> 36:13.240
and use my knowledge of these different leagues too,

36:13.240 --> 36:17.040
or these different sports to compete.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.960
So it's like I can pick my team

36:18.960 --> 36:20.920
or I can pick my favorite players,

36:20.920 --> 36:24.080
and I could use my knowledge to make predictions

36:24.080 --> 36:26.400
and maybe even make money.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.600
So with the basketball season here,

36:28.600 --> 36:30.560
you can now pick combo projections

36:30.560 --> 36:32.920
across football and basketball

36:32.920 --> 36:36.560
from the Specials League on prize picks.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.240
This is a league created specifically

36:38.240 --> 36:40.880
for combo projections that include two or more players

36:40.880 --> 36:42.560
from different sports or leagues.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.120
Want to play alongside some of prize picks' favorite players

36:45.120 --> 36:48.000
like rapper Meek Mill and comedian Andrew Schultz,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.640
who's also been a guest on this podcast,

36:49.640 --> 36:50.880
and I've been a guest on his.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.960
You can now find community plays

36:52.960 --> 36:55.320
under the promos tab of the app to view entries

36:55.320 --> 36:56.480
for some of the biggest names

36:56.480 --> 36:58.680
in the prize picks community each week.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.560
Look, prize picks even offers a reboot policy

37:01.560 --> 37:03.080
so that your entries stay in play,

37:03.080 --> 37:05.840
even if one of your players gets injured.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.160
For football and basketball games,

37:07.200 --> 37:08.680
if you have a player who exits the game

37:08.680 --> 37:11.280
in the first half and does not return in the second,

37:11.280 --> 37:13.000
that player is rebooted.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.680
Prize picks is the only daily fantasy sports platform

37:16.680 --> 37:18.920
with an injury insurance policy.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.200
What?

37:20.200 --> 37:22.040
So I love playing it.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.720
I love anywhere where I can use analytical ability

37:25.720 --> 37:29.640
with my interests to demonstrate some skill

37:29.640 --> 37:31.080
and maybe make some money.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.880
And I like the game-like aspect.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.680
I do wish they had chess as a category on prizepicks.com,

37:35.720 --> 37:37.840
but I'll set up for what they've got.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.920
Maybe I should make my own fantasy chess league.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.840
But in any case, I love prizepicks.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.080
Go to prizepicks.com slash James,

37:46.080 --> 37:51.080
use code James for a first deposit match up to $100.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.240
That's the easiest hundred dollars you're ever gonna make.

37:53.240 --> 37:57.760
So that's prizepicks.com slash James and use code James.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.040
Daily fantasy sports made easy.

38:01.040 --> 38:11.960
The future of learning is definitely online.

38:11.960 --> 38:16.120
Like it's such BS that you have to spend $200,000

38:16.120 --> 38:20.080
or take $200,000 in loans and go to some fancy school

38:20.080 --> 38:21.680
when it's useless.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.400
It doesn't guarantee you a job.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.320
Most employers, including me,

38:25.320 --> 38:28.240
do not care about degrees or grades or anything like that.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.640
We wanna care that you love what you're doing,

38:30.640 --> 38:32.160
that you know what you're doing,

38:32.160 --> 38:33.880
in some cases that you have experience

38:33.880 --> 38:35.200
or that you're rolling to learn.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.920
But people in general love learning and are curious.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.200
Like the key to success is curiosity.

38:41.200 --> 38:45.440
And I think masterclass.com is the perfect model

38:45.440 --> 38:46.520
for online learning.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.280
I'm really happy they're sponsoring this episode.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.640
If you're gonna give a gift, give the gift of learning.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.400
Masterclass makes a meaningful gift this season

38:55.400 --> 38:57.320
for you and anyone on your list

38:57.360 --> 39:00.040
because both of you can learn from the best

39:00.040 --> 39:02.560
to become your best from leadership

39:02.560 --> 39:05.200
to effective communication to cooking.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.960
Let me tell you some of the classes I've taken.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.240
I've taken comedy from Steve Martin.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.760
I mean, can you believe I can take a class

39:11.760 --> 39:14.240
from Steve Martin on comedy or Judd Apatow,

39:14.240 --> 39:15.480
my favorite comedy director.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.080
I could take an actual class from him on writing.

39:19.080 --> 39:23.440
Wolfgang Puck on cooking, Dan Brown on writing

39:23.440 --> 39:26.280
or Judy Bloom who's been on this podcast on writing.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.000
By the way, Wolfgang Puck also has been on this podcast.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.960
It's such a pleasure.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.480
I try to take classes all the time from masterclass.com.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.240
And whether you're watching masterclass on TV

39:36.240 --> 39:39.240
or listening in audio mode in the app or on their site,

39:39.240 --> 39:41.440
the quality speaks for itself.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.600
It's like these masterclass instructors

39:43.600 --> 39:45.920
are your own personal mentors that are going to help you

39:45.920 --> 39:47.480
reach the next level.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.480
How much would it cost to take one-on-one classes

39:50.480 --> 39:52.200
on comedy from Steve Martin

39:52.200 --> 39:53.880
or on chess from Gary Kasparov?

39:53.880 --> 39:55.440
You just wouldn't be able to do it.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.360
But I mean, it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.480
With a masterclass annual membership,

40:00.480 --> 40:02.600
it's $10 a month.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.040
Membership started $120 a year for unlimited access

40:06.040 --> 40:08.960
to one-on-one classes with all 180-plus

40:08.960 --> 40:10.560
masterclass instructors.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.280
So it's not just $120 for one instructor.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.560
You get all 180-plus masterclass instructors.

40:16.560 --> 40:19.160
Boost your confidence and find practical takeaways

40:19.160 --> 40:21.320
you can apply to your life and at work.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.240
And if you own a business or a team leader,

40:23.240 --> 40:26.160
use masterclass to empower and create future-ready

40:26.160 --> 40:27.680
employees and leaders,

40:27.680 --> 40:30.560
that's the real education in today's world.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.720
So this holiday season,

40:32.720 --> 40:34.840
you can give one annual membership

40:34.840 --> 40:39.680
and get one free at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.360
J-A-S, of course, stands for the James Altucher Show.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.920
So right now you can get two memberships

40:43.920 --> 40:48.600
for the price of one at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.760
Masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.000
Offer terms apply.

41:01.680 --> 41:06.320
So on the one hand, you could be a classic stand-up 20 years

41:06.320 --> 41:08.520
writing down jokes and getting that formula,

41:08.520 --> 41:10.760
or you could have lots of experiences in life

41:10.760 --> 41:14.200
where this actually happens and you just say what happened

41:14.200 --> 41:16.080
and that also works.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.520
Right, or like particular words or sounds

41:18.520 --> 41:20.040
have more humor value.

41:20.040 --> 41:23.360
So people have commented numerous times

41:23.360 --> 41:25.960
that the word pants or pickle or igloo,

41:25.960 --> 41:28.840
these things are funny, they shouldn't be.

41:28.840 --> 41:32.360
But if you have a choice of which word to use

41:32.360 --> 41:36.720
and what cadence and there are all sorts of techniques

41:36.720 --> 41:41.480
that I guess if you can talk to somebody

41:41.480 --> 41:43.280
who really appreciates craft,

41:43.280 --> 41:46.600
they can give you a huge leg up where a joke

41:46.600 --> 41:48.960
that's sort of an okay joke that you might tell at a party

41:49.000 --> 41:52.360
can be really souped up by somebody who's fantastic.

41:52.360 --> 41:56.120
I just saw Joe Rogan rework the same joke

41:56.120 --> 42:00.360
about wrestling four times, it's the same joke,

42:00.360 --> 42:02.400
but you'd never recognize the thing,

42:02.400 --> 42:04.440
he just mutates it until he gets it right.

42:04.440 --> 42:08.800
There's a great example of Jim Gaffigan

42:08.800 --> 42:12.000
telling on stage the very first joke ever,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.360
there's some joke in hieroglyphics

42:13.360 --> 42:16.760
from thousands of years ago and it's a fart joke.

42:16.840 --> 42:21.320
And Jim Gaffigan retells the joke in his style

42:21.320 --> 42:23.120
and of course it's very funny,

42:23.120 --> 42:25.680
but it has the same kind of structure.

42:25.680 --> 42:30.040
But so it's interesting, so what are,

42:30.040 --> 42:31.360
in terms of this meta learning,

42:31.360 --> 42:35.000
like how do you take one area of life into another?

42:35.000 --> 42:38.520
Do you think there are kind of core principles

42:38.520 --> 42:40.520
to understand when you're,

42:40.520 --> 42:42.320
because there's a lot of people also take physics

42:42.320 --> 42:43.960
and turned into garbage when they bring it

42:43.960 --> 42:46.080
into self-help or whatever.

42:46.080 --> 42:51.080
So what's maybe some core ways someone can look at being,

42:51.520 --> 42:54.280
taking something that they're expert in or interested in,

42:54.280 --> 42:56.480
bringing it into some other area

42:56.480 --> 42:59.200
where they're in the beginning an imposter,

42:59.200 --> 43:00.320
but they make the jump.

43:01.280 --> 43:04.200
So I'll give you a weird example.

43:04.200 --> 43:08.400
The neutrino was discovered by noticing

43:08.400 --> 43:12.120
that when a neutron is left alone,

43:12.120 --> 43:15.600
it sort of morphs into a proton

43:15.600 --> 43:18.240
after I don't know, half-life of about 12 minutes

43:18.240 --> 43:19.680
or 18 minutes, can't remember.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.960
When you look at the electron that gets shot out

43:23.960 --> 43:27.520
of this neutrino, if you add up the energy

43:27.520 --> 43:29.800
of the proton and the electron,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.720
it doesn't have as much energy

43:31.720 --> 43:33.640
as the neutron did to begin with.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.520
So it would seem to violate conservation of energy.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.440
Wolfgang Pauli had this crazy idea.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.160
He said, I bet there's a secret particle that we can't see

43:41.200 --> 43:42.560
because it's electrically neutral

43:42.560 --> 43:44.840
that's carrying away the missing energy

43:44.840 --> 43:47.240
and we just don't have any ability to trap it.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.040
That was a crazy audacious statement,

43:49.040 --> 43:52.960
but it was necessary to save the principle

43:52.960 --> 43:55.200
of conservation of energy and momentum.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.200
Okay, let me give you a different puzzle.

43:58.480 --> 44:02.240
Tower Records on Sunset, where I grew up in LA

44:02.240 --> 44:05.440
and it was the record store that I used to learn.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
It was a music education for me.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.440
So it closed at some point.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.960
Now, my claim is very often that the invisible world

44:13.960 --> 44:18.280
is discovered by the visible world's failure to close.

44:18.280 --> 44:21.120
That is, in the neutrino case,

44:21.120 --> 44:26.120
there wasn't enough energy in the proton and the electron

44:26.120 --> 44:27.560
which are the decay particles

44:27.560 --> 44:29.520
that you can see from the neutrino.

44:29.520 --> 44:33.160
So something invisible was happening to carry it on.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.760
Somebody failed to follow the law.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.080
There's some missing force, right?

44:39.080 --> 44:44.080
So in the case of Tower Records, what killed Tower Records?

44:45.040 --> 44:47.160
I don't know, maybe it was a file sharing network.

44:47.160 --> 44:50.040
You couldn't see it, but that file sharing network

44:50.040 --> 44:52.640
might have been what took Tower Records down

44:52.640 --> 44:55.840
because otherwise it should have been a thriving music store,

44:55.840 --> 45:00.600
right, or a bird slamming into a glass pane repeatedly.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.160
It knows that if that was just air,

45:02.160 --> 45:03.360
it should be able to proceed,

45:03.360 --> 45:05.200
but something is causing,

45:05.200 --> 45:08.680
like that window is part of the invisible world

45:09.160 --> 45:10.480
to the bird.

45:10.480 --> 45:12.720
So the fact that I'm trying as a bird

45:12.720 --> 45:15.160
to fly in a straight line and not progressing

45:15.160 --> 45:17.360
is the visible world's failure to close.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.760
So Tower Records, though,

45:19.760 --> 45:22.440
could be argued, the internet brought Tower Records.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.880
So that would be, the internet would be,

45:23.880 --> 45:25.200
if you couldn't see it otherwise,

45:25.200 --> 45:27.800
it would be an invisible force

45:27.800 --> 45:31.080
which caused Tower Records to go the way of the dot over.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.360
So when innovation comes,

45:32.360 --> 45:36.240
when you start to see Tower Records sales going down

45:36.240 --> 45:38.160
and there's no, and Tower Records has run,

45:38.160 --> 45:42.400
let's say, magnificently, there's some missing force,

45:42.400 --> 45:44.480
and then you could say, oh, the missing force,

45:44.480 --> 45:46.160
if you could figure out the missing force.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.320
Where's the neutrino?

45:47.320 --> 45:50.520
Yeah, you could start an online business selling CDs,

45:50.520 --> 45:51.840
then that's how you could take advantage.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.840
So that would be a trick that I would learn from physics

45:54.840 --> 45:56.640
that I would try to apply to commerce,

45:56.640 --> 46:00.440
which is look for some visible system

46:00.440 --> 46:04.160
that is failing to behave normally.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.960
Assume that if it isn't behaving normally,

46:05.960 --> 46:08.000
there must be some unseen thing

46:08.000 --> 46:10.240
to go look in the invisible world

46:10.240 --> 46:12.080
for what is causing the visible world

46:12.080 --> 46:13.560
to no longer make any sense.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.680
So for example, another case of this,

46:17.080 --> 46:18.280
might have been on Twitter,

46:18.280 --> 46:20.800
where originally all of these people

46:20.800 --> 46:22.920
who were very influential were finding each other

46:22.920 --> 46:25.280
and amplifying each other's voices

46:25.280 --> 46:28.080
as a real challenge to the mainstream media.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.520
And at some point, we noticed

46:29.520 --> 46:32.080
that we stopped seeing each other's tweets.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.720
Like we just didn't see them.

46:33.720 --> 46:38.720
And sometime later, this guy, James O'Keefe,

46:39.400 --> 46:41.520
who does this undercover stuff,

46:41.520 --> 46:43.520
you don't have to love him, you can hate him.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.640
But one of the things he recorded was people saying,

46:47.640 --> 46:51.680
oh yes, we downrank the bad people on Twitter.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.080
Like downranking?

46:53.080 --> 46:54.520
What's that?

46:54.520 --> 46:58.080
Oh, well, we use the algorithms to sort of suppress,

46:58.080 --> 46:59.840
to downregulate their tweets

46:59.840 --> 47:02.040
in favor of other people's tweets.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.080
And so maybe you discover

47:04.080 --> 47:06.160
that somebody's got their finger on the scales

47:06.160 --> 47:08.600
because you know what the visible world should do

47:08.600 --> 47:10.880
in the absence of somebody tampering

47:10.880 --> 47:12.160
with the measurement equipment.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.360
So I love this idea of looking for the missing force

47:15.360 --> 47:17.080
or using this metaphor.

47:18.280 --> 47:19.200
Where's the neutrino?

47:19.200 --> 47:20.800
Yeah, where is the neutrino?

47:20.800 --> 47:21.640
I love that.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.160
So what's something?

47:24.160 --> 47:25.000
Do you want another one?

47:25.000 --> 47:27.080
Yeah, yeah, I want 10 more.

47:27.080 --> 47:29.640
All right, so here's another one.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.480
Whenever you have something that you think

47:31.480 --> 47:33.640
is just going to be beautiful,

47:33.640 --> 47:35.040
and it's a very naive hope,

47:36.080 --> 47:38.680
almost always your hope will be dashed

47:38.680 --> 47:39.720
because it's too naive.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.200
So instead of just getting upset about it,

47:43.200 --> 47:48.200
the next thing to do is to measure the failure

47:49.400 --> 47:52.640
of your original hope to obtain in the world.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.360
Like how badly did it go wrong?

47:54.360 --> 47:56.920
How do I measure how badly it's off?

47:56.920 --> 47:58.920
And then once you have that,

47:58.920 --> 48:02.440
make that new object the centerpiece of a new theory

48:02.440 --> 48:05.240
and you'll actually build something much more beautiful

48:05.240 --> 48:06.800
than the original theory ever was.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.200
So here's a simple example.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.600
You're at the equator and you want to go north

48:11.600 --> 48:12.920
and you notice that you have a compass

48:12.920 --> 48:15.120
and the compass points north.

48:15.120 --> 48:19.360
Well, magnetic north is an excellent proxy for true north

48:19.360 --> 48:21.400
right up until you get to Canada

48:21.400 --> 48:22.880
and then it starts to get lousy.

48:22.880 --> 48:24.680
And you know, if you're up on Ellesmere's Island

48:24.680 --> 48:26.720
or something way up in the north,

48:26.720 --> 48:29.880
you can actually have magnetic north 180 degrees

48:29.880 --> 48:32.440
off of true north, yeah?

48:32.440 --> 48:34.360
So what is that object?

48:34.360 --> 48:35.960
The object that measures that failure

48:35.960 --> 48:38.320
is called the angle of declination.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.280
So making the angle of declination,

48:40.280 --> 48:44.400
the centerpiece of a magnetic navigation

48:44.400 --> 48:45.640
is the right thing to do.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.320
Or a different one would be,

48:49.920 --> 48:53.520
you know, we were just talking about this on Joe Rogan.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.480
If you have a normal staircase

48:55.480 --> 48:57.160
and you go up one set of stairs

48:58.480 --> 49:00.320
and you come down another set of stairs

49:00.320 --> 49:03.360
let's say made by the same people at the same heights,

49:03.360 --> 49:05.280
you might expect that it's the same number of stairs

49:05.280 --> 49:06.400
going up as going down.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.880
But in the Escher staircase,

49:08.880 --> 49:10.960
if you have that in your mind or the Penrose stairs,

49:10.960 --> 49:13.280
you can sort of see that you can keep going up

49:13.280 --> 49:15.880
and then you get back to where you started.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.080
Well, something is clearly wrong about that.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.440
The idea that the number of steps up

49:19.440 --> 49:21.760
is the number of steps down fails to be true

49:21.760 --> 49:23.160
in that picture.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.920
And the thing that measures that failure,

49:24.920 --> 49:27.680
like how badly did my naive hope fail

49:27.680 --> 49:29.800
might be called the holonomia or the curvature

49:29.800 --> 49:31.040
in mathematics.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.640
So you make the holonomia or the curvature

49:32.640 --> 49:33.960
the centerpiece of your theory.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.680
And in fact, in physics,

49:35.680 --> 49:38.320
two of our three most important equations,

49:38.320 --> 49:41.960
Einstein's equation and the modern version

49:41.960 --> 49:45.840
of Maxwell's equations are based on a curvature object,

49:45.840 --> 49:50.520
which is measuring this failure of steps to behave

49:50.520 --> 49:52.200
in a regular fashion.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.760
And the more they go towards the Escher staircase,

49:54.760 --> 49:56.480
the more the curvature is intense

49:56.480 --> 49:58.920
and that would be perceived by us in some system

49:58.920 --> 50:01.600
as greater electromagnetic field strength.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.080
So let me try to understand the Escher example

50:04.080 --> 50:05.800
because what resulted, of course,

50:06.680 --> 50:09.960
in one way of looking at it was Escher's works of art

50:09.960 --> 50:12.880
is all based on this idea that you could look at something

50:12.880 --> 50:16.160
that looks like it's following the laws of physics,

50:16.160 --> 50:18.960
but it's not and that's what creates the beauty of it.

50:18.960 --> 50:22.640
So do you think that was part of his creative process?

50:22.640 --> 50:26.840
Is like, how can I break this law of nature

50:26.840 --> 50:29.920
and create something beautiful as a result?

50:29.920 --> 50:32.400
Well, he was playing at many different levels.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.040
So for example, the stairs that he creates,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.480
are they possible or are they impossible?

50:39.480 --> 50:42.520
Well, you can actually create a model

50:42.520 --> 50:43.920
and take a photograph of it

50:43.920 --> 50:46.600
and it will look exactly like the Escher stairs.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.040
So you can actually see the effect with real objects

50:50.040 --> 50:51.960
provided the camera is positioned in the right way.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.600
Now, does it have the effect that the system

50:53.600 --> 50:55.880
is actually closed and it goes around and around?

50:55.880 --> 50:59.080
No, but in a system where you actually have curvature,

50:59.080 --> 51:02.040
like on a sphere, like normally you think

51:02.040 --> 51:05.000
if I turn 90 degrees, walk a distance,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.480
turn 90 degrees, walk a distance, same distance,

51:07.480 --> 51:08.960
turn 90 degrees, walk the same distance,

51:08.960 --> 51:10.080
I'd have to turn 90 degrees

51:10.080 --> 51:12.200
and walk the same distance yet again.

51:12.200 --> 51:14.880
But if I did it from the north pole to the equator,

51:15.960 --> 51:19.200
then I turned 90 degrees and I walked along the equator

51:19.200 --> 51:21.200
for about a quarter of its circumference

51:21.320 --> 51:25.000
and I turned 90 degrees again and walked the same distance,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.560
I'd be back at the north pole

51:26.560 --> 51:28.000
and instead of having done a square,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.840
I would have done a triangle, right?

51:30.840 --> 51:33.000
So because of the curvature of the earth,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.840
that naive rule about needing to turn four separate times

51:36.840 --> 51:39.040
to get back to where you started is not true.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.880
You only have to turn three separate times.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.760
Now, in part what Escher was really doing

51:44.760 --> 51:48.520
was playing with the curvature of a curve system,

51:48.520 --> 51:52.480
the optical illusion in a flat system.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.320
There was a lot going on in that example.

51:55.320 --> 52:00.320
And so it's both an illustration of a real phenomena

52:00.800 --> 52:02.760
that we see in electromagnetism.

52:02.760 --> 52:06.920
It's an optical illusion, it's an invitation to curvature,

52:06.920 --> 52:08.880
it's presenting curvature in a flat world.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.680
There's so much happening there

52:10.680 --> 52:12.360
that it's not easy to pull apart

52:12.360 --> 52:14.400
and that's why it was fascinating as a subject.

52:14.400 --> 52:18.320
And I think Escher was very knowledgeable about mathematics

52:18.320 --> 52:22.160
and what he did was he used it as a source,

52:22.160 --> 52:25.600
but he combined enough of our world and our imagination

52:25.600 --> 52:27.880
that he really excited the human spirit.

52:27.880 --> 52:29.560
He took something that was very austere

52:29.560 --> 52:34.560
and perhaps forbidding and he made it warm and inviting.

52:34.880 --> 52:39.720
So let's say I'm trying to figure out different ways

52:39.720 --> 52:42.640
to make this functional.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.360
Let's say, you mentioned earlier,

52:45.360 --> 52:46.520
a lot of people create something

52:46.520 --> 52:47.640
that they think is beautiful

52:47.640 --> 52:48.760
and they're usually wrong.

52:48.760 --> 52:52.760
So for instance, anybody who begins the process of writing

52:52.760 --> 52:54.640
and they've never written before,

52:54.640 --> 52:57.320
there's a certain arrogance that they think,

52:57.320 --> 52:59.440
but they have to have this arrogance to write the book,

52:59.440 --> 53:00.680
their very first book.

53:00.680 --> 53:02.280
There's certain arrogance to think,

53:02.280 --> 53:04.440
oh, I'm gonna write a book and it's gonna be great.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.560
Because it's the first time they're writing it

53:05.560 --> 53:08.120
and other people have written for far longer

53:08.120 --> 53:10.800
and learned different skills and so on.

53:10.800 --> 53:15.800
But how could someone beginning any skill acquisition

53:16.040 --> 53:17.480
and let's just pick out writing,

53:17.480 --> 53:22.480
use this idea of this neutrino metaphor

53:22.720 --> 53:25.560
to kind of push the envelope a little bit

53:25.560 --> 53:26.400
to measure where the value is.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.800
Well, I don't know, it's a great improv challenge,

53:28.800 --> 53:30.120
but let me try to accept it.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.440
Let's take J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.280
Okay.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.360
She wrote a book for the very first time

53:34.360 --> 53:36.080
and it was the biggest hit ever.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.360
Right.

53:37.360 --> 53:41.220
So what was the missing neutrino that she sort of found?

53:42.400 --> 53:43.560
Well, I don't think that that,

53:43.560 --> 53:46.880
where was the naive hope that was dashed?

53:46.880 --> 53:49.560
Well, she did write a book that her,

53:49.560 --> 53:52.320
the first 20 or so publishers rejected.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.280
So nobody thought it was good and...

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
Well, that's a different thing.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.120
Yeah.

53:57.120 --> 53:59.960
That has to do with anything truly new

53:59.960 --> 54:01.520
will be compared to the old.

54:01.520 --> 54:02.560
And if it's new enough,

54:02.560 --> 54:05.520
it will always be found wanting by the standards of the old.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.680
So this is the same problem with Bohemian Rhapsody.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.000
It's like what we're gonna do

54:11.000 --> 54:13.480
with like a seven minute fake opera song

54:13.480 --> 54:15.840
to be played on rock radio stations.

54:15.840 --> 54:19.040
Obviously it's either the dumbest idea of all time

54:19.040 --> 54:22.000
or it's the greatest idea in rock and roll, right?

54:22.000 --> 54:25.520
And so something new being rejected,

54:25.520 --> 54:26.600
I don't think fits this,

54:26.600 --> 54:29.740
but let me accept your gambit of the writer.

54:29.740 --> 54:30.580
Okay.

54:30.580 --> 54:32.240
So imagine that you say,

54:32.240 --> 54:34.360
oh, I'm a genius writer.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.680
I'm just gonna sit down

54:35.680 --> 54:37.680
and the brilliance is gonna come

54:37.680 --> 54:41.000
and first draft is always amazing.

54:41.000 --> 54:41.920
Okay.

54:41.920 --> 54:45.820
So you write your short story to a two pager, right?

54:45.820 --> 54:48.860
And then you show it to your friend as a professional.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.700
And your friend takes one look at it and says,

54:50.700 --> 54:52.660
look, you're bloated over here.

54:52.660 --> 54:53.780
You're anemic over here.

54:53.780 --> 54:55.260
Let me do some stuff.

54:55.260 --> 54:57.900
And she fixes it before she sends you back

54:57.900 --> 54:59.420
and you do 18 revisions.

55:00.660 --> 55:03.700
Now, the object that would be the thing

55:03.700 --> 55:06.980
that measures the difference between your naive hope

55:06.980 --> 55:09.580
and the reality that seems to be true

55:09.580 --> 55:12.220
would be the diff file.

55:12.260 --> 55:16.660
How much did the file change between the first offer

55:16.660 --> 55:19.380
and the final product that everybody agrees to be good?

55:19.380 --> 55:22.620
Well, you might notice that if you define the diff file

55:22.620 --> 55:24.340
for each project,

55:24.340 --> 55:26.980
that you always start off using the same crappy,

55:26.980 --> 55:30.500
flabby words or lots of wiggle words

55:30.500 --> 55:33.620
or way too poetic or way too anemic.

55:33.620 --> 55:34.780
Who knows?

55:34.780 --> 55:36.820
Once you start noticing what it is

55:36.820 --> 55:39.180
that you always do at first,

55:39.180 --> 55:40.140
you can then say,

55:40.420 --> 55:42.980
I'm gonna try to write around my diff file,

55:42.980 --> 55:46.500
which is I always use the word thoroughly too much

55:46.500 --> 55:47.740
or basically,

55:47.740 --> 55:49.700
that you notice how often people use the word

55:49.700 --> 55:51.500
basically in their speech.

55:51.500 --> 55:55.980
So, a public speaker might look at all of their ticks

55:55.980 --> 55:57.980
and then say, I'm gonna create a file,

55:57.980 --> 56:02.020
an audio file that just looks at all of my verbal ticks.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.460
Once you start focusing just on your ticks,

56:05.460 --> 56:06.780
you have something to minimize.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.580
You could put it into an objective function.

56:09.580 --> 56:10.740
Okay, and so...

56:10.740 --> 56:12.620
So, that would be an example of,

56:12.620 --> 56:16.340
I naively think I'm a genius at everything that I say

56:16.340 --> 56:18.740
or write is instantly brilliant.

56:18.740 --> 56:19.980
You notice that that's not true.

56:19.980 --> 56:24.100
Then you figure out how things revise over time

56:24.100 --> 56:25.420
as you go through that cycle.

56:25.420 --> 56:26.740
Then you start studying the object

56:26.740 --> 56:28.100
that measures the revisions.

56:28.100 --> 56:29.900
And then you try to minimize that object

56:29.900 --> 56:31.540
so you become a better writer from the get go.

56:31.540 --> 56:34.180
And so, in your case with the writer,

56:35.540 --> 56:37.020
and you've addressed this before,

56:37.020 --> 56:41.180
the idea of somebody who is self-taught

56:41.180 --> 56:45.140
than having something to be able to teach.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.220
But in your example of the writer,

56:47.220 --> 56:48.780
he still had to go to it,

56:48.780 --> 56:50.500
or she had to go to an expert

56:50.500 --> 56:54.580
who helped create that diff file for the first time.

56:54.580 --> 56:56.980
Do you think that's necessary to find,

56:56.980 --> 56:57.940
so this is deliberate practice?

56:57.940 --> 56:59.180
You need feedback loops.

56:59.180 --> 57:01.220
Sometimes you could manage your own.

57:01.220 --> 57:05.900
And sometimes you need somebody to be on you

57:05.900 --> 57:09.540
and to point out that you're actually avoiding

57:09.540 --> 57:12.620
the negative in the feedback that you're getting

57:12.620 --> 57:15.340
or that you're misinterpreting the positive.

57:15.340 --> 57:17.500
And so, the other question is,

57:17.500 --> 57:20.540
is that then is that person who's getting the feedback

57:20.540 --> 57:23.260
just forcing you into conformity?

57:23.260 --> 57:24.420
And so, okay, you know, this person's saying,

57:24.420 --> 57:26.620
you know, you use basically too much.

57:26.620 --> 57:27.900
Real writers don't do that.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.460
And now you're moving back into conformity.

57:29.460 --> 57:31.860
Well, hopefully the person is pushing you back

57:31.860 --> 57:34.300
into conformity where you need conformity

57:34.380 --> 57:37.660
and pushing you into brilliance where your edge is.

57:37.660 --> 57:41.060
But the idea that you should either be brilliant

57:41.060 --> 57:44.580
and different in everything that you do or not

57:44.580 --> 57:45.580
is preposterous.

57:45.580 --> 57:47.780
So, you know, I often give people the advice

57:47.780 --> 57:50.020
that if their ideas are truly radical,

57:50.020 --> 57:52.300
they should dress very conservatively.

57:52.300 --> 57:53.140
Why?

57:53.140 --> 57:55.820
Because, you know, you can't afford to turn everything

57:55.820 --> 57:58.260
up to 11 without distracting the hell out

57:58.260 --> 58:00.180
of whoever you're trying to reach.

58:00.660 --> 58:02.420
That reminds me of,

58:02.420 --> 58:04.540
did you ever see the Eric Andre show?

58:04.540 --> 58:05.380
No.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.940
Okay, so it's basically,

58:06.940 --> 58:09.660
the premise is it's a late night talk show

58:09.660 --> 58:11.940
in a bodega, in the back of a bodega.

58:11.940 --> 58:16.060
And, but it's a spoof, but nobody knows it's a spoof.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.420
So, celebrities have gone on this show

58:17.420 --> 58:19.580
not knowing that Eric Andre is just gonna do

58:19.580 --> 58:22.500
something completely insane that's gonna freak them out.

58:22.500 --> 58:25.220
And what's fascinating is every component

58:25.220 --> 58:27.460
of a late night show is in the format.

58:27.460 --> 58:30.020
So, he's got a band, he's got a sidekick,

58:30.020 --> 58:32.180
he's got a desk, he's got notes,

58:32.180 --> 58:34.060
he's reading off the notes like David Letterman.

58:34.060 --> 58:36.220
It looks exactly like the format of the David Letterman

58:36.220 --> 58:38.740
or Johnny Carson show, but he changes this one thing

58:38.740 --> 58:42.940
in that he's gonna make fun of the guest in some way.

58:42.940 --> 58:46.900
And so, to what you were saying,

58:46.900 --> 58:49.460
keep the format, change one thing,

58:49.460 --> 58:51.340
and now you could have brilliance.

58:51.340 --> 58:53.580
Sometimes it's one thing, sometimes it's several things.

58:53.580 --> 58:54.980
If it's several things though,

58:54.980 --> 58:57.220
it might be so far from the original.

58:57.220 --> 58:59.100
Like, let's take the matrix.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.540
So, the matrix when it first came out was very fresh.

59:02.540 --> 59:03.700
What did it do?

59:03.700 --> 59:06.380
Well, first of all, it used CGI at some level

59:06.380 --> 59:08.020
that we hadn't seen before.

59:08.020 --> 59:10.900
So, it was computer generated in the extreme for its time.

59:10.900 --> 59:15.220
It used Hong Kong wire work on non-Chinese,

59:15.220 --> 59:17.340
non-Asian actors.

59:17.340 --> 59:19.980
It used the bullet time system of using a bunch

59:19.980 --> 59:24.980
of still cameras arrayed in like a semi-circle

59:25.740 --> 59:29.860
to give a movie sense of like a flip book

59:29.860 --> 59:31.780
as you were going around the subject

59:31.780 --> 59:33.140
of somebody who's in mid-air.

59:33.140 --> 59:35.260
So, just take like those three things.

59:35.260 --> 59:39.120
Those things were all so different from each other

59:39.120 --> 59:42.580
that you could never tell what was happening exactly.

59:42.580 --> 59:45.240
Was it some new photographic innovation?

59:45.240 --> 59:47.780
Was it an acrobatic innovation?

59:47.780 --> 59:50.100
Was it a computer innovation?

59:50.100 --> 59:54.780
Other than that, the storyline was very much

59:54.780 --> 59:57.780
in a kind of a revealed narrative arc heroes journey story.

59:57.780 --> 59:58.620
Right.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:02.500
So, I would say that was the exact heroes journey

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.660
and they changed one thing,

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.860
which is technically how we make the movie.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.020
But what I'm trying to say is that one thing

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.180
had multiple components.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.020
So, then I just gave you three.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.660
In other words, it's not the case

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.380
that you can only choose one thing,

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.340
but you have to have it be balanced

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.260
between that which people expect

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.420
and that which confounds.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.940
And I think I remember reading Leonard Feather,

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.940
the jazz writer, talking about studies that were done

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.660
that said that in improvisation,

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.740
the audience is always making a guess

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.820
as to what's about to happen next.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.420
His claim was that if the audience guesses right

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.620
about half the time, they find it fascinating.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.900
If they guess right all the time, they find it boring.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.900
And if they guess right none of the time,

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.340
they think it's modern jazz and they couldn't care less.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.300
Right, so you have to keep some of the structure.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.220
So, Tower Records had to keep some of their structure.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.660
They had to say, okay, we still sell music,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.860
but now we're gonna do it online.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.700
That was the missing-

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.180
Well, IBM would be a good example of something

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.940
that morphed over time to continue

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.260
to be a major player in tech,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.580
whereas lots of other tech firms couldn't figure out

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.260
how to morph and change.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.580
You know, what is the abstraction

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.940
of your former business in today's terms?

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.140
So, this idea of a missing force,

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.900
and of course you can't, on the surface,

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.460
the whole concept of this is missing,

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.460
you can't see it's a missing force.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.860
Where else do you see this in entrepreneurship?

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.740
Where have you seen it successfully played out?

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.660
Well, very often, if you can notice

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:39.260
that there is a missing need

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.260
that people hadn't really.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.540
And that's like an insight.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.660
So, like Steve Jobs saying,

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.980
every home is gonna have a micro-computer.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.060
You know, the missing force and computing for him

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.420
was why can't I have it all the time?

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.260
Or maybe the idea is that,

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.620
hey, I've also noticed that not only do I know

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.340
that there's going to be a computer everywhere,

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.140
but that it's going to be so integrated into your life

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.300
that the design feature of this,

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.300
that tech people never get right,

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.100
is my chance to add value.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.540
And I'm gonna bring elegance

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.860
and canonical aspects of design

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.380
to something that has to be integrated

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.500
into the very fabric of your being.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.780
So we welcomed Apple in in part

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.140
because it flattered our sense of ourselves

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.940
that we are elegant, we are spare, we are courageous.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.260
We think different as they told us.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.780
And still to this day, like kids get the iPhone

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.260
because culturally that look,

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.460
that's the coolest phone to get.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.340
Although in post Tim Cook's chillings

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.820
or welly in speech about things having no home

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.060
on his platform, my God,

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:57.100
how many of the people that Apple has held up to us

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.700
when they told us to think different

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.700
would be reviled right now as being hateful to somebody?

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.500
I just don't know.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.500
No, and it's scary when you're not a Tim Cook,

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.140
when you're not an Apple, when you're just yourself,

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.860
it's scary going up against the monster

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.180
of kind of this conformist group think somehow.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.940
And I'll get to that in a second,

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.660
but I'm still very interested in this skill acquisition aspect.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:33.020
What kind of core, you always talk about core principles

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.220
or first principles, what sort of first principles

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.060
or basics do you think someone needs

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:44.060
to develop that muscle of looking for the missing force,

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.660
the neutrino.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.860
So obviously Wolfgang Pauley,

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.180
he had a background in physics.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.820
He was able to kind of say,

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.860
huh, it didn't follow this law, something has to be there.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.820
And Tower Records, they didn't have that.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.740
Sales are declining, we're running the company great.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.900
Sales should be going up before running the company great

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.540
and people are listening to music.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.540
See, they somehow they missed the missing force.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.500
Sure.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.820
I mean, I think the one thing you could do

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.620
is you can just say, make a note to yourself.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.940
I'm about to have a conversation with Jane.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940
I wonder what's gonna happen.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.340
I think it's gonna go well.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.940
And you have a conversation with Jane

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.900
and it ends up with Jane yelling at you,

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.380
get out of my office.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:29.220
Okay, well, is that something that typically happens

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.980
that you think you're gonna go into a conversation

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.420
and you think it's gonna go great

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.340
and somebody gets really angry at you?

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.940
You could find somebody who repeats the same error

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.700
over and over again and never gets metacognitive or curious.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.220
So one thing I would say is before you start trying

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.180
to do anything new, if you find that you're frustrated

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.980
in your life and that you can't get past certain objects

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.700
or obstacles, just learn how to do this thing

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.740
I call watching your robot.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.500
So most of what gets you through a day,

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.660
you're not even thinking about it.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.340
You don't think about how to put one foot in front

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.300
of the other because you learned to walk ages ago.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.900
As you learn all of these things, they become automated.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.260
So a really interesting activity is to just watch

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.380
your body and your brain make mistakes.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.580
Like for example, I ordered a burger for lunch

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.860
and it came with fries and I said to myself,

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.860
they always give me fries and I always eat them

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.780
and I always regret it.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.100
And then I watched myself eat the fries

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.060
after having that thought.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.580
And instead of trying to get myself not to eat the fries,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.100
I said, I'm just gonna watch myself being an idiot.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.300
Isn't it interesting that my robot is just

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.420
in an automated mode making a decision

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.900
that I've decided to do the opposite of

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.580
and my robot is winning?

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.740
Well, that doesn't sound very encouraging at the beginning

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.500
but I guarantee you three times of having

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.380
that conversation with myself,

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.020
eventually I can't stand to watch my robot

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.700
take over the ship anymore.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.240
So it seems like you're saying,

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.100
have a mental model, given a situation

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.140
and maybe it's a high-stakes situation.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.060
Like you're gonna write a book or run a business

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.380
or run a particle accelerator and see what happens.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.220
So given a high-stakes situation,

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.900
build a mental model beforehand

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.340
of what you think should happen.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.620
Let's say you're going in to have a discussion

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.020
with your boss or your girlfriend or whatever.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.180
See what happens if there's a difference

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.940
and if there's a difference and view that difference

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.820
as kind of a robot that you're observing from higher

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.460
and then you see that difference enough

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.740
and you're feeling bad about it,

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.140
the solution maybe is some innovation

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.780
or some beautiful solution.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:41.460
Or just getting control of the situation.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:45.020
Don't start off with the big meeting

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.580
or the big project or the big deal

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.780
because usually mostly what we're doing wrong is fractal

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.300
and if you're blowing big deals,

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.580
you're probably blowing little transactions,

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.900
buying a candy bar at the bodega.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.580
You're probably screwing that up too at some level.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.060
And maybe you're too friendly,

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.900
maybe you're not friendly enough, I don't know.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.660
But definitely find the cheapest places to practice

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.020
because there's no sense learning

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.540
in the highest stakes environment possible.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:18.940
So let's take this to you coining the phrase

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.460
the intellectual dark web.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.700
You felt free to express opinions

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.700
among the select group of friends and colleagues.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.780
You chose to be around you on a daily basis.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.980
You feel comfortable saying what you think

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.900
because they don't slander you for it

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.140
or ruin your career for it.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.260
I don't feel comfortable saying what I think.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.340
I just can't stop.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:45.460
The World of Technology

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.020
It's storming every industry

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.780
and literally billions of dollars are being invested.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.140
So buckle up.

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.540
The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.500
and processing power.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.220
So how do you compete without cost spiraling out of control?

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:09.260
It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud,

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.300
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.060
OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure,

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.340
database, application development and AI needs.

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.580
OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds,

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.180
offers one consistent price

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.220
instead of variable regional pricing.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.100
And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.020
So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.500
and less than half the cost of other clouds.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.220
If you want to do more and spend less like Uber,

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.300
eight by eight and Databricks Mosaic,

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:42.580
take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash advance.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.100
That's oracle.com slash advance.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.300
Oracle.com slash advance.
