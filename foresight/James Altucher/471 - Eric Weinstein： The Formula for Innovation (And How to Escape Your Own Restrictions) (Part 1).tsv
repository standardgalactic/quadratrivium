0	4260	I am so glad you convinced me that the family car
4260	6060	should be the Defender 110.
6060	9500	It is so beautiful inside, it's so comfortable,
9500	11820	and it just feels indestructible.
11820	13020	Yes, it really is.
13020	15580	I've been waiting a long time for the new model to come out.
15580	17420	The Defender 110, I'm telling you,
17420	19380	it's my favorite car of all times.
19380	20740	It's my third one.
20740	22980	You know, I have stories of going off road.
22980	24740	The guy managed the group.
24740	27380	He was like, what are you doing in this beautiful car?
27380	28500	I'm like, I'm going off road.
28500	29340	He's like, are you sure?
29340	30460	Because you can use one of ours,
30460	32180	and then they look like Mad Max cars.
32180	33460	I'm like, no, no, no, we're going to do this,
33460	34620	and he was shocked.
34620	35460	Wow.
35460	36980	Well, it's great because the Defender
36980	39900	has been reimagined for 21st century adventure,
39900	42620	and its unparalleled off-road ability,
42620	45860	as well as its robust interior, are invaluable,
45860	47940	whether you're headed towards uncharted territory,
47940	50500	or just a weekend of exploration.
50500	53100	The Defender 110 tackles challenging surroundings
53100	54980	with absolute confidence.
54980	57860	The SUV conveys strength outside and in,
57860	59300	featuring peerless technology,
59300	61460	like an intuitive driver display,
61460	64020	and an award-winning infotainment system.
64020	66340	That's my favorite part, to keep you connected,
66340	68700	no matter where the journey takes you.
68700	72340	Adventure is unique to everyone, and so is the Defender.
72340	74500	Choose from the two-door Defender 90,
74500	77980	the four-door Defender 110, or the larger Defender 130,
77980	80700	with the ability to seat up to eight passengers.
80700	83860	You'll find uncompromising performance in all three.
83860	88140	So pack up and go even further with the Defender 110.

114860	117460	This isn't your average business podcast,
117460	119860	and he's not your average host.
119860	123860	This is the James Altiger Show on the Choose Yourself Network.
125940	128940	Today on the James Altiger Show.
128940	132700	In many ways, permission to be an imposter
132700	135580	is something you have to take for yourself.
135580	137020	So if you're hearing this podcast,
137020	138980	and if you feel like an imposter,
138980	140940	instead of trying to fight it,
140940	143700	just try experimenting when you're in the quiet of your own room.
143700	146300	What if I am an imposter, then so what?
146300	150340	Maybe the idea is that my faking it would be as good or better
150340	153100	than somebody else's earnest attempt.
153100	157980	So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting your fear
157980	159100	of being an imposter,
159100	162460	and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.
162460	167060	You know, for any area, it seems like there's a set path,
167060	170220	there's a set formula to become the top of that area.
170300	174060	And I think, would you say being an imposter
174060	176780	is when there are people who come into the area
176780	178340	without taking that traditional path?
178340	179500	Right, yeah.
179500	184340	But never discount what somebody can do
184340	185860	completely on their own.
185860	188700	And I think when you first make a decision
188700	192140	to burn the boat so there's no returning home, right?
192140	194180	I think that's when things get really exciting
194180	195900	because it's sink or swim,
195900	198340	and people become incredibly inventive
198380	200620	once they become isolated and terrified.
200620	202900	When do you think you've burned boats?
202900	204700	What was your first experience with it?
209700	211580	So, I don't even know how to introduce you.
211580	212900	You're Eric Weinstein,
212900	215540	you're managing director of Weinstein.
215540	217140	I keep forgetting that.
218140	219500	Weinstein, Eric Weinstein,
219500	222100	managing director of Teal Capital.
222100	225340	You got your PhD in mathematical physics at Harvard.
225340	228500	You've done, you're like a Renaissance man, I feel.
228500	230620	You're kind of, I've listened to a whole bunch
230620	232420	of excellent podcasts with you.
232420	235460	Let's start off with Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Tim Ferriss.
235460	238820	I highly recommend people listen to you on those podcasts too
238820	241740	because to get the wide range of your knowledge,
241740	243340	what other things should people say about you?
243340	244900	How do people introduce you?
244900	246100	You've done like a million things.
246100	248020	Well, I don't know, I'm just a guy
248020	250580	who's interested in canonical structures in the universe
250580	252540	and try to find them wherever we can.
252540	254940	So, what do you mean by canonical structure?
254940	256900	And then I'll actually continue the intro.
256900	260700	Well, just, I guess what I'm fascinated by
260700	265700	is things that are extremely elegant, very powerful.
267100	269860	There's an idea, I think, due to Richard Dawkins
269860	272620	that you measure the power of an idea
272620	276500	by what it explains divided by what it assumes.
276500	279260	And so the most powerful ideas assume very little
279260	282260	and tell you a tremendous amount when you unpack them.
282260	284900	So, in general, if you're gonna try to get through life,
284900	288340	you wanna find the most powerful ideas by that rubric.
288340	291540	Okay, but let me unpack that a little bit.
293940	297020	I've heard that before and,
297020	298500	but with the addition that also
298500	300340	it should have some predictive ability.
300340	303540	So, a theory might explain a lot,
303540	307420	like let's take Richard Dawkins in evolutionary psychology.
307420	310180	It could explain a lot, but does it predict a lot?
310180	312540	And would you include that in something
312540	314900	that's an important mental model?
314900	317140	Sure, I mean, I think it does predict a lot
317140	320780	and I think a lot of it can be quite surprising.
320780	322580	Before we get to evolutionary psychology,
322580	324180	because that's always gonna be fraught
324180	326900	as people don't want to imagine
326900	329020	that their thoughts and behavior patterns
329020	330940	are somewhat systematized.
332060	335640	You just take something like the four chord song from music.
336580	339220	I guarantee you that within the next year,
339220	342380	someone will release a version of the four chord song
342380	347260	that will go one, five, six, minor, four.
347260	349260	And they'll have a worldwide hit with it.
349260	352140	And it's predictive because that is a formula
352140	357140	that is known to underlie all sorts of hits.
357380	360500	And it's clearly not by accident or...
361820	365140	So, have you read The Head Factory
365140	367300	about these group of Swedish guys
367300	369940	who basically produce every hits on
369940	371900	and they basically use that structure,
371900	374620	like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, like every hit?
374620	377660	That's usually a bit more complex
377660	379660	than simple four chord songs
379660	382780	that can be strummed around the campfire.
382780	386220	But yeah, I think that there are formulas
386220	388280	and very often the formulas are sort of hidden
388280	390920	as if they're machine tools that make the tools.
391980	396120	So the idea that you have some Scandinavian group
396120	398520	that has figured out the DNA of music
398520	401540	and knows how to pump out hits at will is fascinating.
402180	403740	Why should anyone have that power?
403740	405340	And the idea that there is,
406180	408900	well, that there are formulas is what's fascinating.
408900	411140	So when I talk about canonical structures,
411140	414060	I'm most interested in ways in which the world
414060	416220	seems incredibly complicated,
416220	419700	but in fact reduces to a very small set of assumptions.
419700	422020	So what's another example?
422020	425980	Well, the famous ones that people all know
425980	428620	would be, for example, the periodic table,
428620	432700	but maybe despite the fact that that tells you all
432700	433780	about the chemical elements
433780	437260	and gives you a lot of indication of how they'll combine,
437260	441380	most people have never seen the left step periodic table,
441380	444420	which makes clear the relationship between symmetries
444420	446660	and orbitals and chemical elements.
446660	450900	So that would be an example of a design innovation
450900	454700	where just the presentation of the information
454700	456940	lays bare the underlying structure.
456940	461580	Or if we were talking music or not music language,
461580	463740	the international phonemic alphabet
463740	466020	is something that most people don't even know it exists,
466020	470060	but it has to do with the mapping of the structure
470060	474140	or our speech apparatus into a universal notation
474140	475140	so that you can understand
475140	476820	how to pronounce something in any language.
476820	478700	And so I've heard you talk about that
478700	481140	on Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss.
481140	483340	I think it's fascinating, but it also underlines,
483340	486780	all these things underlined how much of a kind
486900	489060	of polymath or renaissance person you are.
489060	491540	Like, you have your PhD in mathematical physics,
491540	492900	you have results there,
492900	497380	but you've gotten from that to economics,
497380	500900	to obviously a deep understanding of music and language
500900	503020	and economics and finance
503020	504860	and you're managing director of Teal Capitals
504860	506860	who are involved in the investing world.
508020	511540	And the way I know more about you
511540	514580	as I actually heard you speak a few months ago in New York,
514580	517740	Dave Rubin was on the stage, Melissa Chen was on the stage,
517740	519740	and it was about this, you know,
519740	521780	the so-called intellectual dark web,
521780	523860	a phrase you coined,
523860	528860	which is kind of about, if I was to describe it,
528900	533500	basically the limitations on free speech
533500	538500	that has polarized the US or even the world on both sides,
539300	540860	but I would say maybe a little bit more
540860	542500	since Trump got elected,
543460	544940	the limitations of free speech
544940	547860	are happening a little bit more on the left side, and...
547860	549180	Just not a little bit.
549180	550020	All right, not a little bit,
550020	553140	but and to note, you're from the left side,
553140	555100	I've been a Democrat all my life,
555100	559020	but suddenly I find you cannot even,
559020	564020	unless you agree with all 50 things on one team,
564020	566660	you're ruined.
566660	567820	But that's not even true.
567820	569060	There's no way to agree with it
569060	571460	because it's self-contradictory.
571460	572300	Tell me what you mean.
573020	577060	If you are men and women different
577060	578740	or are men and women the same?
578740	581740	So this new movement asserts
581740	584340	both of those things at different times
584340	586860	in order to make two different sets of points.
586860	589460	If you want to make the point that leaving women out
591460	592740	is a problem because you don't get
592740	593900	the benefit of diversity,
593900	595020	you say, do you have any idea
595020	597100	how differently women think from men?
597100	598740	You're losing all of that perspective,
598740	600220	which is an interesting argument.
600300	603220	And then when you see, let's say a workplace
603220	607380	with a lack of balance between men and women,
607380	610220	they'll claim will be men and women are exactly the same
610220	613340	and the failure to hire women has to do
613340	617260	with bigotry and prejudice.
617260	618780	And so it's very interesting.
618780	620900	You're making two separate arguments.
620900	623060	Both of them are individually interesting.
623060	624260	Then you say, well, look,
624260	625740	I've heard you make two different arguments.
625740	627540	Let's try to figure out how they combine
627540	628820	or whether there's a contradiction
628820	630020	or there's something to explore.
630020	631940	And then people get very, very angry.
631940	633740	They get very angry in it.
633740	635300	The way you just put that
635300	638500	kind of reminds me of arguments in relationships.
638500	641860	So it's when two sides,
641860	645060	the man and the woman say, disagree about something.
645060	648780	And usually the way you resolve arguments is,
648780	650460	okay, why do you disagree?
650460	651460	Why do you disagree?
651460	652620	What are all the options?
652620	654060	And then you discuss what's the,
654060	656020	what option is best for the unit
656020	657540	kind of in the middle of that spectrum
657540	658820	between one side and the other.
658820	662100	But here we've come to a place societally
662100	667020	where people are not willing to acknowledge
667020	669300	that there are options in the middle.
669300	671580	Yeah, I don't think it's really about options in the middle
671580	673740	or compromise or common ground.
673740	676540	I think that for some reason that we don't understand
676540	679220	and interesting that both of us identify
679220	681500	with being lifelong Democrats,
681500	685020	something has gone completely insane inside of the left
685020	686700	with respect to logic and reason.
686740	689340	Just even to the point where bringing up logic,
689340	690620	reason, contradiction,
690620	693540	I'm told these are tools of power and oppression.
693540	696380	And I don't even waste time
696380	698220	within any argument that stupid.
698220	700620	It's just, it's so far outside the bounds
700620	703380	of what civilized people should be discussing,
703380	705020	whether or not logic and reason,
705020	706100	I mean, are we gonna be discussing
706100	708580	whether arithmetic is biased?
708580	710780	I have no idea where these people are going.
710780	713020	Well, I wondered about this
713020	715140	when thinking about this podcast,
715260	719020	you're obviously involved in at least questioning
719020	720140	what's going on with free speech.
720140	721740	People like you and Jordan Peterson
721740	724100	who's also been on the podcast and others.
724100	727540	And my first inclination was to think,
727540	728940	why do you care?
728940	732820	Because I just avoid people who don't let me talk.
732820	736220	But I guess in the workplace and in,
736220	740420	if you're out there trying to make other points
740420	744060	that you want people to consider what you're saying
744100	745700	and value what you're saying,
745700	747180	then there's some Twitter mob
747180	749180	or just some societal mob in general
749180	751580	that says, no, he said this 15 years ago,
751580	753740	so we can't listen to anything else he ever says.
753740	756060	I guess it is important to this.
756060	758100	I mean, it's not even close.
758100	760060	What we are potentially going to do
760060	765060	in terms of our ability to destroy our institutions,
765660	767660	suppress thought, descent,
769180	772100	completely weaken ourselves
772100	774180	and our scientific enterprises
774180	776060	by creating a climate in which no one knows
776060	779300	what the rules are from moment to moment.
779300	783460	And anyone can come out of any nook of your past
783460	787060	and accuse you and you feel like you have to answer.
787060	788180	I think it's really important
788180	790900	that people stop answering all of the accusations
790900	793620	with information about their lives.
793620	795340	Very often somebody will be accused and they'll say,
795340	796860	well, actually I was here and I was there
796860	798020	and I was doing this other thing.
798020	799300	Why are you telling people?
799340	803420	I mean, just if people want to accuse you of something,
803420	805460	have them do it through the courts
805460	809180	and have it be done with presumption of innocence.
809180	811380	There's something that's going on
811380	814860	in which we are now attacking people's ability
814860	819260	to earn a living as a second judiciary process.
819260	822180	And the idea is that if we can destroy your reputation,
822180	824420	we may not be able to get you into a court of law,
824420	826900	but we can keep you from feeding your family.
826940	831940	And that is what I've been calling left cartheism.
832020	835180	And because I come from the left,
835180	839140	we learned to hate McCarthyism during the 1950s
839140	841140	because it was used against us
841140	842860	and it was used very specifically
842860	845540	to destroy progressive families.
845540	848740	The idea that people calling themselves progressives
848740	852740	have rediscovered the tools of ruin
852740	855660	that were previously used against progressives
855700	860260	by an out of control anti-communist movement
860260	863340	in the United States is beyond ridiculous.
863340	864340	Well, it's interesting
864340	866380	because it didn't just start now,
866380	869180	although maybe it's at the peak that it's ever been.
869180	872300	I mean, there's always been this notion of PC culture
872300	875060	and you always kind of had to be careful around it.
875060	877780	But it's just maybe it's gotten,
877780	879300	I think since the election of Trump,
879300	881140	it's gotten much more intense
881140	884100	where you're either on one team or the other.
884100	888540	And like you say, it's even hard to say what the team is
888540	893540	because both sides could be construed with the same hate.
893900	895260	But that sounds reactive to Trump.
895260	899100	My claim is that Trump was called out of the vacuum
899100	902740	and installed as president largely because of this madness.
902740	905660	The reason I'm so against this madness
905660	909940	is because it's going to elect us Trump or worse
909940	911740	in the eyes of the left.
911740	914420	In other words, if you start going after
914420	916700	the bedrock of American labor,
916700	921700	let's say famously Hillary's comment about deplorables,
923100	926460	I believe that deplorables are democratic apostates
926460	928260	who left the Democratic Party
928260	930100	when it started abandoning labor
931100	934620	and tried to make up the constituency deficit
934620	936740	by embracing identity politics.
936740	938100	And the claim is that labor
938100	940540	was a super expensive constituency
940540	943460	and identity politics is incredibly cheap.
943460	947620	So the donor class wanted to swap out labor for identity.
947620	950900	This is my wife's theory, Pia Milani's.
950900	953980	But I think that-
953980	956220	Although labor is a huge voting constituency.
956220	961220	Well, it is, but if you have like white former coal miners
962740	964260	in their 60s or something,
964260	966860	and then you're making fun of them as deplorables
966860	971860	because their church going, rifle owning,
973180	976140	speak your mind, American bedrock.
976140	977500	I think that it just shows
977500	980180	that we're completely cut off from our own history,
980180	981540	our own base.
981540	986380	And you should never antagonize a group of people
986380	989860	that's taken a really serious hit like this,
989860	991860	which is in some sense,
991860	993940	just a bedrock constituency in this country.
993940	996500	You're opening the door of Pandora's box.
996540	999220	I can't imagine anyone smart wanting to do that.
999220	1000060	Why do you?
1000060	1005060	I mean, Hillary's obviously not the most successful
1005140	1006060	campaign in the world,
1006060	1008380	but she knows what she's doing enough to get nominated
1008380	1010500	to be almost president.
1010500	1012100	And why do you think she did that?
1014060	1019060	I think that Hillary is part of a very long slide
1020020	1025020	into middle brown nonsense that was used
1025300	1027500	to blow out the genie coefficients,
1027500	1029780	create a tremendous amount of income,
1029780	1032740	inequality, and asset inequality in this country.
1032740	1035620	I think that when Bill Clinton figured out
1035620	1040620	how to finally stop the 12 year Republican juggernaut in 1992,
1043100	1045980	he largely did it by copying so much
1045980	1048700	of the Republican playbook that you have two versions
1049860	1051660	of the pro inequality party.
1051660	1053660	And I think that definitely the idea
1053700	1056940	that Republicans remain the party of millionaires,
1056940	1059180	but Democrats have become the party of billionaires
1059180	1060780	is an interesting critique.
1060780	1062940	Well, it's interesting because in 1992,
1062940	1065500	I mean, at the time he was head of the,
1065500	1068780	I think it was the Democrat National Caucus
1068780	1069780	or Southern Caucus,
1069780	1072300	some part of the Democratic party,
1072300	1074580	that was kind of the conservative wing
1074580	1075540	of a Democratic party.
1075540	1080540	And the fact that they're now signaled to be so on the left,
1081540	1083620	it was kind of an interesting.
1083620	1086420	Yeah, but I don't even know what these words really mean.
1086420	1088940	I think that we have two parties, Democrat and Republican,
1088940	1091860	we can call them left and right, if you will.
1091860	1096220	But to me, it's two faces of the looting party.
1096220	1097900	Of the looting party.
1097900	1099380	Okay, what do you mean by looting?
1099380	1101180	Well, that we've been,
1101180	1103380	we have this country with a tremendous amount of wealth.
1103380	1104980	We have a problem with growth
1104980	1106340	and that we're not really honest
1106340	1109360	about confronting our problems with growth.
1109360	1112040	So just like any family that has a family business
1112040	1113560	that has made it wealthy,
1113560	1116440	where the business starts to begin sputtering,
1116440	1118440	you have a very interesting period of time
1118440	1120520	where you can use the wealth of the family,
1120520	1124160	you can take loans against the assets,
1124160	1125960	you can sell things off,
1125960	1128240	and you can live in the style to which you become accustomed
1128240	1130600	as you try to figure out how to restart the business.
1130600	1132000	Well, that's, I think, what we've been doing
1132000	1135520	for almost since the beginning of the 70s,
1135520	1137240	certainly since the beginning of the 80s,
1137240	1138560	is that we've been buying time,
1138560	1140440	but not actually figuring out
1140440	1144160	how to really restart hyper-aggressive growth.
1146040	1147800	Where do you see that?
1147800	1150080	How do you see that playing out?
1150080	1151440	Well, I don't think we're as invested
1151440	1154320	in real science and technology and Mavericks.
1154320	1156120	We're not interested in employing
1156120	1158560	the super disagreeable people
1158560	1160520	who are strong enough to hold positions
1160520	1162520	that no one agrees with them on,
1162520	1167160	but are in fact necessary to overturn incorrect orthodoxies.
1167160	1170160	We're interested in this kind of consensus,
1170160	1174720	communal structure that's going to choke our ability
1174720	1177640	to find new sources of economic growth.
1177640	1180560	We want dangerous, difficult people,
1180560	1183480	people who you don't necessarily feel safe,
1185120	1186640	trusting your cat to.
1186640	1190000	I mean, people who are aggressive.
1190000	1192760	And I think often about Jim Watson.
1192760	1196200	Jim Watson chooses to be incredibly unpleasant
1196200	1199960	in many ways as the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.
1199960	1200800	On the other hand,
1200800	1203880	he's been fantastically productive over his life.
1203880	1207440	And he's a great example of someone
1207440	1212280	who gave himself permission to dominate areas of science
1212280	1215080	or innovation where he wasn't necessarily
1215080	1218080	the expert or that informed in those areas.
1218080	1221000	And I think that's part of what makes someone dangerous,
1221000	1225200	is to be able to step into an area, say things out loud,
1225200	1229240	and yet not kind of challenge the top of the pyramid.
1229240	1230160	Well, but he's also,
1230160	1233280	he's offensive almost for the sake of being offensive.
1233280	1234720	So I'm not saying,
1234720	1237200	boy, this is the way to conduct yourself at a party
1237200	1240520	or what a wonderful way to treat other people.
1240520	1241960	I'm trying to say,
1241960	1245800	if you want somebody who is balls to the wall
1245800	1248640	and trying to break into new territory
1248640	1251200	and do things at the highest level of human ability,
1251200	1253160	you're gonna have to put up with some people like that.
1253160	1255200	So let's talk about that for a second,
1255200	1256400	because, and I think this is a little
1256400	1258920	out of the intellectual dark web discussion,
1258920	1261520	but I'm really fascinated by skill acquisition
1261520	1265320	and the so-called 10,000-hour role of Anders Erickson,
1265320	1267560	popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.
1267560	1270400	You've succeeded in many different areas.
1270400	1272840	You're an expert in many different areas.
1272840	1276560	Obviously, you're super intelligent,
1276560	1279440	but it seems like you've made conscious decision
1279440	1282240	and permission in the same way that Watson might have
1282240	1285760	to say, okay, I'm gonna become knowledgeable and an expert
1285760	1288160	and even an investor in other areas
1288160	1290240	other than differential geometry,
1290240	1292560	which you studied and got your PhD in.
1292560	1294720	But even there, I'm an imposter.
1294720	1295800	Why is that?
1295800	1298960	Well, I don't, for example, have a thesis advisor.
1298960	1300080	You didn't have a thesis advisor?
1300080	1300920	No.
1300920	1301760	What happened?
1301760	1302600	You were at Harvard.
1302600	1303440	Yeah.
1303440	1304280	You had some ideas.
1304280	1306120	Nobody liked them.
1306120	1308560	I think people were interested in the ideas,
1308560	1311960	but I think that they were pretty radical in a lot of ways.
1312760	1314520	I'm afraid to ask what the ideas were
1314520	1315800	because they're gonna be way beyond.
1315800	1317040	Look, I can say words around them.
1317040	1318360	You're not gonna understand what the words mean,
1318360	1321560	but let's imagine that you had some set of equations
1321560	1323320	that was thought to only occur
1323320	1326800	in particular sets of dimensions, whatever dimensions are.
1326800	1328600	Okay, so you would have an assertion
1328600	1331160	that these equations are peculiar to dimension four
1331160	1333080	and don't exist anywhere else.
1333080	1335000	And so maybe I try to show that, well, actually,
1335000	1338280	versions of those equations exist in all dimensions.
1338320	1343320	So that shibboleth or that perspective was challenged.
1343480	1345960	And if I wanted to try to relate
1345960	1349320	the kind of work we were doing in geometry
1349320	1352360	to actual guesses about the world of particles
1352360	1355800	and particle theory, that could cause a problem.
1355800	1360800	And so in many ways, permission to be an imposter
1362080	1364920	is something you have to take for yourself.
1364920	1367560	And in particular, young women.
1367560	1370440	So young women have confidence problems
1370440	1373920	that I think are more severe even than young men
1373920	1376400	because young men will often decide that they're capable,
1376400	1377640	whether or not they are capable,
1377640	1380320	whereas young women tend to be very acutely aware
1380320	1381840	of all their imperfections.
1382760	1384720	So evolutionary or cultural?
1384720	1386360	I think a lot of it is evolutionary
1386360	1391360	because I think women, females are purposed
1391680	1394040	for child rearing in ways that males are not
1394040	1396000	because maternity is certain and paternity
1396000	1398440	was never certain before genetic testing.
1398440	1400600	So I think that females tended to be
1400600	1403720	the low variance version of a strategy
1403720	1406160	where males tended to be the high variance version
1406160	1409760	of that strategy because women couldn't afford to mess up.
1410680	1413640	If you know about the rigors of early childhood,
1413640	1415560	it's a really super demanding work.
1415560	1419000	And so I think a lot of it is probably innate.
1419000	1421360	And it's good that we have a high variance
1421360	1425200	and a low variance version of these strategies.
1425200	1426840	I think you'll find that women in general
1426840	1430560	are much more reliable than most men on average.
1430560	1434600	Now, with that said, I think one of the terrible things
1434600	1438520	is that we don't give women permission to be imposters.
1438520	1440000	So if you're hearing this podcast
1440000	1441920	and if you feel like an imposter,
1441920	1446200	instead of trying to fight it, just try experimenting
1446200	1447720	when you're in the quiet of your own room.
1447720	1450360	What if I am an imposter, then so what?
1451320	1453960	Maybe the idea is that my faking it
1453960	1457360	would be as good or better than somebody else's
1457360	1458800	earnest attempts.
1458800	1463120	I have a friend who taught herself forms of dance
1463120	1467520	that she didn't have any formal training in,
1467520	1469880	but it certainly looked like she knew what she was doing,
1469880	1471960	but anybody who was actually trained
1471960	1473240	in those forms of dance would know
1473240	1475720	it was just completely made up.
1475720	1480720	So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting
1480720	1482280	your fear of being an imposter
1482280	1485680	and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.
1485680	1490680	You know, it's, you know, for any area,
1491520	1494520	it seems like there's a set path,
1494520	1497320	there's a set formula to become the top of that area.
1497320	1498720	Do you succeed in that area?
1498720	1499880	Politics was one example.
1499880	1502960	You know, you supposedly needed to be in the house,
1502960	1504880	in the Senate, and maybe a governor,
1504880	1506400	then vice president, then a president.
1506400	1507800	That was considered the typical path
1507800	1509520	and with some variation,
1509520	1512920	that's the path that many politicians have followed.
1512920	1516280	With mathematics, you go to graduate school,
1516280	1518440	you get a PhD, you become a professor,
1518440	1520320	and now you're a mathematician.
1520320	1525320	And I think what you say being an imposter is when,
1526360	1528680	and this happens in every area,
1528680	1530400	there are people who come into the area
1530400	1532000	without taking that traditional path.
1532000	1533560	Donald Trump, of course, became president
1533560	1535320	without taking the traditional path.
1535320	1538120	I'm sure there's mathematicians who have not,
1538120	1540800	don't even have a PhD, but have discovered some solution
1540800	1542000	to some theorem or whatever.
1542000	1543920	The guy who came up with Green's Functions,
1543920	1546560	which is a way of inverting a differential operator,
1546560	1549960	if you will, I think was a miller in the middle of England,
1549960	1553400	and he sent off a solution to Cambridge
1553400	1555280	to some famous problem,
1555280	1557560	and they wanted to appoint him to a professorship.
1557560	1559720	And then he said, well, really, I didn't even go to college.
1559720	1561600	And so they forced him to get a BA
1561600	1563440	before they could make him a professor.
1563440	1564400	That's fascinating.
1564400	1566640	So was he just reading like math papers all his life?
1566680	1568200	I think it was kind of unclear,
1568200	1573200	but never discount what somebody can do completely
1574720	1575560	on their own.
1575560	1578600	If you think just like about Jimi Hendrix's strange
1578600	1581480	stringing of his guitar from the right-handed guitar plate
1581480	1584120	upside down and backwards as a left-hander,
1584120	1586680	it immediately took him out of an ability
1586680	1589600	to like watch what somebody else was doing
1589600	1592840	and just copy it because it was so different.
1592840	1595800	So in some sense, it's not that surprising
1595800	1597240	that he would sound that unique
1597240	1599640	because nobody else was even
1599640	1601800	in his same universality class,
1601800	1604280	or Stanley Jordan tunes the guitar,
1604280	1606600	I think, uniformly in fourths,
1606600	1608840	which is a very uncommon thing to do.
1608840	1612440	And so it puts you in just a different class.
1612440	1616040	And I think when you first make a decision
1616040	1620520	to burn the boats, so there's no returning home, right?
1620520	1621680	And like this is what the people did
1621680	1623360	when they had the mutiny on the bounty
1623360	1626200	when they hit Karen Island that they burned the bounty
1626200	1627360	so nobody could leave.
1629760	1632400	I think that that's when things get really exciting
1632400	1634080	because it's sink or swim
1634080	1636520	and people become incredibly inventive
1636520	1638640	once they become isolated and terrified.
1638640	1641560	So when do you think you've burned boats?
1641560	1643600	What was your first experience with it?
1643600	1644440	Oh, geez.
1645680	1650680	I guess asserting that I was not good in math in high school.
1651680	1654520	I'm calling bullshit on that.
1654520	1655360	No.
1655360	1656680	What was your SAT score on math?
1657960	1659600	It's really not very impressive.
1662440	1665520	I mean, I don't wanna talk about my SAT scores at age 53,
1665520	1666720	James, what are we doing here?
1666720	1668920	No, but you're saying that you weren't good at math?
1668920	1670000	I can't believe that.
1670000	1671600	It seems like you're like over math.
1671600	1673240	Let's talk about learning disabilities
1673240	1676680	because I'm sure that you have a decent podcast size, right?
1676680	1677520	Yeah.
1677520	1679160	All right, there are a lot of parents out there.
1679160	1682080	Hey, I see you out there in radio land
1682080	1684760	who have kids who they know are smart.
1684760	1687760	They know are sharp and bright and creative and getting it.
1687760	1690240	And those kids are bringing home grades
1690240	1692320	that are just so depressing.
1692320	1694440	And the parents are tearing their hair out
1694440	1696200	because they're like, I can't get you into college.
1696200	1697520	You're not doing your homework.
1697520	1699480	Everything's coming back screwed up.
1699480	1703320	Okay, that population is probably learning disabled
1703320	1705200	in the standard parlance.
1705200	1707120	But I think they're probably supposed
1707120	1708760	to be our future innovators.
1708760	1710360	I will make the gambit that I believe
1710360	1713840	that most of the innovation or a lot of the innovation
1713840	1715720	is always going to come from people
1715720	1719200	who are going to be written off as learning incapable.
1719200	1721400	And so be of good cheer.
1721400	1723240	There's lots of ways to be smart
1723240	1725080	and underperform like crazy.
1725080	1730080	And I would much rather be appointed king of the losers.
1730200	1734200	There's so much brain power in loser nation
1734200	1735640	compared to winner nation.
1735640	1736960	It's unbelievable.
1736960	1739720	So you just have many more opportunities
1739720	1744380	to unlock unused brilliance in the loser community
1744380	1745980	or the learning disabled community
1745980	1748400	or the people with low self-esteem.
1748400	1749840	These are my people.
1749840	1751760	And this is where I get really super excited
1751760	1754480	because they're sitting on top of gold
1754480	1757560	and they just can't get it together to convert.
1757560	1759000	Well, so what would you say?
1759000	1763800	So again, so maybe you burn bridges by going into math
1763800	1765680	and saying, I'm gonna do this.
1765800	1766960	I have some insights.
1766960	1769800	So I committed to a program whereby I didn't think
1769800	1771080	I was gonna finish college
1771080	1772680	because there was a language requirement.
1772680	1775960	I was doing terribly in French and I just...
1775960	1777080	I had the same problem actually.
1777080	1777920	Really?
1777920	1779240	In French, I took five years
1779240	1781280	and I got a D minus in college French
1781280	1783160	after my fifth year in it.
1783160	1785000	All right, so you're one of us.
1785000	1787520	Look, but if you'd learned Indonesian
1787520	1789520	you actually would have been in great shape.
1789520	1790360	Why is that?
1790360	1791840	Because the orthography is the same as ours.
1791840	1793960	So they use the same Latin letters.
1794520	1797120	It's not inflected for gender.
1797120	1799520	It's not inflected for tense.
1799520	1804520	It's not inflected for gender number K.
1806360	1807200	It's just perfect.
1807200	1811840	It's the most wonderful language to learn super rapidly
1811840	1813760	and it's about the most beautiful place on earth.
1813760	1816080	It might be the most beautiful place on earth.
1816080	1816920	So it's okay.
1816920	1819720	So you decide I'm gonna go into...
1819720	1822280	I have these ideas about the universe and math.
1822280	1825920	So I stopped taking required classes, I guess.
1825920	1827840	I started taking all graduate courses.
1827840	1830480	I loaded up like crazy in math
1830480	1833560	and a little bit of advanced physics or something.
1833560	1835840	And I didn't think I would graduate.
1835840	1838760	And I just said, look, at least I wanna find out
1838760	1841280	what the universe is all about while I'm here.
1841280	1842880	And that turned out to pay out.
1842880	1843720	So...
1844920	1846360	So after you...
1846360	1849120	So you got the PhD, you didn't have advisor
1849120	1851360	so who kind of approved the PhD?
1851360	1853520	Formerly a guy named Raul Bot
1853520	1854720	who would be my, you know,
1854720	1856760	he was formerly appointed as my advisor.
1856760	1858840	The person who came closest to being my advisor
1858840	1860760	was a guy named Dror Bar Natan
1860760	1864000	who just helped me explain what I'd done
1864000	1865840	to people who couldn't understand it.
1867400	1869120	And, but it's, you know, it's very rare
1869120	1874120	not to have an advisor in a subject like mathematics.
1874400	1876160	And then, what was the first?
1876160	1878080	So maybe you took some fellowships.
1878080	1883080	You, but when did you start to branch out of mathematics?
1884240	1885880	Well, I mean, I think I was always interested
1885880	1888160	in anything that could be sort of systematized
1888160	1890360	and explained that had a lot of power to it.
1891640	1894320	I did some work in economics with my wife, Pia Malani.
1894320	1898280	And we found a way to apply the geometry
1898280	1901160	that is underlying particle theory
1901160	1903520	to neoclassical economics.
1903520	1907460	And we had a backwards compatible reformulation
1907460	1910140	of neoclassical economics in a way that could solve
1911100	1913460	something called the changing preference problem.
1913460	1915060	What's the, what's the changing preference problem?
1915060	1917740	Well, if you know that question
1917740	1919220	that you get asked in politics,
1919220	1922060	are you better off now than you were four years ago?
1922060	1926460	Well, if your tastes change over that period of time,
1926460	1928700	there's no way in economic theory,
1928700	1930180	as it's currently practiced,
1930180	1934300	to compare your welfare between two points in time
1934300	1935860	where your tastes were different.
1935860	1938700	It's only if your tastes stay exactly the same
1938700	1940700	that you can make welfare comparisons.
1940700	1941540	And since-
1941540	1944680	So, like as an example, maybe four years earlier,
1944680	1946860	you liked living in a house in the suburbs,
1946860	1949100	but then suddenly you wanted to live in an apartment
1949100	1951620	in Manhattan, it might not seem you're better off.
1951620	1952460	It's hard to measure-
1952460	1954860	Well, let's do kale and beef.
1954860	1957500	Okay, so at some point you're thinking vegan is healthy,
1957500	1958900	then you start reading a lot of stuff
1958900	1961060	that maybe you think paleo is healthier.
1961060	1963100	So before you put a huge premium on kale
1963100	1964740	and a low premium on beef,
1964780	1966380	and then five years later,
1966380	1970020	you value beef more and kale less, okay?
1970020	1972620	So any particular basket of goods,
1972620	1974940	which has both kale and beef in it,
1974940	1976580	gives you some level of happiness.
1976580	1978820	But the problem that you find
1978820	1980420	between periods of time where your tastes change,
1980420	1983380	you don't know how to compare your two forms of happiness,
1983380	1984220	because in some sense,
1984220	1987260	you're too different as two different people.
1987260	1989300	Right, but when someone says,
1989300	1991180	are you better off than you were before,
1991180	1994460	they usually mean probably income plus assets,
1994660	1996300	adjusted for inflation.
1996300	1999380	Well, if everything's a financial asset-
1999380	2000580	Just in terms of economics, though.
2000580	2002740	I understand, but if the idea is
2002740	2005100	that you have cheaper airfare,
2006100	2007900	but you're spending more on healthcare,
2007900	2011540	and how much do I value travel versus health,
2012380	2014420	it's not an easy question.
2014420	2016700	So we solved the puzzle of how to do that
2016700	2018180	at a theoretical level.
2019620	2022900	Using the knowledge you gleaned
2022900	2025340	from differential geometry or physics.
2025340	2027180	Exactly, infinite dimensional gauge theory.
2027180	2029900	So I love the idea of this,
2029900	2031900	because I'm a big believer in,
2033420	2034780	we were talking before the podcast,
2034780	2037700	you had just tried doing stand-up comedy.
2037700	2040500	Obviously, you had never done it before.
2040500	2042140	There's a certain amount of skills involved,
2042140	2043820	but you've done public speaking before.
2043820	2048820	You've had a vast array of experiences and knowledge
2049220	2050900	that you were able to bring onto the stage with you
2050900	2052880	that maybe other comedians didn't.
2052880	2054400	So in a sense, you did the same thing.
2054400	2058080	You borrowed from other categories you were expert in
2058080	2059880	that the audience maybe wasn't,
2059880	2064720	and you were able to use that to perform like an expert
2064720	2065960	on the stage that time.
2065960	2069280	So in this case, you borrowed from physics and math
2069280	2072440	without necessarily having an economics PhD,
2072440	2075640	and were able to do something interesting.
2075640	2077560	Yeah, I think nature has very few games
2077560	2078880	that she knows how to play well.
2078880	2081520	And so if you learn those games, you're quite correct.
2082520	2084360	You can't necessarily just take them wholesale
2084360	2086920	from one field to another, but you can port them
2086920	2088800	in that you have to make certain adaptations
2088800	2090440	to use them in a new place.
2091720	2095760	So for example, jokes, pattern recognition.
2095760	2098280	How many jokes, you have an incident that happens,
2098280	2100360	you have a tiny variation on the first incident.
2100360	2102800	So two incidents sets up an expectation.
2102800	2105400	The third one treats the first two formally,
2105400	2107720	and then does something completely absurd,
2107720	2110640	which you didn't realize also fits the pattern.
2110640	2112680	That doesn't sound like a joke,
2112680	2114520	but the number of Jewish jokes
2114520	2116360	that that unpacks to is enormous.
2128200	2130560	These days, we're all investors,
2130560	2132240	trying to be smart with our money
2132240	2134120	despite our worst impulses.
2134120	2137320	But at iShares, we believe that deep down inside
2137320	2140000	of every investor is a better investor.
2141480	2144920	One that's just waiting to be let out.
2146560	2149200	Explore iShares ETFs and insights,
2149200	2151320	and let your best investor out.

2158000	2160640	You know what I love about fantasy sports?
2160640	2163040	Is that even though I'm not gonna be a great basketball player
2163040	2165720	or a baseball player or a football player or whatever,
2165720	2169880	I feel like I get to participate and make decisions
2169880	2173240	and use my knowledge of these different leagues too,
2173240	2177040	or these different sports to compete.
2177040	2178960	So it's like I can pick my team
2178960	2180920	or I can pick my favorite players,
2180920	2184080	and I could use my knowledge to make predictions
2184080	2186400	and maybe even make money.
2186400	2188600	So with the basketball season here,
2188600	2190560	you can now pick combo projections
2190560	2192920	across football and basketball
2192920	2196560	from the Specials League on prize picks.
2196560	2198240	This is a league created specifically
2198240	2200880	for combo projections that include two or more players
2200880	2202560	from different sports or leagues.
2202560	2205120	Want to play alongside some of prize picks' favorite players
2205120	2208000	like rapper Meek Mill and comedian Andrew Schultz,
2208000	2209640	who's also been a guest on this podcast,
2209640	2210880	and I've been a guest on his.
2210880	2212960	You can now find community plays
2212960	2215320	under the promos tab of the app to view entries
2215320	2216480	for some of the biggest names
2216480	2218680	in the prize picks community each week.
2218680	2221560	Look, prize picks even offers a reboot policy
2221560	2223080	so that your entries stay in play,
2223080	2225840	even if one of your players gets injured.
2225840	2227160	For football and basketball games,
2227200	2228680	if you have a player who exits the game
2228680	2231280	in the first half and does not return in the second,
2231280	2233000	that player is rebooted.
2233000	2236680	Prize picks is the only daily fantasy sports platform
2236680	2238920	with an injury insurance policy.
2238920	2240200	What?
2240200	2242040	So I love playing it.
2242040	2245720	I love anywhere where I can use analytical ability
2245720	2249640	with my interests to demonstrate some skill
2249640	2251080	and maybe make some money.
2251080	2252880	And I like the game-like aspect.
2252880	2255680	I do wish they had chess as a category on prizepicks.com,
2255720	2257840	but I'll set up for what they've got.
2257840	2261920	Maybe I should make my own fantasy chess league.
2261920	2263840	But in any case, I love prizepicks.
2263840	2266080	Go to prizepicks.com slash James,
2266080	2271080	use code James for a first deposit match up to $100.
2271120	2273240	That's the easiest hundred dollars you're ever gonna make.
2273240	2277760	So that's prizepicks.com slash James and use code James.
2277760	2280040	Daily fantasy sports made easy.
2281040	2291960	The future of learning is definitely online.
2291960	2296120	Like it's such BS that you have to spend $200,000
2296120	2300080	or take $200,000 in loans and go to some fancy school
2300080	2301680	when it's useless.
2301680	2303400	It doesn't guarantee you a job.
2303400	2305320	Most employers, including me,
2305320	2308240	do not care about degrees or grades or anything like that.
2308280	2310640	We wanna care that you love what you're doing,
2310640	2312160	that you know what you're doing,
2312160	2313880	in some cases that you have experience
2313880	2315200	or that you're rolling to learn.
2315200	2318920	But people in general love learning and are curious.
2318920	2321200	Like the key to success is curiosity.
2321200	2325440	And I think masterclass.com is the perfect model
2325440	2326520	for online learning.
2326520	2330280	I'm really happy they're sponsoring this episode.
2330280	2332640	If you're gonna give a gift, give the gift of learning.
2332640	2335400	Masterclass makes a meaningful gift this season
2335400	2337320	for you and anyone on your list
2337360	2340040	because both of you can learn from the best
2340040	2342560	to become your best from leadership
2342560	2345200	to effective communication to cooking.
2345200	2346960	Let me tell you some of the classes I've taken.
2346960	2350240	I've taken comedy from Steve Martin.
2350240	2351760	I mean, can you believe I can take a class
2351760	2354240	from Steve Martin on comedy or Judd Apatow,
2354240	2355480	my favorite comedy director.
2355480	2359080	I could take an actual class from him on writing.
2359080	2363440	Wolfgang Puck on cooking, Dan Brown on writing
2363440	2366280	or Judy Bloom who's been on this podcast on writing.
2366280	2369000	By the way, Wolfgang Puck also has been on this podcast.
2369000	2369960	It's such a pleasure.
2369960	2373480	I try to take classes all the time from masterclass.com.
2373480	2376240	And whether you're watching masterclass on TV
2376240	2379240	or listening in audio mode in the app or on their site,
2379240	2381440	the quality speaks for itself.
2381440	2383600	It's like these masterclass instructors
2383600	2385920	are your own personal mentors that are going to help you
2385920	2387480	reach the next level.
2387480	2390480	How much would it cost to take one-on-one classes
2390480	2392200	on comedy from Steve Martin
2392200	2393880	or on chess from Gary Kasparov?
2393880	2395440	You just wouldn't be able to do it.
2395440	2398360	But I mean, it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
2398360	2400480	With a masterclass annual membership,
2400480	2402600	it's $10 a month.
2402600	2406040	Membership started $120 a year for unlimited access
2406040	2408960	to one-on-one classes with all 180-plus
2408960	2410560	masterclass instructors.
2410560	2413280	So it's not just $120 for one instructor.
2413280	2416560	You get all 180-plus masterclass instructors.
2416560	2419160	Boost your confidence and find practical takeaways
2419160	2421320	you can apply to your life and at work.
2421320	2423240	And if you own a business or a team leader,
2423240	2426160	use masterclass to empower and create future-ready
2426160	2427680	employees and leaders,
2427680	2430560	that's the real education in today's world.
2430560	2432720	So this holiday season,
2432720	2434840	you can give one annual membership
2434840	2439680	and get one free at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.
2439680	2442360	J-A-S, of course, stands for the James Altucher Show.
2442360	2443920	So right now you can get two memberships
2443920	2448600	for the price of one at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.
2448600	2451760	Masterclass.com slash J-A-S.
2451760	2453000	Offer terms apply.
2461680	2466320	So on the one hand, you could be a classic stand-up 20 years
2466320	2468520	writing down jokes and getting that formula,
2468520	2470760	or you could have lots of experiences in life
2470760	2474200	where this actually happens and you just say what happened
2474200	2476080	and that also works.
2476080	2478520	Right, or like particular words or sounds
2478520	2480040	have more humor value.
2480040	2483360	So people have commented numerous times
2483360	2485960	that the word pants or pickle or igloo,
2485960	2488840	these things are funny, they shouldn't be.
2488840	2492360	But if you have a choice of which word to use
2492360	2496720	and what cadence and there are all sorts of techniques
2496720	2501480	that I guess if you can talk to somebody
2501480	2503280	who really appreciates craft,
2503280	2506600	they can give you a huge leg up where a joke
2506600	2508960	that's sort of an okay joke that you might tell at a party
2509000	2512360	can be really souped up by somebody who's fantastic.
2512360	2516120	I just saw Joe Rogan rework the same joke
2516120	2520360	about wrestling four times, it's the same joke,
2520360	2522400	but you'd never recognize the thing,
2522400	2524440	he just mutates it until he gets it right.
2524440	2528800	There's a great example of Jim Gaffigan
2528800	2532000	telling on stage the very first joke ever,
2532000	2533360	there's some joke in hieroglyphics
2533360	2536760	from thousands of years ago and it's a fart joke.
2536840	2541320	And Jim Gaffigan retells the joke in his style
2541320	2543120	and of course it's very funny,
2543120	2545680	but it has the same kind of structure.
2545680	2550040	But so it's interesting, so what are,
2550040	2551360	in terms of this meta learning,
2551360	2555000	like how do you take one area of life into another?
2555000	2558520	Do you think there are kind of core principles
2558520	2560520	to understand when you're,
2560520	2562320	because there's a lot of people also take physics
2562320	2563960	and turned into garbage when they bring it
2563960	2566080	into self-help or whatever.
2566080	2571080	So what's maybe some core ways someone can look at being,
2571520	2574280	taking something that they're expert in or interested in,
2574280	2576480	bringing it into some other area
2576480	2579200	where they're in the beginning an imposter,
2579200	2580320	but they make the jump.
2581280	2584200	So I'll give you a weird example.
2584200	2588400	The neutrino was discovered by noticing
2588400	2592120	that when a neutron is left alone,
2592120	2595600	it sort of morphs into a proton
2595600	2598240	after I don't know, half-life of about 12 minutes
2598240	2599680	or 18 minutes, can't remember.
2601080	2603960	When you look at the electron that gets shot out
2603960	2607520	of this neutrino, if you add up the energy
2607520	2609800	of the proton and the electron,
2609800	2611720	it doesn't have as much energy
2611720	2613640	as the neutron did to begin with.
2613640	2616520	So it would seem to violate conservation of energy.
2616520	2618440	Wolfgang Pauli had this crazy idea.
2618440	2621160	He said, I bet there's a secret particle that we can't see
2621200	2622560	because it's electrically neutral
2622560	2624840	that's carrying away the missing energy
2624840	2627240	and we just don't have any ability to trap it.
2627240	2629040	That was a crazy audacious statement,
2629040	2632960	but it was necessary to save the principle
2632960	2635200	of conservation of energy and momentum.
2635200	2637200	Okay, let me give you a different puzzle.
2638480	2642240	Tower Records on Sunset, where I grew up in LA
2642240	2645440	and it was the record store that I used to learn.
2645440	2647440	It was a music education for me.
2647440	2649440	So it closed at some point.
2649440	2653960	Now, my claim is very often that the invisible world
2653960	2658280	is discovered by the visible world's failure to close.
2658280	2661120	That is, in the neutrino case,
2661120	2666120	there wasn't enough energy in the proton and the electron
2666120	2667560	which are the decay particles
2667560	2669520	that you can see from the neutrino.
2669520	2673160	So something invisible was happening to carry it on.
2673160	2676760	Somebody failed to follow the law.
2676760	2679080	There's some missing force, right?
2679080	2684080	So in the case of Tower Records, what killed Tower Records?
2685040	2687160	I don't know, maybe it was a file sharing network.
2687160	2690040	You couldn't see it, but that file sharing network
2690040	2692640	might have been what took Tower Records down
2692640	2695840	because otherwise it should have been a thriving music store,
2695840	2700600	right, or a bird slamming into a glass pane repeatedly.
2700600	2702160	It knows that if that was just air,
2702160	2703360	it should be able to proceed,
2703360	2705200	but something is causing,
2705200	2708680	like that window is part of the invisible world
2709160	2710480	to the bird.
2710480	2712720	So the fact that I'm trying as a bird
2712720	2715160	to fly in a straight line and not progressing
2715160	2717360	is the visible world's failure to close.
2717360	2719760	So Tower Records, though,
2719760	2722440	could be argued, the internet brought Tower Records.
2722440	2723880	So that would be, the internet would be,
2723880	2725200	if you couldn't see it otherwise,
2725200	2727800	it would be an invisible force
2727800	2731080	which caused Tower Records to go the way of the dot over.
2731080	2732360	So when innovation comes,
2732360	2736240	when you start to see Tower Records sales going down
2736240	2738160	and there's no, and Tower Records has run,
2738160	2742400	let's say, magnificently, there's some missing force,
2742400	2744480	and then you could say, oh, the missing force,
2744480	2746160	if you could figure out the missing force.
2746160	2747320	Where's the neutrino?
2747320	2750520	Yeah, you could start an online business selling CDs,
2750520	2751840	then that's how you could take advantage.
2751840	2754840	So that would be a trick that I would learn from physics
2754840	2756640	that I would try to apply to commerce,
2756640	2760440	which is look for some visible system
2760440	2764160	that is failing to behave normally.
2764160	2765960	Assume that if it isn't behaving normally,
2765960	2768000	there must be some unseen thing
2768000	2770240	to go look in the invisible world
2770240	2772080	for what is causing the visible world
2772080	2773560	to no longer make any sense.
2773560	2775680	So for example, another case of this,
2777080	2778280	might have been on Twitter,
2778280	2780800	where originally all of these people
2780800	2782920	who were very influential were finding each other
2782920	2785280	and amplifying each other's voices
2785280	2788080	as a real challenge to the mainstream media.
2788080	2789520	And at some point, we noticed
2789520	2792080	that we stopped seeing each other's tweets.
2792080	2793720	Like we just didn't see them.
2793720	2798720	And sometime later, this guy, James O'Keefe,
2799400	2801520	who does this undercover stuff,
2801520	2803520	you don't have to love him, you can hate him.
2803520	2807640	But one of the things he recorded was people saying,
2807640	2811680	oh yes, we downrank the bad people on Twitter.
2811680	2813080	Like downranking?
2813080	2814520	What's that?
2814520	2818080	Oh, well, we use the algorithms to sort of suppress,
2818080	2819840	to downregulate their tweets
2819840	2822040	in favor of other people's tweets.
2822040	2824080	And so maybe you discover
2824080	2826160	that somebody's got their finger on the scales
2826160	2828600	because you know what the visible world should do
2828600	2830880	in the absence of somebody tampering
2830880	2832160	with the measurement equipment.
2832160	2835360	So I love this idea of looking for the missing force
2835360	2837080	or using this metaphor.
2838280	2839200	Where's the neutrino?
2839200	2840800	Yeah, where is the neutrino?
2840800	2841640	I love that.
2841640	2844160	So what's something?
2844160	2845000	Do you want another one?
2845000	2847080	Yeah, yeah, I want 10 more.
2847080	2849640	All right, so here's another one.
2849640	2851480	Whenever you have something that you think
2851480	2853640	is just going to be beautiful,
2853640	2855040	and it's a very naive hope,
2856080	2858680	almost always your hope will be dashed
2858680	2859720	because it's too naive.
2860760	2863200	So instead of just getting upset about it,
2863200	2868200	the next thing to do is to measure the failure
2869400	2872640	of your original hope to obtain in the world.
2872640	2874360	Like how badly did it go wrong?
2874360	2876920	How do I measure how badly it's off?
2876920	2878920	And then once you have that,
2878920	2882440	make that new object the centerpiece of a new theory
2882440	2885240	and you'll actually build something much more beautiful
2885240	2886800	than the original theory ever was.
2886800	2889200	So here's a simple example.
2889200	2891600	You're at the equator and you want to go north
2891600	2892920	and you notice that you have a compass
2892920	2895120	and the compass points north.
2895120	2899360	Well, magnetic north is an excellent proxy for true north
2899360	2901400	right up until you get to Canada
2901400	2902880	and then it starts to get lousy.
2902880	2904680	And you know, if you're up on Ellesmere's Island
2904680	2906720	or something way up in the north,
2906720	2909880	you can actually have magnetic north 180 degrees
2909880	2912440	off of true north, yeah?
2912440	2914360	So what is that object?
2914360	2915960	The object that measures that failure
2915960	2918320	is called the angle of declination.
2918320	2920280	So making the angle of declination,
2920280	2924400	the centerpiece of a magnetic navigation
2924400	2925640	is the right thing to do.
2925640	2927320	Or a different one would be,
2929920	2933520	you know, we were just talking about this on Joe Rogan.
2933520	2935480	If you have a normal staircase
2935480	2937160	and you go up one set of stairs
2938480	2940320	and you come down another set of stairs
2940320	2943360	let's say made by the same people at the same heights,
2943360	2945280	you might expect that it's the same number of stairs
2945280	2946400	going up as going down.
2946400	2948880	But in the Escher staircase,
2948880	2950960	if you have that in your mind or the Penrose stairs,
2950960	2953280	you can sort of see that you can keep going up
2953280	2955880	and then you get back to where you started.
2955880	2958080	Well, something is clearly wrong about that.
2958080	2959440	The idea that the number of steps up
2959440	2961760	is the number of steps down fails to be true
2961760	2963160	in that picture.
2963160	2964920	And the thing that measures that failure,
2964920	2967680	like how badly did my naive hope fail
2967680	2969800	might be called the holonomia or the curvature
2969800	2971040	in mathematics.
2971040	2972640	So you make the holonomia or the curvature
2972640	2973960	the centerpiece of your theory.
2973960	2975680	And in fact, in physics,
2975680	2978320	two of our three most important equations,
2978320	2981960	Einstein's equation and the modern version
2981960	2985840	of Maxwell's equations are based on a curvature object,
2985840	2990520	which is measuring this failure of steps to behave
2990520	2992200	in a regular fashion.
2992200	2994760	And the more they go towards the Escher staircase,
2994760	2996480	the more the curvature is intense
2996480	2998920	and that would be perceived by us in some system
2998920	3001600	as greater electromagnetic field strength.
3001600	3004080	So let me try to understand the Escher example
3004080	3005800	because what resulted, of course,
3006680	3009960	in one way of looking at it was Escher's works of art
3009960	3012880	is all based on this idea that you could look at something
3012880	3016160	that looks like it's following the laws of physics,
3016160	3018960	but it's not and that's what creates the beauty of it.
3018960	3022640	So do you think that was part of his creative process?
3022640	3026840	Is like, how can I break this law of nature
3026840	3029920	and create something beautiful as a result?
3029920	3032400	Well, he was playing at many different levels.
3032400	3036040	So for example, the stairs that he creates,
3037000	3039480	are they possible or are they impossible?
3039480	3042520	Well, you can actually create a model
3042520	3043920	and take a photograph of it
3043920	3046600	and it will look exactly like the Escher stairs.
3046600	3050040	So you can actually see the effect with real objects
3050040	3051960	provided the camera is positioned in the right way.
3051960	3053600	Now, does it have the effect that the system
3053600	3055880	is actually closed and it goes around and around?
3055880	3059080	No, but in a system where you actually have curvature,
3059080	3062040	like on a sphere, like normally you think
3062040	3065000	if I turn 90 degrees, walk a distance,
3065000	3067480	turn 90 degrees, walk a distance, same distance,
3067480	3068960	turn 90 degrees, walk the same distance,
3068960	3070080	I'd have to turn 90 degrees
3070080	3072200	and walk the same distance yet again.
3072200	3074880	But if I did it from the north pole to the equator,
3075960	3079200	then I turned 90 degrees and I walked along the equator
3079200	3081200	for about a quarter of its circumference
3081320	3085000	and I turned 90 degrees again and walked the same distance,
3085000	3086560	I'd be back at the north pole
3086560	3088000	and instead of having done a square,
3088000	3090840	I would have done a triangle, right?
3090840	3093000	So because of the curvature of the earth,
3093000	3096840	that naive rule about needing to turn four separate times
3096840	3099040	to get back to where you started is not true.
3099040	3101880	You only have to turn three separate times.
3101880	3104760	Now, in part what Escher was really doing
3104760	3108520	was playing with the curvature of a curve system,
3108520	3112480	the optical illusion in a flat system.
3112480	3115320	There was a lot going on in that example.
3115320	3120320	And so it's both an illustration of a real phenomena
3120800	3122760	that we see in electromagnetism.
3122760	3126920	It's an optical illusion, it's an invitation to curvature,
3126920	3128880	it's presenting curvature in a flat world.
3128880	3130680	There's so much happening there
3130680	3132360	that it's not easy to pull apart
3132360	3134400	and that's why it was fascinating as a subject.
3134400	3138320	And I think Escher was very knowledgeable about mathematics
3138320	3142160	and what he did was he used it as a source,
3142160	3145600	but he combined enough of our world and our imagination
3145600	3147880	that he really excited the human spirit.
3147880	3149560	He took something that was very austere
3149560	3154560	and perhaps forbidding and he made it warm and inviting.
3154880	3159720	So let's say I'm trying to figure out different ways
3159720	3162640	to make this functional.
3162640	3165360	Let's say, you mentioned earlier,
3165360	3166520	a lot of people create something
3166520	3167640	that they think is beautiful
3167640	3168760	and they're usually wrong.
3168760	3172760	So for instance, anybody who begins the process of writing
3172760	3174640	and they've never written before,
3174640	3177320	there's a certain arrogance that they think,
3177320	3179440	but they have to have this arrogance to write the book,
3179440	3180680	their very first book.
3180680	3182280	There's certain arrogance to think,
3182280	3184440	oh, I'm gonna write a book and it's gonna be great.
3184440	3185560	Because it's the first time they're writing it
3185560	3188120	and other people have written for far longer
3188120	3190800	and learned different skills and so on.
3190800	3195800	But how could someone beginning any skill acquisition
3196040	3197480	and let's just pick out writing,
3197480	3202480	use this idea of this neutrino metaphor
3202720	3205560	to kind of push the envelope a little bit
3205560	3206400	to measure where the value is.
3206400	3208800	Well, I don't know, it's a great improv challenge,
3208800	3210120	but let me try to accept it.
3210120	3212440	Let's take J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter.
3212440	3213280	Okay.
3213280	3214360	She wrote a book for the very first time
3214360	3216080	and it was the biggest hit ever.
3216080	3217360	Right.
3217360	3221220	So what was the missing neutrino that she sort of found?
3222400	3223560	Well, I don't think that that,
3223560	3226880	where was the naive hope that was dashed?
3226880	3229560	Well, she did write a book that her,
3229560	3232320	the first 20 or so publishers rejected.
3232320	3235280	So nobody thought it was good and...
3235280	3236280	Well, that's a different thing.
3236280	3237120	Yeah.
3237120	3239960	That has to do with anything truly new
3239960	3241520	will be compared to the old.
3241520	3242560	And if it's new enough,
3242560	3245520	it will always be found wanting by the standards of the old.
3245520	3249680	So this is the same problem with Bohemian Rhapsody.
3249680	3251000	It's like what we're gonna do
3251000	3253480	with like a seven minute fake opera song
3253480	3255840	to be played on rock radio stations.
3255840	3259040	Obviously it's either the dumbest idea of all time
3259040	3262000	or it's the greatest idea in rock and roll, right?
3262000	3265520	And so something new being rejected,
3265520	3266600	I don't think fits this,
3266600	3269740	but let me accept your gambit of the writer.
3269740	3270580	Okay.
3270580	3272240	So imagine that you say,
3272240	3274360	oh, I'm a genius writer.
3274360	3275680	I'm just gonna sit down
3275680	3277680	and the brilliance is gonna come
3277680	3281000	and first draft is always amazing.
3281000	3281920	Okay.
3281920	3285820	So you write your short story to a two pager, right?
3285820	3288860	And then you show it to your friend as a professional.
3288860	3290700	And your friend takes one look at it and says,
3290700	3292660	look, you're bloated over here.
3292660	3293780	You're anemic over here.
3293780	3295260	Let me do some stuff.
3295260	3297900	And she fixes it before she sends you back
3297900	3299420	and you do 18 revisions.
3300660	3303700	Now, the object that would be the thing
3303700	3306980	that measures the difference between your naive hope
3306980	3309580	and the reality that seems to be true
3309580	3312220	would be the diff file.
3312260	3316660	How much did the file change between the first offer
3316660	3319380	and the final product that everybody agrees to be good?
3319380	3322620	Well, you might notice that if you define the diff file
3322620	3324340	for each project,
3324340	3326980	that you always start off using the same crappy,
3326980	3330500	flabby words or lots of wiggle words
3330500	3333620	or way too poetic or way too anemic.
3333620	3334780	Who knows?
3334780	3336820	Once you start noticing what it is
3336820	3339180	that you always do at first,
3339180	3340140	you can then say,
3340420	3342980	I'm gonna try to write around my diff file,
3342980	3346500	which is I always use the word thoroughly too much
3346500	3347740	or basically,
3347740	3349700	that you notice how often people use the word
3349700	3351500	basically in their speech.
3351500	3355980	So, a public speaker might look at all of their ticks
3355980	3357980	and then say, I'm gonna create a file,
3357980	3362020	an audio file that just looks at all of my verbal ticks.
3363460	3365460	Once you start focusing just on your ticks,
3365460	3366780	you have something to minimize.
3366780	3369580	You could put it into an objective function.
3369580	3370740	Okay, and so...
3370740	3372620	So, that would be an example of,
3372620	3376340	I naively think I'm a genius at everything that I say
3376340	3378740	or write is instantly brilliant.
3378740	3379980	You notice that that's not true.
3379980	3384100	Then you figure out how things revise over time
3384100	3385420	as you go through that cycle.
3385420	3386740	Then you start studying the object
3386740	3388100	that measures the revisions.
3388100	3389900	And then you try to minimize that object
3389900	3391540	so you become a better writer from the get go.
3391540	3394180	And so, in your case with the writer,
3395540	3397020	and you've addressed this before,
3397020	3401180	the idea of somebody who is self-taught
3401180	3405140	than having something to be able to teach.
3405140	3407220	But in your example of the writer,
3407220	3408780	he still had to go to it,
3408780	3410500	or she had to go to an expert
3410500	3414580	who helped create that diff file for the first time.
3414580	3416980	Do you think that's necessary to find,
3416980	3417940	so this is deliberate practice?
3417940	3419180	You need feedback loops.
3419180	3421220	Sometimes you could manage your own.
3421220	3425900	And sometimes you need somebody to be on you
3425900	3429540	and to point out that you're actually avoiding
3429540	3432620	the negative in the feedback that you're getting
3432620	3435340	or that you're misinterpreting the positive.
3435340	3437500	And so, the other question is,
3437500	3440540	is that then is that person who's getting the feedback
3440540	3443260	just forcing you into conformity?
3443260	3444420	And so, okay, you know, this person's saying,
3444420	3446620	you know, you use basically too much.
3446620	3447900	Real writers don't do that.
3447900	3449460	And now you're moving back into conformity.
3449460	3451860	Well, hopefully the person is pushing you back
3451860	3454300	into conformity where you need conformity
3454380	3457660	and pushing you into brilliance where your edge is.
3457660	3461060	But the idea that you should either be brilliant
3461060	3464580	and different in everything that you do or not
3464580	3465580	is preposterous.
3465580	3467780	So, you know, I often give people the advice
3467780	3470020	that if their ideas are truly radical,
3470020	3472300	they should dress very conservatively.
3472300	3473140	Why?
3473140	3475820	Because, you know, you can't afford to turn everything
3475820	3478260	up to 11 without distracting the hell out
3478260	3480180	of whoever you're trying to reach.
3480660	3482420	That reminds me of,
3482420	3484540	did you ever see the Eric Andre show?
3484540	3485380	No.
3485380	3486940	Okay, so it's basically,
3486940	3489660	the premise is it's a late night talk show
3489660	3491940	in a bodega, in the back of a bodega.
3491940	3496060	And, but it's a spoof, but nobody knows it's a spoof.
3496060	3497420	So, celebrities have gone on this show
3497420	3499580	not knowing that Eric Andre is just gonna do
3499580	3502500	something completely insane that's gonna freak them out.
3502500	3505220	And what's fascinating is every component
3505220	3507460	of a late night show is in the format.
3507460	3510020	So, he's got a band, he's got a sidekick,
3510020	3512180	he's got a desk, he's got notes,
3512180	3514060	he's reading off the notes like David Letterman.
3514060	3516220	It looks exactly like the format of the David Letterman
3516220	3518740	or Johnny Carson show, but he changes this one thing
3518740	3522940	in that he's gonna make fun of the guest in some way.
3522940	3526900	And so, to what you were saying,
3526900	3529460	keep the format, change one thing,
3529460	3531340	and now you could have brilliance.
3531340	3533580	Sometimes it's one thing, sometimes it's several things.
3533580	3534980	If it's several things though,
3534980	3537220	it might be so far from the original.
3537220	3539100	Like, let's take the matrix.
3539100	3542540	So, the matrix when it first came out was very fresh.
3542540	3543700	What did it do?
3543700	3546380	Well, first of all, it used CGI at some level
3546380	3548020	that we hadn't seen before.
3548020	3550900	So, it was computer generated in the extreme for its time.
3550900	3555220	It used Hong Kong wire work on non-Chinese,
3555220	3557340	non-Asian actors.
3557340	3559980	It used the bullet time system of using a bunch
3559980	3564980	of still cameras arrayed in like a semi-circle
3565740	3569860	to give a movie sense of like a flip book
3569860	3571780	as you were going around the subject
3571780	3573140	of somebody who's in mid-air.
3573140	3575260	So, just take like those three things.
3575260	3579120	Those things were all so different from each other
3579120	3582580	that you could never tell what was happening exactly.
3582580	3585240	Was it some new photographic innovation?
3585240	3587780	Was it an acrobatic innovation?
3587780	3590100	Was it a computer innovation?
3590100	3594780	Other than that, the storyline was very much
3594780	3597780	in a kind of a revealed narrative arc heroes journey story.
3597780	3598620	Right.
3598620	3602500	So, I would say that was the exact heroes journey
3602500	3603660	and they changed one thing,
3603660	3605860	which is technically how we make the movie.
3605860	3607020	But what I'm trying to say is that one thing
3607020	3608180	had multiple components.
3608180	3610020	So, then I just gave you three.
3610020	3611660	In other words, it's not the case
3611660	3613380	that you can only choose one thing,
3613380	3616340	but you have to have it be balanced
3616340	3618260	between that which people expect
3618260	3620420	and that which confounds.
3620420	3622940	And I think I remember reading Leonard Feather,
3622940	3627940	the jazz writer, talking about studies that were done
3628380	3630660	that said that in improvisation,
3630660	3632740	the audience is always making a guess
3632740	3634820	as to what's about to happen next.
3634820	3637420	His claim was that if the audience guesses right
3637420	3640620	about half the time, they find it fascinating.
3640620	3642900	If they guess right all the time, they find it boring.
3642900	3644900	And if they guess right none of the time,
3644900	3647340	they think it's modern jazz and they couldn't care less.
3647340	3649300	Right, so you have to keep some of the structure.
3649300	3653220	So, Tower Records had to keep some of their structure.
3653220	3656660	They had to say, okay, we still sell music,
3656660	3657860	but now we're gonna do it online.
3657860	3658700	That was the missing-
3658700	3661180	Well, IBM would be a good example of something
3661180	3665940	that morphed over time to continue
3665940	3668260	to be a major player in tech,
3668260	3671580	whereas lots of other tech firms couldn't figure out
3671580	3673260	how to morph and change.
3673260	3674580	You know, what is the abstraction
3674580	3677940	of your former business in today's terms?
3677940	3681140	So, this idea of a missing force,
3681140	3683900	and of course you can't, on the surface,
3683900	3685460	the whole concept of this is missing,
3685460	3687460	you can't see it's a missing force.
3687460	3689860	Where else do you see this in entrepreneurship?
3689860	3692740	Where have you seen it successfully played out?
3692740	3694660	Well, very often, if you can notice
3694660	3699260	that there is a missing need
3699260	3701260	that people hadn't really.
3702380	3703540	And that's like an insight.
3703540	3704660	So, like Steve Jobs saying,
3704660	3707980	every home is gonna have a micro-computer.
3707980	3711060	You know, the missing force and computing for him
3711060	3713420	was why can't I have it all the time?
3713420	3715260	Or maybe the idea is that,
3716380	3718620	hey, I've also noticed that not only do I know
3718620	3721340	that there's going to be a computer everywhere,
3721340	3725140	but that it's going to be so integrated into your life
3725140	3727300	that the design feature of this,
3727300	3730300	that tech people never get right,
3730300	3732100	is my chance to add value.
3732100	3734540	And I'm gonna bring elegance
3734540	3737860	and canonical aspects of design
3737860	3740380	to something that has to be integrated
3740380	3742500	into the very fabric of your being.
3742500	3744780	So we welcomed Apple in in part
3744780	3747140	because it flattered our sense of ourselves
3747140	3749940	that we are elegant, we are spare, we are courageous.
3749940	3752260	We think different as they told us.
3752260	3754780	And still to this day, like kids get the iPhone
3754780	3757260	because culturally that look,
3757260	3759460	that's the coolest phone to get.
3759460	3764340	Although in post Tim Cook's chillings
3764340	3768820	or welly in speech about things having no home
3768820	3772060	on his platform, my God,
3773980	3777100	how many of the people that Apple has held up to us
3777100	3778700	when they told us to think different
3778700	3783700	would be reviled right now as being hateful to somebody?
3784580	3785500	I just don't know.
3785500	3790500	No, and it's scary when you're not a Tim Cook,
3790500	3793140	when you're not an Apple, when you're just yourself,
3793140	3796860	it's scary going up against the monster
3796860	3801180	of kind of this conformist group think somehow.
3801180	3803940	And I'll get to that in a second,
3803940	3808660	but I'm still very interested in this skill acquisition aspect.
3808660	3813020	What kind of core, you always talk about core principles
3813020	3816220	or first principles, what sort of first principles
3816220	3819060	or basics do you think someone needs
3819060	3824060	to develop that muscle of looking for the missing force,
3824780	3825660	the neutrino.
3825660	3827860	So obviously Wolfgang Pauley,
3827860	3829180	he had a background in physics.
3829180	3830820	He was able to kind of say,
3830820	3834860	huh, it didn't follow this law, something has to be there.
3834860	3837820	And Tower Records, they didn't have that.
3837820	3840740	Sales are declining, we're running the company great.
3840740	3842900	Sales should be going up before running the company great
3842900	3844540	and people are listening to music.
3844540	3847540	See, they somehow they missed the missing force.
3847540	3848500	Sure.
3848500	3849820	I mean, I think the one thing you could do
3849820	3854620	is you can just say, make a note to yourself.
3854620	3856940	I'm about to have a conversation with Jane.
3856940	3857940	I wonder what's gonna happen.
3857940	3859340	I think it's gonna go well.
3860340	3861940	And you have a conversation with Jane
3861940	3863900	and it ends up with Jane yelling at you,
3863900	3865380	get out of my office.
3865380	3869220	Okay, well, is that something that typically happens
3869220	3870980	that you think you're gonna go into a conversation
3870980	3872420	and you think it's gonna go great
3872420	3874340	and somebody gets really angry at you?
3875340	3878940	You could find somebody who repeats the same error
3878940	3882700	over and over again and never gets metacognitive or curious.
3882700	3886220	So one thing I would say is before you start trying
3886220	3890180	to do anything new, if you find that you're frustrated
3890180	3892980	in your life and that you can't get past certain objects
3892980	3896700	or obstacles, just learn how to do this thing
3896700	3898740	I call watching your robot.
3898740	3900500	So most of what gets you through a day,
3900500	3901660	you're not even thinking about it.
3901660	3904340	You don't think about how to put one foot in front
3904340	3906300	of the other because you learned to walk ages ago.
3906300	3909900	As you learn all of these things, they become automated.
3909900	3913260	So a really interesting activity is to just watch
3913260	3916380	your body and your brain make mistakes.
3916380	3919580	Like for example, I ordered a burger for lunch
3919580	3921860	and it came with fries and I said to myself,
3921860	3923860	they always give me fries and I always eat them
3923860	3925780	and I always regret it.
3925780	3928100	And then I watched myself eat the fries
3928100	3930060	after having that thought.
3930060	3932580	And instead of trying to get myself not to eat the fries,
3932580	3936100	I said, I'm just gonna watch myself being an idiot.
3936100	3938300	Isn't it interesting that my robot is just
3938300	3940420	in an automated mode making a decision
3940420	3942900	that I've decided to do the opposite of
3942900	3944580	and my robot is winning?
3944580	3947740	Well, that doesn't sound very encouraging at the beginning
3947740	3950500	but I guarantee you three times of having
3950500	3952380	that conversation with myself,
3952380	3955020	eventually I can't stand to watch my robot
3955020	3956700	take over the ship anymore.
3956700	3958240	So it seems like you're saying,
3959500	3962100	have a mental model, given a situation
3962100	3964140	and maybe it's a high-stakes situation.
3964140	3966060	Like you're gonna write a book or run a business
3966060	3969380	or run a particle accelerator and see what happens.
3969380	3971220	So given a high-stakes situation,
3971220	3972900	build a mental model beforehand
3972900	3974340	of what you think should happen.
3974340	3976620	Let's say you're going in to have a discussion
3976620	3979020	with your boss or your girlfriend or whatever.
3979020	3981180	See what happens if there's a difference
3981180	3984940	and if there's a difference and view that difference
3984940	3988820	as kind of a robot that you're observing from higher
3988820	3991460	and then you see that difference enough
3991460	3994740	and you're feeling bad about it,
3994740	3997140	the solution maybe is some innovation
3997140	3998780	or some beautiful solution.
3998780	4001460	Or just getting control of the situation.
4001460	4005020	Don't start off with the big meeting
4005020	4007580	or the big project or the big deal
4007580	4010780	because usually mostly what we're doing wrong is fractal
4010780	4014300	and if you're blowing big deals,
4014300	4017580	you're probably blowing little transactions,
4017580	4019900	buying a candy bar at the bodega.
4019900	4022580	You're probably screwing that up too at some level.
4022580	4025060	And maybe you're too friendly,
4025060	4026900	maybe you're not friendly enough, I don't know.
4026900	4030660	But definitely find the cheapest places to practice
4030660	4033020	because there's no sense learning
4033020	4035540	in the highest stakes environment possible.
4035540	4038940	So let's take this to you coining the phrase
4038940	4040460	the intellectual dark web.
4040460	4043700	You felt free to express opinions
4043740	4046700	among the select group of friends and colleagues.
4046700	4049780	You chose to be around you on a daily basis.
4049780	4051980	You feel comfortable saying what you think
4051980	4054900	because they don't slander you for it
4054900	4056140	or ruin your career for it.
4056140	4058260	I don't feel comfortable saying what I think.
4058260	4059340	I just can't stop.
4060540	4065460	The World of Technology
4073700	4075020	It's storming every industry
4075020	4077780	and literally billions of dollars are being invested.
4077780	4079140	So buckle up.
4079140	4081540	The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed
4081540	4082500	and processing power.
4082500	4086220	So how do you compete without cost spiraling out of control?
4086220	4089260	It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud,
4089260	4092300	Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI.
4092300	4095060	OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure,
4095060	4098340	database, application development and AI needs.
4098340	4101580	OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds,
4101580	4103180	offers one consistent price
4103180	4105220	instead of variable regional pricing.
4105220	4108100	And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.
4108100	4111020	So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed
4111020	4113500	and less than half the cost of other clouds.
4113500	4116220	If you want to do more and spend less like Uber,
4116220	4118300	eight by eight and Databricks Mosaic,
4118300	4122580	take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash advance.
4122580	4125100	That's oracle.com slash advance.
4125100	4127300	Oracle.com slash advance.
