161920	168960	Oh my gosh, I've been wanting to have this guy on my podcast for literally 10 years ever since I
168960	177280	started this podcast. I am so impressed with him and he speaks about a subject near and dear to my
177280	185520	heart. So Salman Khan, Sal Khan is the creator of the Khan Academy, which was really the first big
186160	194000	online academy. It was to learn math, coding, all these things. And there was generating people who
194000	200080	really learned the topics as opposed to people who go all through 10 years of school and never
200080	205520	learned these topics at all or the schools failed to teach them appropriately. The Khan Academy
205520	210640	really seemed to understand education and it became this huge thing. 150 million students have gone
210640	217520	through the Khan Academy or use it every month or that number of registered users. Salman Khan,
217600	225040	Sal Khan, and he just wrote the book about how AI will revolutionize education. The book is called
225040	232880	Brave New Words. How AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. And he addresses
232880	238880	how to use AI with education, whether you're a student, teacher, employer. It was so valuable in
238880	244880	terms of understanding not only education, but AI and how we can use AI on our lives. And it
244880	251200	addresses all the fears people are having right now about AI and its role in creativity and learning
251200	256720	and will it replace jobs or will it make it easier to get a job. So Brave New Words,
256720	262000	how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. I finally got to interview
262000	268080	Sal Khan about the Khan Academy and AI and I learned so much and I hope you will as well.
275280	294320	Sal, can I start off by asking you a question that is peripherally related to the book, but you do
294320	300240	mention this towards the end of the book, which is there was one line that I was curious about
300240	305760	and it was like a personal thing, but you brought it up in the book. Sure. So you mentioned that you
305760	310560	thought your dad, who you didn't really know, you met him. He left early, your parents separated
310560	318080	when you were very young and you only met him once. He passed away when you were around 14 years old,
318080	323120	but you said he probably suffered from depression and I was curious why you thought that.
323840	333200	You know, I don't have, no one told me that, so I don't have any strong, well, the evidence is
334160	341840	he kind of disappeared and when, the one time I met him when he was, when I was 13,
343200	352720	we briefly went to his place and let's just say it looked like he was down and then it seems to fit
352800	359040	with a lot of the narrative of what we've observed from my end.
359600	362160	What were the circumstances of the visit? Like why did you visit him?
362880	372240	You know, I was 13 years old. I don't remember. If I remember correctly, he had, I guess, a cousin
372240	377440	of mine who I don't know, my father's side of the family that well, a nephew of his, who really
377440	384880	wanted to put him in touch with us again and I forgot all the context. I think we were up in,
384880	391280	he was living in Philadelphia at the time, so we were up in that area anyway and so this cousin,
391280	396720	older cousin than me, you know, probably 20 years older than me, facilitated this, you know, us to
396720	400640	get together and to me and my sister and then we, you know, we spent an evening together.
401520	405760	Well, I was just curious about that particularly since you brought it up in the book, but
406640	412480	look, I've been incredibly impressed with everything you've done. The Khan Academy,
413440	419280	you know, 155 million users, you know, so many people have learned from
420320	427040	the videos on the Khan Academy, the educational style of the Khan Academy and I know people know
427040	432400	the story and it's not central to the book also, but maybe, you know, if you could spend a few
432400	437120	minutes describing how you started this, like it started, apparently, you were, you were tutoring
438000	442800	one of your cousins, Nadia, about math and then other cousins knew, hey,
442800	449520	Sol's available for some free tutoring. We'd, you know, we want to, we want to help and so you
449520	456560	started creating tools and technology and videos and this grew into the Khan Academy.
457200	463120	Yeah, that's generally right. It was back in 2004. I, my original background is technology.
463120	467760	By 2004, I'd gone to business school. I was a year out. I was now working as an analyst at a hedge
467760	474480	fund. I had just gotten married in New Jersey and I was living in Boston and my family from New
474480	478640	Orleans, which is where I was born and raised, were up visiting in the Northeast and they came to,
479280	484320	some of them came to Boston for the July 4th weekend. This was 2004 and just came out of
484320	488800	conversation that my cousin Nadia was having trouble in math. Her mom told me, my aunt,
488800	493680	and that's when I offered to, when I learned more about what was going on with Nadia,
493680	500480	I offered to tutor her and Nadia agreed. And as you mentioned, well, first of all, that tutoring
500480	504960	seemed to work with her. She was struggling with unit conversion, got her caught up even ahead
504960	509120	of her class. And, you know, I joke sometimes I became a tiger cousin at that point. I call up
509120	513840	her school, they let her retake placement exams. It really helped her. Then I started
513840	517760	tutoring her brothers, words, friends, and my family on the free tutoring, as you mentioned. And
517760	524240	before I know it, 10, 15 cousins, family, friends. And I've always been interested in education. So
524240	531280	this wasn't a complete fluke that I was doing this. I'd done tutoring in other times in my life.
531280	537840	And I have always, I had always dreamt of one day starting a school of some kind. So I was always
537840	543120	interested by the problem and I thought I could help my cousins. And I was always interested in
543120	547840	the intersection of, well, if you can solve a problem, can you use technology to help you scale
547840	553280	any solutions that you had? So that was always in the back of my mind a bit. But in 2005,
554080	558800	with that in mind, I did start to make some practice software for these cousins. That was
558800	564720	the first Khan Academy had no videos or anything like that. But it was just to help scale a solution
564720	568400	to a pattern I was seeing. A lot of my cousins just had gaps in their knowledge. They needed more
568400	573760	practice. I as their tutor wanted to make sure that they were getting that practice and I wanted
573760	577920	to monitor it. So that's, that's why I wrote that software. And once again, just as a hobby.
577920	583760	And then in 2006, a friend suggested that I help scale my lessons with videos.
583760	589600	I thought it was, I legitimately thought it was a silly thing to do. I thought it was very low tech.
589600	594240	I thought YouTube was kind of a place for entertainment, not a place for learning.
595120	600480	But I gave that a shot and my cousins famously told me they liked me better on YouTube than in
600480	606240	person. And what they were saying was they liked the pause, the repeat, always accessible, no
606240	610880	embarrassment if they had to review something from before. And so I kept going. And that was
610880	614720	obviously very discoverable by a lot of people as well. So I just kept working on that software
614720	621280	and kept working on those, those, those videos by 2008, 2009. That's where my brain was focusing
621280	626560	most of the time. And so my wife and I looked at our finances. We had some money saved up for a
626560	630240	down payment on a house. At this point, we had moved out to Northern California. But
631360	635440	you know, we felt like this, there's something happening here. There was about 50 to 100,000
635440	642640	folks using the nascent Khan Academy on a monthly basis. And there were some philanthropists that
642640	647520	were, there were actually both venture capitalists and philanthropists who are already signaling
647520	652000	that they were interested. In fact, the venture capitalists were more interested back then.
652640	656720	But it felt important that this would be a nonprofit organization, set it up mission
656720	663280	free world-class education for anyone anywhere. And yeah, 2009, I took the plunge to try to get that
663280	669840	philanthropic support to become a real organization. It was a tough year to be very clear, probably the
669840	674080	most stressful year of my life. Our first child had been born and I'd given up a good career.
674080	679120	But by 2010, we had our first real support. And you know, everything we've been doing since then
679120	684320	has really been that same pattern. How do we scale up that same personalization, that same
684320	689360	student-centered learning that you could do when it was just myself working with Nadia. And, you
689360	694160	know, most of our history has been improving on the software, creating more and more content,
694880	700320	exercises, videos, articles, teacher tools, working with school districts. And obviously,
700320	703440	more recently, it's been leveraging artificial intelligence on top of that.
704320	710320	Right. So your new book, Brave New Words, how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a
710320	717520	good thing. It's a really interesting book because on the one hand, your book is what the title says,
717520	723760	how AI will revolutionize education and you talk about developments in AI, developments that you've
723760	729840	contributed to AI. You were an early user tester and so on of all the versions of
729840	739840	ChatGPT. But the book is also, it almost could be titled, What Everyone is Afraid of in AI
739840	747280	and How We Can Solve Each Fear. And I noticed that is the flip side of AI. I was at a dinner
747280	752640	recently where there was a bunch of academics and journalists and scientists. It was all in the
752640	759200	science domain. And every single one of these scientists or writers of science were really
759200	766720	afraid of AI. They thought AI was dangerous. There was no positive thing said about AI except
766720	773280	when I pointed this out to all of them. Why do you think so many people are afraid of AI? And then
773280	775760	I want to hit how you address some of these things in the book.
778400	786160	I think AI is, it's interesting because it's especially, it's especially threatening to folks
786240	793120	who have always defined their identity by their ability to write and speak and think original
793120	799440	thoughts. So it's not a coincidence that the intelligentsia, so to speak, are the ones that
799440	806240	are probably most concerned about this. And it's not to mean that these aren't legitimate concerns
806240	812720	or a lot of them aren't legitimate concerns. But I think it is affecting folks with education,
812720	821920	folks who write. It gets awfully close to home in terms of identity. And so I think it immediately
822560	826800	puts people into a little bit of a defensive posture and a little bit of a fear-based posture.
827440	832240	And once again, I can't completely predict the future. We even saw that when we first got access
832240	837600	to the technology before the rest of the world did. And I would say half of our team was really
837600	842960	excited about it and want to go all in. And the other half had a lot of this trepidation. And
844000	847680	to your point, maybe your title of the book would have been a better one because you're
847680	854480	right. It really is this pattern that I probably have always tried to lean in this way, but it's
854480	859840	definitely accelerated with AI, which is, all right, we should write down fears. One should not
859840	865280	ignore fears and risks. But fears and risks are not reasons to not try to move forward and make
865280	873920	positive use of it. There are things to address and to deal with so that you can have a positive
873920	880400	outcome. Yeah, I mean, obviously the very first thing that comes up when you talk about AI and
880400	886480	education, and I have all my kids are basically college age or graduate school age. The first
886480	894880	thing that comes up is cheating. And I'll give a just transparent experience
895360	902480	one daughter was in the final stages of her finals on the year. And she had like one day
902480	907920	to write an essay. And she hadn't even read the text she was supposed to be writing the essay
907920	916080	about. And I said, look, there's this thing called chat GPT, just cheat and get it done and graduate.
916080	921120	Just do it. And I don't know if she followed my advice or not, but that was my advice because I
921520	925680	for me it was more important for her to graduate than for her to learn this one thing.
926240	933120	But that is a big concern of teachers and parents and everything because a lot of people don't
933120	937040	care about their education or they don't think that their college or high school or whatever is
937040	943840	giving them a good education. So they're willing to use it to cheat. Yeah, it's a real thing. And
944400	948320	you know, what I write about in the book is I always like to start from first principles,
948320	952720	like, okay, you know, what was the state of things even before chat GPT came on to the scene?
952720	958000	And it didn't take long to realize that cheating was already pretty rampant. And if anything,
958000	963200	there does seem to have been a cultural shift even since you or I were in college in terms of
963200	969040	probably more acceptance of cheating than ever before. And once again, before AI existed,
969040	975760	probably the internet software tools, their services that are happy to write essays for you
975760	980720	or do other types of problem sets for you, their quasi legitimate publicly traded companies that
980720	985600	will help you do your homework and help is I'm saying it very euphemistically, they'll essentially
985600	994400	do your homework for you. So this existed well before. And so I think the question is, in this
994400	1002240	world, what are we hoping to get out of students when they do these types of tasks? And if part
1002320	1006160	of it is to make sure that it is their work. And in the book, I talk about, look, there's
1006160	1010960	certain cases where you probably want students to use the tools. In fact, these tools are going
1010960	1014960	to be part of their future. But there are certain cases where you definitely want to make sure that
1014960	1020960	it's the students own work, how you can, how you can address it. And you know, the AI actually
1020960	1026240	isn't, it can be part of the problem, obviously, with things like chat GPT. But in a lot of ways,
1026240	1031120	I'm optimistic that it can be, it can be a very big part of the solution that addresses not just AI
1031120	1036640	cheating, but cheating in general, where students won't have the work done by the AI, but the AI
1036640	1042800	can be their coach, an ethical tutor, ethical writing coach, and then it can make transparent
1042800	1048560	the process to the teacher. So the teacher doesn't just get the essay, they get the whole transcript
1048560	1052000	of how the student worked on it and the AI's analysis that it's similar to the student's
1052000	1056400	other writing or that they worked on it for four hours or they had trouble with the thesis statement
1056400	1061920	initially, but eventually got there and be able to give the teacher insights across the whole
1061920	1065920	classroom that, look, 15 of your kids are having trouble with thesis statements. Here's a lesson
1065920	1070560	plan that you might want to go on, go and do. So I'm optimistic on that front.
1075440	1080080	Take a quick break. If you like this episode, I really, really appreciate it. It means so much

1102960	1108240	staying in Airbnb's. Like in about a month, I'm going to Cocoa Beach, which is right next to Cape
1108240	1112880	Canaveral. I'm going to watch some rocket launches. I'm going to, of course, be staying in a very nice
1112880	1119600	Airbnb on the beach. And it's just such a great experience. Like the whole world is available
1119600	1129040	to us now because of Airbnb. But whenever I'm at an Airbnb, I always realize, you know, the home
1129040	1136160	that I left to come to this Airbnb, I could be making money on that right now by hosting and
1136160	1142640	being an Airbnb myself. So, and I've known people, I had a friend who basically,
1143440	1149680	you know, made a living from turning his home into an Airbnb. So if you have a home, but you're not
1149680	1155440	always at home, you do have an Airbnb there. And it can easily fit into your lifestyle,
1155440	1161920	and it's a great way to earn some money. Your home might be worth more than you think.

1173280	1179040	The famous Abraham Lincoln quote says, good things come to those who wait. I wonder,
1179040	1181520	did he really say it? Jay, did he really say that? Can you look that up?
1182240	1185840	Regardless of who said it, that's only part of the quote. The full quote is,
1185840	1190480	good things come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.
1191120	1196560	Well, if you're a business owner and want the best people on your team, the same applies.

1273280	1285840	James zip recruiter, the smartest way to hire. Right. So, and this isn't in general,
1285840	1291920	like a theme that runs throughout is that viewing AI or, or, or chat GPT like programs
1291920	1300160	as a collaborator or a partner rather than as a secret weapon is kind of the basic solution to
1300160	1307280	all of these fears. So, so for instance, teaching doesn't go away. But hey, if just like with the
1307280	1311680	kind of kind of people were able to watch the video. So now the T and learn basic math lessons.
1311680	1316960	So now the teachers can focus on more more discussions and interesting topics in the
1316960	1323280	classroom itself. So, so for instance, if you, if the teacher knows the student is using chat GPT
1323920	1329600	to answer questions about the great Gatsby, that might actually be a benefit to the educational
1329600	1334960	experience. Yes and no. I think the key is that everyone is going into it with eyes wide open
1334960	1338240	that the teachers and the educators know why they're asking students to do things.
1338880	1344480	They're very clear about certain tasks where it will be pedagogically valuable to use
1344560	1349200	the chat GPTs of the world and other things where you don't want to use them. But I want to be
1349200	1356400	very clear about use. There is the use of say a general AI platform like chat GPT that would be,
1356400	1362480	you know, that it could be used to do very productive things like do research, help understand a
1362480	1368240	concept. But those also could be used to write your essay for you or do things that a lot of
1368240	1372240	educators would find, hey, that's probably undermining what I was trying to get out of this.
1372240	1377040	There's other use cases of generative AI and this is where ConMigo, which right now is built
1377040	1383680	primarily on GPT-4, but it's a different application than chat GPT. But that's built explicitly to
1383680	1389280	support students and teachers in a, in a education framework. So it won't cheat, but it will
1389280	1394480	socratically work with the students. The bottom line is, I think we're entering this phase where
1395360	1399600	educators have to be more explicit about why they're giving certain tasks and
1400400	1405280	also explicit on the types of tools that are acceptable and aren't, probably with some
1406320	1411040	light oversight, potentially AI empowered oversight of what the students are doing.
1411040	1416080	And it's going to be more and more on the students also to be very clear of like, hey,
1416080	1418960	this is not something that I should do and this is something I should do, but also know
1418960	1423200	that they're going to be held accountable by it, that there are, that ConMigo, what we're doing
1423280	1429840	at Khan Academy, there are tools now to monitor what the student is doing, make sure it is their
1429840	1435520	own work, when the teacher wants to make sure that it's the students own work. Although it seems
1435520	1443680	like every time there's an attempt to, oh, this is definitely created by AI, humans are smarter
1443680	1448160	in this sense. They're always going to develop ways to override whatever tools are being used to
1448160	1454560	detect AI usage and homework. Yeah. Anyone who tells you that they have some type of an algorithm
1454560	1460640	or watermarking technology or statistical algorithm, whatever it might be that can detect AI generated
1460640	1471040	work is either significantly exaggerating or lying to you. There have been plagiarism detectors,
1471040	1478400	but for the most part, what AI is generating is novel, is novel text. So it's very hard to detect.
1478400	1483600	Now, the way that some teachers have detected it, just with their spider senses, they have seen
1484320	1489440	work that just seems different than what the student has turned in before, or it just seems
1489440	1495920	surprisingly cogent, or maybe a little bit bland compared to what a typical people would write.
1495920	1500320	Now, even those cases is usually because the student didn't use the AI artfully enough.
1500880	1505440	That if they really tweaked it a little bit, tweaked their prompts, maybe adapted some of
1505440	1508800	what the AI was writing to make it a little bit more personal, it would have been very hard to
1508800	1516000	detect. So our strategy here isn't to try to magically just read a paper and say this was
1516000	1522720	written by an AI or human or 5050 or some other percentage in between. It's to make the process
1522720	1531120	transparent to the educator. So with Conmigo, we aren't saying, oh, we ran some algorithm and
1531120	1536720	there's an 80% chance this is AI written. Instead, we tell the teacher, here's the transcript of the
1536720	1543600	student working with our AI, working with Conmigo on their essay. It took them four hours. Here's
1543600	1547520	the conversation. Here's a synopsis of the conversation. They had trouble with the thesis
1547520	1553600	statement. We worked on outlining in this way, etc. Maybe a comparison to previous writing that
1553600	1558480	it seems similar. So it's not trying to just detect based only on the output. It's more of giving a
1558480	1564640	very strong indication based on making the entire process transparent. If the student goes to chat
1564640	1571440	GPT or gets their sister to write the paper and it just shows up inside of Conmigo, Conmigo is
1571440	1575520	going to tell the teacher, hey, this just showed up. We didn't work on this. You should look into
1575520	1579120	it. And by the way, it's very different than what the student has written before. I think that's the
1579120	1586720	kind of lens that we need to really not only police cheating, but I don't want to make this just about
1586720	1591680	policing and making it punitive. I also think this is how we're going to better support students and
1591680	1596000	teachers because the students going to be much more supported as they write and the teacher is
1596000	1600960	going to get many more insights about where the students strengths and weaknesses are in their
1600960	1610400	writing. Yeah. So in that sense, the transparency that, hey, I'm using an AI tool and here's the
1610400	1615280	final output. Part of the final output is the essay I came up with. Part of the final output is
1615280	1621440	Conmigo's like your AI tool, Conmigo's analysis of our sessions together. That's right.
1622720	1628240	I think that I think that's very valuable. I think that's I think this idea of AI as collaborator
1628240	1636160	is an important reframing of the role of AI in our lives where just like we have a calculator now
1636160	1642800	to do math equations. Oh, I have kind of an intelligence assistant to help me with problems
1642800	1646960	so I could really focus on the bigger problems. That's right. You know, what we've been doing
1646960	1653120	when we do professional development with teachers is we tell them, look, imagine if
1653920	1659040	all of a sudden your school district discovered a few billion dollars and they want to use that
1659040	1666000	money to hire three or four super hardworking teaching assistants for you that will help you
1666000	1671600	do lesson plans, help you grade papers, help you write progress reports. They'll also analyze what
1671600	1675760	your students are doing on a regular basis to let you know. And by the way, they're also going to
1675760	1680400	be able to tutor the students. They're available 24 seven. These are amazing teaching assistants
1680400	1685200	and they'll be able to connect what you're doing in class to where the students need help and vice
1685200	1691520	versa. Every teacher on the planet would say, yes, sign me up for that. And that I truly believe
1691520	1697200	that's where it's going. This isn't about replacing teachers. Now, one thing we've always said at Khan
1697200	1702480	Academy, our ideal is let's raise the ceiling when a student does have access to a reasonably good
1702480	1708560	classroom and educators. But there are cases where students don't have access to a classroom.
1709360	1713840	It could be a developing nation. There's no school at all. It could be even in the U.S.
1713840	1718080	you're a rural part of the world or a country where there's not a calculus class within an hour
1718640	1724960	hour's drive. Then we want Khan Academy and Khan Mego by extension to help raise the floor
1725520	1728400	so that you can get more supports when there aren't any others.
1729680	1733920	You know, you talk about teachers being worried about they're going to be replaced by Ann. I
1733920	1738240	think this is happening in a lot of professions right now. And that's part of this. There's this
1738240	1743680	existential fear that we're all, you know, horse and buggy drivers and we're not going to need
1743680	1750960	it anymore once the cars are around. And so whether it's, you know, writers, teachers, other
1750960	1759920	professionals and so on. But maybe we don't need teachers. Maybe AI and Khan Academy with Khan Mego
1759920	1764640	can do the job. What is the role of teaching right now?
1765280	1769360	I'm not saying what I'm about to say just because it's the right thing to say. It's
1769360	1774160	what I genuinely believe. I wouldn't be saying it otherwise. I would just stay quiet if it wasn't
1774160	1783760	what I genuinely believe. I think any role that is about the human connection, about the human
1783760	1791520	motivation is going to be not only in very good shape in an AI world, but those are going to
1791520	1798400	be the roles, the jobs, the careers that are most enhanced in an AI world. So even though
1798400	1804800	historically, many people associated teaching with, oh, I'm going to write a lesson plan,
1804800	1808400	then I'm going to deliver this lecture, then we're going to have a quiz every two weeks,
1808400	1812800	and then I'm going to grade those quizzes, and then we're going to rinse and repeat for two weeks.
1814240	1820480	Any great teacher will tell you that's actually not their job. What's actually their job is on a
1820480	1827440	very human level to connect with their students, either individually in small groups as a whole
1827440	1832960	class, to motivate them to see the wonder in the world, to make sure that these students feel seen
1834240	1840240	and supported. And then on top of that, the teachers have to grade papers, write lesson plans,
1840240	1847920	progress reports, IEPs, prepare them for standardized tests. And because we're asking so
1847920	1853760	much of teachers and some of that latter half of stuff is more tangible and more measurable,
1853760	1859840	it's actually squeezed out a lot of teachers' opportunities to do those very human things.
1859840	1864000	Anyone who goes into the teaching profession, they dream of these moments where they're able
1864000	1869200	to have some time in a small group with some students or give that one student who was really
1869200	1872880	down and out of pep talk, and it changes their life forever. And it will change their life forever.
1872880	1880240	I think in my 12 years, 13 years in the K-12 system, I remember probably every moment
1880240	1885120	when a teacher did single me out out of the 30 kids and say, hey, Sal, can I talk to you about
1885120	1890080	something? I really liked what you did, or I really didn't like what you did. It affected me,
1890080	1896480	it changed who I am. And I think that's what, or a teacher ran a Socratic conversation with 10 of
1896480	1902000	us as opposed to all 30 at the same time, or we had a field trip where we ran a simulation. And
1902000	1906080	those are the things that I don't think the AI is going to be able to drive,
1906080	1911600	but I think the AI will be able to support it. But once again, freeing up the teacher to do more
1911600	1918880	of that. The jobs that I think will be under threat with AI, or there will be fewer of them,
1919600	1925360	are the ones that you are, if great writers should not feel threatened, but if you're the
1925360	1931600	person who writes the fairly generic text every day on the news sites about why the stock market
1931600	1939120	went up or down. I'm surprised if those aren't already written by AIs. I think a lot of them
1939120	1942320	actually are. They feel like it. They feel like they've been written by AIs for 10 years.
1944160	1951440	I think if you are, if I'm dealing with the education system, the registrar's office,
1951440	1956320	I think is going to be, you're going to see a lot of automation there. But once again,
1957280	1964320	as just a citizen of the world, I think the more resources that we can save on the non-student
1964320	1969840	facing thing and put it onto the student facing thing, that's a good thing. If you look at school
1969840	1977760	districts like New York City, they spend an average of $40,000 per student per year. There are 25
1977760	1982800	students in an average classroom in the New York City Department of Education. So that means if you
1982880	1988080	just took $40,000 and multiplied it by those 25 students, that means that there's a million dollars.
1988720	1994960	I guarantee you that no matter how good the teacher's benefits, pensions, et cetera,
1994960	2000320	they're getting a small fraction of that million dollars. Maybe a very senior teacher with a great
2000320	2004800	pension, et cetera, maybe with great health insurance, maybe it's $150,000. If you put all
2004800	2011040	the benefits in there, approaching $200,000, that's very, I think I'm already being overly,
2012000	2017680	no one's really making that much. So where are all the other resources going? It's actually
2017680	2022720	not going through the real estate in most cases. Where is it going? And it's going to all of this,
2022720	2028240	let's call it back office, administrative stuff that really isn't moving the dial with students.
2028240	2033200	And actually, I don't write too much about that aspect of it. That's probably less interesting
2033200	2040640	for a lot of folks. But yeah, register's office, scheduling, just a lot of the administrative
2040640	2043200	things I think will hopefully get much more streamlined.
2045200	2050720	You know, what about the current education system is an antique at this point? I mean,
2050720	2057760	I feel like the current, roughly the current education system's been around for 200 or so years
2057760	2063920	that you go to a school, you go to a location where there's a bunch of subjects taught throughout
2063920	2068960	the day. So every day it's like six different subjects. You go from class to class to class
2069040	2074960	and you get homework. At the end you get tested. So that's roughly the structure of the modern
2074960	2078560	education system. And what part of that you think is outdated now?
2079440	2083040	Yeah. And you know, my first book that I had written back in 2012, One World Schoolhouse,
2083040	2089200	it kind of goes into how did we end up with the system? And it really does, it's not a coincidence
2089200	2096240	when you say it's roughly 200, 250 years old. It came out of the Industrial Revolution. And for
2096240	2103440	the most part, it was a very utopian idea. For most of human history, we learned through apprenticeship,
2103440	2109360	we learned through following around, learning from our cousins or our parents how to hunt or how
2109360	2116320	to cook. Once society became more advanced and more specialized, we would hang out with the
2116320	2122720	blacksmith or we would hang out with the, I don't know, the carriage repair guy, whatever it would
2122720	2130480	be to learn or even things like law and medicine was an apprenticeship until about 200, 250 years
2130480	2136160	ago. But the issue with a lot of these is that they didn't scale. If you go back 300 years ago,
2136160	2141600	very, even in more literate parts of the world, you only had a 30 or 40% literacy rates. Most
2141600	2147760	of the world, you only had about a 10 or 15% literacy rate. And so when we had the Industrial
2147760	2154160	Revolution, we had a more abundant society because of technology. And a lot of these societies, and
2154160	2158400	it's not a coincidence that these were some of the first societies to develop a middle class,
2159120	2165840	the UK, what would eventually become Germany, Japan, the United States, they were the first
2165840	2171680	to say, hey, let's have a mass public education system. Very utopian idea. But they said the only
2171680	2176240	way we can afford to do that, the only way we can scale it is by leveraging the techniques of the
2176240	2181200	Industrial Revolution. We're going to bat students together, usually by age, move them together at
2181200	2186480	a set process, literally a bell will ring every hour. I mean, that directly comes from a factory.
2186480	2191280	We're going to have standards. We now take standards for granted in education, but this was
2191280	2200240	a thing that came out of mass production in a factory. We will assess periodically. But we're
2200240	2205440	not going to slow down that assembly line. Instead, we're going to assess and some of the quote
2205520	2210480	product is going to be said, okay, this is the product that's going to be the
2210480	2215040	doctors, lawyers, engineers, and some of it, well, the information or the knowledge doesn't seem to
2215040	2221840	be sticking. Well, these will be the less skilled laborers. So it kind of worked. We could talk about,
2222560	2228480	was it fair for folks? You could have been, and people have been talking about the inequities
2228480	2233760	of tracking for decades. When you're 12, something's not sticking and all of a sudden you're tracked
2233760	2238480	into a slower track and now all of a sudden no one expects you to go to college and people expect
2238480	2244320	you to be a lower skilled laborer versus becoming a doctoral lawyer. Is that fair? That's a very
2244320	2251520	big question. I don't think it is, but it kind of worked for society in that we didn't need a huge
2251520	2256560	number of people in the knowledge economy. And we did need a lot of people who are in either the
2256560	2262640	middle income or lower income jobs, a lot of the mid-skilled or lower skilled labor. We did need
2263200	2268960	it. But if you imagine the world that we are going into, we know what's going to happen to the
2268960	2273760	less skilled jobs, you know, or even the mid-skilled jobs. Obviously, we're talking about artificial
2273760	2280000	intelligence, which is all about kind of that mid-skill processing of information. Everyone I
2280000	2284320	talk to robotics is not far behind. I think a lot of folks are saying in the next five or ten years,
2284320	2290640	we're going to have a chat GPT type moment with robotics as well. So that also means that some
2290640	2296080	of the lower or mid-skilled labor is also going to be automated, probably in the next 10 or 20
2296080	2300720	years. And so where does that leave us? Well, it leaves the high-skill labor, the knowledge economy,
2300720	2308160	being a researcher, being an engineer, being an entrepreneur is where all of the productivity,
2308160	2313040	all of the wealth will accrue there. And so as a society, we have to decide, are we okay with
2313040	2317200	only right now 10% of people participate there? And then that's not a stable society, or we're
2317200	2321120	going to have to do redistribution, which to me is still pretty dystopian because people want to
2321120	2326720	have a sense of purpose. Or do we leverage the technologies that we have to get as many people
2326720	2331760	as possible into the top of that pyramid to be in the knowledge economy? Instead of having a labor
2331760	2336320	pyramid, you can have an inverted pyramid where most people are able to be in that knowledge
2336320	2343200	economy. And so I think that's where the imperative is. So how do you start making those changes in
2343200	2348560	the educational system? And also, I think there's some question as to whether people effectively
2348560	2354640	learn by taking six different subjects in a day. Like multi-tasking learning has been shown to me,
2354640	2358560	not the most effective way to learn. And you even mentioned this in the book, that the more one-on-one
2358560	2365920	more immersion is probably better for education. Yeah. The core ideas, and this is something I've
2365920	2371200	been preaching well before artificial intelligence came on the scene, is instead of a traditional
2371200	2376800	model, what we hold fixed is how long you get to work on something because that assembly line keeps
2376800	2381360	moving. And what's variable is how well you learn it. And we get that in the form of grades. You
2381360	2386880	and I take a class together, we're in algebra for this term, you got an A minus, I got a C plus.
2386880	2391360	All right, it goes in my permanent transcript and we move on. Somehow expecting me that I got to,
2391360	2395280	you know, expecting someone who got the C plus to now understand algebra two or understand
2395920	2400800	something more advanced. And so what I've all, what I've been advocating for the last 10 years
2401520	2406960	or more is let's do it the other way around. What should be, what we should, what should be variable
2406960	2411520	is when and how long you work on something and what's fixed is how well you learn it. And that's
2411520	2416880	what a personal tutor, when Aristotle was Alexander the Great's tutor, I'm sure that's what he did.
2416880	2422640	If young Alexander hadn't mastered a concept yet, he would have slowed down a bit or, you know,
2422640	2426800	given him a second chance to take that test to make sure that he really mastered whatever,
2426800	2432000	military strategy or, you know, governance, whatever, whatever was the, whatever was the
2432000	2438800	topic for the day. Now, if I said this, say 30 years ago, people would have rolled their eyes
2438800	2443840	or say, well, okay, it's easy for you to say, but unless you have a lot of resources to provide
2443840	2448240	that level of personalization, there's no way you can, you can have 30 different students learning
2448240	2454640	at 30 different paces. And if one student is falling a little bit behind for, for them to
2454640	2460640	have a second chance to take that test, that's just logistically impossible to do. Now, what's
2460640	2465040	changed over the last 30 years, even before artificial intelligence is you have tools like
2465040	2470080	Khan Academy, you have software that can let every student practice at their own time and pace,
2470080	2474800	give teachers real time information. If a student needs to refresh their knowledge on something,
2474800	2479360	they could watch an on-demand video, they could read an article, now they can have a conversation
2479360	2484480	with a artificially intelligent tutor. And once again, that tutor is also in contact with the
2484480	2490560	teacher. So constantly guiding the teacher on how they can be a conductor of this class of 30,
2490560	2494880	where they don't have to make every person play the same thing at the same time, regardless of how
2494880	2501200	bad the quality or how, how, how, how not ready for it they are. Now you can, you can, you can
2501200	2507280	personalize a lot more. And so, and a corollary to that is, you know, I talk about mastery learning,
2507280	2512160	which is, if you haven't learned it well yet, keep trying. And once again, this is how we've,
2512160	2516000	we've always instilled do, if you want to be an Olympic athlete, if you want to be a
2516000	2520720	musician, you are doing mastery learning. We just don't do it in our school system,
2520720	2525200	and you see the outcome differences between how good people can get us if they have a personal
2525200	2529920	coach. But, but a corollary to mastery learning is what I would call competency-based learning.
2529920	2534480	Right now, our entire credentialing system is based on seat time, for the most part.
2534480	2539760	Did you sit in a chair for 12 years, and kind of do what you were told, even though you don't
2539760	2543680	really understand a lot of it? Okay, we'll give you something called a high school diploma.
2543680	2550720	Did you sit in a chair for 12 hours this week for a term? Okay, we'll give you the 12 credit
2550720	2554880	hours or however they want to account for it for that course, and you kind of learned it.
2554880	2559360	We know in reality, very few people actually retain most of what they quote are exposed to
2559360	2565520	in school. 60, 70 percent of kids going to community colleges have to get remediation
2566160	2569920	not even at a high school level, essentially at a seventh grade level. So, they sat in these
2569920	2574480	classes called algebra one, algebra two, trigonometry, some of them even take calculus,
2574480	2577440	and the colleges are saying, you're not even ready to learn algebra yet,
2577440	2582000	go back, we're going to work on your pre-algebra. So, a corollary to personalization and mastery
2582000	2586560	learning is moving to a competency-based credentialing system. If you know it,
2586560	2590160	take some type of a rich assessment and we'll give you credit, even if it only took you two days
2590160	2594480	to learn it, but if you haven't learned it yet, that's cool too. Here are some resources to
2594480	2598000	keep learning. Come back in a month, come back in two months, come back in a year,
2598000	2611680	and I'll give you a second chance to actually learn the material.
2612320	2621920	There are over 75 million monthly 2B viewers. That's more people than there are influencers
2621920	2628720	on the internet, which means 2B is more popular than sponsored posts for digestive enzymes and
2628720	2635600	high coverage foundation, more popular than soft launching your boyfriend, more popular
2635600	2640480	than making boomers explode with rage when you tell them how much you make on a single post.
2640480	2645600	2B, it's more popular than influencers. See you in there.
2670480	2687360	So, now let's bring in AI. How would you use AI to who would decide, would it be the student or
2687360	2694000	the teacher or both or the AI, who would decide like, oh, James needs a little more work on his
2694000	2699280	algebra too, as opposed to Sal who got an A plus on every test. Who would decide how I,
2699920	2704880	you know, how much more time do I need and what would I be assigned to do? Like would the AI give
2704880	2709920	me tests or teach me or like what would happen? It's a little bit of all of the above where
2709920	2714880	even before we had artificial intelligence, we have these classrooms where students are working
2714880	2720240	on Khan Academy and we were able to give signals to teachers as to which students are moving ahead
2720240	2723440	and we want to encourage them to do so, where students are on track and where students are
2723440	2728320	maybe falling behind. But we did leave it all, you know, we did professional development for
2728320	2733040	teachers on how they might want to navigate that. Hey, for the kids who are ready to move ahead,
2733040	2737440	let them move ahead for the kids who are behind, why don't you do a focused intervention with those
2737440	2742880	six or seven kids. And a lot of teachers were doing that type of thing, but you can imagine it can get
2742880	2747040	pretty complex and pretty hard, even if you have some of these software tools.
2747040	2750960	What we're able to do now with the artificial intelligence is it really is acting like a data
2750960	2755520	analyst and or teaching assistant for these teachers. So, instead of a teacher every night
2755520	2760640	having to look at a spreadsheet like dashboard and say, okay, these are the kids who are struggling,
2760640	2764240	let me break them out or let me do another lesson plan, which is a lot of work for the teacher,
2764960	2769440	they can just ask the AI what's going on. And the AI says, look, here's what's going on,
2769440	2774160	these are the kids on track here, you know, if we do a differentiated lesson plan tomorrow,
2774160	2779600	I recommend these kids work on this task while you spend the first 20 minutes with these students.
2779600	2784560	And, and the teachers in charge, this thing is in support of the teacher, the teacher is going
2784560	2787760	to be able to say, no, I don't really like that activity. Can you, and we already have this where
2787760	2791280	they can highlight parts of it and they can say, let's come up with something that's a little bit
2791280	2795920	more fun or a little bit more engaging or gets the kids out of their chair. And the AI will say,
2795920	2802080	yes, sir, yes, ma'am, and do that. But as you can imagine, it dramatically lowers the amount of
2803280	2809200	analysis and prep time that a teacher has to spend in order to create these really engaging
2809200	2816080	and differentiated personalized education experiences. It's also going to all this,
2816080	2821120	all these other trappings of school that as students, we never saw as parents, we oftentimes
2821120	2826960	don't see writing progress reports, grading papers, you know, IEPs, which are these
2826960	2831440	plans you have to write for, for students who are, who need special supports, which are
2832000	2836320	increasingly a larger and larger percentage of the student population takes a lot of the teacher's
2836320	2842560	time. Teachers have to prep their own knowledge. If the AI can dramatically improve that time,
2842560	2846800	we've been getting signals from school districts that Kanmigo is helping the teachers with their,
2846800	2853600	with this non-student facing work, it's saving them five, 10 hours a week. And so you're going to
2853600	2859040	see it there. You're going to see, you know, there's this phenomenon called learning management
2859040	2863680	systems, which are increasingly the ways that teachers and students communicate with each other
2863680	2868400	and, you know, make assignments and submit assignments. And right now these are web-based
2868400	2874240	things. I see more and more the AI acts as that intermediary, where it's working with the teacher
2874240	2879360	on the planning, on the creation, it provisions it to the student, it works with the students on
2879360	2884480	those things, and then it's able to report back to the teacher. So, you know, we can, and I can
2884480	2888800	daydream more and more. You can imagine a world where an AI can start to even know what's going
2888800	2893760	on in a classroom and support even more. But even before we go into those more sci-fi use cases,
2894720	2898400	it, I think it's just going to be a, it's just going to be in the fabric of everything that the
2898400	2902080	teacher and the students do, and hopefully in a way that supports the students and the teachers
2902080	2907760	better and streamlines things. Do you think it will happen? Like, let's say, you know, AI is
2907760	2912240	moving pretty fast, and already there are tools like Kanmigo just, you know, what is it like a
2912240	2918560	year and a half after the first chat CPT was released? What, where do you see education five
2918560	2922720	years from now? Like in K through 12, and then I'll ask about other types of education.
2922720	2926000	Yeah, you know, I think there are certain trends that are going to happen that are not fully
2926000	2929600	technologically related, and there's going to be things that are going to be AI related.
2929600	2933920	The non-technologically related, I hope we do move, as I mentioned earlier, to a competency-based
2933920	2939600	system, less seat time, that we can go more to a mastery-based system. And that starts to involve
2939600	2944080	a little bit more technology, because if you're asking a teacher to say, hey, if a student got
2944080	2947840	to see the first time, they should have another chance at that assessment. Well, who's going to
2947840	2952960	write that assessment? That's work. Who's going to grade that assessment? That's work. And so,
2952960	2959040	I think that's where the technology plays into it. In terms of how the technology is going to
2959040	2967920	manifest itself, for sure, all of that support work that we used to bury teachers with, I think
2967920	2972880	is going to be dramatically streamlined. Once again, lesson planning, writing exit tickets,
2972880	2978080	grading papers. Teacher's always in charge, but I mean, imagine being a seventh grade English
2978080	2984960	teacher, and every two weeks, you literally have to sit there and read 100, 150 papers about
2985840	2991680	great expectations from seventh graders. I could imagine by the third or fourth paper,
2991680	2997200	it can get a little bit tedious. Instead, you had a reliable AI that can give analysis,
2997200	3002160	you can spot check it. You're the final arbiter, but it could take that thing that was ruining
3002160	3009680	your weekend to a task that might take an hour instead of 10. So, you're going to see that.
3009680	3013920	You're going to see the AIs get better and better at supporting the students, not just conceptually,
3013920	3019520	not just academically, but I think from an executive functioning, from a metacognitive. So,
3020240	3024480	one project we're working on, we call it Proactive Conmigo. It doesn't just act as a
3024480	3029200	Socratic tutor. It's going to start messaging students. Where are you? The things I used to do
3029200	3035920	at Nadia back in the day. Hey, you said you were going to hit these goals by Friday. It's Saturday
3035920	3041520	now, and you're only halfway. Come on, what's going on? It's going to be able to facilitate a lot
3041520	3047120	more communication between the teacher, the student, and the parent. When it finds that,
3047120	3051120	hey, there's something off parent, you should know about this. And hey, teacher, by the way,
3051120	3055520	I already told the parent that this is happening. I think you're going to see more of that.
3055520	3060400	I think the whole area of assessment is going to be really, really interesting. A lot of the
3060400	3066160	criticism of education over the last 20 or 30 years is we've tried to measure more things,
3066160	3070240	which for the most part is a good thing. And we've been trying to measure it in standardized
3070240	3076400	ways, which for the most part is a good thing. But because so many people started indexing
3076400	3081120	on these things that you can measure in a standardized way, they maybe have lost sight on
3081120	3088400	other things. I was talking to a senior administrator at Harvard, and he was telling me that even at
3088400	3094720	Harvard, they're seeing almost an epidemic of kids who can't write. And if Harvard's seeing that,
3094720	3099360	I can guarantee you it's 10 times worse pretty much everywhere else. And it's probably,
3100240	3104320	no one knows exactly why. Well, think about what standardized testing has been for the last
3105120	3110320	20 years. There's no writing in it because writing has fundamentally been hard to assess,
3110320	3115040	or to be able to give someone standardized clear feedback on. And so it's kind of maybe
3115040	3120880	started to disappear in many cases. We see in the other things in math, when people focus on a
3120880	3126080	multiple choice assessment only, multiple choice can have value. There's nothing inherently wrong
3126080	3131200	with multiple choice, but it might squeeze out other things if we put too much emphasis on it.
3131200	3137520	And so I think AI with its ability to make sense of more open-ended responses,
3138320	3142800	and even visual responses, or even video responses, I think it's going to broaden the
3142800	3147680	aperture of how we assess and how we even assess in a standardized way. And that's going to be good
3147680	3153680	because it's going to allow school to going back to, let's not just focus on what can be assessed,
3154560	3158960	or narrowly assessed, but what's important. And now we can hopefully assess that in a broader way.
3159920	3165200	So do you think, is this hopeful, or do you think this actually will happen in the educational
3165200	3176800	system? We're working on it. I'm both. There's definitely a possibility that a lot of folks,
3176800	3182000	well-intentioned folks, have good ideas, and either they don't get traction in a system that
3182000	3187600	historically has sometimes been slow to move, or it manifests itself in unproductive ways.
3188560	3193440	That's one of my fears. That's why I tell our team at Khan Academy why our role is important.
3193440	3197760	We're not for profit. We are focused on how does this actually drive impact?
3197760	3203440	There are other players. There may be more sales focused, and they're just happy to make the sale
3203440	3210320	however it gets used. And that might not lead to the best possible outcomes for teachers and students.
3210320	3215200	But generally speaking, I'm, obviously, I plan on devoting my life to this,
3215200	3220640	so I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think that this was going to happen.
3222160	3227440	And so you mentioned earlier that a lot of times students don't retain what they learn.
3227440	3232240	I think this is really true. It's what you learn in history class in ninth grade.
3232240	3237040	I would say there's probably a 1% chance you remember it now, unless it's something that
3237040	3244400	particularly fascinates you. What do you think will change in the system that will increase
3244400	3250320	retention? I think if we are more explicit about moving to a competency-based system,
3250320	3255600	where we say, well, one, competency-based system makes you have to get more clear
3255600	3261520	about what you care about. And look, some of the things that we learned in ninth grade that we
3261520	3269600	forgot, that might be okay because it was less about learning the text of, I don't even remember
3269600	3273840	even the eighth amendment, the text of the eighth amendment, but it was more about learning
3274560	3280400	to critically analyze things, et cetera. And that might hopefully be a skill that we have retained.
3280400	3284240	But there probably is content knowledge that we do want. In fact, there for sure is content
3284240	3290000	knowledge that we want people to retain. But we need to get just more explicit about that.
3291040	3296880	And then if we get more explicit about, look, everyone who graduates from high school should,
3296880	3303040	for the rest of their life, be able to solve a simple equation. They should for sure know
3303680	3313440	who Alexander the Great was. They should for sure know how to make sense of a informational text
3313440	3319520	written at at least maybe a seventh or eighth grade level, which is what most texts in our life
3319520	3324560	are actually written at. And then if we can focus on those things, because competency-based learning
3324560	3329920	also focuses you, because right now there's a lot of just hoop jumping and seat time and this
3329920	3335280	or that that could be very idiosyncratic to a particular classroom. It allows you to focus
3335280	3339760	on those things and make sure those things happen. And then hopefully streamlines from some of the
3339760	3345520	other busy work that doesn't have to happen as much. But do you ever see a point where, okay,
3346080	3351600	this student's really good at math? Oh, he spent one week learning algebra one. That was all he
3351600	3355840	was focused on. So now he's able to move on to algebra two, and he goes at his pace. And another
3355840	3362240	student actually goes at a slower pace. And so you do have, for a classroom of 30 students, you do
3362240	3367760	have people going at 30 different paces, and they're immersed. So that increases retention. There's
3367760	3374560	less multitasking from going from biology to history to math or whatever. So some of that's
3374560	3380320	already happening. After I wrote my last book, and my oldest at the time was entering kindergarten,
3380320	3385040	we started a school con lab school that implements a lot of these. And I won't claim that we figured
3385040	3391840	it all out. In fact, I'm always pushing the school to be thinking a little bit more about
3391840	3395360	questioning a lot of the assumptions. But, you know, at that school, yeah, you do have
3396320	3400000	a good number of students. And math is probably where we're seeing it the most,
3400640	3405760	where they could easily be three, four, five, six grade levels ahead. There's a lot of students who
3405840	3412080	are probably, you know, at or one or two grade levels ahead. And there's a few who, you know,
3412080	3417040	the faculty is working extra hard to make sure that they're going at least at a reasonable pace,
3417040	3420320	that they're going to get at least get to calculus before they leave high school,
3420320	3425200	which in the broader world is already a win, because most kids don't even get there. So we're
3425200	3433520	already, we're already seeing that type of reality. But I think we need to see more experiments. I
3433600	3437360	would, you just mentioned of like being able to focus on certain things at a time. I'm intrigued
3437360	3442320	with that idea. There's universities like Colorado College, or colleges, I should say, that do do
3442320	3448480	that. You take classes, instead of taking four or five classes, you take one at a time, but you
3448480	3452320	do it for two weeks. And that's all you do. And then you go and switch and you do another one.
3452320	3456960	I think that's interesting. And I don't think it's just going to be the con lab schools and the
3456960	3462080	Colorado colleges of the world. We have partnerships with very mainstream school districts. Newark,
3462080	3466400	New Jersey, we're seeing some really good things. And they're doing a bit of a hybrid where the
3466400	3470640	teachers are using Khan Academy to assign the daily practice. And by the way, the kids have
3470640	3476240	support from Khan Mego. But the district says, Hey, look, if you finish your assignment and you
3476240	3481520	did it well and you got, you showed your proficiency, you can keep going. But if you did the assignment,
3481520	3486960	but you only got 30% of it right, you should have another go at it. And now it's going to be
3486960	3491840	different items because it's sampling from a very deep item bank, or maybe you're not ready for
3491840	3496720	that assignment because you're missing some prerequisite skills. How do we get you to get
3496720	3501040	some more practice on that without falling too far behind? This is happening in Newark, New Jersey,
3501040	3509440	as we speak. It's interesting. In 1982, I was part of this program where these seventh graders would
3509440	3515200	take the SATs. And if you did well, you were invited to participate in this program at Duke
3515200	3521680	University called TIP, where it had this immersion experiment. And I always remember, finally,
3521680	3527280	like in three weeks, I was able to go through like a couple of years of math. And then when I got back
3527280	3531600	to regular school, so I was in a summer program. And when I got to back to regular school, I was
3531600	3537040	able to advance more quickly. And I always thought that was an incredible experiment that they were
3537040	3541520	doing. And then at the time, there was only 22 students in the program. Now there's like tens of
3541520	3547600	thousands across various campuses. And I just wonder when kind of the mainstream educational
3547600	3551440	system is going to start adapting this, but it sounds like it is to some extent.
3551440	3557520	It is. And if you look at communities where I live, I live in the middle of Silicon Valley,
3557520	3564000	what you're describing is more the norm than the exception. But yeah, and I think the work is how
3564000	3568800	do we make that accessible and the norm more broadly. And that's why most of our work at
3568800	3574320	Khan Academy, most of the places where we are deploying Kanmigo are large-scale public school
3574320	3580400	districts. But we're seeing more traction than I would have guessed a couple of years ago.
3581760	3587360	Now in terms of the existential threat for various industries, one area that has been
3587360	3594640	a big concern, and you mentioned this quite a bit, is the ability to write. Like this has been a big
3595520	3599200	debate in education. Like you mentioned at Harvard, some students don't even have the
3599200	3606400	ability to write. And then in the creative industry, like screenwriting, I think there is a real
3607760	3620160	question. Will AI, will the GPT-7 be able to write an Oscar-winning movie? And I think the
3620160	3624320	conclusion in general, and your conclusion is that it won't be, but it'll be a useful tool.
3624400	3630000	Again, for the creative to be even more creative. But I think people are very worried about this.
3630000	3635440	And I will tell you, just from conversations I've had with heads of major movie studios,
3635440	3639040	they are looking for solutions other than screenwriters.
3639760	3649040	Yeah. Well, I think there's a bunch in this. So on the first level, most writing essentially has
3649040	3657280	two pieces to it. There is the putting words on paper in a structured, hopefully engaging way,
3658080	3663840	grammatical way. And then there's the, how do you come up with what you're going to write?
3663840	3669600	So if you're a journalist, I would think most of your work should be going out there talking
3669600	3674800	to people, looking through public documents, attending public hearings, being on the same
3674800	3679760	scene of the crime to report what's going on. So that's all the work that I don't think AI is
3679760	3686000	going to be able to do anytime soon. And then the journalist takes all of that, and then they write
3686000	3692560	the article, you know, and all of that. And so I think AI there very clearly has a role of, well,
3692560	3698160	if it can help the journalists, let's say take all of their notes that they just got from multiple
3698160	3703520	resources, sources, maybe different recordings, maybe even videos, and then help them get to a
3703520	3707840	first draft pretty fast, maybe with a little bit of prompting. I think that's a win for that
3707840	3712240	journalist. They're going to be able to spend more time on the information gathering and less
3712240	3716400	time on the wordsmithing. But once again, I don't think it's that you're just going to take all that
3716400	3720800	input and let the AI just pop something out that, okay, let's put it in the New York Times. No, the
3720800	3724960	journalist is then going to tweak it and say, no, that they're going to act more like an editor.
3724960	3729360	And they're going to say, no, that let we're burying the lead, let's put this quote up front,
3729360	3733120	et cetera, et cetera, let's tighten it, let's make it a little bit more punchy. So there's still
3733120	3738240	going to be work and the craft of writing and the ability to recognize good writing is still
3738240	3746160	going to matter. I think if we go to the movie industry, I'm not sure exactly how this is going
3746160	3753120	to play out, but, and I write about this in the book, I think what is going to happen is AI is
3753120	3760720	going to lower, like I found it ironic that it was the screenwriters who are afraid of AI and
3760800	3767120	that the production companies really want it. I actually think the AI is going to bring the
3767120	3772400	balance of power to the individual, to the screenwriters and take it away from the gatekeepers
3772400	3777120	who are the production houses. We already saw that before AI with things like YouTube and social
3777120	3782560	media. I mean, you're even seeing this with mainstream news now. It's essentially been
3782560	3790400	disrupted already by YouTube and social media. The ability for someone to publish and be discovered
3790400	3797200	without having to go through gatekeepers now is completely transformed. Justin Bieber is a
3797200	3802960	YouTube artifact. I'm a YouTube artifact. People can publish podcasts now. You don't have to make
3802960	3808160	a pitch to some executive at wherever to do that anymore. That's the way the world was 30 years
3808160	3815120	ago, 40 years ago. With AI, I think you're going to see a similar, you're lowering the cost of
3815120	3822480	getting into the game. Today, if I have a great idea for a science fiction movie, and I have a few,
3823280	3828960	I dream about one day, not only would I have to write a screenplay, I would have to get in
3828960	3833200	in front of people who take me seriously. Even if I wrote a great screenplay, I might not even
3833200	3838240	be noticed unless I'm connected in the right ways, unless I get the right people to read my screenplay.
3839680	3843600	Someone will say, it was a pretty good screenplay. I'll pay a couple hundred grand for it if it's
3843600	3848560	really good. In most cases, I'll pay a couple of tens of grand for it. Go write another one
3848560	3854560	while you're living off of ramen. Then that movie studio might throw some of them away,
3854560	3857920	but eventually say, okay, we're going to put $100 million behind this one,
3857920	3862480	hire actors, director, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Five, 10 years later, the movie comes out.
3863040	3868160	If it's a blockbuster, the movie studio is going to make hundreds of millions of dollars that the
3868160	3873680	screenplay writer probably made less than that, a lot less, a lot less. If they're very savvy,
3873680	3876880	they might have gotten a little bit of a cut of that movie, but in most cases, they're getting
3876880	3883200	next to nothing. In the world we're going into, if I have a great sense of story, if I know what a
3883200	3890000	great movie should look like, I don't have to stop at the screenplay. I will be able to produce the
3890000	3897760	entire movie, probably for tens of thousands of dollars or less, including editing, sound.
3898800	3903840	I'm not going to have to pay actors. I would worry if I'm an actor, actually, in this world,
3904400	3908720	but the creative who's at the core of the idea is going to be able to go much, much further,
3908720	3913120	and then they're going to be able to self-publish it on YouTube and monetize it on YouTube, or
3913120	3917360	maybe there'll be paths, maybe there'll be a YouTube slash Netflix-like thing where
3917440	3923200	slightly vetted people can surface and put their content out. I would be much more worried if I was
3924720	3928800	production houses. The production houses probably are going to invest in it. They're going to figure
3928800	3934640	out ways to do editing much cheaper. They are going to be able to write screenplays,
3936880	3942960	but a commodity screenplay is very different than a great screenplay. I think for society,
3942960	3946320	it's going to be good because think about how many hundred million dollar duds there are,
3946320	3951920	how many bad movies, frankly, most hundred million dollar movies are bad. What a waste of
3951920	3959280	society's resources. Now, we're going to have a bunch more of movies that probably cost 10 or
3959280	3964960	$100,000 to make, and they're going to have a higher percentage of bad ones because it's going
3964960	3968400	to be like YouTube, but we're also going to have a higher total quality of good ones.
3969120	3975520	It's interesting because Tyler Perry, for instance, he shut down plans to
3976160	3982480	build a hundred million dollar studio space because he says AI is going to do this. He's a big
3982480	3988560	movie creator. He has the same view as you. I think I agree, but it's interesting to see how
3989280	3994080	nervous the writers are. Maybe it's just like an insecurity of writers because they haven't been
3994080	3998160	historically making that money. They've been kept down in the system, so they just assumed
3998160	4002880	they're going to be kept down again. But you're right, it is going to give them power. But it's
4002880	4010480	interesting from your book, there's various groups of people that have these fears. There's
4010480	4014720	creatives have these fear. There are teachers that have this existential fear. There's professors who
4014720	4019120	worried the students are cheating. An interesting chapter is the one on parenting. Do you see
4019120	4025200	parents being afraid AI could take their place? I don't think any parents, well, hopefully parents
4025200	4035200	aren't afraid of AI taking their job as a parent. I think most of the fears of a parent are we see
4035200	4041360	directly our kids getting addicted to devices. We either see directly in our own families or schools
4041360	4047520	or we read about how things like social media and cell phones are affecting mental health of
4047520	4054000	especially young people, teenagers, probably disproportionately young girls. That's scary
4054400	4058160	to parents. And so when we see a new technology that's as powerful as AI,
4058160	4062560	okay, is this going to make everything worse? Not really having a clear idea of how it will
4062560	4070080	make it worse. My hope once again is I actually think used well, I'm sure there's going to be
4070080	4078320	use cases of AI that are not great, that can almost amplify a lot of the bad things that we
4078320	4083440	already see on the internet, whether it's marketing to you, whether it's forms of social media that
4083440	4089040	make you feel insecure or you have permanent fear of missing out or whatever's going on
4089040	4093680	or hurt your body image, whatever. But I think there's going to be use cases, these are the ones
4093680	4098960	we're going to focus on, hopefully others focus on it as well, where the AI beyond just helping you
4098960	4104880	academically, it can help you even handle the world that you're dealing with. I write in the book
4104880	4111120	about the AI acting as a guardian angel. Right now, when you surf the internet and our children
4111120	4117680	surf the internet, they don't realize it, but they're already doing battle and they don't even
4117680	4122480	know they're in a battle with AI's where these AI's are figuring out the next thing to show on
4122480	4128160	their social media feed or the search results or the next ad. And their objective function is what's
4128160	4132880	going to get you to click on that ad or what's going to make you watch longer. And unfortunately,
4132880	4138000	it seems like triggering content, polarizing content, content that makes you feel bad about
4138000	4144080	yourself is the stuff that makes you sit on it longer. And any of us who have fallen into it,
4144080	4148640	we've all spent some time on the internet and clicked on an ad or spent more time on social
4148640	4153920	media and we never feel good about it when we're done. We all feel like we kind of wait.
4153920	4159360	Is that true? I feel like that's a little bit of a cliche. Sometimes I surf the internet and I
4160240	4170240	enjoy the experience. For me, it's true. There's definitely times where my friend sends me a fun
4170240	4176800	video or a meme or I fall into it a little bit on YouTube or on TikTok and I get a good giggle and
4176800	4184240	that was exactly what I needed that day. But more often than not, we have fully developed front
4184320	4190000	to lobes and we can regulate ourselves after 10 or 15 minutes of that. But also even TikTok,
4190000	4195120	which I've shut down my account and I had a reason to be on it. We had a social media
4195120	4200640	following. I just took it off because I found even myself, I just went to TikTok to announce a new
4200640	4206000	feature on Khan Academy and then I end up just swiping and swiping and then 10, 15 minutes
4206000	4210400	go by. I'm like, I don't feel good about what I'm doing with my day and I stop. I was able to stop
4210400	4214320	at 15 minutes. There's a lot of young people who aren't stopping at all and they're going two,
4214320	4219040	three, four hours. And look, it's great if someone has the self-regulation to be able to stop after
4219040	4224240	15, 20 minutes. That's probably healthy fun, as long as it's not making them feel bad about
4224240	4229680	themselves. But I am imagining a world now and we're working on this where an AI can
4230720	4236800	act on your behalf or act on your parents or your teacher's behalf where, yeah, okay, I'll let my
4236800	4242320	daughter use a cell phone, but I want to see a world where there is an AI agent on that phone
4242320	4247040	that I am in conversation with. And I would tell them, like, look, I'm cool with her spending
4247040	4253680	some time on it, but let's be careful about her seeing things that hurt her body image or things
4253680	4260480	that make her feel like she's missing out on things or just put her into this polarizing haze
4260480	4265600	or whatever it might be. Then the AI can make sense of what she's surfing and looking at and say,
4265600	4271520	hey, we've just spent the last 10 minutes looking at pictures of that friend's birthday party
4272320	4277600	and when you were out of town, maybe we want to go do something else. Or if it can see patterns in
4277600	4282560	what the daughter is doing, tell the parents, hey, did you know you're child spending an awful
4282560	4287680	lot of time doing X, Y, or Z? One, that might just be something to police a little bit more,
4287680	4291600	or it might be an opportunity to have a connection. Like, did you know that they're really interested
4291600	4296240	in crocheting? Maybe you should take it up. Maybe you should have a conversation with them. This
4296240	4301520	is something to talk about at the dinner table. So I'm hoping that the AI can act much more as a
4303040	4308320	used well, a little bit of a guardian angel, and it can help parents, it can support parents,
4308320	4312640	engage with their children more. I hope that, you know, right now we have devices like Siri
4312640	4317040	and Alexa and Google Home. And right now they're kind of like, you know, what time is it? Put a
4317040	4322480	timer on, you know, what's the weather today? You know, how many people live in Ukraine? That's
4322480	4328640	the type of things we use it for. I would love a time, which I think is going to happen in the
4328640	4335200	next year or two, where I'm, you know, sometimes we're having dinner together. I want to, and
4336320	4341360	we're having a conversation, but I know that there's more that my kids have going on in their life
4341360	4346400	that I'm not getting out of them. When I just ask them, how is your day? How was school? What's,
4346400	4351280	you know, how's history class going? And I could imagine a world where an AI says,
4351280	4356320	I could say, hey, Alexa, can you moderate a conversation, a fun conversation between us as
4356320	4360240	kind of an icebreaker? And it does. And it says, all right, we're going to go around and everyone's
4360240	4364240	going to say the best part of their day. And then when my nine year old says, oh, my best part of
4364240	4369840	the day was getting to hang out with my, you know, my friend who was out sick, then the AI could say,
4369840	4374720	well, why was that? And, and, but once again, it's not squeezing out the parent. It's creating a
4374720	4380400	context to, as a parent, I create more context where I can engage with my children in a more
4380400	4385440	meaningful way, as opposed to just being transactional, put that iPad away, go to bed, eat your food.
4386080	4390320	Hey, it's time to get up. Hey, we're late for the bus. I don't, we all have to do that as parents,
4390320	4394640	but it squeezes out the like, what do you think is the meaning of life? Or what does it mean to be
4394640	4401200	a great friend? Or how can we all be better family members? If we could have an expert facilitator
4401200	4406240	all the time, that'd be pretty incredible. Do you think, do you think, are you going to get a
4406240	4413840	wearable like AI, like this humane AI pin or, or rabbit or, or maybe make Conmingo a wearable?
4413840	4419680	Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, I have no imminent plans to do, to do that. Because I'm also someone who
4419680	4426720	really likes going off the grid, so to speak, and being completely unplugged in certain cases.
4427360	4435680	But if, if there are devices that come out that could, that I, that I can legitimately believe
4435680	4440720	will enhance my life in some way, I'd be open to it. And as long as they have the data privacy and
4441280	4447280	all of the right safeguards in place. Now, I'm wondering what, one big question out there is,
4447280	4454640	does AI somehow plateau? Like, is there only so much it could learn and simulate, you know,
4454640	4459360	human conversation? So you mentioned how like GPT-5 is going to have a trillion parameters
4459360	4466480	as opposed to GPT-4, which just had 175 billion as opposed to GPT-1, which had, I don't know,
4466480	4471840	a million or whatever it was at a trillion parameters or 10 trillion parameters.
4472480	4475440	What can AI do that prior versions couldn't do?
4476000	4481280	None of us know for sure. And I think it is a philosophical debate about if an AI is trained
4481280	4488640	on human created content for the most part, can it transcend human intelligence in certain ways?
4488640	4493120	I think the answer is in certain ways it will be able to, because as these, as the parameters
4493120	4500720	increase, it'll be able to find patterns that are not maybe explicitly obvious to us and maybe
4500720	4506480	leverage those patterns to create things. But will it be like, you know, a truly transcendent
4506480	4515280	intelligence? I don't know. I think one of the interesting things that are going to happen is
4516880	4522240	they're going to be collecting more and more inputs. Right now, it's pretty much human created,
4522240	4529760	written text for the most part, and now images, videos, sound, files. I think when the AIs are,
4531120	4535520	get more sensory perception, you know, once you have wearables, once they have cameras,
4535520	4539520	I know this is a little bit dystopian. So, you know, we have to think about how this gets provisioned.
4539520	4544640	It's going to get more training data. I also think robotics is interesting because
4545440	4550800	when we learn, we don't just observe our environment, we play with the environment. I mean,
4550800	4555600	we literally, that's what that play is literally learning. A kid pokes something, throws it, you
4555600	4562240	know, shakes it and figures out what, how they're investigating the world. And I can imagine
4562800	4569040	once you pair AI with robotics and then it can actively investigate the world,
4570080	4576880	it will get even more input on, and maybe even, and look, it's going to be able to have
4576880	4582320	sensory input that we don't have. It will be able to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum,
4582320	4587840	not just that, you know, it's going to be able to hear every, every frequency of sound. It's going
4587840	4593840	to be able to, you know, detect molecules that we can't at least consciously detect.
4594960	4601520	So, it's an interesting philosophical debate, but you know, once you start talking about orders
4601520	4608400	of magnitude, more parameters than we have synapses in the human brain, and it's tireless,
4608400	4613440	and it has access to all of this information, and it can process it faster than we can.
4614080	4618000	It is interesting, and I know everything I, even me talking out loud has, I've kind of
4618000	4624080	scared myself a bit, but, but, but you know, once again, it's all about intent and how we use it,
4624080	4629440	and, and, and can we use it for, for good purposes, because there, there can be a lot of good purposes
4629440	4637040	here. I mean, it's just something I said, let's say a good purpose is education. I do, and there's,
4637040	4646000	there's evidence that I think with a general AI that basically exceeds our current educational
4646000	4652480	efforts, kids are going to get smarter, meaning they're just going to learn faster, they're going
4652480	4659280	to retain more, they're going to get that feedback loop much more quickly, and, and so they're going
4659280	4664480	to be able to, to advance more quickly than our generation was or the generations in between.
4664480	4669680	I mean, an example that you can see in a specific domain, it's not a general domain,
4669680	4677920	but look, computers have been better than humans at chess since 1997, and, and computers have
4677920	4683280	evolved incredibly since then. So it's been, you know, over 20, you know, 25 years or 20,
4683280	4689520	whatever, 27 years of computers improving since they were already better than humans,
4689520	4697840	and, and kids use computers to learn chess with some coaching, but 99% is they're playing
4697840	4702080	the computer and getting immediate feedback. And then there might be some coaching and kids are
4702080	4710080	so much better now than they were back in 1997. And their rate of improvement is so much faster.
4710080	4715200	I mean, a 17 year old, just the other day became the challenger to the world championship
4715280	4722480	that never would have happened 25 years ago. So it's, it's incredible how in, in that specific
4722480	4728000	domain and other domains like that, kids have advanced and learned and retained so much faster
4728000	4732160	than kids back then. And I wonder if the same thing's going to happen in, in general education.
4732160	4739680	I obviously hope so. And it seems like it definitely will. Like our kids will be smarter.
4739680	4744480	And I, you know, I, I, I typically traffic in optimistic scenarios, but I, and so I hope what
4744480	4748960	you're saying is right. There's a, there is a, a more dystopian, I don't know if it's dystopian,
4748960	4753920	but a less optimistic scenario where you're going to have a segment of students who,
4754880	4760400	who take these tools and run with it and will do exactly what you said. They're going to,
4760400	4765440	to, to get to heights that we never thought was possible by, at very young ages. And look,
4765440	4769760	that's, that by itself is not in any way a negative thing. That is a positive thing.
4769760	4775200	These are going to be the young people who cure diseases for us, who start the next, you know,
4775200	4780320	great companies who write the next great novel, who produce the next great movies,
4781360	4786880	all of the above, push AI forward or make sure that AI is used in a safe way. But I do,
4788000	4793200	I think it's how do we make sure that the other, whatever it is, 60, 70% of students
4793760	4802720	stay engaged and engaged enough to not be, not be thrown behind by, by all of this.
4802720	4807680	Because if they are, it's not, it's not, it's not good for them as human beings and it's not good
4807680	4811440	for society. And so that's where a lot of our, well, we're already seeing with Conmigo in the
4811440	4816800	classroom is there is a segment of student who just runs with it and they are off to the races.
4816800	4819600	And once again, no one should hold them back. I mean, sometimes the school system,
4819600	4824880	temptation is to hold those students back. That is not a good idea. We want these students to,
4824880	4832000	to move it as fast as they can. But how do we make sure that everyone has a, has a decent chance of,
4832000	4835920	of being able to participate without holding people back is where a lot of our work is.
4837680	4842080	Well, and you know, you've been involved in, in obviously been involved in education for
4842080	4847680	almost 20 years. Con Academy has been around almost that long. Why do we have the old system?
4847840	4853360	Why do we have credentialing at all where, oh, in order to get a job in a high profile place,
4853360	4858960	I need a degree from Harvard. Why can't I just go to Con Academy for a year or two,
4858960	4864960	learn what I need to learn and get a job at Goldman Sachs or Silicon Valley or Hollywood or
4864960	4870320	whatever. Like, like what is, what is the real role now of, of higher education? Why can't I just
4870320	4877360	use online education for that? I agree with you 100%. And you're starting to see aspects of that
4877360	4880960	exist. You're definitely seeing that in, in fields like software engineering, where
4882160	4885520	you know, the same employers that 20 or 30 years ago might have said, okay, we're only going to
4885520	4893200	hire from MIT and Caltech and Stanford. They're now saying, hey, anyone can take this boot camp
4893200	4897280	or take this assessment. And if you pass it, we're going to interview you the same as we would
4897280	4903200	interview a, you know, 4.0 grad from Stanford. So that's already happening in, in, in certain fields.
4903760	4911360	I think what you're going to see, and this is a passion of mine, is I do want to create
4911360	4918080	competency based credentials that have the same or greater prestige as going to Harvard or going
4918080	4923120	to Oxford. So much so that even if you go to Oxford or Harvard, you'll still want to get these
4923120	4928720	things to show that you actually learned some, some very useful, very useful skills. So,
4929680	4934960	you know, systems change is harder than technological change for a whole series of reasons.
4934960	4939040	But this is something that I, you know, and hopefully I have many decades left on this
4939040	4943840	planet. But I'm hoping in the next 10 or 20 years, hopefully closer to five or 10 years,
4943840	4948480	you're going to hear some things even from us about ways that you can get high school,
4948480	4955200	college credit, potentially even job opportunities via a pretty streamlined route. Once again,
4955200	4958560	that doesn't mean that it's neither or you might want to do both. But if you don't have
4958560	4963840	access to Harvard, which very, you know, I was telling some very senior people at Harvard that
4963840	4968880	right now there's this false tension where they feel, you know, everyone writes about admissions
4968880	4975520	and it feels like a false tension between equity and merit where there's like, oh, affirmative
4975520	4980720	action that gets ruled down by the Supreme Court. So how are we going to make sure we have equity
4980720	4986160	and that we have right, you know, good representation if we have to go more based purely on test scores
4986160	4990480	or whatever else. And what I've told them is like, you know, it's a false tension because
4990480	4995040	what you've hold, what you've held constant is capacity. Like you're, you're, you only,
4995040	5001360	you only admit whatever 2000 students every year, even though there's probably 100,000
5001360	5006960	qualified students every year. If you could, if you could serve all of the 100,000 qualified
5006960	5012400	students, you wouldn't have to have these weird, bizarre discussions about admissions and equity
5012400	5015840	and all of this that people are having, you would just be able to, if you're, if you can handle the
5015840	5020560	work, we are admitting you and you will get a credential that can get, that can open up the
5020560	5025200	world to you. So yes, I hope that we can, we can create some pathways like that.
5026400	5030240	I think the part of that tension is, is the scarcity principle, which is that
5030800	5035120	Harvard prices their scarcity. And so they make money from their scarcity. You and
5035760	5042000	Khan Academy or let's say a commercial equivalent makes money from scalability as opposed to scarcity.
5042480	5047360	And Harvard doesn't want to have 100,000 students. They want to accept only 2000
5047360	5052160	because that loud, they get charged 300,000 a semester and they'd still fill up. And
5054800	5056640	you know, I think, I think that's the tension really.
5056640	5061120	Yeah. And, you know, and obviously our motivation is, you know, our costs go up as we scale. So
5061120	5065120	our motivation is more of just like, well, how do we maximize impact? But you're right about,
5065120	5070000	there is, there's always going to be a notion of scarcity and the reality of the Harvard's of the
5070000	5075360	world. And so much of the education debate focuses on, let's call it about 30 universities,
5075360	5082080	even though it's less than 1% of students go to those 30 universities. But those 30 universities
5082080	5087920	are relevant because they, they do over influence society. And so I think there are,
5089040	5093280	it's not going to go away anytime soon that there's a certain, you know, the US doesn't
5093280	5099040	have a caste system in the traditional sense, but our, our elite institutions are the best proxy
5099040	5103760	for them where, oh, oh, you're Harvard class of whatever, wherever, were you there? Oh,
5103760	5108800	did you have this professor? Oh, wow. Like we're part of the same, part of the same club.
5110080	5116000	I don't think that's going to go away. What I, and I think there's other positives of not just
5116000	5120960	a Harvard or a Stanford, but college in general of being there in person, forming bonds. I met
5120960	5125120	my wife and many of my best friends in college and we have our best memories there. So I think
5125120	5130000	we can always optimize for some of those in person experiences, but I want to create also
5130000	5134880	alternative pathways. So that's not the only way that you can get into an upper middle class or,
5134880	5140960	you know, promising a career. On, on that optimistic note, and I, and I really hope you're
5140960	5146560	right. I've been writing about this also for a long time. And, and I'm really looking forward to
5146560	5153120	the utopian world that you have been outlining and creating and explaining particularly in your
5153120	5159680	book. I'm going to say the title again, because I always forget things really quickly, brave new
5159680	5165440	words, how AI will revolutionize education and why that's a good thing. And I think what you've
5165440	5170560	explained today has solved a lot of the, also the fears that many people have about AI, but Salman
5170560	5176320	Kahn, creator of the Kahn Academy, thanks once again for coming on the show. Thanks for hugging me, James.
