1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
I am so glad you convinced me that the family car

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,060
should be the Defender 110.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,500
It is so beautiful inside, it's so comfortable,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,820
and it just feels indestructible.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,020
Yes, it really is.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,580
I've been waiting a long time for the new model to come out.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,420
The Defender 110, I'm telling you,

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,380
it's my favorite car of all times.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,740
It's my third one.

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,980
You know, I have stories of going off road.

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,740
The guy managed the group.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,380
He was like, what are you doing in this beautiful car?

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,500
I'm like, I'm going off road.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,340
He's like, are you sure?

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,460
Because you can use one of ours,

16
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,180
and then they look like Mad Max cars.

17
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,460
I'm like, no, no, no, we're going to do this,

18
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,620
and he was shocked.

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,460
Wow.

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,980
Well, it's great because the Defender

21
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,900
has been reimagined for 21st century adventure,

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,620
and its unparalleled off-road ability,

23
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,860
as well as its robust interior, are invaluable,

24
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,940
whether you're headed towards uncharted territory,

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,500
or just a weekend of exploration.

26
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,100
The Defender 110 tackles challenging surroundings

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,980
with absolute confidence.

28
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,860
The SUV conveys strength outside and in,

29
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,300
featuring peerless technology,

30
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,460
like an intuitive driver display,

31
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,020
and an award-winning infotainment system.

32
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,340
That's my favorite part, to keep you connected,

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,700
no matter where the journey takes you.

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,340
Adventure is unique to everyone, and so is the Defender.

35
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,500
Choose from the two-door Defender 90,

36
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,980
the four-door Defender 110, or the larger Defender 130,

37
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,700
with the ability to seat up to eight passengers.

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,860
You'll find uncompromising performance in all three.

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,140
So pack up and go even further with the Defender 110.

This isn't your average business podcast,

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,860
and he's not your average host.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,860
This is the James Altiger Show on the Choose Yourself Network.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Today on the James Altiger Show.

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,700
In many ways, permission to be an imposter

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,580
is something you have to take for yourself.

52
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,020
So if you're hearing this podcast,

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,980
and if you feel like an imposter,

54
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,940
instead of trying to fight it,

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,700
just try experimenting when you're in the quiet of your own room.

56
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
What if I am an imposter, then so what?

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,340
Maybe the idea is that my faking it would be as good or better

58
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,100
than somebody else's earnest attempt.

59
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,980
So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting your fear

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,100
of being an imposter,

61
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,460
and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,060
You know, for any area, it seems like there's a set path,

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,220
there's a set formula to become the top of that area.

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,060
And I think, would you say being an imposter

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,780
is when there are people who come into the area

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,340
without taking that traditional path?

67
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,500
Right, yeah.

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,340
But never discount what somebody can do

69
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,860
completely on their own.

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,700
And I think when you first make a decision

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,140
to burn the boat so there's no returning home, right?

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,180
I think that's when things get really exciting

73
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,900
because it's sink or swim,

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,340
and people become incredibly inventive

75
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,620
once they become isolated and terrified.

76
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,900
When do you think you've burned boats?

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,700
What was your first experience with it?

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,580
So, I don't even know how to introduce you.

79
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
You're Eric Weinstein,

80
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,540
you're managing director of Weinstein.

81
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,140
I keep forgetting that.

82
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,500
Weinstein, Eric Weinstein,

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,100
managing director of Teal Capital.

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,340
You got your PhD in mathematical physics at Harvard.

85
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,500
You've done, you're like a Renaissance man, I feel.

86
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,620
You're kind of, I've listened to a whole bunch

87
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,420
of excellent podcasts with you.

88
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,460
Let's start off with Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Tim Ferriss.

89
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,820
I highly recommend people listen to you on those podcasts too

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,740
because to get the wide range of your knowledge,

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,340
what other things should people say about you?

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,900
How do people introduce you?

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,100
You've done like a million things.

94
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,020
Well, I don't know, I'm just a guy

95
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,580
who's interested in canonical structures in the universe

96
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,540
and try to find them wherever we can.

97
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,940
So, what do you mean by canonical structure?

98
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,900
And then I'll actually continue the intro.

99
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,700
Well, just, I guess what I'm fascinated by

100
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,700
is things that are extremely elegant, very powerful.

101
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,860
There's an idea, I think, due to Richard Dawkins

102
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,620
that you measure the power of an idea

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,500
by what it explains divided by what it assumes.

104
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,260
And so the most powerful ideas assume very little

105
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,260
and tell you a tremendous amount when you unpack them.

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,900
So, in general, if you're gonna try to get through life,

107
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,340
you wanna find the most powerful ideas by that rubric.

108
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,540
Okay, but let me unpack that a little bit.

109
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,020
I've heard that before and,

110
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,500
but with the addition that also

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,340
it should have some predictive ability.

112
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,540
So, a theory might explain a lot,

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,420
like let's take Richard Dawkins in evolutionary psychology.

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,180
It could explain a lot, but does it predict a lot?

115
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,540
And would you include that in something

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,900
that's an important mental model?

117
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,140
Sure, I mean, I think it does predict a lot

118
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,780
and I think a lot of it can be quite surprising.

119
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,580
Before we get to evolutionary psychology,

120
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,180
because that's always gonna be fraught

121
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,900
as people don't want to imagine

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,020
that their thoughts and behavior patterns

123
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,940
are somewhat systematized.

124
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,640
You just take something like the four chord song from music.

125
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,220
I guarantee you that within the next year,

126
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,380
someone will release a version of the four chord song

127
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,260
that will go one, five, six, minor, four.

128
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
And they'll have a worldwide hit with it.

129
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,140
And it's predictive because that is a formula

130
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,140
that is known to underlie all sorts of hits.

131
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,500
And it's clearly not by accident or...

132
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,140
So, have you read The Head Factory

133
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,300
about these group of Swedish guys

134
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,940
who basically produce every hits on

135
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,900
and they basically use that structure,

136
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,620
like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, like every hit?

137
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,660
That's usually a bit more complex

138
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
than simple four chord songs

139
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,780
that can be strummed around the campfire.

140
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,220
But yeah, I think that there are formulas

141
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,280
and very often the formulas are sort of hidden

142
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,920
as if they're machine tools that make the tools.

143
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,120
So the idea that you have some Scandinavian group

144
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,520
that has figured out the DNA of music

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,540
and knows how to pump out hits at will is fascinating.

146
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,740
Why should anyone have that power?

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,340
And the idea that there is,

148
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,900
well, that there are formulas is what's fascinating.

149
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,140
So when I talk about canonical structures,

150
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm most interested in ways in which the world

151
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,220
seems incredibly complicated,

152
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,700
but in fact reduces to a very small set of assumptions.

153
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,020
So what's another example?

154
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,980
Well, the famous ones that people all know

155
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,620
would be, for example, the periodic table,

156
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,700
but maybe despite the fact that that tells you all

157
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,780
about the chemical elements

158
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,260
and gives you a lot of indication of how they'll combine,

159
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,380
most people have never seen the left step periodic table,

160
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,420
which makes clear the relationship between symmetries

161
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,660
and orbitals and chemical elements.

162
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,900
So that would be an example of a design innovation

163
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,700
where just the presentation of the information

164
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,940
lays bare the underlying structure.

165
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,580
Or if we were talking music or not music language,

166
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,740
the international phonemic alphabet

167
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,020
is something that most people don't even know it exists,

168
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,060
but it has to do with the mapping of the structure

169
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,140
or our speech apparatus into a universal notation

170
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
so that you can understand

171
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,820
how to pronounce something in any language.

172
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,700
And so I've heard you talk about that

173
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,140
on Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss.

174
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,340
I think it's fascinating, but it also underlines,

175
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,780
all these things underlined how much of a kind

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,060
of polymath or renaissance person you are.

177
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,540
Like, you have your PhD in mathematical physics,

178
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,900
you have results there,

179
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,380
but you've gotten from that to economics,

180
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,900
to obviously a deep understanding of music and language

181
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,020
and economics and finance

182
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,860
and you're managing director of Teal Capitals

183
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,860
who are involved in the investing world.

184
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,540
And the way I know more about you

185
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,580
as I actually heard you speak a few months ago in New York,

186
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,740
Dave Rubin was on the stage, Melissa Chen was on the stage,

187
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
and it was about this, you know,

188
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,780
the so-called intellectual dark web,

189
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,860
a phrase you coined,

190
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,860
which is kind of about, if I was to describe it,

191
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,500
basically the limitations on free speech

192
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,500
that has polarized the US or even the world on both sides,

193
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,860
but I would say maybe a little bit more

194
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,500
since Trump got elected,

195
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,940
the limitations of free speech

196
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,860
are happening a little bit more on the left side, and...

197
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
Just not a little bit.

198
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,020
All right, not a little bit,

199
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,140
but and to note, you're from the left side,

200
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,100
I've been a Democrat all my life,

201
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,020
but suddenly I find you cannot even,

202
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,020
unless you agree with all 50 things on one team,

203
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,660
you're ruined.

204
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,820
But that's not even true.

205
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,060
There's no way to agree with it

206
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,460
because it's self-contradictory.

207
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
Tell me what you mean.

208
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,060
If you are men and women different

209
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,740
or are men and women the same?

210
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
So this new movement asserts

211
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,340
both of those things at different times

212
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,860
in order to make two different sets of points.

213
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,460
If you want to make the point that leaving women out

214
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,740
is a problem because you don't get

215
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,900
the benefit of diversity,

216
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,020
you say, do you have any idea

217
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,100
how differently women think from men?

218
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,740
You're losing all of that perspective,

219
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,220
which is an interesting argument.

220
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,220
And then when you see, let's say a workplace

221
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,380
with a lack of balance between men and women,

222
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,220
they'll claim will be men and women are exactly the same

223
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,340
and the failure to hire women has to do

224
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,260
with bigotry and prejudice.

225
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,780
And so it's very interesting.

226
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,900
You're making two separate arguments.

227
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,060
Both of them are individually interesting.

228
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,260
Then you say, well, look,

229
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,740
I've heard you make two different arguments.

230
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
Let's try to figure out how they combine

231
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,820
or whether there's a contradiction

232
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,020
or there's something to explore.

233
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,940
And then people get very, very angry.

234
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,740
They get very angry in it.

235
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,300
The way you just put that

236
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,500
kind of reminds me of arguments in relationships.

237
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,860
So it's when two sides,

238
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,060
the man and the woman say, disagree about something.

239
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,780
And usually the way you resolve arguments is,

240
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,460
okay, why do you disagree?

241
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Why do you disagree?

242
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,620
What are all the options?

243
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,060
And then you discuss what's the,

244
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,020
what option is best for the unit

245
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,540
kind of in the middle of that spectrum

246
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,820
between one side and the other.

247
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,100
But here we've come to a place societally

248
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,020
where people are not willing to acknowledge

249
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,300
that there are options in the middle.

250
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,580
Yeah, I don't think it's really about options in the middle

251
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,740
or compromise or common ground.

252
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,540
I think that for some reason that we don't understand

253
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,220
and interesting that both of us identify

254
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,500
with being lifelong Democrats,

255
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,020
something has gone completely insane inside of the left

256
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,700
with respect to logic and reason.

257
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,340
Just even to the point where bringing up logic,

258
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,620
reason, contradiction,

259
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm told these are tools of power and oppression.

260
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,380
And I don't even waste time

261
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,220
within any argument that stupid.

262
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,620
It's just, it's so far outside the bounds

263
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,380
of what civilized people should be discussing,

264
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,020
whether or not logic and reason,

265
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,100
I mean, are we gonna be discussing

266
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,580
whether arithmetic is biased?

267
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,780
I have no idea where these people are going.

268
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,020
Well, I wondered about this

269
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,140
when thinking about this podcast,

270
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,020
you're obviously involved in at least questioning

271
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,140
what's going on with free speech.

272
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,740
People like you and Jordan Peterson

273
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,100
who's also been on the podcast and others.

274
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,540
And my first inclination was to think,

275
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,940
why do you care?

276
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,820
Because I just avoid people who don't let me talk.

277
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,220
But I guess in the workplace and in,

278
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,420
if you're out there trying to make other points

279
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,060
that you want people to consider what you're saying

280
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700
and value what you're saying,

281
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
then there's some Twitter mob

282
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
or just some societal mob in general

283
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,580
that says, no, he said this 15 years ago,

284
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,740
so we can't listen to anything else he ever says.

285
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,060
I guess it is important to this.

286
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,100
I mean, it's not even close.

287
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,060
What we are potentially going to do

288
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,060
in terms of our ability to destroy our institutions,

289
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
suppress thought, descent,

290
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,100
completely weaken ourselves

291
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,180
and our scientific enterprises

292
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,060
by creating a climate in which no one knows

293
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,300
what the rules are from moment to moment.

294
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,460
And anyone can come out of any nook of your past

295
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,060
and accuse you and you feel like you have to answer.

296
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,180
I think it's really important

297
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,900
that people stop answering all of the accusations

298
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,620
with information about their lives.

299
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,340
Very often somebody will be accused and they'll say,

300
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,860
well, actually I was here and I was there

301
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,020
and I was doing this other thing.

302
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,300
Why are you telling people?

303
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,420
I mean, just if people want to accuse you of something,

304
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,460
have them do it through the courts

305
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,180
and have it be done with presumption of innocence.

306
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,380
There's something that's going on

307
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,860
in which we are now attacking people's ability

308
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,260
to earn a living as a second judiciary process.

309
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,180
And the idea is that if we can destroy your reputation,

310
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,420
we may not be able to get you into a court of law,

311
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,900
but we can keep you from feeding your family.

312
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,940
And that is what I've been calling left cartheism.

313
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,180
And because I come from the left,

314
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,140
we learned to hate McCarthyism during the 1950s

315
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
because it was used against us

316
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,860
and it was used very specifically

317
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,540
to destroy progressive families.

318
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,740
The idea that people calling themselves progressives

319
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,740
have rediscovered the tools of ruin

320
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,660
that were previously used against progressives

321
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,260
by an out of control anti-communist movement

322
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,340
in the United States is beyond ridiculous.

323
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
Well, it's interesting

324
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,380
because it didn't just start now,

325
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,180
although maybe it's at the peak that it's ever been.

326
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,300
I mean, there's always been this notion of PC culture

327
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,060
and you always kind of had to be careful around it.

328
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,780
But it's just maybe it's gotten,

329
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,300
I think since the election of Trump,

330
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,140
it's gotten much more intense

331
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,100
where you're either on one team or the other.

332
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,540
And like you say, it's even hard to say what the team is

333
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,540
because both sides could be construed with the same hate.

334
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,260
But that sounds reactive to Trump.

335
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,100
My claim is that Trump was called out of the vacuum

336
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,740
and installed as president largely because of this madness.

337
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,660
The reason I'm so against this madness

338
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,940
is because it's going to elect us Trump or worse

339
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,740
in the eyes of the left.

340
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,420
In other words, if you start going after

341
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,700
the bedrock of American labor,

342
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,700
let's say famously Hillary's comment about deplorables,

343
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,460
I believe that deplorables are democratic apostates

344
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,260
who left the Democratic Party

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,100
when it started abandoning labor

346
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,620
and tried to make up the constituency deficit

347
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,740
by embracing identity politics.

348
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,100
And the claim is that labor

349
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,540
was a super expensive constituency

350
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,460
and identity politics is incredibly cheap.

351
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,620
So the donor class wanted to swap out labor for identity.

352
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,900
This is my wife's theory, Pia Milani's.

353
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,980
But I think that-

354
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,220
Although labor is a huge voting constituency.

355
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,220
Well, it is, but if you have like white former coal miners

356
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,260
in their 60s or something,

357
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,860
and then you're making fun of them as deplorables

358
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,860
because their church going, rifle owning,

359
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,140
speak your mind, American bedrock.

360
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,500
I think that it just shows

361
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,180
that we're completely cut off from our own history,

362
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,540
our own base.

363
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,380
And you should never antagonize a group of people

364
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,860
that's taken a really serious hit like this,

365
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
which is in some sense,

366
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,940
just a bedrock constituency in this country.

367
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,500
You're opening the door of Pandora's box.

368
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,220
I can't imagine anyone smart wanting to do that.

369
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,060
Why do you?

370
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I mean, Hillary's obviously not the most successful

371
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,060
campaign in the world,

372
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,380
but she knows what she's doing enough to get nominated

373
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,500
to be almost president.

374
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
And why do you think she did that?

375
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I think that Hillary is part of a very long slide

376
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:05,020
into middle brown nonsense that was used

377
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,500
to blow out the genie coefficients,

378
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,780
create a tremendous amount of income,

379
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,740
inequality, and asset inequality in this country.

380
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,620
I think that when Bill Clinton figured out

381
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,620
how to finally stop the 12 year Republican juggernaut in 1992,

382
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,980
he largely did it by copying so much

383
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,700
of the Republican playbook that you have two versions

384
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,660
of the pro inequality party.

385
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
And I think that definitely the idea

386
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,940
that Republicans remain the party of millionaires,

387
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,180
but Democrats have become the party of billionaires

388
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,780
is an interesting critique.

389
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,940
Well, it's interesting because in 1992,

390
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,500
I mean, at the time he was head of the,

391
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,780
I think it was the Democrat National Caucus

392
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
or Southern Caucus,

393
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,300
some part of the Democratic party,

394
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,580
that was kind of the conservative wing

395
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,540
of a Democratic party.

396
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,540
And the fact that they're now signaled to be so on the left,

397
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,620
it was kind of an interesting.

398
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,420
Yeah, but I don't even know what these words really mean.

399
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,940
I think that we have two parties, Democrat and Republican,

400
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,860
we can call them left and right, if you will.

401
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,220
But to me, it's two faces of the looting party.

402
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,900
Of the looting party.

403
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,380
Okay, what do you mean by looting?

404
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,180
Well, that we've been,

405
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,380
we have this country with a tremendous amount of wealth.

406
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
We have a problem with growth

407
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,340
and that we're not really honest

408
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,360
about confronting our problems with growth.

409
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,040
So just like any family that has a family business

410
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,560
that has made it wealthy,

411
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,440
where the business starts to begin sputtering,

412
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
you have a very interesting period of time

413
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,520
where you can use the wealth of the family,

414
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,160
you can take loans against the assets,

415
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,960
you can sell things off,

416
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
and you can live in the style to which you become accustomed

417
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,600
as you try to figure out how to restart the business.

418
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
Well, that's, I think, what we've been doing

419
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
for almost since the beginning of the 70s,

420
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,240
certainly since the beginning of the 80s,

421
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
is that we've been buying time,

422
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,440
but not actually figuring out

423
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,160
how to really restart hyper-aggressive growth.

424
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,800
Where do you see that?

425
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,080
How do you see that playing out?

426
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
Well, I don't think we're as invested

427
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,320
in real science and technology and Mavericks.

428
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
We're not interested in employing

429
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,560
the super disagreeable people

430
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,520
who are strong enough to hold positions

431
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
that no one agrees with them on,

432
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,160
but are in fact necessary to overturn incorrect orthodoxies.

433
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
We're interested in this kind of consensus,

434
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,720
communal structure that's going to choke our ability

435
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,640
to find new sources of economic growth.

436
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,560
We want dangerous, difficult people,

437
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,480
people who you don't necessarily feel safe,

438
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
trusting your cat to.

439
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,000
I mean, people who are aggressive.

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,760
And I think often about Jim Watson.

441
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,200
Jim Watson chooses to be incredibly unpleasant

442
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,960
in many ways as the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.

443
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
On the other hand,

444
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,880
he's been fantastically productive over his life.

445
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,440
And he's a great example of someone

446
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,280
who gave himself permission to dominate areas of science

447
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,080
or innovation where he wasn't necessarily

448
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
the expert or that informed in those areas.

449
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,000
And I think that's part of what makes someone dangerous,

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
is to be able to step into an area, say things out loud,

451
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,240
and yet not kind of challenge the top of the pyramid.

452
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,160
Well, but he's also,

453
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,280
he's offensive almost for the sake of being offensive.

454
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
So I'm not saying,

455
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
boy, this is the way to conduct yourself at a party

456
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,520
or what a wonderful way to treat other people.

457
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm trying to say,

458
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,800
if you want somebody who is balls to the wall

459
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,640
and trying to break into new territory

460
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
and do things at the highest level of human ability,

461
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,160
you're gonna have to put up with some people like that.

462
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
So let's talk about that for a second,

463
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
because, and I think this is a little

464
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,920
out of the intellectual dark web discussion,

465
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,520
but I'm really fascinated by skill acquisition

466
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,320
and the so-called 10,000-hour role of Anders Erickson,

467
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.

468
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
You've succeeded in many different areas.

469
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,840
You're an expert in many different areas.

470
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,560
Obviously, you're super intelligent,

471
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,440
but it seems like you've made conscious decision

472
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
and permission in the same way that Watson might have

473
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
to say, okay, I'm gonna become knowledgeable and an expert

474
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,160
and even an investor in other areas

475
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,240
other than differential geometry,

476
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,560
which you studied and got your PhD in.

477
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,720
But even there, I'm an imposter.

478
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,800
Why is that?

479
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,960
Well, I don't, for example, have a thesis advisor.

480
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
You didn't have a thesis advisor?

481
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,920
No.

482
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,760
What happened?

483
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,600
You were at Harvard.

484
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,440
Yeah.

485
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
You had some ideas.

486
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,120
Nobody liked them.

487
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,560
I think people were interested in the ideas,

488
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,960
but I think that they were pretty radical in a lot of ways.

489
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm afraid to ask what the ideas were

490
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
because they're gonna be way beyond.

491
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
Look, I can say words around them.

492
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
You're not gonna understand what the words mean,

493
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,560
but let's imagine that you had some set of equations

494
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,320
that was thought to only occur

495
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,800
in particular sets of dimensions, whatever dimensions are.

496
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, so you would have an assertion

497
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,160
that these equations are peculiar to dimension four

498
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,080
and don't exist anywhere else.

499
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,000
And so maybe I try to show that, well, actually,

500
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,280
versions of those equations exist in all dimensions.

501
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,320
So that shibboleth or that perspective was challenged.

502
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,960
And if I wanted to try to relate

503
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,320
the kind of work we were doing in geometry

504
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,360
to actual guesses about the world of particles

505
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,800
and particle theory, that could cause a problem.

506
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,800
And so in many ways, permission to be an imposter

507
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,920
is something you have to take for yourself.

508
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,560
And in particular, young women.

509
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,440
So young women have confidence problems

510
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,920
that I think are more severe even than young men

511
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,400
because young men will often decide that they're capable,

512
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
whether or not they are capable,

513
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,320
whereas young women tend to be very acutely aware

514
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
of all their imperfections.

515
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,720
So evolutionary or cultural?

516
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
I think a lot of it is evolutionary

517
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,360
because I think women, females are purposed

518
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,040
for child rearing in ways that males are not

519
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,000
because maternity is certain and paternity

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,440
was never certain before genetic testing.

521
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,600
So I think that females tended to be

522
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,720
the low variance version of a strategy

523
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,160
where males tended to be the high variance version

524
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,760
of that strategy because women couldn't afford to mess up.

525
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,640
If you know about the rigors of early childhood,

526
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,560
it's a really super demanding work.

527
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,000
And so I think a lot of it is probably innate.

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
And it's good that we have a high variance

529
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,200
and a low variance version of these strategies.

530
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,840
I think you'll find that women in general

531
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,560
are much more reliable than most men on average.

532
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,600
Now, with that said, I think one of the terrible things

533
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,520
is that we don't give women permission to be imposters.

534
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,000
So if you're hearing this podcast

535
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,920
and if you feel like an imposter,

536
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,200
instead of trying to fight it, just try experimenting

537
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,720
when you're in the quiet of your own room.

538
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,360
What if I am an imposter, then so what?

539
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,960
Maybe the idea is that my faking it

540
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,360
would be as good or better than somebody else's

541
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,800
earnest attempts.

542
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,120
I have a friend who taught herself forms of dance

543
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,520
that she didn't have any formal training in,

544
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,880
but it certainly looked like she knew what she was doing,

545
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
but anybody who was actually trained

546
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,240
in those forms of dance would know

547
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,720
it was just completely made up.

548
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,720
So I think it's very appealing to stop fighting

549
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,280
your fear of being an imposter

550
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,680
and saying that's no excuse for staying on the couch.

551
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You know, it's, you know, for any area,

552
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,520
it seems like there's a set path,

553
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,320
there's a set formula to become the top of that area.

554
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,720
Do you succeed in that area?

555
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,880
Politics was one example.

556
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,960
You know, you supposedly needed to be in the house,

557
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
in the Senate, and maybe a governor,

558
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
then vice president, then a president.

559
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,800
That was considered the typical path

560
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,520
and with some variation,

561
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,920
that's the path that many politicians have followed.

562
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,280
With mathematics, you go to graduate school,

563
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,440
you get a PhD, you become a professor,

564
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,320
and now you're a mathematician.

565
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,320
And I think what you say being an imposter is when,

566
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,680
and this happens in every area,

567
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,400
there are people who come into the area

568
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
without taking that traditional path.

569
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,560
Donald Trump, of course, became president

570
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,320
without taking the traditional path.

571
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm sure there's mathematicians who have not,

572
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,800
don't even have a PhD, but have discovered some solution

573
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
to some theorem or whatever.

574
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,920
The guy who came up with Green's Functions,

575
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,560
which is a way of inverting a differential operator,

576
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,960
if you will, I think was a miller in the middle of England,

577
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,400
and he sent off a solution to Cambridge

578
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,280
to some famous problem,

579
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,560
and they wanted to appoint him to a professorship.

580
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,720
And then he said, well, really, I didn't even go to college.

581
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,600
And so they forced him to get a BA

582
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,440
before they could make him a professor.

583
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
That's fascinating.

584
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,640
So was he just reading like math papers all his life?

585
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,200
I think it was kind of unclear,

586
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,200
but never discount what somebody can do completely

587
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
on their own.

588
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,600
If you think just like about Jimi Hendrix's strange

589
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,480
stringing of his guitar from the right-handed guitar plate

590
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
upside down and backwards as a left-hander,

591
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,680
it immediately took him out of an ability

592
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,600
to like watch what somebody else was doing

593
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,840
and just copy it because it was so different.

594
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,800
So in some sense, it's not that surprising

595
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,240
that he would sound that unique

596
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,640
because nobody else was even

597
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,800
in his same universality class,

598
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,280
or Stanley Jordan tunes the guitar,

599
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,600
I think, uniformly in fourths,

600
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,840
which is a very uncommon thing to do.

601
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,440
And so it puts you in just a different class.

602
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,040
And I think when you first make a decision

603
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,520
to burn the boats, so there's no returning home, right?

604
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,680
And like this is what the people did

605
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,360
when they had the mutiny on the bounty

606
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,200
when they hit Karen Island that they burned the bounty

607
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,360
so nobody could leave.

608
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
I think that that's when things get really exciting

609
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
because it's sink or swim

610
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,520
and people become incredibly inventive

611
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,640
once they become isolated and terrified.

612
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,560
So when do you think you've burned boats?

613
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,600
What was your first experience with it?

614
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,440
Oh, geez.

615
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I guess asserting that I was not good in math in high school.

616
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm calling bullshit on that.

617
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,360
No.

618
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,680
What was your SAT score on math?

619
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,600
It's really not very impressive.

620
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,520
I mean, I don't wanna talk about my SAT scores at age 53,

621
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
James, what are we doing here?

622
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,920
No, but you're saying that you weren't good at math?

623
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,000
I can't believe that.

624
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
It seems like you're like over math.

625
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
Let's talk about learning disabilities

626
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,680
because I'm sure that you have a decent podcast size, right?

627
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
Yeah.

628
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,160
All right, there are a lot of parents out there.

629
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,080
Hey, I see you out there in radio land

630
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,760
who have kids who they know are smart.

631
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,760
They know are sharp and bright and creative and getting it.

632
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
And those kids are bringing home grades

633
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,320
that are just so depressing.

634
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,440
And the parents are tearing their hair out

635
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,200
because they're like, I can't get you into college.

636
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,520
You're not doing your homework.

637
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,480
Everything's coming back screwed up.

638
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,320
Okay, that population is probably learning disabled

639
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,200
in the standard parlance.

640
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,120
But I think they're probably supposed

641
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,760
to be our future innovators.

642
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,360
I will make the gambit that I believe

643
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,840
that most of the innovation or a lot of the innovation

644
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,720
is always going to come from people

645
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,200
who are going to be written off as learning incapable.

646
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
And so be of good cheer.

647
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,240
There's lots of ways to be smart

648
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,080
and underperform like crazy.

649
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,080
And I would much rather be appointed king of the losers.

650
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,200
There's so much brain power in loser nation

651
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
compared to winner nation.

652
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,960
It's unbelievable.

653
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,720
So you just have many more opportunities

654
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,380
to unlock unused brilliance in the loser community

655
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,980
or the learning disabled community

656
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,400
or the people with low self-esteem.

657
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,840
These are my people.

658
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
And this is where I get really super excited

659
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
because they're sitting on top of gold

660
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,560
and they just can't get it together to convert.

661
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Well, so what would you say?

662
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,800
So again, so maybe you burn bridges by going into math

663
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,680
and saying, I'm gonna do this.

664
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,960
I have some insights.

665
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,800
So I committed to a program whereby I didn't think

666
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,080
I was gonna finish college

667
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,680
because there was a language requirement.

668
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,960
I was doing terribly in French and I just...

669
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,080
I had the same problem actually.

670
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,920
Really?

671
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
In French, I took five years

672
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,280
and I got a D minus in college French

673
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,160
after my fifth year in it.

674
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
All right, so you're one of us.

675
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,520
Look, but if you'd learned Indonesian

676
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
you actually would have been in great shape.

677
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,360
Why is that?

678
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,840
Because the orthography is the same as ours.

679
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,960
So they use the same Latin letters.

680
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,120
It's not inflected for gender.

681
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
It's not inflected for tense.

682
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,520
It's not inflected for gender number K.

683
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,200
It's just perfect.

684
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,840
It's the most wonderful language to learn super rapidly

685
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
and it's about the most beautiful place on earth.

686
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,080
It might be the most beautiful place on earth.

687
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,920
So it's okay.

688
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,720
So you decide I'm gonna go into...

689
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,280
I have these ideas about the universe and math.

690
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,920
So I stopped taking required classes, I guess.

691
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,840
I started taking all graduate courses.

692
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,480
I loaded up like crazy in math

693
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,560
and a little bit of advanced physics or something.

694
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,840
And I didn't think I would graduate.

695
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,760
And I just said, look, at least I wanna find out

696
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,280
what the universe is all about while I'm here.

697
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,880
And that turned out to pay out.

698
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,720
So...

699
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
So after you...

700
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,120
So you got the PhD, you didn't have advisor

701
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,360
so who kind of approved the PhD?

702
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
Formerly a guy named Raul Bot

703
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,720
who would be my, you know,

704
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,760
he was formerly appointed as my advisor.

705
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,840
The person who came closest to being my advisor

706
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,760
was a guy named Dror Bar Natan

707
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,000
who just helped me explain what I'd done

708
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
to people who couldn't understand it.

709
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,120
And, but it's, you know, it's very rare

710
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,120
not to have an advisor in a subject like mathematics.

711
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
And then, what was the first?

712
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,080
So maybe you took some fellowships.

713
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,080
You, but when did you start to branch out of mathematics?

714
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,880
Well, I mean, I think I was always interested

715
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,160
in anything that could be sort of systematized

716
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,360
and explained that had a lot of power to it.

717
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,320
I did some work in economics with my wife, Pia Malani.

718
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,280
And we found a way to apply the geometry

719
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,160
that is underlying particle theory

720
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,520
to neoclassical economics.

721
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,460
And we had a backwards compatible reformulation

722
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,140
of neoclassical economics in a way that could solve

723
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,460
something called the changing preference problem.

724
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,060
What's the, what's the changing preference problem?

725
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,740
Well, if you know that question

726
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,220
that you get asked in politics,

727
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,060
are you better off now than you were four years ago?

728
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,460
Well, if your tastes change over that period of time,

729
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,700
there's no way in economic theory,

730
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,180
as it's currently practiced,

731
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,300
to compare your welfare between two points in time

732
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,860
where your tastes were different.

733
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,700
It's only if your tastes stay exactly the same

734
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
that you can make welfare comparisons.

735
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
And since-

736
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,680
So, like as an example, maybe four years earlier,

737
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,860
you liked living in a house in the suburbs,

738
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,100
but then suddenly you wanted to live in an apartment

739
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,620
in Manhattan, it might not seem you're better off.

740
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
It's hard to measure-

741
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,860
Well, let's do kale and beef.

742
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,500
Okay, so at some point you're thinking vegan is healthy,

743
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,900
then you start reading a lot of stuff

744
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,060
that maybe you think paleo is healthier.

745
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,100
So before you put a huge premium on kale

746
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,740
and a low premium on beef,

747
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,380
and then five years later,

748
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,020
you value beef more and kale less, okay?

749
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,620
So any particular basket of goods,

750
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,940
which has both kale and beef in it,

751
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,580
gives you some level of happiness.

752
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,820
But the problem that you find

753
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,420
between periods of time where your tastes change,

754
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,380
you don't know how to compare your two forms of happiness,

755
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
because in some sense,

756
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,260
you're too different as two different people.

757
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,300
Right, but when someone says,

758
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,180
are you better off than you were before,

759
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,460
they usually mean probably income plus assets,

760
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,300
adjusted for inflation.

761
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,380
Well, if everything's a financial asset-

762
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,580
Just in terms of economics, though.

763
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,740
I understand, but if the idea is

764
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,100
that you have cheaper airfare,

765
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,900
but you're spending more on healthcare,

766
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,540
and how much do I value travel versus health,

767
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,420
it's not an easy question.

768
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,700
So we solved the puzzle of how to do that

769
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,180
at a theoretical level.

770
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,900
Using the knowledge you gleaned

771
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,340
from differential geometry or physics.

772
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,180
Exactly, infinite dimensional gauge theory.

773
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,900
So I love the idea of this,

774
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
because I'm a big believer in,

775
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,780
we were talking before the podcast,

776
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,700
you had just tried doing stand-up comedy.

777
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,500
Obviously, you had never done it before.

778
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,140
There's a certain amount of skills involved,

779
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,820
but you've done public speaking before.

780
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,820
You've had a vast array of experiences and knowledge

781
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,900
that you were able to bring onto the stage with you

782
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,880
that maybe other comedians didn't.

783
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
So in a sense, you did the same thing.

784
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,080
You borrowed from other categories you were expert in

785
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,880
that the audience maybe wasn't,

786
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,720
and you were able to use that to perform like an expert

787
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
on the stage that time.

788
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,280
So in this case, you borrowed from physics and math

789
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,440
without necessarily having an economics PhD,

790
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,640
and were able to do something interesting.

791
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,560
Yeah, I think nature has very few games

792
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,880
that she knows how to play well.

793
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,520
And so if you learn those games, you're quite correct.

794
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,360
You can't necessarily just take them wholesale

795
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,920
from one field to another, but you can port them

796
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,800
in that you have to make certain adaptations

797
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,440
to use them in a new place.

798
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,760
So for example, jokes, pattern recognition.

799
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,280
How many jokes, you have an incident that happens,

800
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,360
you have a tiny variation on the first incident.

801
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,800
So two incidents sets up an expectation.

802
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,400
The third one treats the first two formally,

803
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,720
and then does something completely absurd,

804
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,640
which you didn't realize also fits the pattern.

805
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,680
That doesn't sound like a joke,

806
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,520
but the number of Jewish jokes

807
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,360
that that unpacks to is enormous.

808
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,560
These days, we're all investors,

809
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
trying to be smart with our money

810
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
despite our worst impulses.

811
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,320
But at iShares, we believe that deep down inside

812
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,000
of every investor is a better investor.

813
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,920
One that's just waiting to be let out.

814
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,200

817
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,640
You know what I love about fantasy sports?

818
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
Is that even though I'm not gonna be a great basketball player

819
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,720
or a baseball player or a football player or whatever,

820
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,880
I feel like I get to participate and make decisions

821
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,240
and use my knowledge of these different leagues too,

822
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,040
or these different sports to compete.

823
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
So it's like I can pick my team

824
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,920
or I can pick my favorite players,

825
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,080
and I could use my knowledge to make predictions

826
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,400
and maybe even make money.

827
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
So with the basketball season here,

828
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,560
you can now pick combo projections

829
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,920
across football and basketball

830
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,560
from the Specials League on prize picks.

831
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,240
This is a league created specifically

832
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,880
for combo projections that include two or more players

833
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
from different sports or leagues.

834
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,120
Want to play alongside some of prize picks' favorite players

835
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,000
like rapper Meek Mill and comedian Andrew Schultz,

836
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,640
who's also been a guest on this podcast,

837
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,880
and I've been a guest on his.

838
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
You can now find community plays

839
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,320
under the promos tab of the app to view entries

840
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,480
for some of the biggest names

841
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,680
in the prize picks community each week.

842
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,560
Look, prize picks even offers a reboot policy

843
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,080
so that your entries stay in play,

844
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,840
even if one of your players gets injured.

845
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,160
For football and basketball games,

846
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,680
if you have a player who exits the game

847
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,280
in the first half and does not return in the second,

848
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,000
that player is rebooted.

849
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,680
Prize picks is the only daily fantasy sports platform

850
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,920
with an injury insurance policy.

851
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,200
What?

852
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,040
So I love playing it.

853
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,720
I love anywhere where I can use analytical ability

854
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,640
with my interests to demonstrate some skill

855
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,080
and maybe make some money.

856
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,880
And I like the game-like aspect.

857
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,680
I do wish they had chess as a category on prizepicks.com,

858
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,840
but I'll set up for what they've got.

859
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Maybe I should make my own fantasy chess league.

860
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,840
But in any case, I love prizepicks.

861
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Go to prizepicks.com slash James,

862
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,080
use code James for a first deposit match up to $100.

863
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,240
That's the easiest hundred dollars you're ever gonna make.

864
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,760
So that's prizepicks.com slash James and use code James.

865
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,040
Daily fantasy sports made easy.

866
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:11,960
The future of learning is definitely online.

867
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
Like it's such BS that you have to spend $200,000

868
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,080
or take $200,000 in loans and go to some fancy school

869
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,680
when it's useless.

870
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
It doesn't guarantee you a job.

871
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,320
Most employers, including me,

872
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,240
do not care about degrees or grades or anything like that.

873
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,640
We wanna care that you love what you're doing,

874
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,160
that you know what you're doing,

875
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,880
in some cases that you have experience

876
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
or that you're rolling to learn.

877
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,920
But people in general love learning and are curious.

878
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,200
Like the key to success is curiosity.

879
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,440
And I think masterclass.com is the perfect model

880
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,520
for online learning.

881
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm really happy they're sponsoring this episode.

882
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,640
If you're gonna give a gift, give the gift of learning.

883
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,400
Masterclass makes a meaningful gift this season

884
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,320
for you and anyone on your list

885
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,040
because both of you can learn from the best

886
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,560
to become your best from leadership

887
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,200
to effective communication to cooking.

888
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
Let me tell you some of the classes I've taken.

889
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,240
I've taken comedy from Steve Martin.

890
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,760
I mean, can you believe I can take a class

891
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
from Steve Martin on comedy or Judd Apatow,

892
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,480
my favorite comedy director.

893
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,080
I could take an actual class from him on writing.

894
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,440
Wolfgang Puck on cooking, Dan Brown on writing

895
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,280
or Judy Bloom who's been on this podcast on writing.

896
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,000
By the way, Wolfgang Puck also has been on this podcast.

897
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,960
It's such a pleasure.

898
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,480
I try to take classes all the time from masterclass.com.

899
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,240
And whether you're watching masterclass on TV

900
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
or listening in audio mode in the app or on their site,

901
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,440
the quality speaks for itself.

902
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,600
It's like these masterclass instructors

903
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,920
are your own personal mentors that are going to help you

904
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,480
reach the next level.

905
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,480
How much would it cost to take one-on-one classes

906
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,200
on comedy from Steve Martin

907
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,880
or on chess from Gary Kasparov?

908
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,440
You just wouldn't be able to do it.

909
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,360
But I mean, it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

910
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,480
With a masterclass annual membership,

911
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,600
it's $10 a month.

912
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,040
Membership started $120 a year for unlimited access

913
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,960
to one-on-one classes with all 180-plus

914
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,560
masterclass instructors.

915
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,280
So it's not just $120 for one instructor.

916
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,560
You get all 180-plus masterclass instructors.

917
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Boost your confidence and find practical takeaways

918
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,320
you can apply to your life and at work.

919
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,240
And if you own a business or a team leader,

920
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,160
use masterclass to empower and create future-ready

921
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
employees and leaders,

922
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,560
that's the real education in today's world.

923
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,720
So this holiday season,

924
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,840
you can give one annual membership

925
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,680
and get one free at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

926
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,360
J-A-S, of course, stands for the James Altucher Show.

927
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,920
So right now you can get two memberships

928
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,600
for the price of one at masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

929
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,760
Masterclass.com slash J-A-S.

930
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,000
Offer terms apply.

931
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,320
So on the one hand, you could be a classic stand-up 20 years

932
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,520
writing down jokes and getting that formula,

933
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,760
or you could have lots of experiences in life

934
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,200
where this actually happens and you just say what happened

935
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,080
and that also works.

936
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,520
Right, or like particular words or sounds

937
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,040
have more humor value.

938
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,360
So people have commented numerous times

939
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,960
that the word pants or pickle or igloo,

940
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,840
these things are funny, they shouldn't be.

941
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,360
But if you have a choice of which word to use

942
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,720
and what cadence and there are all sorts of techniques

943
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,480
that I guess if you can talk to somebody

944
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,280
who really appreciates craft,

945
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,600
they can give you a huge leg up where a joke

946
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,960
that's sort of an okay joke that you might tell at a party

947
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,360
can be really souped up by somebody who's fantastic.

948
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,120
I just saw Joe Rogan rework the same joke

949
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,360
about wrestling four times, it's the same joke,

950
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,400
but you'd never recognize the thing,

951
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440
he just mutates it until he gets it right.

952
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,800
There's a great example of Jim Gaffigan

953
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,000
telling on stage the very first joke ever,

954
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,360
there's some joke in hieroglyphics

955
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,760
from thousands of years ago and it's a fart joke.

956
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,320
And Jim Gaffigan retells the joke in his style

957
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,120
and of course it's very funny,

958
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,680
but it has the same kind of structure.

959
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,040
But so it's interesting, so what are,

960
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,360
in terms of this meta learning,

961
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,000
like how do you take one area of life into another?

962
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,520
Do you think there are kind of core principles

963
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
to understand when you're,

964
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,320
because there's a lot of people also take physics

965
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,960
and turned into garbage when they bring it

966
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,080
into self-help or whatever.

967
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,080
So what's maybe some core ways someone can look at being,

968
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,280
taking something that they're expert in or interested in,

969
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,480
bringing it into some other area

970
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,200
where they're in the beginning an imposter,

971
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,320
but they make the jump.

972
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,200
So I'll give you a weird example.

973
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,400
The neutrino was discovered by noticing

974
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,120
that when a neutron is left alone,

975
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,600
it sort of morphs into a proton

976
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,240
after I don't know, half-life of about 12 minutes

977
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,680
or 18 minutes, can't remember.

978
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,960
When you look at the electron that gets shot out

979
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,520
of this neutrino, if you add up the energy

980
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,800
of the proton and the electron,

981
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
it doesn't have as much energy

982
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,640
as the neutron did to begin with.

983
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,520
So it would seem to violate conservation of energy.

984
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,440
Wolfgang Pauli had this crazy idea.

985
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,160
He said, I bet there's a secret particle that we can't see

986
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,560
because it's electrically neutral

987
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,840
that's carrying away the missing energy

988
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,240
and we just don't have any ability to trap it.

989
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,040
That was a crazy audacious statement,

990
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,960
but it was necessary to save the principle

991
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
of conservation of energy and momentum.

992
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Okay, let me give you a different puzzle.

993
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,240
Tower Records on Sunset, where I grew up in LA

994
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
and it was the record store that I used to learn.

995
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
It was a music education for me.

996
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
So it closed at some point.

997
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,960
Now, my claim is very often that the invisible world

998
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,280
is discovered by the visible world's failure to close.

999
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,120
That is, in the neutrino case,

1000
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,120
there wasn't enough energy in the proton and the electron

1001
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,560
which are the decay particles

1002
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,520
that you can see from the neutrino.

1003
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,160
So something invisible was happening to carry it on.

1004
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,760
Somebody failed to follow the law.

1005
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,080
There's some missing force, right?

1006
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,080
So in the case of Tower Records, what killed Tower Records?

1007
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,160
I don't know, maybe it was a file sharing network.

1008
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,040
You couldn't see it, but that file sharing network

1009
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,640
might have been what took Tower Records down

1010
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,840
because otherwise it should have been a thriving music store,

1011
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,600
right, or a bird slamming into a glass pane repeatedly.

1012
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,160
It knows that if that was just air,

1013
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,360
it should be able to proceed,

1014
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,200
but something is causing,

1015
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,680
like that window is part of the invisible world

1016
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,480
to the bird.

1017
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,720
So the fact that I'm trying as a bird

1018
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,160
to fly in a straight line and not progressing

1019
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,360
is the visible world's failure to close.

1020
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,760
So Tower Records, though,

1021
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,440
could be argued, the internet brought Tower Records.

1022
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,880
So that would be, the internet would be,

1023
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
if you couldn't see it otherwise,

1024
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,800
it would be an invisible force

1025
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,080
which caused Tower Records to go the way of the dot over.

1026
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,360
So when innovation comes,

1027
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,240
when you start to see Tower Records sales going down

1028
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,160
and there's no, and Tower Records has run,

1029
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,400
let's say, magnificently, there's some missing force,

1030
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,480
and then you could say, oh, the missing force,

1031
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,160
if you could figure out the missing force.

1032
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,320
Where's the neutrino?

1033
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,520
Yeah, you could start an online business selling CDs,

1034
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,840
then that's how you could take advantage.

1035
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,840
So that would be a trick that I would learn from physics

1036
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,640
that I would try to apply to commerce,

1037
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,440
which is look for some visible system

1038
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,160
that is failing to behave normally.

1039
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,960
Assume that if it isn't behaving normally,

1040
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,000
there must be some unseen thing

1041
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,240
to go look in the invisible world

1042
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,080
for what is causing the visible world

1043
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,560
to no longer make any sense.

1044
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,680
So for example, another case of this,

1045
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,280
might have been on Twitter,

1046
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,800
where originally all of these people

1047
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,920
who were very influential were finding each other

1048
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,280
and amplifying each other's voices

1049
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,080
as a real challenge to the mainstream media.

1050
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,520
And at some point, we noticed

1051
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,080
that we stopped seeing each other's tweets.

1052
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,720
Like we just didn't see them.

1053
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,720
And sometime later, this guy, James O'Keefe,

1054
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,520
who does this undercover stuff,

1055
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
you don't have to love him, you can hate him.

1056
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,640
But one of the things he recorded was people saying,

1057
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,680
oh yes, we downrank the bad people on Twitter.

1058
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,080
Like downranking?

1059
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,520
What's that?

1060
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,080
Oh, well, we use the algorithms to sort of suppress,

1061
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,840
to downregulate their tweets

1062
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,040
in favor of other people's tweets.

1063
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,080
And so maybe you discover

1064
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,160
that somebody's got their finger on the scales

1065
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,600
because you know what the visible world should do

1066
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,880
in the absence of somebody tampering

1067
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,160
with the measurement equipment.

1068
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,360
So I love this idea of looking for the missing force

1069
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,080
or using this metaphor.

1070
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,200
Where's the neutrino?

1071
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
Yeah, where is the neutrino?

1072
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,640
I love that.

1073
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,160
So what's something?

1074
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,000
Do you want another one?

1075
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,080
Yeah, yeah, I want 10 more.

1076
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,640
All right, so here's another one.

1077
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,480
Whenever you have something that you think

1078
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,640
is just going to be beautiful,

1079
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,040
and it's a very naive hope,

1080
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,680
almost always your hope will be dashed

1081
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,720
because it's too naive.

1082
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,200
So instead of just getting upset about it,

1083
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,200
the next thing to do is to measure the failure

1084
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,640
of your original hope to obtain in the world.

1085
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,360
Like how badly did it go wrong?

1086
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,920
How do I measure how badly it's off?

1087
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,920
And then once you have that,

1088
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,440
make that new object the centerpiece of a new theory

1089
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,240
and you'll actually build something much more beautiful

1090
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,800
than the original theory ever was.

1091
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,200
So here's a simple example.

1092
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,600
You're at the equator and you want to go north

1093
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,920
and you notice that you have a compass

1094
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,120
and the compass points north.

1095
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,360
Well, magnetic north is an excellent proxy for true north

1096
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,400
right up until you get to Canada

1097
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,880
and then it starts to get lousy.

1098
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,680
And you know, if you're up on Ellesmere's Island

1099
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,720
or something way up in the north,

1100
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,880
you can actually have magnetic north 180 degrees

1101
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,440
off of true north, yeah?

1102
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,360
So what is that object?

1103
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,960
The object that measures that failure

1104
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,320
is called the angle of declination.

1105
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,280
So making the angle of declination,

1106
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,400
the centerpiece of a magnetic navigation

1107
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,640
is the right thing to do.

1108
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,320
Or a different one would be,

1109
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,520
you know, we were just talking about this on Joe Rogan.

1110
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,480
If you have a normal staircase

1111
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,160
and you go up one set of stairs

1112
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,320
and you come down another set of stairs

1113
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,360
let's say made by the same people at the same heights,

1114
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,280
you might expect that it's the same number of stairs

1115
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,400
going up as going down.

1116
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,880
But in the Escher staircase,

1117
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,960
if you have that in your mind or the Penrose stairs,

1118
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,280
you can sort of see that you can keep going up

1119
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,880
and then you get back to where you started.

1120
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,080
Well, something is clearly wrong about that.

1121
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,440
The idea that the number of steps up

1122
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,760
is the number of steps down fails to be true

1123
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,160
in that picture.

1124
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,920
And the thing that measures that failure,

1125
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,680
like how badly did my naive hope fail

1126
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,800
might be called the holonomia or the curvature

1127
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,040
in mathematics.

1128
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,640
So you make the holonomia or the curvature

1129
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,960
the centerpiece of your theory.

1130
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,680
And in fact, in physics,

1131
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,320
two of our three most important equations,

1132
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,960
Einstein's equation and the modern version

1133
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,840
of Maxwell's equations are based on a curvature object,

1134
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,520
which is measuring this failure of steps to behave

1135
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,200
in a regular fashion.

1136
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,760
And the more they go towards the Escher staircase,

1137
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,480
the more the curvature is intense

1138
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,920
and that would be perceived by us in some system

1139
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,600
as greater electromagnetic field strength.

1140
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,080
So let me try to understand the Escher example

1141
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,800
because what resulted, of course,

1142
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,960
in one way of looking at it was Escher's works of art

1143
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,880
is all based on this idea that you could look at something

1144
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,160
that looks like it's following the laws of physics,

1145
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,960
but it's not and that's what creates the beauty of it.

1146
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,640
So do you think that was part of his creative process?

1147
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,840
Is like, how can I break this law of nature

1148
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,920
and create something beautiful as a result?

1149
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
Well, he was playing at many different levels.

1150
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,040
So for example, the stairs that he creates,

1151
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,480
are they possible or are they impossible?

1152
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,520
Well, you can actually create a model

1153
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,920
and take a photograph of it

1154
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,600
and it will look exactly like the Escher stairs.

1155
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,040
So you can actually see the effect with real objects

1156
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,960
provided the camera is positioned in the right way.

1157
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,600
Now, does it have the effect that the system

1158
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,880
is actually closed and it goes around and around?

1159
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,080
No, but in a system where you actually have curvature,

1160
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,040
like on a sphere, like normally you think

1161
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,000
if I turn 90 degrees, walk a distance,

1162
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,480
turn 90 degrees, walk a distance, same distance,

1163
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,960
turn 90 degrees, walk the same distance,

1164
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,080
I'd have to turn 90 degrees

1165
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,200
and walk the same distance yet again.

1166
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,880
But if I did it from the north pole to the equator,

1167
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,200
then I turned 90 degrees and I walked along the equator

1168
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
for about a quarter of its circumference

1169
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,000
and I turned 90 degrees again and walked the same distance,

1170
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,560
I'd be back at the north pole

1171
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,000
and instead of having done a square,

1172
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,840
I would have done a triangle, right?

1173
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,000
So because of the curvature of the earth,

1174
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,840
that naive rule about needing to turn four separate times

1175
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,040
to get back to where you started is not true.

1176
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,880
You only have to turn three separate times.

1177
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,760
Now, in part what Escher was really doing

1178
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,520
was playing with the curvature of a curve system,

1179
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,480
the optical illusion in a flat system.

1180
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,320
There was a lot going on in that example.

1181
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,320
And so it's both an illustration of a real phenomena

1182
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,760
that we see in electromagnetism.

1183
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,920
It's an optical illusion, it's an invitation to curvature,

1184
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,880
it's presenting curvature in a flat world.

1185
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,680
There's so much happening there

1186
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,360
that it's not easy to pull apart

1187
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,400
and that's why it was fascinating as a subject.

1188
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,320
And I think Escher was very knowledgeable about mathematics

1189
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,160
and what he did was he used it as a source,

1190
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,600
but he combined enough of our world and our imagination

1191
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,880
that he really excited the human spirit.

1192
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,560
He took something that was very austere

1193
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,560
and perhaps forbidding and he made it warm and inviting.

1194
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,720
So let's say I'm trying to figure out different ways

1195
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,640
to make this functional.

1196
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,360
Let's say, you mentioned earlier,

1197
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,520
a lot of people create something

1198
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,640
that they think is beautiful

1199
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,760
and they're usually wrong.

1200
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,760
So for instance, anybody who begins the process of writing

1201
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,640
and they've never written before,

1202
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,320
there's a certain arrogance that they think,

1203
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,440
but they have to have this arrogance to write the book,

1204
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,680
their very first book.

1205
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,280
There's certain arrogance to think,

1206
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,440
oh, I'm gonna write a book and it's gonna be great.

1207
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,560
Because it's the first time they're writing it

1208
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,120
and other people have written for far longer

1209
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,800
and learned different skills and so on.

1210
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,800
But how could someone beginning any skill acquisition

1211
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,480
and let's just pick out writing,

1212
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,480
use this idea of this neutrino metaphor

1213
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,560
to kind of push the envelope a little bit

1214
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,400
to measure where the value is.

1215
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,800
Well, I don't know, it's a great improv challenge,

1216
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,120
but let me try to accept it.

1217
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,440
Let's take J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter.

1218
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,280
Okay.

1219
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,360
She wrote a book for the very first time

1220
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,080
and it was the biggest hit ever.

1221
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,360
Right.

1222
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,220
So what was the missing neutrino that she sort of found?

1223
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,560
Well, I don't think that that,

1224
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,880
where was the naive hope that was dashed?

1225
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,560
Well, she did write a book that her,

1226
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,320
the first 20 or so publishers rejected.

1227
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,280
So nobody thought it was good and...

1228
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Well, that's a different thing.

1229
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,120
Yeah.

1230
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,960
That has to do with anything truly new

1231
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,520
will be compared to the old.

1232
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,560
And if it's new enough,

1233
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,520
it will always be found wanting by the standards of the old.

1234
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,680
So this is the same problem with Bohemian Rhapsody.

1235
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,000
It's like what we're gonna do

1236
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,480
with like a seven minute fake opera song

1237
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,840
to be played on rock radio stations.

1238
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,040
Obviously it's either the dumbest idea of all time

1239
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,000
or it's the greatest idea in rock and roll, right?

1240
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,520
And so something new being rejected,

1241
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,600
I don't think fits this,

1242
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,740
but let me accept your gambit of the writer.

1243
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,580
Okay.

1244
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,240
So imagine that you say,

1245
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,360
oh, I'm a genius writer.

1246
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,680
I'm just gonna sit down

1247
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
and the brilliance is gonna come

1248
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,000
and first draft is always amazing.

1249
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,920
Okay.

1250
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,820
So you write your short story to a two pager, right?

1251
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,860
And then you show it to your friend as a professional.

1252
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,700
And your friend takes one look at it and says,

1253
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,660
look, you're bloated over here.

1254
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,780
You're anemic over here.

1255
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,260
Let me do some stuff.

1256
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,900
And she fixes it before she sends you back

1257
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,420
and you do 18 revisions.

1258
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,700
Now, the object that would be the thing

1259
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,980
that measures the difference between your naive hope

1260
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,580
and the reality that seems to be true

1261
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,220
would be the diff file.

1262
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,660
How much did the file change between the first offer

1263
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,380
and the final product that everybody agrees to be good?

1264
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,620
Well, you might notice that if you define the diff file

1265
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,340
for each project,

1266
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,980
that you always start off using the same crappy,

1267
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,500
flabby words or lots of wiggle words

1268
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,620
or way too poetic or way too anemic.

1269
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,780
Who knows?

1270
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,820
Once you start noticing what it is

1271
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,180
that you always do at first,

1272
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,140
you can then say,

1273
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,980
I'm gonna try to write around my diff file,

1274
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,500
which is I always use the word thoroughly too much

1275
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,740
or basically,

1276
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,700
that you notice how often people use the word

1277
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,500
basically in their speech.

1278
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,980
So, a public speaker might look at all of their ticks

1279
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,980
and then say, I'm gonna create a file,

1280
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,020
an audio file that just looks at all of my verbal ticks.

1281
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,460
Once you start focusing just on your ticks,

1282
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,780
you have something to minimize.

1283
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,580
You could put it into an objective function.

1284
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,740
Okay, and so...

1285
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,620
So, that would be an example of,

1286
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,340
I naively think I'm a genius at everything that I say

1287
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,740
or write is instantly brilliant.

1288
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,980
You notice that that's not true.

1289
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,100
Then you figure out how things revise over time

1290
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,420
as you go through that cycle.

1291
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,740
Then you start studying the object

1292
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,100
that measures the revisions.

1293
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,900
And then you try to minimize that object

1294
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,540
so you become a better writer from the get go.

1295
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,180
And so, in your case with the writer,

1296
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,020
and you've addressed this before,

1297
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,180
the idea of somebody who is self-taught

1298
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,140
than having something to be able to teach.

1299
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,220
But in your example of the writer,

1300
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,780
he still had to go to it,

1301
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,500
or she had to go to an expert

1302
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,580
who helped create that diff file for the first time.

1303
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,980
Do you think that's necessary to find,

1304
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,940
so this is deliberate practice?

1305
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,180
You need feedback loops.

1306
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,220
Sometimes you could manage your own.

1307
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,900
And sometimes you need somebody to be on you

1308
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,540
and to point out that you're actually avoiding

1309
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,620
the negative in the feedback that you're getting

1310
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,340
or that you're misinterpreting the positive.

1311
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,500
And so, the other question is,

1312
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,540
is that then is that person who's getting the feedback

1313
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,260
just forcing you into conformity?

1314
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,420
And so, okay, you know, this person's saying,

1315
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,620
you know, you use basically too much.

1316
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,900
Real writers don't do that.

1317
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,460
And now you're moving back into conformity.

1318
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,860
Well, hopefully the person is pushing you back

1319
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,300
into conformity where you need conformity

1320
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,660
and pushing you into brilliance where your edge is.

1321
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,060
But the idea that you should either be brilliant

1322
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,580
and different in everything that you do or not

1323
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,580
is preposterous.

1324
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,780
So, you know, I often give people the advice

1325
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,020
that if their ideas are truly radical,

1326
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,300
they should dress very conservatively.

1327
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,140
Why?

1328
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,820
Because, you know, you can't afford to turn everything

1329
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,260
up to 11 without distracting the hell out

1330
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,180
of whoever you're trying to reach.

1331
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,420
That reminds me of,

1332
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,540
did you ever see the Eric Andre show?

1333
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,380
No.

1334
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,940
Okay, so it's basically,

1335
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,660
the premise is it's a late night talk show

1336
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,940
in a bodega, in the back of a bodega.

1337
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,060
And, but it's a spoof, but nobody knows it's a spoof.

1338
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,420
So, celebrities have gone on this show

1339
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,580
not knowing that Eric Andre is just gonna do

1340
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,500
something completely insane that's gonna freak them out.

1341
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,220
And what's fascinating is every component

1342
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,460
of a late night show is in the format.

1343
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,020
So, he's got a band, he's got a sidekick,

1344
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,180
he's got a desk, he's got notes,

1345
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,060
he's reading off the notes like David Letterman.

1346
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,220
It looks exactly like the format of the David Letterman

1347
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,740
or Johnny Carson show, but he changes this one thing

1348
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,940
in that he's gonna make fun of the guest in some way.

1349
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,900
And so, to what you were saying,

1350
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,460
keep the format, change one thing,

1351
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,340
and now you could have brilliance.

1352
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,580
Sometimes it's one thing, sometimes it's several things.

1353
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,980
If it's several things though,

1354
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,220
it might be so far from the original.

1355
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,100
Like, let's take the matrix.

1356
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,540
So, the matrix when it first came out was very fresh.

1357
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,700
What did it do?

1358
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,380
Well, first of all, it used CGI at some level

1359
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,020
that we hadn't seen before.

1360
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,900
So, it was computer generated in the extreme for its time.

1361
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,220
It used Hong Kong wire work on non-Chinese,

1362
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,340
non-Asian actors.

1363
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,980
It used the bullet time system of using a bunch

1364
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,980
of still cameras arrayed in like a semi-circle

1365
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,860
to give a movie sense of like a flip book

1366
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,780
as you were going around the subject

1367
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,140
of somebody who's in mid-air.

1368
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,260
So, just take like those three things.

1369
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,120
Those things were all so different from each other

1370
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,580
that you could never tell what was happening exactly.

1371
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,240
Was it some new photographic innovation?

1372
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,780
Was it an acrobatic innovation?

1373
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,100
Was it a computer innovation?

1374
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,780
Other than that, the storyline was very much

1375
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,780
in a kind of a revealed narrative arc heroes journey story.

1376
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,620
Right.

1377
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:02,500
So, I would say that was the exact heroes journey

1378
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,660
and they changed one thing,

1379
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,860
which is technically how we make the movie.

1380
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,020
But what I'm trying to say is that one thing

1381
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,180
had multiple components.

1382
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,020
So, then I just gave you three.

1383
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,660
In other words, it's not the case

1384
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,380
that you can only choose one thing,

1385
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,340
but you have to have it be balanced

1386
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,260
between that which people expect

1387
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,420
and that which confounds.

1388
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,940
And I think I remember reading Leonard Feather,

1389
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,940
the jazz writer, talking about studies that were done

1390
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,660
that said that in improvisation,

1391
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,740
the audience is always making a guess

1392
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,820
as to what's about to happen next.

1393
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,420
His claim was that if the audience guesses right

1394
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,620
about half the time, they find it fascinating.

1395
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,900
If they guess right all the time, they find it boring.

1396
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
And if they guess right none of the time,

1397
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,340
they think it's modern jazz and they couldn't care less.

1398
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,300
Right, so you have to keep some of the structure.

1399
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,220
So, Tower Records had to keep some of their structure.

1400
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,660
They had to say, okay, we still sell music,

1401
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,860
but now we're gonna do it online.

1402
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,700
That was the missing-

1403
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,180
Well, IBM would be a good example of something

1404
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,940
that morphed over time to continue

1405
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,260
to be a major player in tech,

1406
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,580
whereas lots of other tech firms couldn't figure out

1407
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,260
how to morph and change.

1408
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,580
You know, what is the abstraction

1409
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,940
of your former business in today's terms?

1410
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,140
So, this idea of a missing force,

1411
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,900
and of course you can't, on the surface,

1412
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,460
the whole concept of this is missing,

1413
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,460
you can't see it's a missing force.

1414
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,860
Where else do you see this in entrepreneurship?

1415
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,740
Where have you seen it successfully played out?

1416
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,660
Well, very often, if you can notice

1417
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:39,260
that there is a missing need

1418
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,260
that people hadn't really.

1419
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,540
And that's like an insight.

1420
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,660
So, like Steve Jobs saying,

1421
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,980
every home is gonna have a micro-computer.

1422
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,060
You know, the missing force and computing for him

1423
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,420
was why can't I have it all the time?

1424
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,260
Or maybe the idea is that,

1425
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,620
hey, I've also noticed that not only do I know

1426
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,340
that there's going to be a computer everywhere,

1427
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,140
but that it's going to be so integrated into your life

1428
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,300
that the design feature of this,

1429
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,300
that tech people never get right,

1430
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,100
is my chance to add value.

1431
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,540
And I'm gonna bring elegance

1432
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,860
and canonical aspects of design

1433
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,380
to something that has to be integrated

1434
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,500
into the very fabric of your being.

1435
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,780
So we welcomed Apple in in part

1436
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,140
because it flattered our sense of ourselves

1437
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,940
that we are elegant, we are spare, we are courageous.

1438
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,260
We think different as they told us.

1439
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,780
And still to this day, like kids get the iPhone

1440
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,260
because culturally that look,

1441
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,460
that's the coolest phone to get.

1442
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,340
Although in post Tim Cook's chillings

1443
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,820
or welly in speech about things having no home

1444
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:52,060
on his platform, my God,

1445
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,100
how many of the people that Apple has held up to us

1446
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,700
when they told us to think different

1447
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,700
would be reviled right now as being hateful to somebody?

1448
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,500
I just don't know.

1449
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,500
No, and it's scary when you're not a Tim Cook,

1450
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,140
when you're not an Apple, when you're just yourself,

1451
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,860
it's scary going up against the monster

1452
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,180
of kind of this conformist group think somehow.

1453
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,940
And I'll get to that in a second,

1454
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:28,660
but I'm still very interested in this skill acquisition aspect.

1455
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:33,020
What kind of core, you always talk about core principles

1456
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,220
or first principles, what sort of first principles

1457
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,060
or basics do you think someone needs

1458
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:44,060
to develop that muscle of looking for the missing force,

1459
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,660
the neutrino.

1460
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,860
So obviously Wolfgang Pauley,

1461
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,180
he had a background in physics.

1462
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,820
He was able to kind of say,

1463
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,860
huh, it didn't follow this law, something has to be there.

1464
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,820
And Tower Records, they didn't have that.

1465
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,740
Sales are declining, we're running the company great.

1466
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,900
Sales should be going up before running the company great

1467
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,540
and people are listening to music.

1468
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,540
See, they somehow they missed the missing force.

1469
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,500
Sure.

1470
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,820
I mean, I think the one thing you could do

1471
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:14,620
is you can just say, make a note to yourself.

1472
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,940
I'm about to have a conversation with Jane.

1473
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
I wonder what's gonna happen.

1474
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,340
I think it's gonna go well.

1475
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,940
And you have a conversation with Jane

1476
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,900
and it ends up with Jane yelling at you,

1477
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,380
get out of my office.

1478
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,220
Okay, well, is that something that typically happens

1479
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,980
that you think you're gonna go into a conversation

1480
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,420
and you think it's gonna go great

1481
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,340
and somebody gets really angry at you?

1482
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,940
You could find somebody who repeats the same error

1483
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,700
over and over again and never gets metacognitive or curious.

1484
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,220
So one thing I would say is before you start trying

1485
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,180
to do anything new, if you find that you're frustrated

1486
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,980
in your life and that you can't get past certain objects

1487
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,700
or obstacles, just learn how to do this thing

1488
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,740
I call watching your robot.

1489
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,500
So most of what gets you through a day,

1490
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,660
you're not even thinking about it.

1491
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,340
You don't think about how to put one foot in front

1492
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,300
of the other because you learned to walk ages ago.

1493
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,900
As you learn all of these things, they become automated.

1494
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:13,260
So a really interesting activity is to just watch

1495
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,380
your body and your brain make mistakes.

1496
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,580
Like for example, I ordered a burger for lunch

1497
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,860
and it came with fries and I said to myself,

1498
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,860
they always give me fries and I always eat them

1499
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,780
and I always regret it.

1500
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,100
And then I watched myself eat the fries

1501
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,060
after having that thought.

1502
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,580
And instead of trying to get myself not to eat the fries,

1503
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,100
I said, I'm just gonna watch myself being an idiot.

1504
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,300
Isn't it interesting that my robot is just

1505
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,420
in an automated mode making a decision

1506
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,900
that I've decided to do the opposite of

1507
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,580
and my robot is winning?

1508
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,740
Well, that doesn't sound very encouraging at the beginning

1509
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,500
but I guarantee you three times of having

1510
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,380
that conversation with myself,

1511
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,020
eventually I can't stand to watch my robot

1512
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,700
take over the ship anymore.

1513
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,240
So it seems like you're saying,

1514
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,100
have a mental model, given a situation

1515
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,140
and maybe it's a high-stakes situation.

1516
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,060
Like you're gonna write a book or run a business

1517
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,380
or run a particle accelerator and see what happens.

1518
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,220
So given a high-stakes situation,

1519
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,900
build a mental model beforehand

1520
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,340
of what you think should happen.

1521
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,620
Let's say you're going in to have a discussion

1522
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,020
with your boss or your girlfriend or whatever.

1523
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,180
See what happens if there's a difference

1524
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,940
and if there's a difference and view that difference

1525
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,820
as kind of a robot that you're observing from higher

1526
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,460
and then you see that difference enough

1527
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,740
and you're feeling bad about it,

1528
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,140
the solution maybe is some innovation

1529
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,780
or some beautiful solution.

1530
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,460
Or just getting control of the situation.

1531
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,020
Don't start off with the big meeting

1532
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,580
or the big project or the big deal

1533
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,780
because usually mostly what we're doing wrong is fractal

1534
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,300
and if you're blowing big deals,

1535
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,580
you're probably blowing little transactions,

1536
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,900
buying a candy bar at the bodega.

1537
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,580
You're probably screwing that up too at some level.

1538
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,060
And maybe you're too friendly,

1539
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,900
maybe you're not friendly enough, I don't know.

1540
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,660
But definitely find the cheapest places to practice

1541
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,020
because there's no sense learning

1542
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,540
in the highest stakes environment possible.

1543
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,940
So let's take this to you coining the phrase

1544
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,460
the intellectual dark web.

1545
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:23,700
You felt free to express opinions

1546
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,700
among the select group of friends and colleagues.

1547
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,780
You chose to be around you on a daily basis.

1548
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,980
You feel comfortable saying what you think

1549
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,900
because they don't slander you for it

1550
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,140
or ruin your career for it.

1551
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,260
I don't feel comfortable saying what I think.

1552
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,340
I just can't stop.

1553
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:45,460
The World of Technology

1554
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,020
It's storming every industry

1555
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,780
and literally billions of dollars are being invested.

1556
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,140
So buckle up.

1557
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,540
The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed

1558
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,500
and processing power.

1559
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,220
So how do you compete without cost spiraling out of control?

1560
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,260
It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud,

1561
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,300
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI.

1562
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,060
OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure,

1563
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,340
database, application development and AI needs.

1564
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,580
OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds,

1565
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,180
offers one consistent price

1566
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,220
instead of variable regional pricing.

1567
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,100
And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.

1568
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,020
So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed

1569
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,500
and less than half the cost of other clouds.

1570
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,220
If you want to do more and spend less like Uber,

1571
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,300
eight by eight and Databricks Mosaic,

1572
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,580
take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash advance.

1573
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,100
That's oracle.com slash advance.

1574
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,300
Oracle.com slash advance.
