00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
It can be difficult to calculate the size of a wild population,

00:04.200 --> 00:07.400
but thankfully, there are statistical techniques available

00:07.400 --> 00:10.000
to estimate how big populations are.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And today, I'm going to put one of those to test in the real world.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
So, I have come to the Royal Statistical Society's annual conference.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
This is the biggest statistics conference in the UK.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
There are a lot of statisticians here.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
But how many are there, right? That's exactly what we're going to do.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
We're going to try and estimate the current population size of statisticians

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
by sampling them in their natural habitat.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I've found quite a large group of statisticians.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
They're currently feeding.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Unfortunately, this is not all of them.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And statisticians don't all come together to feed or sunbathe or nest.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So, unlike some animals,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
where you can just wait until they're all together and count them all,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
for statisticians, we're going to have to do something a bit more clever.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
We're going to have to do a classic capture, recapture estimation.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
To help me with the experiment,

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm joined by stand-up masses resident statistician, Jen Rogers,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
who is also one of the vice presidents of the Royal Statistical Society.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
So, she is technically working right now.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
OK. Very quickly, how would you explain capture-recapture?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So, you take a sample of people.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
You mark them in some way.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Then you release them back into the wild.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
You leave a little bit of time for them to get mingled back in again.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And then you recapture them and you count how many are actually marked.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
OK. And to mark our statisticians, we've brought some stickers.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And the plan is just to take these and put them on the back of the conference badge.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Stick it. Easy.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
We're going to go around.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Behind us is the poster session at the conference,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
where people are presenting their statistical findings in poster form.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
We're going to label every single person here.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Let's do it.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So, why have we picked the poster session?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, if we'd gone through one of the talks,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
we would have only had a particular type of statistician.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So, it might be medical or environmental.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
By choosing the poster session,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
we're hoping that we're going to get a random mix

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
across all of the different statisticians that are here.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
And there are a couple of other assumptions that we need to make

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
when doing this capture-recapture.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
We're going to assume that no one leaves the conference

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
in the time that it takes for us to recapture.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
And we're going to assume as well that nobody else comes in.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So, we need to make sure that the numbers are staying around constant,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
which is a pretty reasonable assumption at this conference.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And when we do our resampling,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
we need to make sure that we also do that randomly.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
We're going to be doing that later on in the day.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
There are other options than just capture, mark, release, recapture.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
You can do it several times for a more accurate result.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Here, I have a population of confectionary children.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't know how many are in here. There's just over a kilogram of them.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm going to sample them several times

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
to try and estimate this population.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
So, my first sampling is going to be this many.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
That is... You know what? I'm going to label them and chuck them back in.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Five and 15, 17.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
OK, so I know my first capture was 17.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
They've all been marked, except I've numbered them from one to 17.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So, when I recapture them, I will know exactly which one is,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and I can actually keep track over several recapturings

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
which ones have been captured how many times.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So, I'll have the recapture frequency. So, here's my next sample.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Here we go. And I've got one again.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
So, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
thirteen, fourteen, seventeen again.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Wow, that is a consistent scoop.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
And I'm going to number... That one's now 18.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Thirty.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
OK, so, I've just relabeled all the ones that came out a second ago,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and there are two new ones.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
So, I've got a... That's a 14.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Wow, that is not very clear.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I've got a 14. That's come out a second time.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And number one has come out a second time.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So, I'm going to increase both of those.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
14 now goes up to two captures.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
One goes up to two captures.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
So, I've now had an additional 15 that I found for the first time.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
And so, that brings us up to 32,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
which have been uniquely labelled.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
And so, I'm going to add all of those into my tally.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm now going to do this for as many times as I can be bothered.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
We're going to go for 10. So, we've done two so far.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
We've got a frequency table for how often each one has been captured.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Now, I've got all of my stats.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
We're going to crunch them and see if we can calculate

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
how many confectionary offspring are in that bowl.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
OK, I think I've put most of the data together.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
So, we've got the 10 times we sampled.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And it was an average of 16.9.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So, 17 suites per sample.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And then, 48 of them were only picked out once.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
42 were picked twice.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
10 were picked three times.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Two were picked four times.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And then, none.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Zero were picked five or more times.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I've put that into a bar chart.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Here are the ones that were picked once, twice, three times, four times.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And then, that's it.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And there's a missing column here

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
for the ones that were picked zero times.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
That's what we don't know.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
We've got to try and extend this distribution somehow

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
to work out how big zero is.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
We could do something clever, like a Frisson distribution

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
or a geometric thing.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like everything in statistics, it gets very complicated very quickly

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and I am dangerously underqualified.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
So, I have just approximated using probability

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
now that I know the average sample size,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
what distributions I would get for different population sizes.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm just going to guess.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm going to scroll through a bunch,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
find the one that's the closest match to this,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and assume that's it.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So, we know there's at least 102.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So, if I set my population to 102,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
that's the distribution I would expect.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
As you can see, it's way smaller here.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So, obviously, there's more than 102

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
because there's some that we didn't pick at all.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So, it's got up to 150.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Let's see how that looks.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, that's a bit.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
What if I go up to 180?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Oops, too many. 140.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, that's closer.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
They're a little off, they're a little off.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
These are quite close together,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
so I might bring it down this measure.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
130. Ooh!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
That's not bad.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
120.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
No, too small.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
125.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
126.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
140.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
138.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
138.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
My official prediction is 138.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We're now going to count these to see how close we were.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
A Jen is still here,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
so it's going to be...

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
She's dangerously overqualified

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
for counting confectionary children.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
OK, so I figured...

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Not like I had anything better to be doing.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It's like you've got a conference to run.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
OK, here we go.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
So, I reckon we put them in piles of 10.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
OK.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, we can put piles of 10 in the squares.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh, we could.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Let's do 20 per square. OK, here you go.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
OK. So, you're on.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
One, two,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
three, four.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, wow, you're being a lot.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You know it.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's still neat.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Not yet, not yet.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Sorry, I'm 10.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Do you have a minute?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Yes, yes, please.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Sorry. Wait, do you want us to bring them afterwards?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We can...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I can't do it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
OK.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
How many is that?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Ooh, that's got to be two.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
That's a two. That's a two.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I'm going to put them there.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
One, two, three, four.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Seven.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
They're ones that are, like, trap-shy.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Like, they're less likely to get caught.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
That's true. You know, that's an important feat.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I mean, you can exclude it

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
as a... No.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
No, it's the real world.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
These confectionary children.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm just assuming I'm going to be right,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
so I want to do it in a dramatic...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I mean... ...reveal.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh, no.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
No!

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
160.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
160.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
One, two, three, four,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
169.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
That's not 130.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
No, I'm checking my bar chart.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Population of 169, you'd expect.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh, come on!

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
We should have trusted the tale.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah. Didn't trust the tale.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
We should have gone, this is wrong.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
This has not bowed well for our estimation

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
of the number of statisticians.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Uncertainty. You would always put...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Exactly. We've got the error bars.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We're in the room with a final closing.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Plenary sessions about to take place.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
People are just coming in to take their seats.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And we're quite happy that if we take every person

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
on the end of each of the aisles,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
that that should be a pretty good random mix

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
of all the different statisticians.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Let's do it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Give a green sticker.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Is that OK?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
OK.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
David Spiegelholt has started talking,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
so we have to get out because he gets very angry.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
He doesn't, he's lovely.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
So I had eight people with stickers

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
and 22 without stickers.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
OK, I had 13 with stickers.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And 21 with stickers.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
24 without.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
OK, and then there's 21 with stickers.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
So we had a total population...

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm going to add going up of 67.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That's surprisingly close to last time.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Is that good? I don't know.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
The way the equation works out is

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
we assume that what we just did now

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
is work out the proportion of the population

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
we previously stickered.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And so the number of people in the first sample,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
we stickered all of them,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
divided by the total population,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and the second sample, who were stickered,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
divided by the size of the second sample.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Yep.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So if we multiply the first sample size

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
by the second sample size,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
divided by the number of stickers,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
which I'm going to put here,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
so it's 64 times 67,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
divided by 21,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
that is our estimate.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So I'm going to work that out.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Jen actually knows the correct answer.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I do.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Because she's on the organising team.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
So I will...

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Do I have to round to the nearest whole statistician?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, we don't have many half statisticians here.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, if there's anywhere you're going to have

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
a fraction of a person, it's here.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
OK, so...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
OK, so we're going to do, like, a 1, 2, 3 reveal.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yep, sounds good.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
OK, ready? 1, 2, 3,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
204.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
475.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So no.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Get home!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I must have done that wrong.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Did I do the maths wrong?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That's horrific.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Hang on, I'm going to do it logically from the top.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
So we're saying that 21 divided by

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
67,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
we labelled about a third before.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yep.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah, at times about 60 is about 200.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yep.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And what is it, everyone who's here today?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
475 are here today.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
So in conclusion, statistics doesn't work.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
In conclusion, statistics is difficult.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So we got nowhere near it.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
204.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, there are several reasons what could have gone wrong there.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
This is the very end of the conference.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Loads of people have left.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
There are not 475 people still in there.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I mean, people are leaving right now, see?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So 475 was more of an upper bound.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That's the maximum number.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
So if we'd gotten more than that, we'd been worried.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Under that is fine.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And frankly, it's the correct order of magnitude.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I refuse to accept there are 475 people in there.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And I guess more importantly,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
as I was sampling statisticians at the end, they're like,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
oh yes, but actually there's going to be a lot of overlap

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
between the sorts of people who will go to the poster session

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and go to the general plenary.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
They're the ones who are interested in a wide range of things

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and being engaged in the community.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And obviously some people will just come in for their seminars

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or their subsection and go.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And I mean, we could have done a better random sample.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
We could have done a bigger sample.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
We should have done more samples.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
So basically, in conclusion, we didn't put the effort in.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
And when I did do more samples with the confectionary children,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I shouldn't have just eyeballed it.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I shouldn't have done a proper thing.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And that would have revealed that the tail was the bit

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I should have been matching, not the lead to cause.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Anyway, it's been great fun.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Thanks to the Royal Statistical Society for getting me along.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm now doing the after dinner like entertainment

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
at the closing conference dinner.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
That'll be fun.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And thanks to all the Patreon people who fund these things.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So when I get invited to a conference,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I can, you know, bring a camera, make a video, put it online.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Thank you so much for your statistically significant support.
