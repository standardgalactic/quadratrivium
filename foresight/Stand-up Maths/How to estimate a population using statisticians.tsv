0	4200	It can be difficult to calculate the size of a wild population,
4200	7400	but thankfully, there are statistical techniques available
7400	10000	to estimate how big populations are.
10000	14000	And today, I'm going to put one of those to test in the real world.
21000	26000	So, I have come to the Royal Statistical Society's annual conference.
26000	29000	This is the biggest statistics conference in the UK.
29000	32000	There are a lot of statisticians here.
32000	35000	But how many are there, right? That's exactly what we're going to do.
35000	40000	We're going to try and estimate the current population size of statisticians
40000	43000	by sampling them in their natural habitat.
48000	50000	I've found quite a large group of statisticians.
50000	53000	They're currently feeding.
53000	55000	Unfortunately, this is not all of them.
55000	59000	And statisticians don't all come together to feed or sunbathe or nest.
59000	61000	So, unlike some animals,
61000	64000	where you can just wait until they're all together and count them all,
64000	67000	for statisticians, we're going to have to do something a bit more clever.
67000	71000	We're going to have to do a classic capture, recapture estimation.
71000	73000	To help me with the experiment,
73000	77000	I'm joined by stand-up masses resident statistician, Jen Rogers,
77000	81000	who is also one of the vice presidents of the Royal Statistical Society.
81000	83000	So, she is technically working right now.
83000	87000	OK. Very quickly, how would you explain capture-recapture?
87000	89000	So, you take a sample of people.
89000	91000	You mark them in some way.
91000	94000	Then you release them back into the wild.
94000	97000	You leave a little bit of time for them to get mingled back in again.
97000	102000	And then you recapture them and you count how many are actually marked.
102000	106000	OK. And to mark our statisticians, we've brought some stickers.
106000	110000	And the plan is just to take these and put them on the back of the conference badge.
111000	113000	Stick it. Easy.
113000	115000	We're going to go around.
115000	117000	Behind us is the poster session at the conference,
117000	121000	where people are presenting their statistical findings in poster form.
121000	124000	We're going to label every single person here.
124000	126000	Let's do it.
132000	134000	So, why have we picked the poster session?
134000	136000	Well, if we'd gone through one of the talks,
136000	139000	we would have only had a particular type of statistician.
139000	141000	So, it might be medical or environmental.
141000	143000	By choosing the poster session,
143000	145000	we're hoping that we're going to get a random mix
145000	148000	across all of the different statisticians that are here.
148000	150000	And there are a couple of other assumptions that we need to make
150000	152000	when doing this capture-recapture.
152000	155000	We're going to assume that no one leaves the conference
155000	157000	in the time that it takes for us to recapture.
157000	160000	And we're going to assume as well that nobody else comes in.
160000	164000	So, we need to make sure that the numbers are staying around constant,
164000	167000	which is a pretty reasonable assumption at this conference.
167000	169000	And when we do our resampling,
169000	172000	we need to make sure that we also do that randomly.
172000	174000	We're going to be doing that later on in the day.
174000	178000	There are other options than just capture, mark, release, recapture.
178000	181000	You can do it several times for a more accurate result.
181000	184000	Here, I have a population of confectionary children.
184000	187000	I don't know how many are in here. There's just over a kilogram of them.
187000	189000	I'm going to sample them several times
189000	191000	to try and estimate this population.
191000	195000	So, my first sampling is going to be this many.
195000	198000	That is... You know what? I'm going to label them and chuck them back in.
198000	203000	Five and 15, 17.
203000	206000	OK, so I know my first capture was 17.
206000	211000	They've all been marked, except I've numbered them from one to 17.
211000	215000	So, when I recapture them, I will know exactly which one is,
215000	219000	and I can actually keep track over several recapturings
219000	222000	which ones have been captured how many times.
222000	226000	So, I'll have the recapture frequency. So, here's my next sample.
226000	231000	Here we go. And I've got one again.
231000	236000	So, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
236000	238000	thirteen, fourteen, seventeen again.
238000	242000	Wow, that is a consistent scoop.
242000	246000	And I'm going to number... That one's now 18.
246000	248000	Thirty.
248000	254000	OK, so, I've just relabeled all the ones that came out a second ago,
254000	256000	and there are two new ones.
256000	260000	So, I've got a... That's a 14.
260000	262000	Wow, that is not very clear.
262000	264000	I've got a 14. That's come out a second time.
264000	267000	And number one has come out a second time.
267000	270000	So, I'm going to increase both of those.
270000	274000	14 now goes up to two captures.
274000	277000	One goes up to two captures.
277000	282000	So, I've now had an additional 15 that I found for the first time.
282000	288000	And so, that brings us up to 32,
288000	290000	which have been uniquely labelled.
290000	296000	And so, I'm going to add all of those into my tally.
296000	300000	I'm now going to do this for as many times as I can be bothered.
300000	303000	We're going to go for 10. So, we've done two so far.
303000	307000	We've got a frequency table for how often each one has been captured.
319000	321000	Now, I've got all of my stats.
321000	324000	We're going to crunch them and see if we can calculate
324000	329000	how many confectionary offspring are in that bowl.
329000	331000	OK, I think I've put most of the data together.
331000	334000	So, we've got the 10 times we sampled.
334000	336000	And it was an average of 16.9.
336000	339000	So, 17 suites per sample.
339000	343000	And then, 48 of them were only picked out once.
343000	344000	42 were picked twice.
344000	345000	10 were picked three times.
345000	347000	Two were picked four times.
347000	348000	And then, none.
348000	350000	Zero were picked five or more times.
350000	354000	I've put that into a bar chart.
354000	358000	Here are the ones that were picked once, twice, three times, four times.
358000	360000	And then, that's it.
360000	362000	And there's a missing column here
362000	364000	for the ones that were picked zero times.
364000	366000	That's what we don't know.
366000	369000	We've got to try and extend this distribution somehow
369000	371000	to work out how big zero is.
371000	374000	We could do something clever, like a Frisson distribution
374000	376000	or a geometric thing.
376000	379000	Like everything in statistics, it gets very complicated very quickly
379000	381000	and I am dangerously underqualified.
381000	385000	So, I have just approximated using probability
385000	387000	now that I know the average sample size,
387000	390000	what distributions I would get for different population sizes.
390000	392000	I'm just going to guess.
392000	394000	I'm going to scroll through a bunch,
394000	396000	find the one that's the closest match to this,
396000	398000	and assume that's it.
398000	400000	So, we know there's at least 102.
400000	402000	So, if I set my population to 102,
402000	405000	that's the distribution I would expect.
405000	407000	As you can see, it's way smaller here.
407000	409000	So, obviously, there's more than 102
409000	411000	because there's some that we didn't pick at all.
411000	413000	So, it's got up to 150.
413000	416000	Let's see how that looks.
416000	418000	Yeah, that's a bit.
418000	420000	What if I go up to 180?
420000	423000	Oops, too many. 140.
423000	425000	Well, that's closer.
425000	427000	They're a little off, they're a little off.
427000	428000	These are quite close together,
428000	429000	so I might bring it down this measure.
429000	431000	130. Ooh!
431000	433000	That's not bad.
433000	435000	120.
435000	436000	No, too small.
436000	438000	125.
438000	442000	126.
442000	444000	140.
444000	446000	138.
446000	448000	138.
448000	450000	My official prediction is 138.
450000	452000	We're now going to count these to see how close we were.
452000	454000	A Jen is still here,
454000	456000	so it's going to be...
456000	458000	She's dangerously overqualified
458000	460000	for counting confectionary children.
460000	461000	OK, so I figured...
461000	463000	Not like I had anything better to be doing.
463000	465000	It's like you've got a conference to run.
465000	466000	OK, here we go.
466000	468000	So, I reckon we put them in piles of 10.
468000	470000	OK.
470000	472000	Oh, we can put piles of 10 in the squares.
472000	474000	Oh, we could.
474000	476000	Let's do 20 per square. OK, here you go.
476000	478000	OK. So, you're on.
480000	482000	One, two,
482000	484000	three, four.
494000	496000	Oh, wow, you're being a lot.
496000	498000	You know it.
499000	501000	It's still neat.
501000	503000	Not yet, not yet.
503000	505000	Sorry, I'm 10.
505000	507000	Do you have a minute?
507000	509000	Yes, yes, please.
509000	511000	Sorry. Wait, do you want us to bring them afterwards?
511000	513000	We can...
513000	515000	I can't do it.
515000	517000	OK.
522000	524000	How many is that?
524000	526000	Ooh, that's got to be two.
526000	528000	That's a two. That's a two.
528000	530000	I'm going to put them there.
530000	532000	One, two, three, four.
532000	534000	Seven.
534000	536000	They're ones that are, like, trap-shy.
536000	538000	Like, they're less likely to get caught.
538000	540000	That's true. You know, that's an important feat.
540000	542000	I mean, you can exclude it
542000	544000	as a... No.
544000	546000	No, it's the real world.
546000	548000	These confectionary children.
548000	550000	I'm just assuming I'm going to be right,
550000	552000	so I want to do it in a dramatic...
552000	554000	I mean... ...reveal.
554000	558000	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
558000	560000	Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
560000	562000	Oh, no.
562000	564000	No!
564000	567000	11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
567000	569000	160.
571000	573000	160.
573000	575000	One, two, three, four,
575000	578000	five, six, seven, eight, nine.
578000	580000	169.
580000	582000	That's not 130.
582000	584000	No, I'm checking my bar chart.
586000	589000	Population of 169, you'd expect.
589000	591000	Oh, come on!
591000	593000	We should have trusted the tale.
593000	595000	Yeah. Didn't trust the tale.
595000	597000	We should have gone, this is wrong.
597000	599000	Oh.
599000	601000	This has not bowed well for our estimation
601000	603000	of the number of statisticians.
603000	605000	Uncertainty. You would always put...
605000	607000	Exactly. We've got the error bars.
608000	610000	We're in the room with a final closing.
610000	612000	Plenary sessions about to take place.
612000	614000	People are just coming in to take their seats.
614000	616000	And we're quite happy that if we take every person
616000	618000	on the end of each of the aisles,
618000	620000	that that should be a pretty good random mix
620000	622000	of all the different statisticians.
622000	624000	Let's do it.
631000	633000	Give a green sticker.
633000	635000	Is that OK?
640000	642000	OK.
642000	644000	David Spiegelholt has started talking,
644000	646000	so we have to get out because he gets very angry.
646000	648000	He doesn't, he's lovely.
650000	652000	So I had eight people with stickers
652000	655000	and 22 without stickers.
655000	658000	OK, I had 13 with stickers.
658000	660000	And 21 with stickers.
660000	662000	24 without.
662000	665000	OK, and then there's 21 with stickers.
665000	667000	So we had a total population...
667000	671000	I'm going to add going up of 67.
671000	673000	Yeah.
673000	675000	That's surprisingly close to last time.
675000	677000	Is that good? I don't know.
677000	679000	The way the equation works out is
679000	681000	we assume that what we just did now
681000	683000	is work out the proportion of the population
683000	685000	we previously stickered.
685000	687000	And so the number of people in the first sample,
687000	688000	we stickered all of them,
688000	690000	divided by the total population,
690000	692000	and the second sample, who were stickered,
692000	694000	divided by the size of the second sample.
694000	696000	Yep.
696000	698000	So if we multiply the first sample size
698000	699000	by the second sample size,
699000	701000	divided by the number of stickers,
701000	703000	which I'm going to put here,
703000	705000	so it's 64 times 67,
705000	707000	divided by 21,
707000	709000	that is our estimate.
709000	711000	So I'm going to work that out.
711000	713000	Jen actually knows the correct answer.
713000	714000	I do.
714000	716000	Because she's on the organising team.
716000	718000	So I will...
718000	721000	Do I have to round to the nearest whole statistician?
721000	724000	Yeah, we don't have many half statisticians here.
724000	726000	Well, if there's anywhere you're going to have
726000	728000	a fraction of a person, it's here.
728000	730000	OK, so...
732000	734000	OK, so we're going to do, like, a 1, 2, 3 reveal.
734000	735000	Yep, sounds good.
735000	737000	OK, ready? 1, 2, 3,
737000	739000	204.
739000	741000	475.
743000	745000	So no.
745000	748000	Get home!
748000	751000	I must have done that wrong.
751000	754000	Did I do the maths wrong?
754000	756000	That's horrific.
756000	758000	So...
758000	760000	Hang on, I'm going to do it logically from the top.
760000	764000	So we're saying that 21 divided by
764000	766000	67,
766000	768000	we labelled about a third before.
768000	769000	Yep.
769000	772000	Yeah, at times about 60 is about 200.
772000	773000	Yep.
773000	775000	And what is it, everyone who's here today?
775000	777000	475 are here today.
777000	780000	So in conclusion, statistics doesn't work.
781000	784000	In conclusion, statistics is difficult.
784000	786000	So we got nowhere near it.
786000	788000	204.
788000	790000	I mean, there are several reasons what could have gone wrong there.
790000	792000	This is the very end of the conference.
792000	794000	Loads of people have left.
794000	796000	There are not 475 people still in there.
796000	798000	I mean, people are leaving right now, see?
798000	801000	So 475 was more of an upper bound.
801000	803000	That's the maximum number.
803000	805000	So if we'd gotten more than that, we'd been worried.
805000	807000	Under that is fine.
807000	809000	And frankly, it's the correct order of magnitude.
809000	811000	I refuse to accept there are 475 people in there.
811000	813000	And I guess more importantly,
813000	815000	as I was sampling statisticians at the end, they're like,
815000	818000	oh yes, but actually there's going to be a lot of overlap
818000	821000	between the sorts of people who will go to the poster session
821000	823000	and go to the general plenary.
823000	825000	They're the ones who are interested in a wide range of things
825000	827000	and being engaged in the community.
827000	829000	And obviously some people will just come in for their seminars
829000	831000	or their subsection and go.
831000	834000	And I mean, we could have done a better random sample.
834000	836000	We could have done a bigger sample.
836000	838000	We should have done more samples.
838000	841000	So basically, in conclusion, we didn't put the effort in.
841000	844000	And when I did do more samples with the confectionary children,
844000	846000	I shouldn't have just eyeballed it.
846000	848000	I shouldn't have done a proper thing.
848000	850000	And that would have revealed that the tail was the bit
850000	852000	I should have been matching, not the lead to cause.
852000	854000	Anyway, it's been great fun.
854000	856000	Thanks to the Royal Statistical Society for getting me along.
856000	859000	I'm now doing the after dinner like entertainment
859000	861000	at the closing conference dinner.
861000	862000	That'll be fun.
862000	866000	And thanks to all the Patreon people who fund these things.
866000	868000	So when I get invited to a conference,
868000	871000	I can, you know, bring a camera, make a video, put it online.
871000	875000	Thank you so much for your statistically significant support.
