Checking Stand-up Maths/How did the 'impossible' Perfect Bridge Deal happenï¼Ÿ.txt
1. A perfect deal in bridge can occur more frequently than previously thought due to the way cards are often played and organized during a game. This is not as rare as initially believed, with historical instances reported as early as 1888 and several times since then.
2. Two out shuffles or two in shuffles can guarantee a perfect deal in bridge, and there are infinitely many combinations of in and out shuffles that will achieve this result.
3. The Great Courses Plus offers courses on interesting subjects like magic and math, which include episodes on topics like the mathematics behind card shuffling and the use of in and out shuffles in magic tricks.
4. A sponsorship mention for The Great Courses Plus, where viewers can sign up for a free trial to explore the content, including Art Benjamin's series on magic and math.
5. An open question is presented regarding the most efficient way to move any card to any position in a deck using in and out shuffles, which can be done but requires further investigation to determine the optimal method.

Checking Stand-up Maths/How to estimate a population using statisticians.txt
1. Jen and her team attempted to estimate the number of people present at a conference by stickering a subset of attendees and then using that data to infer the total population.
   2. They initially had 13 people with stickers from the first sample, 21 people with stickers from the second sample, and 24 people without any stickers. This gives a total of 67 stickered people.
   3. To estimate the total population, they used the proportion of stickered people in each sample to calculate an estimate. They multiplied the size of the first sample (64) by the size of the second sample (67), and then divided by the number of stickers (21). This should theoretically give them the total population.
   4. Jen initially revealed a result of 475, which was much higher than the actual number of people present at the conference. This discrepancy was attributed to several factors, including the fact that it was the end of the conference and many people had already left.
   5. The correct estimate for the number of attendees was significantly lower than 475, reflecting a more accurate understanding of the population based on the stickering data.
   6. Jen acknowledges that the sampling method could have been better and that more samples should have been taken to improve accuracy. She also points out that the tail of the distribution (the overlap between attendees interested in various aspects of the conference) is what should have been matched, not just the initial sample size.
   7. The event concluded with Jen's humorous take on the situation and a thank you to the Royal Statistical Society for inviting her and to Patreon supporters for their financial backing that allows her to attend such events and share her experiences online.
