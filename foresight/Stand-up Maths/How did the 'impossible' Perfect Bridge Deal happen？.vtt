00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
In a recent video, I said that the live stream dream could not have been playing an unaltered

00:06.480 --> 00:12.080
version of Minecraft because the probability of them getting the luck that they did was

00:12.080 --> 00:15.520
1 in 2.0 x 10 to the 22.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.000
I just said there's no way that's ever going to happen.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.480
And I tried to put a limit on how often humans could do something.

00:22.480 --> 00:28.080
And I said if you had 10 billion humans doing the same thing once a second over and over

00:28.160 --> 00:34.880
and over again for a century, the 10 billion human second century is 3.1 x 10 to the 19.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.240
A smaller number.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.600
So anything that actually occurs to a human has to have odds below 1 in that.

00:43.600 --> 00:50.320
And as an example, Patricia, the current world record holder in craps, the chance of her game

00:50.320 --> 00:55.520
occurring because it's just pure random luck, is 1.6 x 10 to the 12.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.880
Okay, all good.

00:56.880 --> 01:07.280
But then people have pointed out that in 2011, four senior citizens playing a card game in Warwickshire

01:07.280 --> 01:11.120
in England got a perfect bridge deal.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.440
They all had a full suit each.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.840
And the probability of that happening is 2.2 x 10 to the 27.

01:18.800 --> 01:25.360
We're talking nearly 100,000 times less likely than what happened to Dream.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.280
And that actually happened.

01:27.280 --> 01:31.040
So the question now is, do I owe Dream an apology?

01:39.040 --> 01:44.400
This video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus, a subscription service with thousands of

01:44.400 --> 01:46.720
factual videos available on demand.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.320
More about them and an extra mass question at the end of the video.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.520
First up, what's the deal with a perfect bridge deal?

01:55.520 --> 01:59.600
This is where an entire deck of cards is dealt out to four players.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.520
And then when each player turns over their hand, they see all their cards are from the same suit.

02:05.520 --> 02:13.120
And this is what Wender, Ron, Alan and Norman claim happened to them in Warwickshire in November 2011.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.760
Although technically they were playing West, which was a precursor game to Bridge.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.960
But the deal and all of this is exactly the same.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.840
So I'm just going to refer to it as a perfect bridge deal.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.160
And they're pretty adamant it happened, said Ron.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.920
I would swear on my grandchildren's lives it was not fixed.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.840
Oh bold statement, Ron.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.560
But several newspapers picked it up at the time.

02:34.560 --> 02:43.520
And most, if not all of them featured this number, the 2.2 times 10 to the 27 probability.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.200
So now we have to work out, first of all, is that number correct?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.440
And secondly, what actually happened?

02:50.800 --> 02:55.120
In their description of what happened, they said it was the first hand of the night.

02:55.120 --> 03:00.560
So I'm going to use a brand new deck of cards to recreate what happened.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.720
Okay. Don't need the advertising cards.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.880
Don't need the two jokers.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.200
Right. Well, I say recreate what happened.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.800
Of course, we're not going to get the perfect deal,

03:10.800 --> 03:16.560
but we can still follow along with the steps and keep track of the mathematics

03:16.560 --> 03:20.000
of how likely it is to get that perfect deal.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.880
Now they said that they shuffled the cards a few times.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.000
So I'll do that.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.120
They then dealt the cards out where they cut them.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.360
And then they dealt them out between the four players.

03:29.360 --> 03:36.800
So importantly, if you're playing a wist or bridge, you deal out the entire deck.

03:36.800 --> 03:44.160
So I actually think it's easiest to just keep track of how many possible starting arrangements

03:44.160 --> 03:49.600
of the deck would lead to having a perfect deal.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.200
And then our probability is that many arrangements out of the total number

03:55.200 --> 03:57.840
of arrangements possible of a deck of cards.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.640
And that we know it's just 52 factorial because there's 52 cards that could start on top,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.600
51 underneath that, 50 all the way down.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.560
Okay. So I've now shuffled the cards twice.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.280
They then cut the cards somewhere like that and they started dealing.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.600
So the first card I'm dealing to the first imaginary player,

04:17.600 --> 04:19.920
that could be any card in the deck.

04:19.920 --> 04:24.800
All it's doing is specifying what suit we want this first player to end up with.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.200
So that could be any of the 52 I'm holding.

04:27.280 --> 04:32.320
The next one can be any card that's not the same suit as this one.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.000
And there are 13 in that suit.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.680
So this is any of the remaining 39 possible cards.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.640
Okay. This one's any of the remaining 26, the other two suits that aren't here.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.800
There's now one suit left for the fourth player.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.200
So that's any of the 13 that could be there.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.280
Now the next card going to the first player again,

04:50.080 --> 04:54.000
that can be any card that matches whatever suit this one is.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.600
And so that's any of the 12 outstanding cards from that suit.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.000
Likewise, any of the 12 from that suit, 12 from that one, 12 from that one.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.080
And then this one's any of the 11 from this one,

05:04.080 --> 05:06.560
11 from this one, 11 from this one, 11 from this one.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.440
So apart from the first cards, which were 52, 39, 26 and 13,

05:11.440 --> 05:16.400
these next cards, each hand is just 12 factorial.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.880
So our total number of hands which give you a perfect deal is

05:20.880 --> 05:26.480
52 times 39 times 26 times 13 times 12 factorial to the power of four.

05:26.480 --> 05:31.360
And then it's all of that out of the 52 factorial possible combinations.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.800
You could turn the handle on that to crunch out a number,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.240
or you could cancel out a bunch of factors top and bottom,

05:38.240 --> 05:39.280
whatever you want to do.

05:39.280 --> 05:46.640
It ends up being one in two octillion, 235 septillion.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.280
So on all the way down 301,560,000.

05:51.280 --> 05:51.920
So there you are.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.680
That's where the number comes from.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.080
Obviously what I've dealt out now isn't going to be a perfect hand.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.360
So what did the first person get?

05:57.360 --> 06:01.040
They got, oh my goodness, they got all spades.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.280
How did that happen?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.960
What about the next person?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.160
They've got all hearts.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.120
But you saw me get a new deck of cards.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.880
You saw me shuffle it twice.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.840
We cut the deck, but yet a perfect bridge deal.

06:15.920 --> 06:21.520
The probability of this happening is only 2.2 in 10 to the 27.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.400
This cannot have just happened.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.960
For the record, I did actually execute a perfect bridge deal.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.400
However, as you may have noticed from the concentration on my face,

06:34.400 --> 06:38.240
when I was shuffling, something suspicious was going on.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.040
Suspicious, but legitimate, right?

06:41.040 --> 06:44.320
I legitimately think this is what they did.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.160
The steps that I just went through.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.320
And I'm going to do it again because, of course,

06:48.320 --> 06:50.800
I've got more brand new decks of cards.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.680
I have a lot of these.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.520
And the first key bit of information is the order in which the cards start.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.520
So once you get rid of the advertising cards and the jokers,

07:01.520 --> 07:05.360
the rest of the cards in a deck are already clumped by suit.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.600
This is just how the deck starts.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.880
So you can see you got all the hearts, all the clubs,

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
all the diamonds, all the spades.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.680
We actually don't care about the ordering within them.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.400
I mean, they do happen to go ace through king,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.160
ace through king, and then it flips in the middle,

07:20.160 --> 07:21.680
king through ace, king through ace.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.080
But we don't care what order the cards are

07:24.080 --> 07:25.760
when the people get them in their hand.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.600
We just care that they're all the same suit.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.880
So what we really care is where the suits are and they're clumped.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.680
They're all together.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.880
There's one suit, next suit, next suit, next suit.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.680
And if you deal with cards in bridge,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.960
by just giving the first person the first 13 cards,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.760
next person the next 13, this would work.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.640
But you don't.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.320
You give this to the first person,

07:46.320 --> 07:48.160
second person, third person, fourth person,

07:48.160 --> 07:49.280
then back to the first person.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.000
So we've got to spread the suits out.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.680
So every fourth card is the same suit.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.960
And we do that with what are called pharaoh shuffles.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.520
So I did two pharaoh shuffles,

08:01.520 --> 08:06.000
which is just a fancy name for a perfect interleaf shuffle.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.880
So the way this works,

08:07.600 --> 08:10.720
first of all, you put the deck into two exact halves.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.240
That's the 26 cards.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.600
That's 26 cards.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.840
And then when you push them together,

08:15.840 --> 08:19.360
they need to perfectly alternate.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.960
So you have one from one side,

08:20.960 --> 08:21.760
then one from the other,

08:21.760 --> 08:22.960
then one from one side,

08:22.960 --> 08:24.240
and then one from the other.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.520
There we go.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.000
And then you just push that all the way along.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.920
And there it is, a perfect pharaoh shuffle.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.280
So you can see it goes one on this side,

08:39.280 --> 08:41.280
then one, then one, then one, then one, then one.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.720
And normally a riffle shuffle,

08:42.720 --> 08:44.400
they'd be clumped a bit.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.360
They would not be singles,

08:45.360 --> 08:47.520
but this is singles the whole way through.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.480
This is just a pointless little flourish

08:51.120 --> 08:53.920
to get all the cards back into a little pack.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.720
And now you can see they've been reordered

08:56.720 --> 08:58.800
but in a very systematic way.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.480
You've now got all the black suits together.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.080
You've got all the red suits together.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.680
That was a terrible spread.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.760
And then they alternate within those.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.680
So we're halfway there.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.120
They go spades, clubs, spades, clubs,

09:09.120 --> 09:10.640
spades, clubs all the way along.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.000
And then you've got diamonds hearts,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.280
diamonds hearts all the way along.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.920
So we're going to do a second pharaoh shuffle.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.160
I am specifically doing out pharaoh shuffles.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.320
And that means that the outermost cards don't change.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.440
And you achieve that by when I take off the bottom deck,

09:27.440 --> 09:28.720
the bottom most card,

09:28.720 --> 09:30.560
which has always been the ace of spades,

09:30.560 --> 09:32.720
when I start pushing them together,

09:32.720 --> 09:34.800
I make sure that goes on the bottom.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.520
There it is.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.600
And then we push all the way along.

09:38.320 --> 09:45.920
And now we've got,

09:48.320 --> 09:50.160
you can see all the black ones or the red ones.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.320
And the bottom card is still the bottom card.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.480
And actually the top card is still the top card.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.160
So this is an out pharaoh shuffle.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.960
Now I put all those together.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.440
And we've got the exact condition required

10:03.440 --> 10:05.120
to get a perfect bridge deal.

10:05.120 --> 10:05.600
Look at that.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.560
Then now the suit perfectly alternate.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.560
So you get all four suits in each group of four.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.800
And it goes spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.480
Spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.160
The actual order is not important.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.520
What is important is every fourth card is the same suit.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.080
Also they did cut the deck,

10:24.080 --> 10:25.840
but that actually doesn't make a difference

10:25.840 --> 10:28.240
to the kind of the cycle they're in.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.040
Because cutting the deck,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.560
you're just taking some off one end,

10:30.560 --> 10:32.080
you're putting them on the other end.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.720
Every fourth card is still the same suit.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.240
So I could cut this as many times as I want.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.280
It's like that.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.040
And the deal will still work.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.640
So the first card out happens to be spades.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.880
I didn't know what suit that was going to be because of the cut.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.120
But I do now know that the next three cards

10:49.120 --> 10:50.640
will all be different suits.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.160
And then we go back to spades.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.200
And then we've got hearts.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.080
And then we've got clubs.

10:54.080 --> 10:54.960
Then we've got diamonds.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.040
And then this carries all the way down.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.160
So that's my theory.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.120
Because it was the first hand of the night,

11:01.120 --> 11:03.040
they started with a new deck of cards.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.880
They shuffled them twice.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.960
They accidentally did.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.760
Perfect interleaved shuffles.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.200
And then when they doubt them out into their forehands,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.320
everyone got a complete suit.

11:16.320 --> 11:22.160
Except that is not the only way it could have happened.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.440
When I started playing around with this,

11:23.440 --> 11:25.200
I realized there were other options.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.720
But before we get to those,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.640
we're going to take a closer look

11:28.640 --> 11:32.880
at what actually happens when you do a perfect

11:33.040 --> 11:34.320
Faro shuffle.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.840
And for that purpose,

11:35.840 --> 11:41.360
I have, of course, got another brand new deck of cards.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.240
I'm going to perfectly out Faro shuffle this eight times in a row.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.480
We'll speed the footage up

11:50.480 --> 11:54.320
and watch what happens to the order of the cards.

12:32.880 --> 12:52.160
And that's eight.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.320
All right, I should make it very clear.

12:54.320 --> 13:00.400
I'm now video good enough at doing a perfect Faro shuffle.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.560
I'm not good enough to do it live on stage.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.440
But if I'm filming it and I have the luxury of editing afterwards,

13:05.440 --> 13:06.240
good enough.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.240
So now after eight of these,

13:08.240 --> 13:14.720
you can see they've returned to exactly the same original starting order.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.200
But we could have done in shuffles.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.600
Now I have the cards back in their original order.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.880
I can conveniently show you a different type of Faro shuffle.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.040
So instead of doing the out shuffles like I was doing before,

13:31.040 --> 13:33.040
I could do in shuffles,

13:33.040 --> 13:36.400
which means that the outermost cards move in.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.800
So the bottom card, the ace of spades,

13:38.800 --> 13:40.240
doesn't stay on the bottom.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.000
I move it over slightly.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.720
So now it starts one in.

13:44.720 --> 13:49.440
And the knock on effect is the top card doesn't stay the top card.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.880
It's now one over.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.760
It's slightly in as well.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.280
So you can see now what was the bottom card is now the second card in.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.520
Same thing goes all the way along.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.080
And to what was the top card is now the first card in.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.640
So that is an in Faro shuffle.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.200
And if we do two of those,

14:07.200 --> 14:09.440
give me a second if I re-split the deck.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.400
That looks like it there.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.600
No, off by one.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.760
You know, you just got to judge it by eye.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.200
If they've been properly shuffled,

14:17.200 --> 14:18.800
it's a bit harder to do.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.960
I'm kind of cheating because I know what the card should be.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.600
Okay, there we are.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.880
There's my next in shuffle done.

14:27.760 --> 14:35.200
And lo and behold, I give these a cut and then start dealing.

14:35.200 --> 14:40.160
And once again, we have exactly the same situation.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.240
So I had a bit of a think about it.

14:42.240 --> 14:42.800
I went, you know what?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.360
Hang on a second.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It doesn't have to be out shuffles.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.040
You could instead do two in shuffles.

14:49.040 --> 14:53.760
Or you could do any combination of out and in shuffles.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.800
So if you do an in and an out or then an out and an in,

14:56.800 --> 14:58.960
you still end up with the cards

14:58.960 --> 15:02.720
with each suit perfectly spaced out for a perfect deal.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.560
So that actually makes it even more likely again.

15:06.560 --> 15:10.080
They could have started with a brand new deck of cards,

15:10.080 --> 15:13.280
done any two types of perfect riffle shuffle.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.520
It doesn't matter where they started lining up,

15:15.520 --> 15:17.760
as long as it's an in or an out.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.360
Two of those, any number of cuts anywhere in the deck,

15:21.360 --> 15:23.680
deal it and you get the perfect deal.

15:24.560 --> 15:29.840
Although question now is, if actually this was two in shuffles,

15:29.840 --> 15:33.120
that works, how many in shuffles would it take

15:33.120 --> 15:36.320
before a deck gets right back to where it started?

15:36.320 --> 15:41.200
And so I ran the calculation on it and it turns out 52.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.080
So out shuffles, if you do eight out shuffles in a row,

15:46.080 --> 15:48.080
you get back to where you started.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.080
If you want to use in shuffles to get back to where you started, 52.

15:52.800 --> 15:58.720
I am not going to do 52 in shuffles to show that that works,

15:58.720 --> 16:01.360
because I don't think you'd want to see, oh wait, hang on,

16:02.000 --> 16:02.640
what am I getting?

16:02.640 --> 16:04.160
I'm just, this is coming in live now,

16:04.160 --> 16:05.760
it turns out you would like to see that.

16:05.760 --> 16:11.760
So I'll tell you what, I'll do it live on Patreon as a Q&A.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.520
And so if you're one of my Patreon supporters,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.280
thank you so much, all of you who are,

16:15.280 --> 16:18.000
then you can watch me do it live and ask me questions as I do it.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.960
It's going to take a while and I'll then release the footage on my second channel

16:22.960 --> 16:24.080
so everyone can check it out.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.440
So there you are, I will do 52 in shuffles,

16:27.440 --> 16:30.640
but even that is not the worst case scenario.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.520
We can take a closer look at what actually happens

16:35.520 --> 16:38.960
if we do out shuffles on a brand new deck of cards.

16:38.960 --> 16:43.120
The aces at both ends, as we know, don't go anywhere.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.960
My favorite two cards though are the Fiverr Clubs and the Fiverr Diamonds,

16:46.960 --> 16:50.400
they swap, each time you do an out shuffle,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.800
they just switch places and they go backwards and forwards

16:52.800 --> 16:55.520
in their own little two cycle.

16:55.520 --> 16:59.440
Okay, now the two of hearts, it goes to where the three of hearts was,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.600
three of hearts moves to where the five of hearts was,

17:01.600 --> 17:04.160
the five of hearts goes over to where the nine of hearts was,

17:04.160 --> 17:07.200
that moves to the four of clubs, that moves to the seven of diamonds,

17:07.200 --> 17:10.080
which goes backwards to where the ace of clubs was,

17:10.080 --> 17:11.440
that goes to where the king of diamonds is,

17:11.440 --> 17:13.120
and that goes back to the start.

17:13.120 --> 17:16.320
So these eight cards form a cycle,

17:16.320 --> 17:19.280
and each time you do an out shuffle, they all move one around.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.720
In fact, the rest of the cards form eight cycles,

17:22.720 --> 17:26.480
there are six of them, and for all the cycles

17:26.480 --> 17:29.680
to simultaneously be back where they started,

17:29.680 --> 17:35.280
you need to do the lowest common multiple of shuffles,

17:35.280 --> 17:38.160
and thankfully two and one both divide into eight,

17:38.160 --> 17:41.760
that's why eight shuffles get you back where you started.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.840
For in shuffles, it's a bit more complicated,

17:45.840 --> 17:51.840
because all of the cards form this single cycle of 52 cards.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.680
So that's why you have to do it 52 times,

17:53.680 --> 17:57.360
you've just got to go all the way around this giant cycle.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.240
If you want to see more about shuffles and cycles,

18:00.240 --> 18:03.440
the mathematician and magician Tori Nogas

18:03.440 --> 18:06.320
has some fantastic videos going into the maths

18:06.320 --> 18:07.520
and the theory behind it,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.720
and she does that in far better detail than I could.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.960
I just got obsessed with how long

18:14.960 --> 18:17.440
I could get the repeating point to be

18:17.440 --> 18:19.440
with different combinations of shuffles.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.560
So we already know if you do out, out, out over and over again,

18:22.560 --> 18:25.440
that's eight in, in, in gives you 52.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.680
I then checked in, out, in, out,

18:27.680 --> 18:30.640
and if you keep repeating and alternating between the two,

18:30.640 --> 18:35.200
504, 504 alternating shuffles

18:35.200 --> 18:36.880
before you get back to where you started.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.480
And if you start on the out,

18:38.480 --> 18:40.080
and then alternate in, out, in, out,

18:40.080 --> 18:41.600
it's exactly the same.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.040
From here in, it's a bit annoying

18:43.040 --> 18:44.080
to have to type them all out.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.000
So I'm just going to swap them O's for outs,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.520
I's for ins, and I'm going to give you

18:47.520 --> 18:51.040
the fewest number you need to then repeat to get the pattern.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.680
I started looking at combinations of three,

18:53.680 --> 18:55.360
and all of these gave me 60.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
And I realized these are actually all the same.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.360
They're all two outs followed by an in,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.200
followed by two outs, then an in.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.440
You're just starting at different points in the cycle,

19:03.440 --> 19:04.400
same as these ones.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.160
And that doesn't make a difference.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.400
So I'm only going to give one example,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.680
and it doesn't matter where you start in that range.

19:11.680 --> 19:15.200
Now I wanted to see if I could find extremely long

19:15.200 --> 19:18.560
and unexpectedly short repeating cycles.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.840
So if you do out, in, in, out, in, in, in,

19:21.840 --> 19:25.040
8,820 before it repeats.

19:25.040 --> 19:25.760
Ridiculous.

19:25.760 --> 19:31.360
Those seven shuffles, you have to do 8,820 shuffles

19:31.360 --> 19:32.640
to get back where you started.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.360
These eight, only 16.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.160
Seven outs, and then a single in.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.840
You just do all of that twice,

19:39.840 --> 19:41.280
and you get right back to where you started.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.760
And I like the fact that this shows us,

19:43.760 --> 19:46.000
if you do a little bit of working out,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.880
that an in followed by seven outs followed by an in

19:48.880 --> 19:51.680
is the equivalent to doing a single out.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.160
And we can actually start to get some interesting equations

19:54.160 --> 19:56.720
showing which combinations of shuffles

19:56.720 --> 19:58.160
are equivalent to other ones.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.000
And when we had that 52 cycle from doing all ins,

20:02.000 --> 20:07.360
that tells us that 51 ins is equivalent to an inverse in.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.600
And we could carry on with this.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.560
I decided just to find one more ridiculous long one

20:12.560 --> 20:13.280
and call it a day.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.520
I found this run of 13 outs and ins,

20:17.520 --> 20:23.040
which doesn't repeat until after 20,000 and 20 shuffles.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.080
Just ridiculous.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.080
But the point of all of this, where we started,

20:26.080 --> 20:29.920
is to find out which shuffles set up a perfect deal.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.440
And we already know that two out shuffles, that works.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.240
It turns out two in shuffles also works.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.960
Get a new deck, two in shuffles, you're ready to go.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.640
You can actually do an out and then an in.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.120
That works.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.640
And you can do an in and an out.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.680
That works.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.120
And there are loads more.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.240
In fact, there are infinitely many.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.360
If you do 28 ins, that sets you up.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.480
If you do an in, seven outs, two in, seven out, and an in.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.520
And I could keep generating these without ever running out.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.560
But the important ones are these,

20:58.560 --> 21:01.520
which have a realistic chance of actually happening.

21:01.760 --> 21:07.360
Given any pair of in and out Faro shuffles will order the deck

21:07.360 --> 21:11.840
to give you a perfect deal, of course it's way more likely

21:11.840 --> 21:15.760
than assuming the deck is always perfectly randomized.

21:15.760 --> 21:20.080
And this starting condition of having all the suits together

21:20.080 --> 21:22.400
doesn't only happen in a new deck.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.080
When you're playing bridge,

21:24.080 --> 21:26.240
a lot of the time when you're putting a card down,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.960
it's because the suit of the card you're playing

21:28.960 --> 21:31.360
matches the other cards already down.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.080
Now, it's not going to happen every game,

21:34.080 --> 21:35.360
but a lot of the time,

21:35.360 --> 21:38.080
particularly if there's a human picking up the cards

21:38.080 --> 21:40.160
who likes organizing things,

21:40.160 --> 21:43.920
you will end up accidentally putting the suits together.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.120
And so it's going to happen way more often

21:47.120 --> 21:49.920
than the naive calculation indicated.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.560
And when this happened in 2011,

21:52.560 --> 21:57.520
Peter Rowlett of the AP article went through old newspaper archives

21:57.520 --> 22:02.000
and found stories of perfect bridge deals one per decade,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.680
including my favorite story from 1929,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.400
when it happened again at a game in London.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.840
And that story says it had happened five times before that on the record,

22:13.840 --> 22:17.600
going right back to a game in 1888.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.560
So there you are.

22:18.560 --> 22:22.320
That's why our senior citizens playing cards

22:22.480 --> 22:28.320
with dream on the wrong side of the 10 billion human second century,

22:28.320 --> 22:31.440
assuming that everything was perfectly fair

22:31.440 --> 22:34.960
and correctly shuffled was incorrect.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.280
In the case of our senior citizens,

22:37.280 --> 22:39.280
the deck was already stacked.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.960
And I maintain the same thing still applies to dream.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.360
Speaking of good luck,

22:47.360 --> 22:51.360
this video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus,

22:51.360 --> 22:55.360
and I had decided that they could sponsor this video

22:55.360 --> 22:58.720
about the bridge deal before I remembered

22:58.720 --> 23:02.320
that my friend Art Benjamin has done a whole series for them

23:02.320 --> 23:04.320
about magic and math.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.080
I can probably be excused

23:06.080 --> 23:08.240
because I've got over 11,000 videos

23:08.240 --> 23:11.520
and I tend to watch the ones about history.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.920
I like them because they fall somewhere between

23:13.920 --> 23:17.280
a documentary series and an actual proper course.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.560
Only there's no like tests or checks

23:20.560 --> 23:21.920
that you're paying attention.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.880
You can just enjoy watching the videos.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.440

23:34.800 --> 23:38.720
I do recommend starting with Art Benjamin's series.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.160
Episode five is all about perfect shuffles,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.600
pretty much what I covered here.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.960
But in magic, you can use in and out shuffles

23:47.040 --> 23:51.040
to move the top card to any position in the deck,

23:51.040 --> 23:52.080
using binary.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.040
Super interesting.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.040
And actually, a bit of an open question.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.480
You can actually use in and out shuffles

23:58.480 --> 24:00.720
to move any card to any position,

24:00.720 --> 24:02.880
and I can say that because it occurred to me

24:02.880 --> 24:07.360
that 52 cycle of in shuffles does that, just badly.

24:07.360 --> 24:11.280
So I have no idea what the most efficient way

24:12.000 --> 24:14.320
of moving any card to any position is,

24:14.320 --> 24:15.920
but it can definitely be done.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.880
There you are.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.880
Didn't expect an open question in the sponsorship message,

24:20.880 --> 24:21.360
did you?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.240
There you are.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.200
I haven't looked into it.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.680
If anyone can find out, let me know.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.880
If you just want to learn more magic and math,

24:28.880 --> 24:31.200
I highly recommend Art Benjamin's series.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.880
Look at so many episodes, including Magic Squares.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.560
There you are.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.680
Learn to do a magic square.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.520
How hard can it be?

24:39.520 --> 24:43.200
So do head on over to thegreatcoursesplus.com
