1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
In a recent video, I said that the live stream dream could not have been playing an unaltered

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,080
version of Minecraft because the probability of them getting the luck that they did was

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,520
1 in 2.0 x 10 to the 22.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,000
I just said there's no way that's ever going to happen.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
And I tried to put a limit on how often humans could do something.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,080
And I said if you had 10 billion humans doing the same thing once a second over and over

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,880
and over again for a century, the 10 billion human second century is 3.1 x 10 to the 19.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,240
A smaller number.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,600
So anything that actually occurs to a human has to have odds below 1 in that.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,320
And as an example, Patricia, the current world record holder in craps, the chance of her game

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,520
occurring because it's just pure random luck, is 1.6 x 10 to the 12.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,880
Okay, all good.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:07,280
But then people have pointed out that in 2011, four senior citizens playing a card game in Warwickshire

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,120
in England got a perfect bridge deal.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,440
They all had a full suit each.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,840
And the probability of that happening is 2.2 x 10 to the 27.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,360
We're talking nearly 100,000 times less likely than what happened to Dream.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
And that actually happened.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
So the question now is, do I owe Dream an apology?

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,400
This video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus, a subscription service with thousands of

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,720
factual videos available on demand.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
More about them and an extra mass question at the end of the video.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,520
First up, what's the deal with a perfect bridge deal?

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
This is where an entire deck of cards is dealt out to four players.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,520
And then when each player turns over their hand, they see all their cards are from the same suit.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:13,120
And this is what Wender, Ron, Alan and Norman claim happened to them in Warwickshire in November 2011.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
Although technically they were playing West, which was a precursor game to Bridge.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
But the deal and all of this is exactly the same.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,840
So I'm just going to refer to it as a perfect bridge deal.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
And they're pretty adamant it happened, said Ron.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,920
I would swear on my grandchildren's lives it was not fixed.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
Oh bold statement, Ron.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
But several newspapers picked it up at the time.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:43,520
And most, if not all of them featured this number, the 2.2 times 10 to the 27 probability.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,200
So now we have to work out, first of all, is that number correct?

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
And secondly, what actually happened?

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
In their description of what happened, they said it was the first hand of the night.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
So I'm going to use a brand new deck of cards to recreate what happened.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
Okay. Don't need the advertising cards.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,880
Don't need the two jokers.

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,200
Right. Well, I say recreate what happened.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Of course, we're not going to get the perfect deal,

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,560
but we can still follow along with the steps and keep track of the mathematics

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
of how likely it is to get that perfect deal.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Now they said that they shuffled the cards a few times.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
So I'll do that.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
They then dealt the cards out where they cut them.

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
And then they dealt them out between the four players.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,800
So importantly, if you're playing a wist or bridge, you deal out the entire deck.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,160
So I actually think it's easiest to just keep track of how many possible starting arrangements

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,600
of the deck would lead to having a perfect deal.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,200
And then our probability is that many arrangements out of the total number

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
of arrangements possible of a deck of cards.

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,640
And that we know it's just 52 factorial because there's 52 cards that could start on top,

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,600
51 underneath that, 50 all the way down.

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay. So I've now shuffled the cards twice.

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
They then cut the cards somewhere like that and they started dealing.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
So the first card I'm dealing to the first imaginary player,

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
that could be any card in the deck.

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,800
All it's doing is specifying what suit we want this first player to end up with.

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
So that could be any of the 52 I'm holding.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,320
The next one can be any card that's not the same suit as this one.

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
And there are 13 in that suit.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
So this is any of the remaining 39 possible cards.

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,640
Okay. This one's any of the remaining 26, the other two suits that aren't here.

66
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,800
There's now one suit left for the fourth player.

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
So that's any of the 13 that could be there.

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,280
Now the next card going to the first player again,

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
that can be any card that matches whatever suit this one is.

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
And so that's any of the 12 outstanding cards from that suit.

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Likewise, any of the 12 from that suit, 12 from that one, 12 from that one.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
And then this one's any of the 11 from this one,

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,560
11 from this one, 11 from this one, 11 from this one.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,440
So apart from the first cards, which were 52, 39, 26 and 13,

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,400
these next cards, each hand is just 12 factorial.

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,880
So our total number of hands which give you a perfect deal is

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,480
52 times 39 times 26 times 13 times 12 factorial to the power of four.

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,360
And then it's all of that out of the 52 factorial possible combinations.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
You could turn the handle on that to crunch out a number,

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
or you could cancel out a bunch of factors top and bottom,

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,280
whatever you want to do.

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,640
It ends up being one in two octillion, 235 septillion.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,280
So on all the way down 301,560,000.

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,920
So there you are.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,680
That's where the number comes from.

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
Obviously what I've dealt out now isn't going to be a perfect hand.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
So what did the first person get?

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,040
They got, oh my goodness, they got all spades.

89
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,280
How did that happen?

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
What about the next person?

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
They've got all hearts.

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
But you saw me get a new deck of cards.

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,880
You saw me shuffle it twice.

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
We cut the deck, but yet a perfect bridge deal.

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,520
The probability of this happening is only 2.2 in 10 to the 27.

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
This cannot have just happened.

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,960
For the record, I did actually execute a perfect bridge deal.

98
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,400
However, as you may have noticed from the concentration on my face,

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
when I was shuffling, something suspicious was going on.

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Suspicious, but legitimate, right?

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,320
I legitimately think this is what they did.

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,160
The steps that I just went through.

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,320
And I'm going to do it again because, of course,

104
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,800
I've got more brand new decks of cards.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,680
I have a lot of these.

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,520
And the first key bit of information is the order in which the cards start.

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
So once you get rid of the advertising cards and the jokers,

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,360
the rest of the cards in a deck are already clumped by suit.

109
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,600
This is just how the deck starts.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,880
So you can see you got all the hearts, all the clubs,

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
all the diamonds, all the spades.

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
We actually don't care about the ordering within them.

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,400
I mean, they do happen to go ace through king,

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
ace through king, and then it flips in the middle,

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
king through ace, king through ace.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
But we don't care what order the cards are

117
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,760
when the people get them in their hand.

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,600
We just care that they're all the same suit.

119
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,880
So what we really care is where the suits are and they're clumped.

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,680
They're all together.

121
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
There's one suit, next suit, next suit, next suit.

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
And if you deal with cards in bridge,

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
by just giving the first person the first 13 cards,

124
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,760
next person the next 13, this would work.

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
But you don't.

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
You give this to the first person,

127
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,160
second person, third person, fourth person,

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
then back to the first person.

129
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
So we've got to spread the suits out.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
So every fourth card is the same suit.

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
And we do that with what are called pharaoh shuffles.

132
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,520
So I did two pharaoh shuffles,

133
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,000
which is just a fancy name for a perfect interleaf shuffle.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880
So the way this works,

135
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
first of all, you put the deck into two exact halves.

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
That's the 26 cards.

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
That's 26 cards.

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,840
And then when you push them together,

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,360
they need to perfectly alternate.

140
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
So you have one from one side,

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,760
then one from the other,

142
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,960
then one from one side,

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
and then one from the other.

144
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,520
There we go.

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
And then you just push that all the way along.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,920
And there it is, a perfect pharaoh shuffle.

147
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,280
So you can see it goes one on this side,

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
then one, then one, then one, then one, then one.

149
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
And normally a riffle shuffle,

150
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,400
they'd be clumped a bit.

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
They would not be singles,

152
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,520
but this is singles the whole way through.

153
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
This is just a pointless little flourish

154
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
to get all the cards back into a little pack.

155
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
And now you can see they've been reordered

156
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
but in a very systematic way.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
You've now got all the black suits together.

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
You've got all the red suits together.

159
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
That was a terrible spread.

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
And then they alternate within those.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,680
So we're halfway there.

162
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
They go spades, clubs, spades, clubs,

163
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
spades, clubs all the way along.

164
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
And then you've got diamonds hearts,

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
diamonds hearts all the way along.

166
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,920
So we're going to do a second pharaoh shuffle.

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
I am specifically doing out pharaoh shuffles.

168
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
And that means that the outermost cards don't change.

169
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
And you achieve that by when I take off the bottom deck,

170
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
the bottom most card,

171
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
which has always been the ace of spades,

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
when I start pushing them together,

173
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
I make sure that goes on the bottom.

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,520
There it is.

175
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,600
And then we push all the way along.

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,920
And now we've got,

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
you can see all the black ones or the red ones.

178
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
And the bottom card is still the bottom card.

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
And actually the top card is still the top card.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
So this is an out pharaoh shuffle.

181
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,960
Now I put all those together.

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
And we've got the exact condition required

183
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
to get a perfect bridge deal.

184
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Look at that.

185
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
Then now the suit perfectly alternate.

186
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
So you get all four suits in each group of four.

187
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
And it goes spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
Spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.

189
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
The actual order is not important.

190
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,520
What is important is every fourth card is the same suit.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Also they did cut the deck,

192
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
but that actually doesn't make a difference

193
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,240
to the kind of the cycle they're in.

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
Because cutting the deck,

195
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
you're just taking some off one end,

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
you're putting them on the other end.

197
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,720
Every fourth card is still the same suit.

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
So I could cut this as many times as I want.

199
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
It's like that.

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,040
And the deal will still work.

201
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
So the first card out happens to be spades.

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
I didn't know what suit that was going to be because of the cut.

203
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
But I do now know that the next three cards

204
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
will all be different suits.

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
And then we go back to spades.

206
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
And then we've got hearts.

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,080
And then we've got clubs.

208
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
Then we've got diamonds.

209
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,040
And then this carries all the way down.

210
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
So that's my theory.

211
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Because it was the first hand of the night,

212
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
they started with a new deck of cards.

213
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,880
They shuffled them twice.

214
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
They accidentally did.

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,760
Perfect interleaved shuffles.

216
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
And then when they doubt them out into their forehands,

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
everyone got a complete suit.

218
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Except that is not the only way it could have happened.

219
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,440
When I started playing around with this,

220
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
I realized there were other options.

221
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
But before we get to those,

222
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
we're going to take a closer look

223
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,880
at what actually happens when you do a perfect

224
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
Faro shuffle.

225
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
And for that purpose,

226
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,360
I have, of course, got another brand new deck of cards.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm going to perfectly out Faro shuffle this eight times in a row.

228
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
We'll speed the footage up

229
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
and watch what happens to the order of the cards.

230
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:52,160
And that's eight.

231
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,320
All right, I should make it very clear.

232
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm now video good enough at doing a perfect Faro shuffle.

233
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm not good enough to do it live on stage.

234
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,440
But if I'm filming it and I have the luxury of editing afterwards,

235
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
good enough.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
So now after eight of these,

237
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
you can see they've returned to exactly the same original starting order.

238
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
But we could have done in shuffles.

239
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,600
Now I have the cards back in their original order.

240
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,880
I can conveniently show you a different type of Faro shuffle.

241
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,040
So instead of doing the out shuffles like I was doing before,

242
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I could do in shuffles,

243
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,400
which means that the outermost cards move in.

244
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,800
So the bottom card, the ace of spades,

245
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
doesn't stay on the bottom.

246
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
I move it over slightly.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,720
So now it starts one in.

248
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,440
And the knock on effect is the top card doesn't stay the top card.

249
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
It's now one over.

250
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
It's slightly in as well.

251
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,280
So you can see now what was the bottom card is now the second card in.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
Same thing goes all the way along.

253
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,080
And to what was the top card is now the first card in.

254
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,640
So that is an in Faro shuffle.

255
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,200
And if we do two of those,

256
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
give me a second if I re-split the deck.

257
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,400
That looks like it there.

258
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
No, off by one.

259
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
You know, you just got to judge it by eye.

260
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
If they've been properly shuffled,

261
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
it's a bit harder to do.

262
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm kind of cheating because I know what the card should be.

263
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Okay, there we are.

264
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,880
There's my next in shuffle done.

265
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:35,200
And lo and behold, I give these a cut and then start dealing.

266
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,160
And once again, we have exactly the same situation.

267
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
So I had a bit of a think about it.

268
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,800
I went, you know what?

269
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,360
Hang on a second.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It doesn't have to be out shuffles.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
You could instead do two in shuffles.

272
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Or you could do any combination of out and in shuffles.

273
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
So if you do an in and an out or then an out and an in,

274
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,960
you still end up with the cards

275
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,720
with each suit perfectly spaced out for a perfect deal.

276
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
So that actually makes it even more likely again.

277
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,080
They could have started with a brand new deck of cards,

278
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,280
done any two types of perfect riffle shuffle.

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
It doesn't matter where they started lining up,

280
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,760
as long as it's an in or an out.

281
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,360
Two of those, any number of cuts anywhere in the deck,

282
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,680
deal it and you get the perfect deal.

283
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,840
Although question now is, if actually this was two in shuffles,

284
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,120
that works, how many in shuffles would it take

285
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
before a deck gets right back to where it started?

286
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,200
And so I ran the calculation on it and it turns out 52.

287
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,080
So out shuffles, if you do eight out shuffles in a row,

288
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
you get back to where you started.

289
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,080
If you want to use in shuffles to get back to where you started, 52.

290
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,720
I am not going to do 52 in shuffles to show that that works,

291
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
because I don't think you'd want to see, oh wait, hang on,

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,640
what am I getting?

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm just, this is coming in live now,

294
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,760
it turns out you would like to see that.

295
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,760
So I'll tell you what, I'll do it live on Patreon as a Q&A.

296
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,520
And so if you're one of my Patreon supporters,

297
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,280
thank you so much, all of you who are,

298
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,000
then you can watch me do it live and ask me questions as I do it.

299
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,960
It's going to take a while and I'll then release the footage on my second channel

300
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,080
so everyone can check it out.

301
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,440
So there you are, I will do 52 in shuffles,

302
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,640
but even that is not the worst case scenario.

303
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,520
We can take a closer look at what actually happens

304
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,960
if we do out shuffles on a brand new deck of cards.

305
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,120
The aces at both ends, as we know, don't go anywhere.

306
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,960
My favorite two cards though are the Fiverr Clubs and the Fiverr Diamonds,

307
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,400
they swap, each time you do an out shuffle,

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,800
they just switch places and they go backwards and forwards

309
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,520
in their own little two cycle.

310
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,440
Okay, now the two of hearts, it goes to where the three of hearts was,

311
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
three of hearts moves to where the five of hearts was,

312
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
the five of hearts goes over to where the nine of hearts was,

313
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,200
that moves to the four of clubs, that moves to the seven of diamonds,

314
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,080
which goes backwards to where the ace of clubs was,

315
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,440
that goes to where the king of diamonds is,

316
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,120
and that goes back to the start.

317
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,320
So these eight cards form a cycle,

318
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,280
and each time you do an out shuffle, they all move one around.

319
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
In fact, the rest of the cards form eight cycles,

320
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,480
there are six of them, and for all the cycles

321
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,680
to simultaneously be back where they started,

322
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,280
you need to do the lowest common multiple of shuffles,

323
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
and thankfully two and one both divide into eight,

324
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,760
that's why eight shuffles get you back where you started.

325
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,840
For in shuffles, it's a bit more complicated,

326
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,840
because all of the cards form this single cycle of 52 cards.

327
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,680
So that's why you have to do it 52 times,

328
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,360
you've just got to go all the way around this giant cycle.

329
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,240
If you want to see more about shuffles and cycles,

330
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,440
the mathematician and magician Tori Nogas

331
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
has some fantastic videos going into the maths

332
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
and the theory behind it,

333
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
and she does that in far better detail than I could.

334
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,960
I just got obsessed with how long

335
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
I could get the repeating point to be

336
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
with different combinations of shuffles.

337
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,560
So we already know if you do out, out, out over and over again,

338
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,440
that's eight in, in, in gives you 52.

339
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,680
I then checked in, out, in, out,

340
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,640
and if you keep repeating and alternating between the two,

341
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
504, 504 alternating shuffles

342
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
before you get back to where you started.

343
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
And if you start on the out,

344
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
and then alternate in, out, in, out,

345
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
it's exactly the same.

346
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,040
From here in, it's a bit annoying

347
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,080
to have to type them all out.

348
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
So I'm just going to swap them O's for outs,

349
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,520
I's for ins, and I'm going to give you

350
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,040
the fewest number you need to then repeat to get the pattern.

351
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,680
I started looking at combinations of three,

352
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,360
and all of these gave me 60.

353
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
And I realized these are actually all the same.

354
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
They're all two outs followed by an in,

355
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
followed by two outs, then an in.

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,440
You're just starting at different points in the cycle,

357
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
same as these ones.

358
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
And that doesn't make a difference.

359
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
So I'm only going to give one example,

360
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,680
and it doesn't matter where you start in that range.

361
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,200
Now I wanted to see if I could find extremely long

362
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,560
and unexpectedly short repeating cycles.

363
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,840
So if you do out, in, in, out, in, in, in,

364
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,040
8,820 before it repeats.

365
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,760
Ridiculous.

366
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,360
Those seven shuffles, you have to do 8,820 shuffles

367
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
to get back where you started.

368
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
These eight, only 16.

369
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Seven outs, and then a single in.

370
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
You just do all of that twice,

371
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
and you get right back to where you started.

372
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
And I like the fact that this shows us,

373
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
if you do a little bit of working out,

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
that an in followed by seven outs followed by an in

375
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,680
is the equivalent to doing a single out.

376
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,160
And we can actually start to get some interesting equations

377
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
showing which combinations of shuffles

378
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
are equivalent to other ones.

379
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
And when we had that 52 cycle from doing all ins,

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,360
that tells us that 51 ins is equivalent to an inverse in.

381
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
And we could carry on with this.

382
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,560
I decided just to find one more ridiculous long one

383
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,280
and call it a day.

384
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
I found this run of 13 outs and ins,

385
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,040
which doesn't repeat until after 20,000 and 20 shuffles.

386
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
Just ridiculous.

387
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
But the point of all of this, where we started,

388
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,920
is to find out which shuffles set up a perfect deal.

389
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,440
And we already know that two out shuffles, that works.

390
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,240
It turns out two in shuffles also works.

391
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,960
Get a new deck, two in shuffles, you're ready to go.

392
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
You can actually do an out and then an in.

393
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,120
That works.

394
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
And you can do an in and an out.

395
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,680
That works.

396
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
And there are loads more.

397
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,240
In fact, there are infinitely many.

398
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,360
If you do 28 ins, that sets you up.

399
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,480
If you do an in, seven outs, two in, seven out, and an in.

400
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,520
And I could keep generating these without ever running out.

401
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,560
But the important ones are these,

402
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,520
which have a realistic chance of actually happening.

403
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,360
Given any pair of in and out Faro shuffles will order the deck

404
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,840
to give you a perfect deal, of course it's way more likely

405
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,760
than assuming the deck is always perfectly randomized.

406
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,080
And this starting condition of having all the suits together

407
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
doesn't only happen in a new deck.

408
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
When you're playing bridge,

409
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
a lot of the time when you're putting a card down,

410
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,960
it's because the suit of the card you're playing

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
matches the other cards already down.

412
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
Now, it's not going to happen every game,

413
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
but a lot of the time,

414
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,080
particularly if there's a human picking up the cards

415
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,160
who likes organizing things,

416
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,920
you will end up accidentally putting the suits together.

417
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,120
And so it's going to happen way more often

418
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,920
than the naive calculation indicated.

419
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,560
And when this happened in 2011,

420
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,520
Peter Rowlett of the AP article went through old newspaper archives

421
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,000
and found stories of perfect bridge deals one per decade,

422
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,680
including my favorite story from 1929,

423
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
when it happened again at a game in London.

424
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,840
And that story says it had happened five times before that on the record,

425
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
going right back to a game in 1888.

426
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,560
So there you are.

427
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,320
That's why our senior citizens playing cards

428
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,320
with dream on the wrong side of the 10 billion human second century,

429
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
assuming that everything was perfectly fair

430
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
and correctly shuffled was incorrect.

431
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,280
In the case of our senior citizens,

432
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
the deck was already stacked.

433
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,960
And I maintain the same thing still applies to dream.

434
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
Speaking of good luck,

435
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
this video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus,

436
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
and I had decided that they could sponsor this video

437
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
about the bridge deal before I remembered

438
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,320
that my friend Art Benjamin has done a whole series for them

439
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
about magic and math.

440
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
I can probably be excused

441
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
because I've got over 11,000 videos

442
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
and I tend to watch the ones about history.

443
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,920
I like them because they fall somewhere between

444
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,280
a documentary series and an actual proper course.

445
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,560
Only there's no like tests or checks

446
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,920
that you're paying attention.

447
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,880

slash standupmaths.

452
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,720
I do recommend starting with Art Benjamin's series.

453
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,160
Episode five is all about perfect shuffles,

454
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,600
pretty much what I covered here.

455
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,960
But in magic, you can use in and out shuffles

456
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,040
to move the top card to any position in the deck,

457
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
using binary.

458
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,040
Super interesting.

459
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
And actually, a bit of an open question.

460
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,480
You can actually use in and out shuffles

461
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
to move any card to any position,

462
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
and I can say that because it occurred to me

463
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
that 52 cycle of in shuffles does that, just badly.

464
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,280
So I have no idea what the most efficient way

465
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
of moving any card to any position is,

466
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,920
but it can definitely be done.

467
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,880
There you are.

468
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Didn't expect an open question in the sponsorship message,

469
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,360
did you?

470
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,240
There you are.

471
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
I haven't looked into it.

472
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,680
If anyone can find out, let me know.

473
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,880
If you just want to learn more magic and math,

474
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
I highly recommend Art Benjamin's series.

475
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
Look at so many episodes, including Magic Squares.

476
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,560
There you are.

477
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,680
Learn to do a magic square.

478
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,520
