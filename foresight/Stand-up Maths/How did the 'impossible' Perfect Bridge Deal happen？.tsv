0	6480	In a recent video, I said that the live stream dream could not have been playing an unaltered
6480	12080	version of Minecraft because the probability of them getting the luck that they did was
12080	15520	1 in 2.0 x 10 to the 22.
15520	18000	I just said there's no way that's ever going to happen.
18000	22480	And I tried to put a limit on how often humans could do something.
22480	28080	And I said if you had 10 billion humans doing the same thing once a second over and over
28160	34880	and over again for a century, the 10 billion human second century is 3.1 x 10 to the 19.
34880	36240	A smaller number.
36240	43600	So anything that actually occurs to a human has to have odds below 1 in that.
43600	50320	And as an example, Patricia, the current world record holder in craps, the chance of her game
50320	55520	occurring because it's just pure random luck, is 1.6 x 10 to the 12.
55520	56880	Okay, all good.
56880	67280	But then people have pointed out that in 2011, four senior citizens playing a card game in Warwickshire
67280	71120	in England got a perfect bridge deal.
71120	73440	They all had a full suit each.
73440	77840	And the probability of that happening is 2.2 x 10 to the 27.
78800	85360	We're talking nearly 100,000 times less likely than what happened to Dream.
85360	87280	And that actually happened.
87280	91040	So the question now is, do I owe Dream an apology?
99040	104400	This video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus, a subscription service with thousands of
104400	106720	factual videos available on demand.
106720	110320	More about them and an extra mass question at the end of the video.
111440	115520	First up, what's the deal with a perfect bridge deal?
115520	119600	This is where an entire deck of cards is dealt out to four players.
119600	125520	And then when each player turns over their hand, they see all their cards are from the same suit.
125520	133120	And this is what Wender, Ron, Alan and Norman claim happened to them in Warwickshire in November 2011.
133120	137760	Although technically they were playing West, which was a precursor game to Bridge.
137760	140960	But the deal and all of this is exactly the same.
140960	143840	So I'm just going to refer to it as a perfect bridge deal.
143840	146160	And they're pretty adamant it happened, said Ron.
146160	149920	I would swear on my grandchildren's lives it was not fixed.
149920	151840	Oh bold statement, Ron.
151840	154560	But several newspapers picked it up at the time.
154560	163520	And most, if not all of them featured this number, the 2.2 times 10 to the 27 probability.
163520	167200	So now we have to work out, first of all, is that number correct?
167200	169440	And secondly, what actually happened?
170800	175120	In their description of what happened, they said it was the first hand of the night.
175120	180560	So I'm going to use a brand new deck of cards to recreate what happened.
180560	182720	Okay. Don't need the advertising cards.
182720	184880	Don't need the two jokers.
184880	187200	Right. Well, I say recreate what happened.
187200	190800	Of course, we're not going to get the perfect deal,
190800	196560	but we can still follow along with the steps and keep track of the mathematics
196560	200000	of how likely it is to get that perfect deal.
200000	202880	Now they said that they shuffled the cards a few times.
202880	204000	So I'll do that.
204000	207120	They then dealt the cards out where they cut them.
207120	209360	And then they dealt them out between the four players.
209360	216800	So importantly, if you're playing a wist or bridge, you deal out the entire deck.
216800	224160	So I actually think it's easiest to just keep track of how many possible starting arrangements
224160	229600	of the deck would lead to having a perfect deal.
229600	235200	And then our probability is that many arrangements out of the total number
235200	237840	of arrangements possible of a deck of cards.
237840	242640	And that we know it's just 52 factorial because there's 52 cards that could start on top,
243200	245600	51 underneath that, 50 all the way down.
245600	248560	Okay. So I've now shuffled the cards twice.
248560	253280	They then cut the cards somewhere like that and they started dealing.
253280	257600	So the first card I'm dealing to the first imaginary player,
257600	259920	that could be any card in the deck.
259920	264800	All it's doing is specifying what suit we want this first player to end up with.
264800	267200	So that could be any of the 52 I'm holding.
267280	272320	The next one can be any card that's not the same suit as this one.
272320	274000	And there are 13 in that suit.
274000	277680	So this is any of the remaining 39 possible cards.
277680	282640	Okay. This one's any of the remaining 26, the other two suits that aren't here.
282640	284800	There's now one suit left for the fourth player.
284800	287200	So that's any of the 13 that could be there.
287200	289280	Now the next card going to the first player again,
290080	294000	that can be any card that matches whatever suit this one is.
294080	297600	And so that's any of the 12 outstanding cards from that suit.
297600	302000	Likewise, any of the 12 from that suit, 12 from that one, 12 from that one.
302000	304080	And then this one's any of the 11 from this one,
304080	306560	11 from this one, 11 from this one, 11 from this one.
306560	311440	So apart from the first cards, which were 52, 39, 26 and 13,
311440	316400	these next cards, each hand is just 12 factorial.
316400	320880	So our total number of hands which give you a perfect deal is
320880	326480	52 times 39 times 26 times 13 times 12 factorial to the power of four.
326480	331360	And then it's all of that out of the 52 factorial possible combinations.
331360	334800	You could turn the handle on that to crunch out a number,
334800	338240	or you could cancel out a bunch of factors top and bottom,
338240	339280	whatever you want to do.
339280	346640	It ends up being one in two octillion, 235 septillion.
346640	351280	So on all the way down 301,560,000.
351280	351920	So there you are.
351920	353680	That's where the number comes from.
353680	356080	Obviously what I've dealt out now isn't going to be a perfect hand.
356080	357360	So what did the first person get?
357360	361040	They got, oh my goodness, they got all spades.
361760	363280	How did that happen?
363280	364960	What about the next person?
364960	366160	They've got all hearts.
366160	369120	But you saw me get a new deck of cards.
369120	370880	You saw me shuffle it twice.
370880	375840	We cut the deck, but yet a perfect bridge deal.
375920	381520	The probability of this happening is only 2.2 in 10 to the 27.
381520	384400	This cannot have just happened.
385920	390960	For the record, I did actually execute a perfect bridge deal.
390960	394400	However, as you may have noticed from the concentration on my face,
394400	398240	when I was shuffling, something suspicious was going on.
398240	401040	Suspicious, but legitimate, right?
401040	404320	I legitimately think this is what they did.
404320	406160	The steps that I just went through.
406160	408320	And I'm going to do it again because, of course,
408320	410800	I've got more brand new decks of cards.
410800	411680	I have a lot of these.
412400	417520	And the first key bit of information is the order in which the cards start.
417520	421520	So once you get rid of the advertising cards and the jokers,
421520	425360	the rest of the cards in a deck are already clumped by suit.
426080	427600	This is just how the deck starts.
427600	430880	So you can see you got all the hearts, all the clubs,
430880	432880	all the diamonds, all the spades.
432880	435680	We actually don't care about the ordering within them.
435680	438400	I mean, they do happen to go ace through king,
438400	440160	ace through king, and then it flips in the middle,
440160	441680	king through ace, king through ace.
441680	444080	But we don't care what order the cards are
444080	445760	when the people get them in their hand.
445760	447600	We just care that they're all the same suit.
447600	450880	So what we really care is where the suits are and they're clumped.
450880	451680	They're all together.
451680	454880	There's one suit, next suit, next suit, next suit.
454880	457680	And if you deal with cards in bridge,
457680	460960	by just giving the first person the first 13 cards,
460960	463760	next person the next 13, this would work.
463760	464640	But you don't.
464640	466320	You give this to the first person,
466320	468160	second person, third person, fourth person,
468160	469280	then back to the first person.
469840	472000	So we've got to spread the suits out.
472000	475680	So every fourth card is the same suit.
475680	478960	And we do that with what are called pharaoh shuffles.
478960	481520	So I did two pharaoh shuffles,
481520	486000	which is just a fancy name for a perfect interleaf shuffle.
486000	486880	So the way this works,
487600	490720	first of all, you put the deck into two exact halves.
490720	492240	That's the 26 cards.
492240	493600	That's 26 cards.
493600	495840	And then when you push them together,
495840	499360	they need to perfectly alternate.
499360	500960	So you have one from one side,
500960	501760	then one from the other,
501760	502960	then one from one side,
502960	504240	and then one from the other.
504800	505520	There we go.
508160	512000	And then you just push that all the way along.
512000	515920	And there it is, a perfect pharaoh shuffle.
515920	519280	So you can see it goes one on this side,
519280	521280	then one, then one, then one, then one, then one.
521280	522720	And normally a riffle shuffle,
522720	524400	they'd be clumped a bit.
524400	525360	They would not be singles,
525360	527520	but this is singles the whole way through.
528080	530480	This is just a pointless little flourish
531120	533920	to get all the cards back into a little pack.
533920	536720	And now you can see they've been reordered
536720	538800	but in a very systematic way.
538800	540480	You've now got all the black suits together.
540480	542080	You've got all the red suits together.
542080	543680	That was a terrible spread.
544320	545760	And then they alternate within those.
546400	547680	So we're halfway there.
547680	549120	They go spades, clubs, spades, clubs,
549120	550640	spades, clubs all the way along.
550640	552000	And then you've got diamonds hearts,
552000	553280	diamonds hearts all the way along.
553280	555920	So we're going to do a second pharaoh shuffle.
555920	560160	I am specifically doing out pharaoh shuffles.
560160	564320	And that means that the outermost cards don't change.
564320	567440	And you achieve that by when I take off the bottom deck,
567440	568720	the bottom most card,
568720	570560	which has always been the ace of spades,
570560	572720	when I start pushing them together,
572720	574800	I make sure that goes on the bottom.
574800	575520	There it is.
575520	577600	And then we push all the way along.
578320	585920	And now we've got,
588320	590160	you can see all the black ones or the red ones.
590160	592320	And the bottom card is still the bottom card.
592320	594480	And actually the top card is still the top card.
594480	596160	So this is an out pharaoh shuffle.
596720	598960	Now I put all those together.
600320	603440	And we've got the exact condition required
603440	605120	to get a perfect bridge deal.
605120	605600	Look at that.
605600	608560	Then now the suit perfectly alternate.
608560	612560	So you get all four suits in each group of four.
612560	614800	And it goes spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.
614800	616480	Spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts.
616480	618160	The actual order is not important.
618160	621520	What is important is every fourth card is the same suit.
622080	624080	Also they did cut the deck,
624080	625840	but that actually doesn't make a difference
625840	628240	to the kind of the cycle they're in.
628240	629040	Because cutting the deck,
629040	630560	you're just taking some off one end,
630560	632080	you're putting them on the other end.
632080	634720	Every fourth card is still the same suit.
634720	638240	So I could cut this as many times as I want.
638240	639280	It's like that.
639280	641040	And the deal will still work.
641040	644640	So the first card out happens to be spades.
644640	646880	I didn't know what suit that was going to be because of the cut.
646880	649120	But I do now know that the next three cards
649120	650640	will all be different suits.
650640	652160	And then we go back to spades.
652160	653200	And then we've got hearts.
653200	654080	And then we've got clubs.
654080	654960	Then we've got diamonds.
654960	657040	And then this carries all the way down.
657040	658160	So that's my theory.
658960	661120	Because it was the first hand of the night,
661120	663040	they started with a new deck of cards.
663680	664880	They shuffled them twice.
664880	666960	They accidentally did.
666960	669760	Perfect interleaved shuffles.
669760	673200	And then when they doubt them out into their forehands,
673200	676320	everyone got a complete suit.
676320	682160	Except that is not the only way it could have happened.
682160	683440	When I started playing around with this,
683440	685200	I realized there were other options.
685200	686720	But before we get to those,
686720	688640	we're going to take a closer look
688640	692880	at what actually happens when you do a perfect
693040	694320	Faro shuffle.
694320	695840	And for that purpose,
695840	701360	I have, of course, got another brand new deck of cards.
702000	708240	I'm going to perfectly out Faro shuffle this eight times in a row.
708240	710480	We'll speed the footage up
710480	714320	and watch what happens to the order of the cards.
752880	772160	And that's eight.
772880	774320	All right, I should make it very clear.
774320	780400	I'm now video good enough at doing a perfect Faro shuffle.
780400	782560	I'm not good enough to do it live on stage.
782640	785440	But if I'm filming it and I have the luxury of editing afterwards,
785440	786240	good enough.
786240	788240	So now after eight of these,
788240	794720	you can see they've returned to exactly the same original starting order.
794720	797200	But we could have done in shuffles.
798640	801600	Now I have the cards back in their original order.
801600	806880	I can conveniently show you a different type of Faro shuffle.
806880	811040	So instead of doing the out shuffles like I was doing before,
811040	813040	I could do in shuffles,
813040	816400	which means that the outermost cards move in.
816400	818800	So the bottom card, the ace of spades,
818800	820240	doesn't stay on the bottom.
820240	822000	I move it over slightly.
822000	824720	So now it starts one in.
824720	829440	And the knock on effect is the top card doesn't stay the top card.
829440	830880	It's now one over.
830880	833760	It's slightly in as well.
833760	837280	So you can see now what was the bottom card is now the second card in.
838000	839520	Same thing goes all the way along.
839520	842080	And to what was the top card is now the first card in.
842080	844640	So that is an in Faro shuffle.
844640	847200	And if we do two of those,
847200	849440	give me a second if I re-split the deck.
850160	852400	That looks like it there.
852400	853600	No, off by one.
853600	855760	You know, you just got to judge it by eye.
855760	857200	If they've been properly shuffled,
857200	858800	it's a bit harder to do.
858800	862960	I'm kind of cheating because I know what the card should be.
862960	863600	Okay, there we are.
863600	866880	There's my next in shuffle done.
867760	875200	And lo and behold, I give these a cut and then start dealing.
875200	880160	And once again, we have exactly the same situation.
880160	882240	So I had a bit of a think about it.
882240	882800	I went, you know what?
882800	883360	Hang on a second.
884000	886000	It doesn't have to be out shuffles.
886000	889040	You could instead do two in shuffles.
889040	893760	Or you could do any combination of out and in shuffles.
893760	896800	So if you do an in and an out or then an out and an in,
896800	898960	you still end up with the cards
898960	902720	with each suit perfectly spaced out for a perfect deal.
902720	906560	So that actually makes it even more likely again.
906560	910080	They could have started with a brand new deck of cards,
910080	913280	done any two types of perfect riffle shuffle.
913280	915520	It doesn't matter where they started lining up,
915520	917760	as long as it's an in or an out.
918560	921360	Two of those, any number of cuts anywhere in the deck,
921360	923680	deal it and you get the perfect deal.
924560	929840	Although question now is, if actually this was two in shuffles,
929840	933120	that works, how many in shuffles would it take
933120	936320	before a deck gets right back to where it started?
936320	941200	And so I ran the calculation on it and it turns out 52.
942240	946080	So out shuffles, if you do eight out shuffles in a row,
946080	948080	you get back to where you started.
948080	952080	If you want to use in shuffles to get back to where you started, 52.
952800	958720	I am not going to do 52 in shuffles to show that that works,
958720	961360	because I don't think you'd want to see, oh wait, hang on,
962000	962640	what am I getting?
962640	964160	I'm just, this is coming in live now,
964160	965760	it turns out you would like to see that.
965760	971760	So I'll tell you what, I'll do it live on Patreon as a Q&A.
971760	973520	And so if you're one of my Patreon supporters,
973520	975280	thank you so much, all of you who are,
975280	978000	then you can watch me do it live and ask me questions as I do it.
978720	982960	It's going to take a while and I'll then release the footage on my second channel
982960	984080	so everyone can check it out.
984080	987440	So there you are, I will do 52 in shuffles,
987440	990640	but even that is not the worst case scenario.
992080	995520	We can take a closer look at what actually happens
995520	998960	if we do out shuffles on a brand new deck of cards.
998960	1003120	The aces at both ends, as we know, don't go anywhere.
1003120	1006960	My favorite two cards though are the Fiverr Clubs and the Fiverr Diamonds,
1006960	1010400	they swap, each time you do an out shuffle,
1010400	1012800	they just switch places and they go backwards and forwards
1012800	1015520	in their own little two cycle.
1015520	1019440	Okay, now the two of hearts, it goes to where the three of hearts was,
1019440	1021600	three of hearts moves to where the five of hearts was,
1021600	1024160	the five of hearts goes over to where the nine of hearts was,
1024160	1027200	that moves to the four of clubs, that moves to the seven of diamonds,
1027200	1030080	which goes backwards to where the ace of clubs was,
1030080	1031440	that goes to where the king of diamonds is,
1031440	1033120	and that goes back to the start.
1033120	1036320	So these eight cards form a cycle,
1036320	1039280	and each time you do an out shuffle, they all move one around.
1039280	1042720	In fact, the rest of the cards form eight cycles,
1042720	1046480	there are six of them, and for all the cycles
1046480	1049680	to simultaneously be back where they started,
1049680	1055280	you need to do the lowest common multiple of shuffles,
1055280	1058160	and thankfully two and one both divide into eight,
1058160	1061760	that's why eight shuffles get you back where you started.
1061760	1065840	For in shuffles, it's a bit more complicated,
1065840	1071840	because all of the cards form this single cycle of 52 cards.
1071840	1073680	So that's why you have to do it 52 times,
1073680	1077360	you've just got to go all the way around this giant cycle.
1077360	1080240	If you want to see more about shuffles and cycles,
1080240	1083440	the mathematician and magician Tori Nogas
1083440	1086320	has some fantastic videos going into the maths
1086320	1087520	and the theory behind it,
1087520	1090720	and she does that in far better detail than I could.
1090720	1094960	I just got obsessed with how long
1094960	1097440	I could get the repeating point to be
1097440	1099440	with different combinations of shuffles.
1099440	1102560	So we already know if you do out, out, out over and over again,
1102560	1105440	that's eight in, in, in gives you 52.
1105440	1107680	I then checked in, out, in, out,
1107680	1110640	and if you keep repeating and alternating between the two,
1110640	1115200	504, 504 alternating shuffles
1115200	1116880	before you get back to where you started.
1116880	1118480	And if you start on the out,
1118480	1120080	and then alternate in, out, in, out,
1120080	1121600	it's exactly the same.
1121600	1123040	From here in, it's a bit annoying
1123040	1124080	to have to type them all out.
1124080	1126000	So I'm just going to swap them O's for outs,
1126000	1127520	I's for ins, and I'm going to give you
1127520	1131040	the fewest number you need to then repeat to get the pattern.
1131040	1133680	I started looking at combinations of three,
1133680	1135360	and all of these gave me 60.
1135360	1137360	And I realized these are actually all the same.
1137360	1139360	They're all two outs followed by an in,
1139360	1141200	followed by two outs, then an in.
1141200	1143440	You're just starting at different points in the cycle,
1143440	1144400	same as these ones.
1144400	1146160	And that doesn't make a difference.
1146160	1148400	So I'm only going to give one example,
1148400	1151680	and it doesn't matter where you start in that range.
1151680	1155200	Now I wanted to see if I could find extremely long
1155200	1158560	and unexpectedly short repeating cycles.
1158560	1161840	So if you do out, in, in, out, in, in, in,
1161840	1165040	8,820 before it repeats.
1165040	1165760	Ridiculous.
1165760	1171360	Those seven shuffles, you have to do 8,820 shuffles
1171360	1172640	to get back where you started.
1173280	1175360	These eight, only 16.
1176160	1178160	Seven outs, and then a single in.
1178160	1179840	You just do all of that twice,
1179840	1181280	and you get right back to where you started.
1181280	1183760	And I like the fact that this shows us,
1183760	1186000	if you do a little bit of working out,
1186000	1188880	that an in followed by seven outs followed by an in
1188880	1191680	is the equivalent to doing a single out.
1191680	1194160	And we can actually start to get some interesting equations
1194160	1196720	showing which combinations of shuffles
1196720	1198160	are equivalent to other ones.
1198160	1202000	And when we had that 52 cycle from doing all ins,
1202000	1207360	that tells us that 51 ins is equivalent to an inverse in.
1207360	1209600	And we could carry on with this.
1209600	1212560	I decided just to find one more ridiculous long one
1212560	1213280	and call it a day.
1213920	1217520	I found this run of 13 outs and ins,
1217520	1223040	which doesn't repeat until after 20,000 and 20 shuffles.
1223040	1224080	Just ridiculous.
1224080	1226080	But the point of all of this, where we started,
1226080	1229920	is to find out which shuffles set up a perfect deal.
1229920	1233440	And we already know that two out shuffles, that works.
1233440	1236240	It turns out two in shuffles also works.
1236240	1238960	Get a new deck, two in shuffles, you're ready to go.
1238960	1240640	You can actually do an out and then an in.
1240640	1241120	That works.
1241120	1242640	And you can do an in and an out.
1242640	1243680	That works.
1243680	1245120	And there are loads more.
1245120	1246240	In fact, there are infinitely many.
1246240	1249360	If you do 28 ins, that sets you up.
1249360	1252480	If you do an in, seven outs, two in, seven out, and an in.
1252480	1255520	And I could keep generating these without ever running out.
1255520	1258560	But the important ones are these,
1258560	1261520	which have a realistic chance of actually happening.
1261760	1267360	Given any pair of in and out Faro shuffles will order the deck
1267360	1271840	to give you a perfect deal, of course it's way more likely
1271840	1275760	than assuming the deck is always perfectly randomized.
1275760	1280080	And this starting condition of having all the suits together
1280080	1282400	doesn't only happen in a new deck.
1282400	1284080	When you're playing bridge,
1284080	1286240	a lot of the time when you're putting a card down,
1286240	1288960	it's because the suit of the card you're playing
1288960	1291360	matches the other cards already down.
1291360	1294080	Now, it's not going to happen every game,
1294080	1295360	but a lot of the time,
1295360	1298080	particularly if there's a human picking up the cards
1298080	1300160	who likes organizing things,
1300160	1303920	you will end up accidentally putting the suits together.
1303920	1307120	And so it's going to happen way more often
1307120	1309920	than the naive calculation indicated.
1309920	1312560	And when this happened in 2011,
1312560	1317520	Peter Rowlett of the AP article went through old newspaper archives
1317520	1322000	and found stories of perfect bridge deals one per decade,
1322000	1325680	including my favorite story from 1929,
1325680	1328400	when it happened again at a game in London.
1328400	1333840	And that story says it had happened five times before that on the record,
1333840	1337600	going right back to a game in 1888.
1337600	1338560	So there you are.
1338560	1342320	That's why our senior citizens playing cards
1342480	1348320	with dream on the wrong side of the 10 billion human second century,
1348320	1351440	assuming that everything was perfectly fair
1351440	1354960	and correctly shuffled was incorrect.
1354960	1357280	In the case of our senior citizens,
1357280	1359280	the deck was already stacked.
1359280	1362960	And I maintain the same thing still applies to dream.
1365440	1367360	Speaking of good luck,
1367360	1371360	this video is sponsored by the Great Courses Plus,
1371360	1375360	and I had decided that they could sponsor this video
1375360	1378720	about the bridge deal before I remembered
1378720	1382320	that my friend Art Benjamin has done a whole series for them
1382320	1384320	about magic and math.
1384320	1386080	I can probably be excused
1386080	1388240	because I've got over 11,000 videos
1388240	1391520	and I tend to watch the ones about history.
1391520	1393920	I like them because they fall somewhere between
1393920	1397280	a documentary series and an actual proper course.
1397280	1400560	Only there's no like tests or checks
1400560	1401920	that you're paying attention.

1414800	1418720	I do recommend starting with Art Benjamin's series.
1418720	1422160	Episode five is all about perfect shuffles,
1422160	1423600	pretty much what I covered here.
1423600	1426960	But in magic, you can use in and out shuffles
1427040	1431040	to move the top card to any position in the deck,
1431040	1432080	using binary.
1432080	1433040	Super interesting.
1433040	1435040	And actually, a bit of an open question.
1435760	1438480	You can actually use in and out shuffles
1438480	1440720	to move any card to any position,
1440720	1442880	and I can say that because it occurred to me
1442880	1447360	that 52 cycle of in shuffles does that, just badly.
1447360	1451280	So I have no idea what the most efficient way
1452000	1454320	of moving any card to any position is,
1454320	1455920	but it can definitely be done.
1455920	1456880	There you are.
1456880	1460880	Didn't expect an open question in the sponsorship message,
1460880	1461360	did you?
1461360	1462240	There you are.
1462240	1463200	I haven't looked into it.
