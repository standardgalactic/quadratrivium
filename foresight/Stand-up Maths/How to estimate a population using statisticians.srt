1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
It can be difficult to calculate the size of a wild population,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,400
but thankfully, there are statistical techniques available

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,000
to estimate how big populations are.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today, I'm going to put one of those to test in the real world.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, I have come to the Royal Statistical Society's annual conference.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is the biggest statistics conference in the UK.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are a lot of statisticians here.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But how many are there, right? That's exactly what we're going to do.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to try and estimate the current population size of statisticians

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
by sampling them in their natural habitat.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I've found quite a large group of statisticians.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They're currently feeding.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Unfortunately, this is not all of them.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And statisticians don't all come together to feed or sunbathe or nest.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, unlike some animals,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
where you can just wait until they're all together and count them all,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for statisticians, we're going to have to do something a bit more clever.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're going to have to do a classic capture, recapture estimation.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To help me with the experiment,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm joined by stand-up masses resident statistician, Jen Rogers,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
who is also one of the vice presidents of the Royal Statistical Society.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, she is technically working right now.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
OK. Very quickly, how would you explain capture-recapture?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, you take a sample of people.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You mark them in some way.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then you release them back into the wild.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You leave a little bit of time for them to get mingled back in again.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And then you recapture them and you count how many are actually marked.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK. And to mark our statisticians, we've brought some stickers.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And the plan is just to take these and put them on the back of the conference badge.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Stick it. Easy.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're going to go around.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Behind us is the poster session at the conference,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
where people are presenting their statistical findings in poster form.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're going to label every single person here.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's do it.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, why have we picked the poster session?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, if we'd gone through one of the talks,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we would have only had a particular type of statistician.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, it might be medical or environmental.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
By choosing the poster session,

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
we're hoping that we're going to get a random mix

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
across all of the different statisticians that are here.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And there are a couple of other assumptions that we need to make

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
when doing this capture-recapture.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're going to assume that no one leaves the conference

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
in the time that it takes for us to recapture.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we're going to assume as well that nobody else comes in.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, we need to make sure that the numbers are staying around constant,

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
which is a pretty reasonable assumption at this conference.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And when we do our resampling,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we need to make sure that we also do that randomly.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We're going to be doing that later on in the day.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There are other options than just capture, mark, release, recapture.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You can do it several times for a more accurate result.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here, I have a population of confectionary children.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know how many are in here. There's just over a kilogram of them.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going to sample them several times

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to try and estimate this population.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, my first sampling is going to be this many.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That is... You know what? I'm going to label them and chuck them back in.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Five and 15, 17.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
OK, so I know my first capture was 17.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They've all been marked, except I've numbered them from one to 17.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, when I recapture them, I will know exactly which one is,

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and I can actually keep track over several recapturings

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which ones have been captured how many times.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, I'll have the recapture frequency. So, here's my next sample.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Here we go. And I've got one again.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
thirteen, fourteen, seventeen again.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wow, that is a consistent scoop.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I'm going to number... That one's now 18.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thirty.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
OK, so, I've just relabeled all the ones that came out a second ago,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and there are two new ones.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, I've got a... That's a 14.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wow, that is not very clear.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've got a 14. That's come out a second time.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And number one has come out a second time.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, I'm going to increase both of those.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
14 now goes up to two captures.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One goes up to two captures.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, I've now had an additional 15 that I found for the first time.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And so, that brings us up to 32,

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
which have been uniquely labelled.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And so, I'm going to add all of those into my tally.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm now going to do this for as many times as I can be bothered.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're going to go for 10. So, we've done two so far.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We've got a frequency table for how often each one has been captured.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, I've got all of my stats.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're going to crunch them and see if we can calculate

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
how many confectionary offspring are in that bowl.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
OK, I think I've put most of the data together.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, we've got the 10 times we sampled.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And it was an average of 16.9.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, 17 suites per sample.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then, 48 of them were only picked out once.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
42 were picked twice.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
10 were picked three times.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Two were picked four times.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then, none.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Zero were picked five or more times.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've put that into a bar chart.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Here are the ones that were picked once, twice, three times, four times.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then, that's it.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And there's a missing column here

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
for the ones that were picked zero times.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's what we don't know.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We've got to try and extend this distribution somehow

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to work out how big zero is.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We could do something clever, like a Frisson distribution

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or a geometric thing.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Like everything in statistics, it gets very complicated very quickly

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and I am dangerously underqualified.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So, I have just approximated using probability

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
now that I know the average sample size,

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
what distributions I would get for different population sizes.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm just going to guess.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm going to scroll through a bunch,

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
find the one that's the closest match to this,

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and assume that's it.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, we know there's at least 102.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, if I set my population to 102,

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that's the distribution I would expect.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
As you can see, it's way smaller here.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, obviously, there's more than 102

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because there's some that we didn't pick at all.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, it's got up to 150.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's see how that looks.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, that's a bit.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What if I go up to 180?

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oops, too many. 140.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, that's closer.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They're a little off, they're a little off.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
These are quite close together,

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
so I might bring it down this measure.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
130. Ooh!

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's not bad.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
120.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, too small.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
125.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
126.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
140.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
138.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
138.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
My official prediction is 138.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We're now going to count these to see how close we were.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
A Jen is still here,

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
so it's going to be...

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She's dangerously overqualified

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
for counting confectionary children.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
OK, so I figured...

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not like I had anything better to be doing.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like you've got a conference to run.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK, here we go.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, I reckon we put them in piles of 10.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
OK.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, we can put piles of 10 in the squares.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, we could.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's do 20 per square. OK, here you go.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OK. So, you're on.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
One, two,

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
three, four.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, wow, you're being a lot.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know it.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's still neat.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Not yet, not yet.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sorry, I'm 10.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you have a minute?

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes, yes, please.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sorry. Wait, do you want us to bring them afterwards?

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We can...

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can't do it.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
OK.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How many is that?

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ooh, that's got to be two.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's a two. That's a two.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to put them there.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
One, two, three, four.

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Seven.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're ones that are, like, trap-shy.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Like, they're less likely to get caught.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's true. You know, that's an important feat.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I mean, you can exclude it

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
as a... No.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, it's the real world.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
These confectionary children.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm just assuming I'm going to be right,

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
so I want to do it in a dramatic...

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean... ...reveal.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, no.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No!

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
160.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
160.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
One, two, three, four,

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
169.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's not 130.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No, I'm checking my bar chart.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Population of 169, you'd expect.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, come on!

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We should have trusted the tale.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah. Didn't trust the tale.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We should have gone, this is wrong.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This has not bowed well for our estimation

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
of the number of statisticians.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Uncertainty. You would always put...

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Exactly. We've got the error bars.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're in the room with a final closing.

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Plenary sessions about to take place.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
People are just coming in to take their seats.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And we're quite happy that if we take every person

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
on the end of each of the aisles,

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that that should be a pretty good random mix

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
of all the different statisticians.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's do it.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Give a green sticker.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is that OK?

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OK.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
David Spiegelholt has started talking,

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
so we have to get out because he gets very angry.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He doesn't, he's lovely.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I had eight people with stickers

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and 22 without stickers.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
OK, I had 13 with stickers.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And 21 with stickers.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
24 without.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OK, and then there's 21 with stickers.

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So we had a total population...

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm going to add going up of 67.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's surprisingly close to last time.

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is that good? I don't know.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The way the equation works out is

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we assume that what we just did now

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
is work out the proportion of the population

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
we previously stickered.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And so the number of people in the first sample,

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we stickered all of them,

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
divided by the total population,

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and the second sample, who were stickered,

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
divided by the size of the second sample.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yep.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So if we multiply the first sample size

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
by the second sample size,

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
divided by the number of stickers,

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
which I'm going to put here,

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
so it's 64 times 67,

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
divided by 21,

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that is our estimate.

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So I'm going to work that out.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Jen actually knows the correct answer.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I do.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because she's on the organising team.

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I will...

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do I have to round to the nearest whole statistician?

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, we don't have many half statisticians here.

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, if there's anywhere you're going to have

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a fraction of a person, it's here.

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
OK, so...

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
OK, so we're going to do, like, a 1, 2, 3 reveal.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yep, sounds good.

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
OK, ready? 1, 2, 3,

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
204.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
475.

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So no.

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Get home!

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I must have done that wrong.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Did I do the maths wrong?

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's horrific.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So...

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hang on, I'm going to do it logically from the top.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So we're saying that 21 divided by

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
67,

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
we labelled about a third before.

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yep.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, at times about 60 is about 200.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yep.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And what is it, everyone who's here today?

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
475 are here today.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So in conclusion, statistics doesn't work.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In conclusion, statistics is difficult.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So we got nowhere near it.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
204.

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I mean, there are several reasons what could have gone wrong there.

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is the very end of the conference.

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Loads of people have left.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There are not 475 people still in there.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I mean, people are leaving right now, see?

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So 475 was more of an upper bound.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's the maximum number.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So if we'd gotten more than that, we'd been worried.

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Under that is fine.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And frankly, it's the correct order of magnitude.

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I refuse to accept there are 475 people in there.

301
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I guess more importantly,

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
as I was sampling statisticians at the end, they're like,

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
oh yes, but actually there's going to be a lot of overlap

304
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
between the sorts of people who will go to the poster session

305
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and go to the general plenary.

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They're the ones who are interested in a wide range of things

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and being engaged in the community.

308
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And obviously some people will just come in for their seminars

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or their subsection and go.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I mean, we could have done a better random sample.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We could have done a bigger sample.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We should have done more samples.

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So basically, in conclusion, we didn't put the effort in.

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And when I did do more samples with the confectionary children,

315
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I shouldn't have just eyeballed it.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I shouldn't have done a proper thing.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And that would have revealed that the tail was the bit

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I should have been matching, not the lead to cause.

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Anyway, it's been great fun.

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Thanks to the Royal Statistical Society for getting me along.

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm now doing the after dinner like entertainment

322
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
at the closing conference dinner.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That'll be fun.

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And thanks to all the Patreon people who fund these things.

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So when I get invited to a conference,

326
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can, you know, bring a camera, make a video, put it online.

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Thank you so much for your statistically significant support.
