1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Now, instead of having to know all this, all the scales, the dominant, the subdominant,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,640
one, four, five, blah, blah, blah, and all this diatonic harmony, it's impressive.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,760
And now you can explain it if somebody asks you, but wouldn't it be nice to just get rid

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,760
of this and just have a circle?

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Because watch what happens.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,960
This is step number one, right?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,000
This is four.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
This is five.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,040
This is two.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
This is six.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
And this is three.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
All right?

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,760
Have you ever heard the term relative minor?

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,040
Every major key has a relative minor key.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,040
All right.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Back to the husband and wife story.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
Home, wife, husband.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
All right?

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
All right?

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,400
If the husband leaves home, if the C chord goes to a G chord, almost always with the

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:09,080
GPS in my family, the Cecil's like, look, he loves that woman inside that GPS, okay?

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,560
She talks the whole time we're on a trip, but just get, get, get, get, turn left, turn

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
right.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
You went too far.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Go back.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
You just want to smack her.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Her name is Jill.

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Yeah.

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
One goes to five.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,560
The husband almost always knows how to get back home.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,560
So if a C chord goes to a G chord, one to five, see, it always goes back to one.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,560
If the wife leaves home, goes shopping, generally she can find her way back home too.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,560
See, four goes to one.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,560
But once in a while, I don't have a GPS.

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,560
So I have a tendency to get lost.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,560
So I have to call the husband or go get him and then both go home.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
See, use his GPS, then go home.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
All right.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,560
So C chord, if the wife leaves most of the time, she goes right back home.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Occasionally, one goes to four, goes to five.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,560
One goes to four, goes to five, goes to one.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,560
On the circle, I just go, okay, C goes to G, 99% odds that the third chord is going to

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
be G.

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
All right.

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:35,560
If a C chord goes to F, 85% odds, well, no, 90% odds that she's going to go back home too.

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,560
But if she doesn't go back home, she usually goes, gets the husband and then they go home.

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
All right.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
That's how it works.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,560
So if I'm not in the key of C, I'm in the key of F.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Look, what are the three major chords in the key of F?

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,560
F, B flat and C.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
If F goes to C, what's the next chord?

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
F.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,560
If F goes to B flat, what's the next chord?

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
F.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Right.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
All right.

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
How about the key of E?

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
E, B and A.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
See how easy?

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Yeah.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Now comes these other little guys, those minor, the relatives.

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Okay.

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
I've got husband and wife all set with the home.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Then I've got these relatives out here.

67
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
All right.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,560
The relative, the main relative is Uncle Albert.

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
We'll call him.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,560
The relative's house is always at nine o'clock, right around the corner.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,560
If the major chord is at 12 o'clock, the name of the key, the tonic, then the relative

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,560
minor is at nine o'clock, always.

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,560
And the one to the right of it and the one to the left of it are the other two minors.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
So check it out.

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
In the key of C, this holds true, right?

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
See, look.

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,560
C, there's D minor right there, E minor and A minor and G and F.

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,560
So I have every step of the scale from eight o'clock to one o'clock.

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,560
And that is, and if I go all the way down, if I just cut the pie in half, there's that

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
B diminished chord.

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,560
That's the last note in that C scale.

82
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,560
So it's the pie, one o'clock, all the way to seven o'clock.

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Those are all the chords that get used in the key of C.

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Cool, huh?

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,560
If I put F at 12 o'clock, let's pretend that that's 12 o'clock, it would be F to E.

86
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,560
The major chords would be F, B flat and C and the minors would be D, A and G.

87
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
And G, I can't jump back there.

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
I have to take the road to get back there.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Thus comes my chord progression.

90
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
And I don't even need to think.

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,560
It's C, A minor, D minor, G, C.

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
If it jumps down here to E minor, look.

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Say it.

94
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,560
C, E minor, A minor, D minor, G, C.

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
And there it is.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Everybody.

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Aren't you glad you have a circle?

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Okay, I'm in the key of B flat.

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
First chord is B flat.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Second chord is D minor.

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
What's the next chord?

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
G minor.

103
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
G minor.

104
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Next chord?

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
C minor.

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
F major, B flat.

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Remember, one to the left, one to the right, or major.

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
The next three back are minor.

109
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
But there's always a flat.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Not always.

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Depending on the melody and how the composer wrote the song,

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,560
sometimes these minor chords, which are supposed to be minor,

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,560
they just decide to make them major just because they can.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
For example, this song.

115
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Now, the first chord is C.

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
The problem is the composer probably wrote the melody

117
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
before he figured out the chords.

118
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,560
And he went 5-2.

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
There's a G sharp in the second major.

120
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Big problem.

121
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,560
He tried every single one of those other chords in the key of C.

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
He tried F.

123
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
That didn't work.

124
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,560
He tried G.

125
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
That didn't work.

126
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
He tried D minor.

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
That didn't work.

128
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
He tried D major.

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,560
See, none of them worked because the G sharp was in the melody.

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
From C all the way down to B,

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,560
what's the only chord in that segment that has a G sharp in it?

132
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,560
That's a quiet answer.

133
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Spell the chords.

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,560
G B D, D F sharp A, A C sharp E, E G sharp B.

135
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
The E chord.

136
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
The E major chord has a G sharp in it.

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
So, I'll use that E chord.

138
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Now, the rest is a no-brainer

139
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,560
because remember, I told you, you've got to take the road home.

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
What comes after E?

141
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Now, he said it now is in major, so it's going to probably,

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
let's try A minor.

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Oh, that's too depressing.

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
He left it major.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
A, then what? A, then what?

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
D, then G, C.

147
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
And because most songs are divided into eight bar sections,

148
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,560
the next section did the same thing.

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,560
E, A, B, G, C.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:25,560
E, A, B, G, C.

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Boring.

152
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah, but it's fun.

153
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
It's fun.

154
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
And you know what?

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
When you start using the circle, everything changes.

156
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
You start to go, wow, this song used to be hardened now.

157
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
I get it.

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Okay, what if I want to play 5-2 in the key of G?

159
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Oh, I can either sit down with my little pencil

160
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
and do what we did earlier,

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,560
or I can use my transposer on the organ,

162
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
or I can use logic here.

163
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Now, in the key of C, my first note was E.

164
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,560
All right, I'm not going to use the circle to figure this out.

165
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,560
In the key of C, what step of the scale is E?

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Use your fingers.

167
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Three.

168
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So in the key of G, G, A, B,

169
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm going to start on B.

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
And I'm going to play all the ethnotes chart.

171
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Okay?

172
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,560
So I'm going to start with a G chord.

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,560
All right, now, from the key of C,

174
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I went all the way back to E.

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,560
The key of G, I'm going to go all the way back to what?

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
B.

177
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
What's my next chord?

178
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
G.

179
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
B.

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Next.

181
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
B.

182
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
A.

183
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Next.

184
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
B.

185
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Next.

186
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
B.

187
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
G.

188
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,560
First time I did that, I'm so excited you thought I just wrote a symphony.

189
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Something that small, that little accomplishment,

190
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
you stood there to go.

191
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Wow, I changed the key.
