0	5600	Now, instead of having to know all this, all the scales, the dominant, the subdominant,
5600	11640	one, four, five, blah, blah, blah, and all this diatonic harmony, it's impressive.
11640	16760	And now you can explain it if somebody asks you, but wouldn't it be nice to just get rid
16760	18760	of this and just have a circle?
18760	19760	Yeah.
19760	21760	Because watch what happens.
21760	25960	This is step number one, right?
25960	28000	This is four.
28000	29520	This is five.
29540	31040	This is two.
31040	33040	This is six.
33040	35040	And this is three.
35040	36040	All right?
36040	40760	Have you ever heard the term relative minor?
40760	45040	Every major key has a relative minor key.
45040	47040	All right.
47040	50040	Back to the husband and wife story.
50040	52040	Home, wife, husband.
52040	53040	All right?
53560	54560	All right?
54560	61400	If the husband leaves home, if the C chord goes to a G chord, almost always with the
61400	69080	GPS in my family, the Cecil's like, look, he loves that woman inside that GPS, okay?
69080	72560	She talks the whole time we're on a trip, but just get, get, get, get, turn left, turn
72560	73560	right.
73560	74560	You went too far.
74560	75560	Go back.
75560	76560	You just want to smack her.
76560	78560	Her name is Jill.
78560	79560	Yeah.
79560	81560	One goes to five.
81560	86560	The husband almost always knows how to get back home.
86560	93560	So if a C chord goes to a G chord, one to five, see, it always goes back to one.
93560	100560	If the wife leaves home, goes shopping, generally she can find her way back home too.
100560	103560	See, four goes to one.
103560	107560	But once in a while, I don't have a GPS.
107560	110560	So I have a tendency to get lost.
110560	116560	So I have to call the husband or go get him and then both go home.
116560	120560	See, use his GPS, then go home.
120560	121560	All right.
121560	127560	So C chord, if the wife leaves most of the time, she goes right back home.
127560	131560	Occasionally, one goes to four, goes to five.
131560	136560	One goes to four, goes to five, goes to one.
136560	143560	On the circle, I just go, okay, C goes to G, 99% odds that the third chord is going to
143560	144560	be G.
144560	145560	All right.
145560	155560	If a C chord goes to F, 85% odds, well, no, 90% odds that she's going to go back home too.
155560	161560	But if she doesn't go back home, she usually goes, gets the husband and then they go home.
161560	162560	All right.
162560	164560	That's how it works.
164560	168560	So if I'm not in the key of C, I'm in the key of F.
168560	172560	Look, what are the three major chords in the key of F?
172560	175560	F, B flat and C.
175560	178560	If F goes to C, what's the next chord?
178560	179560	F.
179560	182560	If F goes to B flat, what's the next chord?
182560	183560	F.
183560	184560	Right.
184560	185560	All right.
185560	187560	How about the key of E?
187560	189560	E, B and A.
189560	191560	See how easy?
191560	192560	Yeah.
192560	195560	Now comes these other little guys, those minor, the relatives.
195560	196560	Okay.
196560	200560	I've got husband and wife all set with the home.
200560	203560	Then I've got these relatives out here.
203560	204560	All right.
204560	209560	The relative, the main relative is Uncle Albert.
209560	211560	We'll call him.
211560	218560	The relative's house is always at nine o'clock, right around the corner.
218560	225560	If the major chord is at 12 o'clock, the name of the key, the tonic, then the relative
225560	228560	minor is at nine o'clock, always.
228560	238560	And the one to the right of it and the one to the left of it are the other two minors.
238560	239560	So check it out.
239560	241560	In the key of C, this holds true, right?
241560	242560	See, look.
242560	249560	C, there's D minor right there, E minor and A minor and G and F.
249560	256560	So I have every step of the scale from eight o'clock to one o'clock.
256560	262560	And that is, and if I go all the way down, if I just cut the pie in half, there's that
262560	263560	B diminished chord.
263560	267560	That's the last note in that C scale.
267560	271560	So it's the pie, one o'clock, all the way to seven o'clock.
271560	277560	Those are all the chords that get used in the key of C.
277560	278560	Cool, huh?
278560	285560	If I put F at 12 o'clock, let's pretend that that's 12 o'clock, it would be F to E.
285560	292560	The major chords would be F, B flat and C and the minors would be D, A and G.
292560	294560	And G, I can't jump back there.
294560	298560	I have to take the road to get back there.
298560	301560	Thus comes my chord progression.
301560	303560	And I don't even need to think.
303560	308560	It's C, A minor, D minor, G, C.
308560	312560	If it jumps down here to E minor, look.
312560	313560	Say it.
313560	319560	C, E minor, A minor, D minor, G, C.
319560	321560	And there it is.
321560	323560	Everybody.
323560	327560	Aren't you glad you have a circle?
327560	330560	Okay, I'm in the key of B flat.
330560	332560	First chord is B flat.
332560	335560	Second chord is D minor.
335560	336560	What's the next chord?
336560	337560	G minor.
337560	338560	G minor.
338560	339560	Next chord?
339560	340560	C minor.
340560	342560	F major, B flat.
342560	346560	Remember, one to the left, one to the right, or major.
346560	349560	The next three back are minor.
349560	352560	But there's always a flat.
352560	354560	Not always.
354560	358560	Depending on the melody and how the composer wrote the song,
358560	363560	sometimes these minor chords, which are supposed to be minor,
363560	367560	they just decide to make them major just because they can.
367560	370560	For example, this song.
373560	378560	Now, the first chord is C.
378560	381560	The problem is the composer probably wrote the melody
381560	383560	before he figured out the chords.
383560	386560	And he went 5-2.
386560	390560	There's a G sharp in the second major.
390560	391560	Big problem.
391560	396560	He tried every single one of those other chords in the key of C.
396560	398560	He tried F.
398560	400560	That didn't work.
400560	403560	He tried G.
403560	405560	That didn't work.
405560	408560	He tried D minor.
408560	410560	That didn't work.
410560	413560	He tried D major.
413560	419560	See, none of them worked because the G sharp was in the melody.
419560	422560	From C all the way down to B,
422560	428560	what's the only chord in that segment that has a G sharp in it?
428560	431560	That's a quiet answer.
431560	432560	Spell the chords.
432560	439560	G B D, D F sharp A, A C sharp E, E G sharp B.
439560	441560	The E chord.
441560	444560	The E major chord has a G sharp in it.
444560	447560	So, I'll use that E chord.
451560	453560	Now, the rest is a no-brainer
453560	457560	because remember, I told you, you've got to take the road home.
457560	459560	What comes after E?
459560	463560	Now, he said it now is in major, so it's going to probably,
463560	465560	let's try A minor.
466560	468560	Oh, that's too depressing.
468560	470560	He left it major.
470560	476560	A, then what? A, then what?
476560	480560	D, then G, C.
480560	484560	And because most songs are divided into eight bar sections,
484560	487560	the next section did the same thing.
487560	494560	E, A, B, G, C.
494560	505560	E, A, B, G, C.
505560	507560	Boring.
507560	508560	Yeah, but it's fun.
508560	509560	It's fun.
509560	510560	And you know what?
510560	515560	When you start using the circle, everything changes.
515560	518560	You start to go, wow, this song used to be hardened now.
518560	520560	I get it.
520560	525560	Okay, what if I want to play 5-2 in the key of G?
525560	529560	Oh, I can either sit down with my little pencil
529560	531560	and do what we did earlier,
531560	535560	or I can use my transposer on the organ,
535560	539560	or I can use logic here.
539560	544560	Now, in the key of C, my first note was E.
544560	549560	All right, I'm not going to use the circle to figure this out.
549560	553560	In the key of C, what step of the scale is E?
553560	555560	Use your fingers.
555560	556560	Three.
556560	561560	So in the key of G, G, A, B,
561560	563560	I'm going to start on B.
563560	567560	And I'm going to play all the ethnotes chart.
567560	568560	Okay?
568560	573560	So I'm going to start with a G chord.
573560	576560	All right, now, from the key of C,
576560	578560	I went all the way back to E.
578560	582560	The key of G, I'm going to go all the way back to what?
582560	583560	B.
583560	586560	What's my next chord?
586560	587560	G.
587560	588560	B.
588560	589560	Next.
589560	590560	B.
590560	591560	A.
591560	592560	Next.
592560	593560	B.
593560	594560	Next.
594560	595560	B.
595560	596560	G.
596560	602560	First time I did that, I'm so excited you thought I just wrote a symphony.
602560	606560	Something that small, that little accomplishment,
606560	608560	you stood there to go.
608560	610560	Wow, I changed the key.
