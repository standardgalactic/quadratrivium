Processing Overview for Karen Ramirez
============================
Checking Karen Ramirez/Determining song chords using the circle.txt
1. If you're in the key of C and want to play a 5-2 chord progression, you start on A (the fifth) and end on C (the tonic). The sequence is A -> E (or E7 if you want to include the major seventh).

2. In the key of B flat, following the same progression, you'd start on E (the fifth) and end on B flat (the tonic), with D minor as the second chord.

3. For a song in the key of G that wants to mimic a 5-2 pattern, you would start on B (the fifth) since G is three semitones higher than C. The progression would then be B -> G (the tonic), repeating this pattern until resolved back to G.

4. Using the circle of fifths can simplify finding chords in different keys and help you understand how to transpose songs from one key to another.

5. The circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationships between chords in different keys, showing that each fifth note has the same function (tonic, dominant, etc.) in its relative major or minor key.

6. Remembering the pattern of whole steps and half steps in the key signatures can also help you navigate the circle of fifths and understand where to place your chords when transposing.
