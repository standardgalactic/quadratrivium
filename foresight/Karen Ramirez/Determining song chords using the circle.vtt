00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Now, instead of having to know all this, all the scales, the dominant, the subdominant,

00:05.600 --> 00:11.640
one, four, five, blah, blah, blah, and all this diatonic harmony, it's impressive.

00:11.640 --> 00:16.760
And now you can explain it if somebody asks you, but wouldn't it be nice to just get rid

00:16.760 --> 00:18.760
of this and just have a circle?

00:18.760 --> 00:19.760
Yeah.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.760
Because watch what happens.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.960
This is step number one, right?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.000
This is four.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.520
This is five.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.040
This is two.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.040
This is six.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.040
And this is three.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
All right?

00:36.040 --> 00:40.760
Have you ever heard the term relative minor?

00:40.760 --> 00:45.040
Every major key has a relative minor key.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.040
All right.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.040
Back to the husband and wife story.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.040
Home, wife, husband.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.040
All right?

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
All right?

00:54.560 --> 01:01.400
If the husband leaves home, if the C chord goes to a G chord, almost always with the

01:01.400 --> 01:09.080
GPS in my family, the Cecil's like, look, he loves that woman inside that GPS, okay?

01:09.080 --> 01:12.560
She talks the whole time we're on a trip, but just get, get, get, get, turn left, turn

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
right.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
You went too far.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
Go back.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
You just want to smack her.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.560
Her name is Jill.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.560
Yeah.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.560
One goes to five.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.560
The husband almost always knows how to get back home.

01:26.560 --> 01:33.560
So if a C chord goes to a G chord, one to five, see, it always goes back to one.

01:33.560 --> 01:40.560
If the wife leaves home, goes shopping, generally she can find her way back home too.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.560
See, four goes to one.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.560
But once in a while, I don't have a GPS.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.560
So I have a tendency to get lost.

01:50.560 --> 01:56.560
So I have to call the husband or go get him and then both go home.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.560
See, use his GPS, then go home.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.560
All right.

02:01.560 --> 02:07.560
So C chord, if the wife leaves most of the time, she goes right back home.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.560
Occasionally, one goes to four, goes to five.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.560
One goes to four, goes to five, goes to one.

02:16.560 --> 02:23.560
On the circle, I just go, okay, C goes to G, 99% odds that the third chord is going to

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
be G.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.560
All right.

02:25.560 --> 02:35.560
If a C chord goes to F, 85% odds, well, no, 90% odds that she's going to go back home too.

02:35.560 --> 02:41.560
But if she doesn't go back home, she usually goes, gets the husband and then they go home.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
All right.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.560
That's how it works.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.560
So if I'm not in the key of C, I'm in the key of F.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.560
Look, what are the three major chords in the key of F?

02:52.560 --> 02:55.560
F, B flat and C.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.560
If F goes to C, what's the next chord?

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
F.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.560
If F goes to B flat, what's the next chord?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
F.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
Right.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.560
All right.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.560
How about the key of E?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.560
E, B and A.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.560
See how easy?

03:11.560 --> 03:12.560
Yeah.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.560
Now comes these other little guys, those minor, the relatives.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.560
Okay.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.560
I've got husband and wife all set with the home.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.560
Then I've got these relatives out here.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.560
All right.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.560
The relative, the main relative is Uncle Albert.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.560
We'll call him.

03:31.560 --> 03:38.560
The relative's house is always at nine o'clock, right around the corner.

03:38.560 --> 03:45.560
If the major chord is at 12 o'clock, the name of the key, the tonic, then the relative

03:45.560 --> 03:48.560
minor is at nine o'clock, always.

03:48.560 --> 03:58.560
And the one to the right of it and the one to the left of it are the other two minors.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.560
So check it out.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
In the key of C, this holds true, right?

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
See, look.

04:02.560 --> 04:09.560
C, there's D minor right there, E minor and A minor and G and F.

04:09.560 --> 04:16.560
So I have every step of the scale from eight o'clock to one o'clock.

04:16.560 --> 04:22.560
And that is, and if I go all the way down, if I just cut the pie in half, there's that

04:22.560 --> 04:23.560
B diminished chord.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.560
That's the last note in that C scale.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.560
So it's the pie, one o'clock, all the way to seven o'clock.

04:31.560 --> 04:37.560
Those are all the chords that get used in the key of C.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.560
Cool, huh?

04:38.560 --> 04:45.560
If I put F at 12 o'clock, let's pretend that that's 12 o'clock, it would be F to E.

04:45.560 --> 04:52.560
The major chords would be F, B flat and C and the minors would be D, A and G.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.560
And G, I can't jump back there.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.560
I have to take the road to get back there.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.560
Thus comes my chord progression.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.560
And I don't even need to think.

05:03.560 --> 05:08.560
It's C, A minor, D minor, G, C.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.560
If it jumps down here to E minor, look.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
Say it.

05:13.560 --> 05:19.560
C, E minor, A minor, D minor, G, C.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.560
And there it is.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.560
Everybody.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.560
Aren't you glad you have a circle?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.560
Okay, I'm in the key of B flat.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.560
First chord is B flat.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.560
Second chord is D minor.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
What's the next chord?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
G minor.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
G minor.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
Next chord?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.560
C minor.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.560
F major, B flat.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.560
Remember, one to the left, one to the right, or major.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.560
The next three back are minor.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.560
But there's always a flat.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.560
Not always.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.560
Depending on the melody and how the composer wrote the song,

05:58.560 --> 06:03.560
sometimes these minor chords, which are supposed to be minor,

06:03.560 --> 06:07.560
they just decide to make them major just because they can.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.560
For example, this song.

06:13.560 --> 06:18.560
Now, the first chord is C.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.560
The problem is the composer probably wrote the melody

06:21.560 --> 06:23.560
before he figured out the chords.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.560
And he went 5-2.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.560
There's a G sharp in the second major.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
Big problem.

06:31.560 --> 06:36.560
He tried every single one of those other chords in the key of C.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.560
He tried F.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
That didn't work.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.560
He tried G.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
That didn't work.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.560
He tried D minor.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
That didn't work.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.560
He tried D major.

06:53.560 --> 06:59.560
See, none of them worked because the G sharp was in the melody.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.560
From C all the way down to B,

07:02.560 --> 07:08.560
what's the only chord in that segment that has a G sharp in it?

07:08.560 --> 07:11.560
That's a quiet answer.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
Spell the chords.

07:12.560 --> 07:19.560
G B D, D F sharp A, A C sharp E, E G sharp B.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.560
The E chord.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.560
The E major chord has a G sharp in it.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.560
So, I'll use that E chord.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.560
Now, the rest is a no-brainer

07:33.560 --> 07:37.560
because remember, I told you, you've got to take the road home.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.560
What comes after E?

07:39.560 --> 07:43.560
Now, he said it now is in major, so it's going to probably,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.560
let's try A minor.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.560
Oh, that's too depressing.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.560
He left it major.

07:50.560 --> 07:56.560
A, then what? A, then what?

07:56.560 --> 08:00.560
D, then G, C.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.560
And because most songs are divided into eight bar sections,

08:04.560 --> 08:07.560
the next section did the same thing.

08:07.560 --> 08:14.560
E, A, B, G, C.

08:14.560 --> 08:25.560
E, A, B, G, C.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
Boring.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.560
Yeah, but it's fun.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
It's fun.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.560
And you know what?

08:30.560 --> 08:35.560
When you start using the circle, everything changes.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.560
You start to go, wow, this song used to be hardened now.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.560
I get it.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.560
Okay, what if I want to play 5-2 in the key of G?

08:45.560 --> 08:49.560
Oh, I can either sit down with my little pencil

08:49.560 --> 08:51.560
and do what we did earlier,

08:51.560 --> 08:55.560
or I can use my transposer on the organ,

08:55.560 --> 08:59.560
or I can use logic here.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.560
Now, in the key of C, my first note was E.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.560
All right, I'm not going to use the circle to figure this out.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.560
In the key of C, what step of the scale is E?

09:13.560 --> 09:15.560
Use your fingers.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.560
Three.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.560
So in the key of G, G, A, B,

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
I'm going to start on B.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.560
And I'm going to play all the ethnotes chart.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
Okay?

09:28.560 --> 09:33.560
So I'm going to start with a G chord.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.560
All right, now, from the key of C,

09:36.560 --> 09:38.560
I went all the way back to E.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.560
The key of G, I'm going to go all the way back to what?

09:42.560 --> 09:43.560
B.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.560
What's my next chord?

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
G.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
B.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
Next.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.560
B.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.560
A.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
Next.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
B.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.560
Next.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.560
B.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.560
G.

09:56.560 --> 10:02.560
First time I did that, I'm so excited you thought I just wrote a symphony.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.560
Something that small, that little accomplishment,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
you stood there to go.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.560
Wow, I changed the key.
