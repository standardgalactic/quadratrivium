WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
I forget now whether you do have a discussant or not. Yeah, Virginia.

00:04.160 --> 00:06.160
Oh, it's Virginia's gonna. Okay, great. So

00:07.040 --> 00:10.160
She's here. Yeah, she's there. Hi, Jenny. I've been Virginia. I mean

00:24.720 --> 00:25.920
Have you

00:26.000 --> 00:33.040
Josh, you haven't seen any sessions at all yet, right? Um, I've seen I haven't been able to join live, but I watched video from the first two days

00:33.680 --> 00:35.680
Did you watch belkin?

00:35.680 --> 00:41.520
I did. Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. I was even gonna refer to it briefly. Yeah. Okay. That's why I don't want this to explain. Yeah

00:41.840 --> 00:43.840
Um

00:54.720 --> 00:56.960
I'm I'm also trying to see if there's some time

00:57.200 --> 01:02.240
I know you said that there might I might be able to join I can't join the discuss or there is no discussion today, but um

01:02.800 --> 01:07.120
I'm trying to see if there's any one of the other panels that my schedule would be great. I can add

01:08.240 --> 01:10.240
Yeah, I'll I'll uh

01:10.480 --> 01:12.960
I'll I'll be in touch about that. Okay. Let me just

01:14.960 --> 01:16.960
Solid duty here

01:33.200 --> 01:37.680
Welcome everybody to the afternoon session everybody out in in the

01:38.640 --> 01:42.640
Distributed land and everybody here. I'd like to um

01:43.200 --> 01:50.560
Introduce Josh Stendenbaum who's professor of computational cognitive science in the department of brain and cognitive science

01:51.280 --> 01:52.880
at mit

01:52.880 --> 02:00.720
He's a principal investigator at the computer science and artificial intelligence lab called sea sail. Is that former sail?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.880
No, uh sail is a stem from sail

02:05.840 --> 02:10.800
But it's formerly the AI lab and the lcs laboratory for computer science

02:11.200 --> 02:16.640
Great. Yeah, and a thrust leader in the center for brains minds and machines cbn

02:16.640 --> 02:24.240
And his papers are on perception learning common sensory reasoning in humans and machines with the twin goals of better

02:24.640 --> 02:31.360
Understanding human intelligence in computational terms and building more human like intelligence in machines

02:32.000 --> 02:34.640
In other words, he's cut out perfectly for this

02:36.080 --> 02:39.200
Summer school. I hand it over now to Josh Stendenbaum

02:40.160 --> 02:43.520
Okay, great. Thank you so much, Steven for organizing for inviting me

02:45.120 --> 02:51.600
You know, I I got to watch much of the first two days and it was really interesting to see a back and forth between people who are

02:52.160 --> 02:54.640
Extremely impressed with large language models

02:55.120 --> 03:00.240
Both on their language abilities and maybe some of their general thinking abilities and other people who are much more skeptical

03:00.880 --> 03:04.080
That they have really anything to do with intelligence at least of the human form

03:04.720 --> 03:09.200
The work I'm going to talk about here is a is an interesting I think mix of those two perspectives

03:10.720 --> 03:12.240
And I hope that will

03:12.240 --> 03:14.240
Be useful stimulating

03:14.560 --> 03:18.800
Engage in some interesting discussion both now and going forward over the next two weeks

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
The the heart of the talk, which will really be more like the second half is based on this paper

03:24.000 --> 03:27.200
Which you can find on archive from word models to world models

03:27.600 --> 03:31.200
Understanding natural language by translating into a probabilistic language of thought

03:32.080 --> 03:40.080
But I'm going to spend the first half setting some context on just how we think about thinking and then it's built on that for the relationship between language and thought

03:41.280 --> 03:45.120
This is you know, I would say this is both an AI talk and a cognitive science talk

03:45.200 --> 03:48.480
Although most fundamentally to me. I'm really interested in the computational structure

03:49.280 --> 03:51.200
of the human mind

03:51.200 --> 03:52.640
So just in that

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
hear it in that lens

03:54.640 --> 03:57.280
But I think also just sort of very generally

03:58.000 --> 04:01.040
You know, nobody can fail to be surprised and impressed

04:01.600 --> 04:04.640
At what has happened with the most recent machine learning models

04:05.680 --> 04:10.000
And at the same time they're they're very puzzling and confounding in certain ways

04:10.000 --> 04:12.560
So I hope to try to be able to resolve some of that or at least

04:12.960 --> 04:14.960
Point the way towards some of that

04:15.360 --> 04:18.320
This paper the work i'm going to talk about is joint with a number of people

04:18.640 --> 04:24.480
I want to single out two people Lionel long and Gabe grand who are the joint first authors of that paper

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
I'm putting Lionel a little bit bigger

04:27.200 --> 04:29.840
In part because a lot more of my slides are taken from lines

04:30.240 --> 04:35.920
So I would say all of the credit for the good stuff both on the research and in the slides to Lionel and Gabe

04:37.360 --> 04:42.320
And you know anything that doesn't quite work or make sense is probably just me garbling things

04:42.960 --> 04:44.000
Okay

04:44.000 --> 04:47.120
But a lot of other people contribute to the work that i'm going to talk about here

04:48.000 --> 04:52.400
So again, you know, we can't who cannot be impressed with the advances of AI

04:52.640 --> 04:56.320
Whether it's in perception and and you know robots deployed in the real world

04:56.320 --> 05:02.640
Like the self-driving car systems of tesla and wemo or most recently conversational AI systems like chat gpt

05:03.840 --> 05:06.240
Clearly there's something really interesting and important happening

05:06.400 --> 05:08.560
But at the same time something quite puzzling now

05:08.560 --> 05:11.120
There's a number of puzzles that people here have talked about just one

05:11.120 --> 05:13.920
I'll point to is what you might call the puzzle of confabulation

05:15.280 --> 05:17.520
Which points to what ways I think that the kinds of

05:18.480 --> 05:25.280
What intelligence or unquote intelligence that we see in these systems is different in nature and origins from that in our own minds

05:25.760 --> 05:29.520
So think about for example in the context of driving. This is a video from tesla

05:30.160 --> 05:36.800
A self-driving system where it's it's faced with something a little bit out of its training set a horse drawn carriage and and

05:37.840 --> 05:42.320
Buggy and it interprets it as a truck first facing one way the other then it's

05:43.440 --> 05:45.680
SUV then it's a truck with the person behind it

05:46.640 --> 05:48.640
Now the person's gone away

05:48.720 --> 05:50.720
Shortly the person will come back

05:51.520 --> 05:53.680
You know, they can't figure out which way the truck is facing

05:54.320 --> 05:59.280
If a person were having this experience on the road, you would think they should stop driving and get off the road as soon as possible

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
Right. There's something fundamentally

06:02.560 --> 06:04.560
Detached about their mind from reality here

06:05.600 --> 06:11.200
And when this happens in systems where lives are at stake, it can be deadly. So this is a serious worry

06:11.760 --> 06:13.040
technologically and

06:13.120 --> 06:19.760
Sightly now when it comes to computer vision and tesla self-driving a lot of progress has been made

06:21.680 --> 06:24.880
What I showed you what i'm showing you here is from a few years ago

06:25.680 --> 06:29.360
Um, but you still see similar kinds of things and also on the language side

06:29.360 --> 06:34.560
I'm just going to show one example of analogous kinds of things that really make you scratch your head

06:34.960 --> 06:40.960
On the you you could find these in language models, but i'm going to talk about multimodal language and vision models because this is where

06:41.280 --> 06:44.400
You know, there's a lot of really interesting stuff going on

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
Where machine learning and especially like grounded language

06:48.480 --> 06:51.360
Potentially might meet up with what goes on in cognition

06:51.920 --> 06:55.200
um, so this is a i'm just going to show you a couple of little demos from

06:56.800 --> 07:02.880
Google's large language model multimodal language model. Um, gemini both earlier versions and then the most recent version

07:03.520 --> 07:09.360
This is the figure i'm showing here, which i'm giving to gemini and I should say you can see similar things with chat gpt

07:09.360 --> 07:12.480
But it's a little bit funnier with the google ones. I'm going to focus on that

07:12.960 --> 07:17.680
Um, this is an image from my colleague vikash mansinga whose work will also figure in the talk

07:18.240 --> 07:21.120
Um, vikash is one of the world's experts in probabilistic programming

07:21.280 --> 07:25.360
He and I are very interested in how our minds and our machines could model uncertainty

07:25.920 --> 07:28.880
So here's an image that that I think all of us when we look at this

07:28.960 --> 07:32.480
It's it's it's pretty clear that though. It's a little hard to read kind of messy

07:32.640 --> 07:35.920
It's really clear that there's a word here and that the word is uncertainty

07:36.480 --> 07:40.240
Um, but what is uh an lm a multimodal lmc from this?

07:40.640 --> 07:45.040
Well, it might see this the image you sent me shows a black and white image of a text box

07:45.120 --> 07:51.520
The text book has a dark gray border rounded corners. Good inside is the word dream written in a bold sans serif font

07:52.240 --> 07:55.440
Is there anything else I can help you with? I ask how many letters are shown in the text box?

07:55.680 --> 07:59.680
There are five letters shown in the text box the letters are d r e a and m

08:01.120 --> 08:03.120
What is going on with this?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.840
Now we could say all right. Well, at least it's pretty good

08:05.920 --> 08:10.560
I mean at least it's recognizing that there's text and it's you know, it could be worse

08:11.200 --> 08:16.400
But it seems to be strangely self-confident strangely confident about an incorrect answer

08:16.640 --> 08:20.720
But you could say at least it's not like seeing a person or person walking down the street

08:21.760 --> 08:28.400
But consider this small change to the input image now our lm says this shows a black and white pixelated image of a person

08:28.640 --> 08:33.120
The person is facing forward and appears to be standing still. Here are some details about the person

08:33.440 --> 08:37.520
They have short hair. They're wearing a shirt with a collar. Their legs are slightly wider than their torso

08:38.080 --> 08:39.360
Since the image is pixelated

08:39.360 --> 08:43.200
It's difficult to discern other details such as facial features or specific articles of clothing

08:43.600 --> 08:47.120
Now again, the thing that I think should make us puzzle here is

08:47.920 --> 08:53.360
Is not just that the system gets this wrong, but that it seems to confidently assert things that are so

08:54.400 --> 08:58.000
detached from our sense of of the reality of what we're seeing

08:58.640 --> 09:01.440
And where just a small change can make such a huge difference

09:02.080 --> 09:08.720
Just to update things this was this was from the first version of google's gemini the most recent version of gemini 1.5 pro

09:09.120 --> 09:11.120
Has gotten better in some sense

09:11.520 --> 09:14.880
Now given uncertainty. It doesn't say dream. It says optical illusion

09:15.840 --> 09:20.960
But it's still wrong and it's still over confident. Um, it rates itself as fairly confident

09:21.680 --> 09:28.160
That it says optical illusion. It's interesting. It makes you think is there some semantic association between dreams optical illusions and

09:28.400 --> 09:32.480
This particular way of presenting the notion of uncertainty. I don't know. Um,

09:33.120 --> 09:38.080
The the very most recent thing this was well, it's not that recent but the last time I gave this talk

09:38.800 --> 09:45.200
Um, I tried this on the the newest updated version of gemini 1.5 pro just to see if perhaps it had been improved

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
And now it gave a very different answer

09:47.600 --> 09:50.160
It didn't say it didn't read it as optical illusion. It gave this

09:51.040 --> 09:56.400
Extended digit number six one two nine eight one five three two four two and I asked it to judge its confidence and it said

09:56.560 --> 09:58.560
Well 70 to 80 percent

09:58.640 --> 10:03.840
Again, what what happened? Just to check again consistency and coherence of this

10:04.320 --> 10:08.720
Weird interpretation. I asked it just 10 seconds later just in an out of context again

10:08.800 --> 10:13.360
Just gave it the same thing and the next 10 seconds later. It said geocache

10:14.000 --> 10:18.080
Um, again now 75 confident and then one more time

10:19.200 --> 10:23.280
Um, a distorted text appears to read northeast blackout

10:24.240 --> 10:25.600
However, it's difficult to be certain

10:25.600 --> 10:31.040
But it's moderately confident that the text reads northeast blackout because the first and last words are relatively clear

10:31.040 --> 10:34.880
While the middle word is slightly less discernible, but still suggestive of blackout

10:35.600 --> 10:38.080
Okay, so what's going on here?

10:39.120 --> 10:40.160
That's one of the mysteries now

10:40.160 --> 10:44.640
I'm not I'm not I'm going to gesture at what I think some of the mysteries or some of the answers might be

10:44.960 --> 10:50.400
But mostly to point the way towards the difference with human intelligence and what we're trying to understand in in artwork

10:51.200 --> 10:56.240
Okay, I think fundamentally what's going on is whether you're building a computer vision system or

10:56.720 --> 10:59.760
An llm or a multimodal language text system

10:59.760 --> 11:04.640
You're building a system that takes the inputs and outputs that our brains do

11:04.960 --> 11:11.360
perception of the eternal world sense data of some form and it produces actions or something like actions that can be

11:11.920 --> 11:17.280
Grounded back in the external world, but the inside of the system doesn't have any notion of a world

11:17.360 --> 11:18.800
It's a function approximator

11:18.800 --> 11:22.800
It's learning to approximate the input output functions that our minds produce

11:23.200 --> 11:29.360
And it's learning to do that from various data sources including objective data sources as well as human reinforcement

11:30.160 --> 11:34.080
Now how why does this possibly work? Well, again, there there may be some

11:34.560 --> 11:40.000
laws of physics things that are like physics like for example the famous scaling laws of neural language models

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
Where you can show in some form

11:42.880 --> 11:45.360
Especially when you're trying to predict like you know

11:45.760 --> 11:51.920
And this is very much following some of the information theoretic ideas that richard has been talking about and others in the group here

11:52.960 --> 11:55.920
If i'm just trying to predict the next token from the previous ones

11:56.720 --> 12:02.320
There are certain fundamental power laws of language and distributions in language that these systems seem to incorporate

12:02.800 --> 12:06.720
And build on such that if you increase by an order of magnitude the amount of compute

12:07.040 --> 12:11.520
You can in a predictable way lower the test loss in predicting the next token. That's on the left

12:12.320 --> 12:14.320
In gpt4's technical report

12:14.560 --> 12:19.120
They suggested that you could see similar kinds of scaling laws for problem solving not just text prediction

12:19.120 --> 12:20.800
Although it's a lot if you're there

12:20.800 --> 12:25.840
And I think fundamentally the problem is the power laws are beautiful laws and they're predictable in a certain sense

12:26.160 --> 12:28.960
The thing about a power law is while it approaches asymptote

12:29.360 --> 12:32.320
Or it rather approaches zero error in its asymptote

12:32.800 --> 12:37.600
It in some important sense never gets there compared to like an exponential decay

12:37.840 --> 12:42.400
Where there's a predictable timescale on which it will get to zero a power law keeps slowing down

12:42.800 --> 12:46.960
and if you have any uncertainty in the power laws coefficient or

12:48.080 --> 12:53.760
You know in its applicability to the not just to predicting the data stream, but actually solving a problem

12:54.480 --> 13:00.400
Then it's it's basically impossible to know how much data and compute you're going to need to actually get to the asymptote

13:00.400 --> 13:03.280
Which we want to call, you know full adult human intelligence

13:03.680 --> 13:05.680
In contrast

13:06.320 --> 13:12.400
Humans don't seem to be built this way. We our minds seem to be built as world modelers from the start

13:12.560 --> 13:14.720
And I'll say more about this, but from the very beginning

13:15.440 --> 13:18.720
We have our minds and our brains and this is something that

13:19.360 --> 13:25.360
Inherits shared with other animals and inherits from our evolutionary legacy seem to be built to model the world

13:25.840 --> 13:28.800
And to deal with all kinds of incompleteness and uncertainty

13:29.520 --> 13:33.120
And that means both in how in the the structure of the world

13:33.840 --> 13:38.560
And our uncertainty over what's out there the current state as well as the the fundamental deeper laws

13:38.720 --> 13:41.760
The causal laws of physics or how agents plan and so on

13:42.000 --> 13:45.280
But we're built to engage these kinds of mental representations

13:45.840 --> 13:48.080
As i'll as i'll show in a little bit the way in our group

13:48.080 --> 13:53.760
We've modeled this for a long time is what we call the game engine in the head by analogy to say video game engines

13:54.080 --> 13:58.640
That our brains and minds seem to be built with these kinds of resources for world modeling

13:59.360 --> 14:03.760
You can see that this the the notion of world models that are used

14:04.160 --> 14:10.400
Even not just in human adults, but in young children to coherently understand the world and deal with situations that are

14:11.040 --> 14:13.040
Importantly out of distribution

14:13.040 --> 14:15.040
Right and that's really key

14:15.040 --> 14:20.720
The ways in which we perceive and learn about the world are not nearly as time to the distributions of our experience as

14:21.120 --> 14:23.120
machine learning or function approximation

14:23.760 --> 14:27.520
So here's some examples of different kind of self-driving system. These are

14:28.400 --> 14:31.040
four-year-olds for the most part three four five-year-olds

14:31.920 --> 14:36.240
In a genre of youtube videos, you can see one of them actually the video on the left

14:37.200 --> 14:40.800
It's it's sort of the the video genre on youtube is like, you know

14:40.880 --> 14:48.000
My four-year-old driving for the first time and parents have put their kids behind the wheels of golf carts or tractors or cars or trucks

14:48.960 --> 14:53.040
And just go at it and they video from the side or from next to them

14:53.680 --> 14:54.480
and

14:54.480 --> 15:00.160
You know, you could question the rationality of the adults who are putting their kids in the situation and then putting the videos online

15:00.480 --> 15:03.680
But there's a certain basic rationality that the four-year-old has

15:04.080 --> 15:10.640
Even though they haven't been in the situation before the systems that their mind has built through evolution and the last couple of years

15:10.640 --> 15:12.640
The first few years of their experience

15:12.880 --> 15:15.760
Allow them to handle this totally new kind of perceptual information

15:15.760 --> 15:19.280
The world's going by them at a high speed and they're in control in some way

15:19.840 --> 15:25.360
But they can generalize from their from from their experience because the the nature of their generalization

15:25.600 --> 15:29.520
Is their mind's models of the world and those transfer to these new situations?

15:29.520 --> 15:32.480
Of course, their new things they have to learn about exactly how the steering wheel works

15:32.560 --> 15:37.280
But they can learn those very quickly too because the learning is grounded in their world model

15:38.240 --> 15:42.560
So fundamentally, I think what we have is the is a contrast between the scaling thesis

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
of deep learning and today's ai

15:45.360 --> 15:49.520
And what you could call the original scaling route that human intelligence follows what we might call

15:49.920 --> 15:53.040
Growing up as opposed to scaling up and I want to contrast

15:53.520 --> 15:56.800
Three points, which I think are really important for understanding

15:57.280 --> 16:03.200
In general our intelligence and the contrast between ai and machine learning and especially the role that language and language models play in

16:03.840 --> 16:09.200
So three points that are that are fundamental to the way today's ai is working based on deep learning one

16:09.840 --> 16:12.960
That intelligence is seen as the end result of learning

16:13.440 --> 16:17.760
We're learning starts with some simple very general and in some ways dumb mechanisms

16:18.240 --> 16:20.720
associative learning prediction, you know in some way

16:21.520 --> 16:27.600
But the idea is if you scale that up enough you have the surprising emergent phenomenon that now we start to call intelligence

16:28.160 --> 16:29.360
um

16:29.360 --> 16:34.080
The the problem is though, I mean either you call it a problem or you can call it just the way things work

16:34.160 --> 16:36.480
But there's some remarkable kind of generalization

16:36.480 --> 16:39.680
But it still is going to depend on similarity to training data

16:40.160 --> 16:46.640
And its ability to go beyond the training distribution is is weak and unpredictable compared to when you're in distribution

16:47.600 --> 16:51.920
Um, this is true whether you're talking about perception or other forms of higher level cognition

16:51.920 --> 16:58.080
But especially thinking things that we recognize as forms of reasoning planning problem solving and so on

16:58.720 --> 17:01.680
The the sort of thing that we've never seen in any computer vision system

17:01.680 --> 17:05.840
But we're starting to see some interesting kind of approximation to in language models

17:06.480 --> 17:10.320
Crucially that in machine learning thinking derives from language

17:10.640 --> 17:16.640
Because it's only the data of language not the data of pixels that conveys information really about human thoughts

17:16.720 --> 17:21.360
Which makes sense again humans have always used language as our main medium to express our thoughts to others

17:21.440 --> 17:24.640
Just like what we're doing right now in giving talks like this, right?

17:25.120 --> 17:25.680
um

17:25.680 --> 17:30.880
But crucially thinking requires language data and even carefully cleaned and curated language data

17:30.880 --> 17:34.400
Our colleagues who are at the big ai companies can tell us a lot more about this or rather

17:34.480 --> 17:38.000
Maybe they can't tell us about this but they can tell us that they can't tell us about

17:38.560 --> 17:44.320
And those of us who've worked with this know the importance of having the right kinds of language data as well as the right reinforcement data

17:45.120 --> 17:48.640
Okay, so contrast this with human minds and especially human children

17:49.680 --> 17:51.760
Our intelligence if for our intelligence

17:52.000 --> 17:55.920
It's not just the thing that is at the end result of all of our learning although we do

17:56.240 --> 18:00.560
You know babies are not in some important way not as intelligent as human adults we would like to say

18:01.120 --> 18:07.200
But human intelligence is is built in in some form from the start. It's the foundation of learning. It's not just the end state

18:07.600 --> 18:12.800
It's what's there and the the learning mechanisms that let you learn so much from so little

18:13.520 --> 18:17.040
Okay, and we saw some of that in virginia's talk and you know

18:17.040 --> 18:21.600
I think the the field of human cognitive development is a testament to this or what I was just showing from the four-year-olds

18:21.600 --> 18:24.400
Is another example but in other work that i'm not going to talk about here

18:24.400 --> 18:28.080
We've done a lot of work trying to model the core knowledge of even you know

18:28.080 --> 18:33.520
12-month-old or 10-month-old babies and there's important ways in which they have a common sense understanding of the world

18:34.000 --> 18:38.720
That is in in in significant ways. It's not all built in but in significant ways

18:38.720 --> 18:42.080
It seems to be present even even in two and three month olds. Okay

18:42.880 --> 18:43.600
um

18:43.600 --> 18:50.800
As a result of our built-in capacity for modeling the world our generalization is based on the fit of our mental models

18:50.800 --> 18:55.760
It's not about the training data. Okay data is important. We improve our models. We grow models

18:55.760 --> 19:02.080
We can make new models from data, but what accounts for generalization and what drives generalization is not similarities to the data

19:02.240 --> 19:08.240
But the fit of our world models and their ability to be flexible and themselves to be generalized

19:09.360 --> 19:15.360
And crucially thinking isn't the thing that comes at the end state as an emergent property of modeling language

19:15.360 --> 19:19.360
But rather thinking is there from the start and it's the basis for language

19:19.440 --> 19:25.440
It's the basis for why human children construct language so robustly and resiliently and again there

19:25.520 --> 19:27.200
I'm referring to

19:27.200 --> 19:33.360
By using that word resilience to some of the ideas that virginia talked about in her talk and susan golden meadow has talked about

19:33.680 --> 19:37.360
I urge everyone to watch her rumelhardt prize talk where she talks about this as well

19:37.920 --> 19:43.280
This idea that as we saw in susan's work and annie sangus's work with nicaraguan sign language

19:43.680 --> 19:46.240
That you know children who grow up who grow up without

19:47.120 --> 19:48.480
Any language input?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.680
It's not just about the poverty the stimulus in the traditional linguistic sense

19:51.680 --> 19:57.840
But you grow up with deaf without sign language input and you create in some form your own personal proto language

19:57.840 --> 20:01.040
Or at least a way of communicating that has hierarchical symbolic structure

20:01.280 --> 20:04.800
And then you bring a few such children together and within the span of a couple of generations

20:04.800 --> 20:10.000
They've created a whole new language from scratch. Okay, so it's very clear from data like that

20:10.800 --> 20:13.840
That humans are built to think and we're built with an

20:14.400 --> 20:18.320
A desire to understand and to under to be understood to express our thoughts

20:18.640 --> 20:22.320
In some form and share them with others in our as our social partners

20:22.960 --> 20:26.080
And that's you know, there's nothing I think more fundamental to

20:26.720 --> 20:29.600
To understand if you want to understand where our intelligence comes from

20:30.080 --> 20:36.960
So what we've been trying to do in our work is to try to capture the human growing up scaling root in computational terms

20:37.520 --> 20:40.480
And it starts with this idea of probabilistic inference and

20:41.040 --> 20:44.800
Expected value decision-making on top of world models, you know informally

20:44.960 --> 20:49.200
I would say and like many others that thinking not just in human brains

20:49.280 --> 20:54.560
But in brains and in many other animals is about making good guesses and bets not about the next

20:55.040 --> 20:59.760
Data thing you're going to see not about the next token or the next pixel or set of pixel values

20:59.920 --> 21:02.720
But about the world what's going to happen in the world and how

21:03.280 --> 21:08.400
It might depend on your actions or the actions of others or how you might be able to change the world to change those

21:08.960 --> 21:14.160
dependencies causal and counterfactual reasoning and then having some sense of what you'd like to see happen

21:14.560 --> 21:18.160
Or and what you'd not like to see happen or what could really cost you your life or

21:18.800 --> 21:24.080
Be hugely valuable and making good bets about how to act and what to think about next

21:24.960 --> 21:26.960
fundamentally this classic idea of

21:27.360 --> 21:29.360
effectively rationality that

21:30.000 --> 21:34.640
You know, you could say our minds and brains are the original sources of this idea through evolution

21:35.520 --> 21:38.640
Being constructed to do this kind of computation

21:39.280 --> 21:43.520
In our work and this is the stuff we've been doing with language models builds on this

21:43.840 --> 21:46.960
We've been using the idea of probabilistic programs, which is a

21:47.840 --> 21:52.080
family of mathematical languages and actual programming languages and platforms

21:52.560 --> 21:58.720
To embody this idea basically take this conceptual idea of rational world modeling inference of decision

21:59.120 --> 22:04.960
And turn it into practical engineering terms that can be models of human minds as well as more human like ai

22:05.520 --> 22:08.240
And I don't have time to give a whole introduction to probabilistic programs

22:08.800 --> 22:15.040
But you know, you can think of it as a kind of catch-all phrase or a complicated suitcase phrase just like neural network

22:16.080 --> 22:20.400
Packages a number of different things together, but probabilistic programs are formalisms

22:20.880 --> 22:26.400
For combining what I think are several of the best ideas about intelligence that have come up through through a number of

22:27.840 --> 22:32.480
You know decades in the field that includes neural networks modern probabilistic programming languages

22:32.800 --> 22:37.920
Like gen from vikash man singha's group who I mentioned before at mit or pyro

22:38.480 --> 22:42.240
That was developed by originally a group at uber ai that noah goodman

22:42.720 --> 22:45.920
Another collaborator of ours helped to start along with a number of others

22:47.120 --> 22:48.480
you know

22:48.480 --> 22:52.080
In many ways build on languages like pie torch

22:52.720 --> 22:59.680
Or tensor flow the languages that support modern deep learning and that allow you to construct really complex but end to end differentiable

23:00.640 --> 23:02.640
Functions for approximation or other purposes

23:03.280 --> 23:09.840
But that's not the most important part the most important part are building on the idea of symbolic languages for expressing abstract knowledge

23:10.080 --> 23:11.920
for modeling the world

23:11.920 --> 23:13.280
that is

23:13.280 --> 23:15.520
You know across many areas of science and engineering

23:16.000 --> 23:21.040
consistently the strongest most powerful toolkit we've had for building coherent models to

23:21.680 --> 23:24.720
To understand the world are various forms of symbols

23:25.440 --> 23:32.720
And then the third idea is the probabilistic one using those symbolic languages to express probabilistic models where you can be uncertain about

23:33.120 --> 23:35.840
Everything and in a in a turing computational sense

23:35.840 --> 23:40.480
You can be uncertain about the state of the world right now or more abstractly how the world works

23:41.200 --> 23:46.880
How the different kinds of data that you're getting perceptual or others are connected to the underlying state of the world

23:47.600 --> 23:52.400
And then to be able to do joint inference about all those different sources of uncertainty as the basis for perception

23:52.800 --> 23:54.800
reasoning planning learning and so on

23:55.040 --> 23:57.040
And probabilistic programs bring those things together

23:57.600 --> 24:03.600
I'll say a little bit about how that toolkit works as well as then how once you learn language

24:04.720 --> 24:11.200
The ability to externalize and internalize thoughts that are produced by these kinds of probabilistic programs basically

24:11.920 --> 24:17.360
That transforms things in fundamental ways and here, you know, less people think that i'm just a

24:18.080 --> 24:20.400
Deep learning or a llm skeptic or something

24:20.720 --> 24:27.040
I you know, again, I find neural language models and the the long tradition of distributional statistical learning

24:27.440 --> 24:31.600
In language that they build on to be really important and in the work that we've been doing we've been using

24:32.400 --> 24:35.120
large language models or in many by today's standards

24:35.120 --> 24:38.240
I might even say small language models to capture this actually

24:38.960 --> 24:44.880
So I think this is a place where the you know, I would not say that you want to think about human minds

24:45.040 --> 24:48.320
It's llms or or transformers all the way down nothing like that

24:48.640 --> 24:52.160
But the kinds of things that are going on in distributional sequence learning

24:52.560 --> 24:59.120
Could be a way to capture some aspects of how language grounds in these tools for mental modeling and and also

24:59.600 --> 25:01.600
enriches and extends it

25:02.000 --> 25:05.920
So, I mean just very briefly for people who aren't familiar with this idea

25:06.400 --> 25:09.840
There, you know, for a couple of decades now I and and many colleagues

25:10.240 --> 25:15.360
Students former students a number of others who are very interested in what you could call the Bayesian approach to cognition

25:16.080 --> 25:20.800
Have been using this general toolkit of probabilistic inference over structured symbolic models

25:21.200 --> 25:26.240
To capture many aspects of mental models and I just this is a plug for a book that's coming

25:26.800 --> 25:31.520
forthcoming edited by tom griffith's nick shader and myself and with many many other contributors

25:32.000 --> 25:34.400
And it'll be coming later this year from mit press

25:34.720 --> 25:39.600
But it's it's part textbook part research monograph and just showing how this toolkit can be used to

25:40.160 --> 25:45.440
Capture to both explain in a principled and you know, actually understandable way

25:45.760 --> 25:52.160
But also to quantitatively predict and model behavioral data across so many different ways in which our minds model the world

25:52.640 --> 25:55.840
Just to illustrate one which i'll come back to in the context of language in a minute

25:57.360 --> 26:00.080
An area that we've done a lot of work on is intuitive physics

26:01.040 --> 26:04.800
As as a kind of probabilistic inference and the particular kinds of intuitive physics

26:04.800 --> 26:10.000
We're thinking about are in these complex seed understanding cases, which again not coincidentally

26:10.080 --> 26:13.840
I think are also really interesting in classic settings for studying grounded language

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
So for example, if I show you a

26:17.120 --> 26:20.880
Scene of a bunch of blocks think like jenga blocks stacked up in various ways

26:21.200 --> 26:26.800
Some of these images might look very stable others might look unstable and I can ask you a question

26:26.880 --> 26:30.080
How likely do you think this stack of blocks is to fall under gravity?

26:30.800 --> 26:37.280
And we can model that by having a a structured world model which consists of basically 3d object models

26:37.680 --> 26:43.040
And then causal models of how though of how those underlying 3d scenes give rise to images

26:43.120 --> 26:48.960
That's like a graphics program basically the computer graphics is a way of writing programs that generate images

26:49.280 --> 26:51.280
From those underlying 3d world models

26:51.680 --> 26:55.440
But then there's also these physics programs and again here I mentioned game engines

26:55.680 --> 27:01.040
So game engine style physics simulators capture a lot of aspects of effectively real world

27:01.120 --> 27:04.960
But common sense physics in ways that hack hack Newtonian or actual

27:05.520 --> 27:07.920
True scientific physics in all sorts of ways to be efficient

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
But to a pretty good job of capturing

27:10.560 --> 27:15.120
What we expect to happen in the world which makes sense because we're the ones playing the video games and they're designed for us

27:15.520 --> 27:21.040
So by doing probabilistic inference to infer the input to a graphics program given the output

27:21.120 --> 27:26.960
Which is the image you can do a lot of 3d perception and then by doing probabilistic forward simulation

27:27.120 --> 27:30.720
You can imagine what might happen next. It could also be conditional on your action

27:31.200 --> 27:34.800
So the same toolkit could be applied to a much less familiar sort of judgment

27:35.360 --> 27:38.400
Like imagine I have these scenes of red and yellow blocks on a table

27:38.480 --> 27:41.760
And what if I bump the table hard enough to knock some of the blocks onto the floor?

27:42.080 --> 27:44.400
Will you knock off more red blocks or yellow blocks?

27:45.040 --> 27:48.160
So the first judgment the one about how likely the stack of blocks to fall

27:48.160 --> 27:52.000
I mean anyone who's played jenga or anybody who's ever been a kid probably has built things

27:52.240 --> 27:54.720
If you're a professional builder, you have a lot of other intuitions

27:55.040 --> 27:59.520
But you know, that's very familiar the question on the right is one that unless you've seen me talk about this

27:59.760 --> 28:05.040
You probably never thought about it's not something you have direct experience about you can't learn it from feedback

28:05.520 --> 28:06.960
How to answer that question?

28:07.280 --> 28:13.040
But I can use my language to give you that question as well as the other relevant world knowledge

28:13.040 --> 28:18.880
And then you can reason about it and the models that we build can capture both the familiar judgments of like

28:18.960 --> 28:21.680
How likely the stack is to fall as well as these novel judgments

28:22.480 --> 28:23.840
Relatively equally well

28:23.840 --> 28:28.400
So these scatter plots are examples of the kind of data and modeling that we've done in our lab for a long time

28:28.880 --> 28:36.080
On the y-axis we're plotting the average human judgments of let's say on one to seven scale how stable or unstable the blocks are

28:36.800 --> 28:38.800
and on the x-axis the average

28:39.760 --> 28:44.160
Result of doing a small number of probabilistic simulations where we imagine running forward

28:45.120 --> 28:51.520
Game-style physics a few time steps with uncertainty about exactly where the blocks might be and how the physics works because we don't

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
There's are all things that our minds don't fully know

28:54.240 --> 28:58.480
The same kind of model can be used to answer these red and yellow questions. So just to illustrate this

28:59.440 --> 29:00.960
If we take one of these

29:00.960 --> 29:05.840
Scenes and we reconstruct it in a game-style physics engine and we simulate a bump of the table

29:06.160 --> 29:10.480
So there's one simulation on the right. I'll show you another simulation with a harder bump

29:10.800 --> 29:14.640
Okay, and you can see watch it again that different things happen

29:15.440 --> 29:17.440
in these two simulations

29:17.600 --> 29:21.280
But it doesn't really matter which one of those you ran to answer the question, right?

29:21.280 --> 29:25.200
I mean you look at the scene also and it's very clear from the beginning that if I bump the table

29:25.680 --> 29:29.680
Relatively hard. It's going to probably be mostly yellow blocks on the floor. How do you do that?

29:29.760 --> 29:31.760
Well in our model you only need to run

29:32.160 --> 29:36.400
One or a small number of these simulations to answer the question at the grain of intuitive physics

29:36.560 --> 29:39.760
And you don't need to run it very long. You could stop it now and you already know the answer

29:40.160 --> 29:40.640
Okay

29:40.640 --> 29:45.040
So a small number of short incomplete simulations is the basis for these pretty

29:45.360 --> 29:51.040
Quantitative models and they've also been used in robotics to actually predict and and be able to get for example a robot to

29:51.600 --> 29:56.000
Learn to play the game genka, but learn from a very small amount of realistic human experience

29:56.640 --> 29:58.640
The same kind of idea has been very

29:58.960 --> 29:59.920
impactful

29:59.920 --> 30:03.040
I think even more impactful in intuitive psychology

30:03.760 --> 30:09.840
Where we and many others this there's work that I've done with a number of students and my colleague at mit rebecca sacks

30:09.920 --> 30:15.840
But especially I would highlight work from chris baker and julia har edinger who did quantitative modeling here

30:16.160 --> 30:18.160
Going back years with us

30:18.480 --> 30:21.840
julian continued chris is now working on self-driving cars and industry julian

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
is now working on

30:25.280 --> 30:32.480
It's now a professor at Yale where he's he's extended on this kind of approach in many areas of social and communicate with social cognition and communication

30:33.280 --> 30:34.800
in really interesting ways

30:34.800 --> 30:36.800
And many other colleagues here

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
I and I should mention also though I didn't

30:39.920 --> 30:43.040
I forgot to mention this before the intuitive physics work started in our group

30:43.360 --> 30:46.560
More than 10 years ago with pete patalia and jess hamrick and others

30:47.040 --> 30:53.360
And they are now actually both working at deep mind google deep mind working on various interesting kinds of deep learning approaches

30:53.600 --> 31:00.000
For both intuitive physics and all sorts of real-world physics that matter like climate modeling. That's where pete's current focuses

31:00.720 --> 31:03.760
I won't go into the details on the bayesian theory of mind

31:04.400 --> 31:08.160
But the basic idea is again, there's a program that now describes

31:08.560 --> 31:15.040
Not necessarily how actual minds and brains works, but our mental models of other minds how the actions we see agents take

31:15.600 --> 31:19.520
We interpret them as the effect of planning programs that take as input

31:20.240 --> 31:23.680
The our minds representations of their beliefs and desires

31:24.080 --> 31:29.040
And by seeing how agents act and change the state of the world and modeling also their perception process

31:29.040 --> 31:34.400
Which leads to belief formation and updating we can model many aspects of how people understand

31:35.520 --> 31:41.600
Other minds especially in what you might call these sort of physically grounded and perceptual scenarios the kinds that you can also

31:41.600 --> 31:47.040
Study in young babies like in the experiments. I'm showing here from gargay chibra. Kylie hamlin paul bloom and others

31:47.760 --> 31:51.040
Um the the intuitive psychology case is especially interesting

31:51.600 --> 31:58.720
Because in work that we've done like in this paper with uh, brendan lake tomer olemann sam gershman that helped to set some of the

31:58.720 --> 32:02.960
Current stage of debates between deep learning and more cognitive approaches to ai

32:03.920 --> 32:07.520
Where we put about a challenge back in 2016 and 2017

32:09.040 --> 32:14.880
For the the deep learning ai world about how to think about the kinds of inductive biases mental model

32:15.600 --> 32:19.600
Materials that seem to be built into human minds and the learning mechanisms that build on those

32:20.400 --> 32:27.200
We highlighted both intuitive physics and intuitive psychology in the famous sparks of agi paper showing again some of the most

32:28.400 --> 32:32.880
earliest glimpse into some of the surprising things that gpd4 seemed to be able to do

32:33.680 --> 32:40.080
bubeka and colleagues also highlighted intuitive physics and intuitive psychology and then in a recent paper from eric schultz's group

32:40.640 --> 32:47.520
Which is kind of forms a a three-part story here and it continues as as i know bushoff and and schultz and colleagues

32:47.760 --> 32:50.000
Continue to work on this area and we also do

32:50.560 --> 32:55.440
Is to now in the era of these multimodal language and vision models like i showed you at the beginning

32:55.760 --> 33:02.640
We can go and take on all these tasks like whether it's block tower intuitive physics things or agents moving around in the world and interpreting

33:03.280 --> 33:07.760
As julia harr edinger called it the naive utility calculus of their rewards and costs

33:08.400 --> 33:13.760
And give language models or multimodal models the same kinds of stimuli and questions that we give people

33:14.720 --> 33:16.720
And as schultz and colleagues showed

33:17.840 --> 33:21.520
In some of the intuitive physics settings, they're kind of okay. They're not great

33:22.800 --> 33:26.560
In the intuitive theory of mind ones they fail altogether. That's a quote from their paper

33:26.720 --> 33:33.600
So as an example, this is this is work that julia harr edinger did as part of his phd thesis with myself and laura schultz

33:34.480 --> 33:40.640
Um where we call these the astronaut studies where people would see an agent an astronaut on some planet

33:40.880 --> 33:48.000
Who would start at a certain point and have a home base that they had to get to and they would follow some path along

33:48.720 --> 33:50.720
This the surface of the planet

33:50.720 --> 33:54.080
They could just go straight to their home base or they could take a different a not straight path

33:54.640 --> 34:00.880
Um crucially there were various objects that they could pick up that could either be positively valuable or aversive to them

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
And we asked people based on the path

34:03.440 --> 34:07.200
How likely do you think that the agent likes or doesn't like one of these objects?

34:07.600 --> 34:11.040
And also there are different terrains and the terrains could be more or less costly

34:11.360 --> 34:16.560
And by showing people different maps different configurations of objects based terrain and different paths

34:16.880 --> 34:22.880
You could get very interesting rich inferences about what about what the agent both wants and

34:23.360 --> 34:27.600
What the rewards assigned to the different objects are as well as the costs for moving around on the terrain

34:27.840 --> 34:30.560
So here's an example of some of the stimuli from one experiment

34:30.800 --> 34:33.920
Just to show you the kind of variation and then in each of these cases

34:33.920 --> 34:38.480
We can ask people to make four judgments or three or four depending on how many kinds of terrain

34:38.720 --> 34:42.480
And that's what's shown here. These are these are the actually the predictions of the model

34:43.200 --> 34:48.960
Z scored for the relative cost for the different kinds of terrain and the relative value for the different kinds of objects

34:49.200 --> 34:51.520
And we're assuming that the agent basically takes in a

34:52.160 --> 34:55.520
of rational efficient plan trying to maximize reward

34:56.000 --> 35:01.280
Minus cost where there's a small cost for each step, but especially costly when you travel over certain kinds of terrain

35:01.840 --> 35:06.560
So seeing the path you can make inferences about how the agent has rewards and costs

35:06.880 --> 35:10.560
And then when you ask people to make the same judgments, they line up almost perfectly

35:10.960 --> 35:16.080
This is just one of many experiments that julian did showing what is really a remarkable quantitative

35:16.560 --> 35:20.160
Match and but but by a model that isn't just fit to data

35:20.400 --> 35:22.720
There's a little bit of fitting but it's mostly based on

35:23.120 --> 35:28.480
Thinking about what are the core concepts of theory of mind that people like I mentioned before like gargay and chibra

35:28.640 --> 35:33.120
Have studied even in very young infants pre-verbal infants infants who can't even walk

35:34.560 --> 35:37.840
And barely just able to reach for things themselves yet

35:37.840 --> 35:43.280
They still have these ideas these intuitions about efficient inference and and use those it seems

35:44.160 --> 35:46.160
I mentioned sherry lou's work who was a

35:46.480 --> 35:50.720
PhD student at harvard a few years ago with this velki who worked with tomer omen also in me

35:51.040 --> 35:56.640
To show those same kinds of things work in babies sherry's now doing amazing stuff extending that in a new lab at johns hopkins

35:57.280 --> 36:02.720
Um, so these these are cases where this kind of probabilistic program model works really well, but just a pure language model

36:03.280 --> 36:09.280
Uh is basically at chance zero correlation with human judgments, although quite good at telling you things like the background color of the scene

36:10.000 --> 36:14.800
Okay, so in the last part of the talk having sort of set the stage for how are our

36:15.680 --> 36:20.080
Human thinking seems to work and how we can model this in ways that are explanatory

36:20.720 --> 36:26.720
Understandable and quite quantitatively predictive using these probabilistic programs. Let's understand where language comes into picture

36:27.200 --> 36:31.840
I don't think that a pure machine learning transformer approach like the ones we've been talking about

36:32.400 --> 36:37.200
Are on track to give a human level or certainly a human like account of how it works

36:37.440 --> 36:43.680
But I do think the ideas of sequence modeling statistical distribution learning that you see having

36:44.240 --> 36:46.240
such great success in llms

36:46.560 --> 36:51.280
Even perhaps on a smaller scale could say something important about how language comes into the picture

36:51.920 --> 36:54.160
So this here is the at the beginning

36:54.160 --> 36:57.440
I talked about this archive paper the word models to world models paper

36:57.840 --> 37:04.080
From line along Gabe grand and colleagues and that's what i'm going to be talking about here is how we've been using bringing these tools together

37:04.560 --> 37:09.280
But a key ingredient is this I would say the modern return of the language of thought hypothesis

37:09.280 --> 37:14.320
You know made famous by jerry fodor, but obviously with a history that goes back hundreds if not thousands of years

37:14.640 --> 37:16.640
But in the number of recent papers

37:17.360 --> 37:21.680
And proposals from various groups the idea that again that there's some kind of

37:22.480 --> 37:27.840
Not necessarily single language, but but abstract symbolic languages, which could be general or also

37:28.320 --> 37:30.820
Created and constructed domain specific languages

37:31.200 --> 37:37.600
Some kind of abstract symbolic language is seems to be a powerful way to think about human thinking abstraction

37:37.840 --> 37:39.520
concept learning and so on

37:39.520 --> 37:42.480
And the particular kind of languages of thought that we've been thinking about are

37:43.040 --> 37:47.200
What noah goodman and toby gersenberg and I called the probabilistic language of thought

37:47.520 --> 37:51.440
So this is the idea of using probabilistic programming languages the technical tool

37:51.520 --> 37:52.960
I talked about before

37:52.960 --> 37:58.160
To to formalize in a cognitive setting a certain kind of hypothesis of a language of thought

37:58.400 --> 38:00.720
But one that is focused on modeling the world

38:01.120 --> 38:07.440
Not just possible worlds, but probable worlds and where the the symbolic language can also express ways of conditioning and query

38:07.760 --> 38:11.360
So that we can ask and answer the kinds of questions that our minds do and that

38:11.680 --> 38:15.200
We might we might want for example any kind of general ai system to do

38:15.520 --> 38:20.400
So if you want to learn more about the probabilistic language of thought check out our chapter in the conceptual mind

38:20.800 --> 38:23.280
This is one of the margiles and laurence

38:24.160 --> 38:30.080
Readers or the web book probabilistic models of cognition, which which has examples of the kinds of models

38:30.080 --> 38:31.520
I'm going to be talking about

38:31.520 --> 38:36.960
Not with language models though the new thing is to take advantage of llms and specifically the fact that

38:37.200 --> 38:40.240
Most llms these days are trained not only on natural language

38:40.480 --> 38:43.200
But on on programming languages and source code

38:43.600 --> 38:49.360
Namely programming languages like all the ones we're probably familiar with that are designed to be read and written by humans

38:49.440 --> 38:52.320
And not just machines and so they're written in a very english like way

38:52.880 --> 38:56.720
Or natural language like way, you know linguists have long pointed out

38:57.200 --> 39:02.640
Sometimes the differences between natural languages and programming languages, but from a certain perspective

39:02.880 --> 39:04.880
They're a lot more similar than they are different

39:05.120 --> 39:10.320
A hierarchical structure syntax and even just much of the lexicon, you know natural languages

39:10.400 --> 39:14.080
They're not just commented or programming languages are not just commented in natural language

39:14.080 --> 39:18.880
But functions variables data structures are named using english for the most part

39:18.960 --> 39:22.960
Okay, so that's a very powerful data source that allows

39:23.600 --> 39:31.680
Some kind of statistical sequence to sequence model for predicting and translating between streams sequential streams to effectively learn to translate

39:32.000 --> 39:37.760
From english or any other natural language into programming languages of thought and that includes probabilistic programming

39:38.160 --> 39:42.400
So the idea of this paper what we call rational meaning construction. That's the name of this

39:43.120 --> 39:49.280
Is is a particular thesis on how language is understood and perhaps also how it might be produced and learned

39:49.360 --> 39:51.680
Although our focus here is on language understanding

39:52.400 --> 39:56.400
And thinking about the relation between language of language and thought in that context

39:57.040 --> 40:03.280
By thinking what we think of as like the core original notion of thinking is what I've been talking about for the for the first part of the talk

40:03.520 --> 40:05.520
Which is the idea of having a

40:06.080 --> 40:10.240
Structured probabilistic model of the world conditioning it on observations and then

40:10.800 --> 40:14.960
And then drawing samples of underlying latent states and future states

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
Okay, that's thinking from this standpoint

40:17.680 --> 40:21.760
And then understanding language is effectively translating from natural language

40:22.080 --> 40:27.600
Into a probabilistic language of thought that's used to define and condition and query the probabilistic world model

40:28.000 --> 40:30.800
So we're going to exploit the the property of these

40:31.280 --> 40:36.720
LLMs to translate from natural language to code in a way that might be familiar if you've tried using them to code

40:36.720 --> 40:39.040
But it's different in some key ways in particular

40:39.120 --> 40:43.520
We're not going to be just asking our LLM to write a whole bunch of code at least not to start

40:43.680 --> 40:47.520
But we're going to be focusing on the sentence level and what is meaning at the sentence level

40:47.840 --> 40:52.480
It's something like trying to infer a line of code in a mental programming language

40:52.800 --> 40:54.800
that is your best understanding of

40:55.280 --> 41:01.040
The meaning by which we just mean the thought that the person who's uttering that sentence is trying to convey

41:01.840 --> 41:06.960
Okay, and the the LLMs in this case can represent that meaning construction function

41:07.280 --> 41:09.440
Okay in ways that have some very interesting properties

41:09.680 --> 41:15.760
So i'll just illustrate this with a classic example from the probabilistic language of thought literature the so-called Bayesian tug-of-war

41:16.160 --> 41:19.360
So just to ground this imagine that you're reasoning about a situation

41:20.160 --> 41:21.680
Like for example, uh

41:21.680 --> 41:26.960
Various games of tug-of-war various people symbolized by colored shirts here are facing off against each other

41:27.200 --> 41:29.760
And let's just take one person. Let's just say this is a

41:30.640 --> 41:34.880
Guy named jack and you might say well, how strong do you think jack is I haven't shown you any information?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.960
So your best guess might be just average. Okay

41:38.240 --> 41:40.960
Now, uh, suppose I give you some other information

41:42.320 --> 41:45.680
Like um, or I should say here. So here are a few samples, you know, I might say average

41:45.680 --> 41:47.520
Maybe it's a little less than average

41:47.520 --> 41:50.320
If we're talking about MIT students, you may just pick the MIT average

41:50.480 --> 41:54.960
But now I could give more information like suppose, you know that jack beat leo in a game of tug-of-war

41:55.200 --> 41:58.320
So that might move your arrow up from the MIT average because well, you know

41:59.040 --> 42:03.440
People who are who are stronger might be more likely to win than people who are weaker somehow. Okay

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I could give you some more information

42:06.000 --> 42:11.280
Like leo had just won 10 previous matches as well. So that means you might think leo's pretty strong and jack must be even stronger

42:11.280 --> 42:12.800
So your arrow goes way up

42:12.800 --> 42:16.080
But suppose I told you well leo sometimes it doesn't pull as hard as they really could

42:16.320 --> 42:21.760
So maybe maybe leo was just getting a little lazy when leo faced jack. So it might go down a little bit

42:22.400 --> 42:27.200
But then leo single-handedly beat a team with jack and tom on it. Okay. So now you think okay

42:27.200 --> 42:31.360
Well leo was probably lazy before jack. Maybe isn't that strong

42:32.240 --> 42:35.440
Since leo when they wanted to could beat both jack and tom. Okay

42:35.440 --> 42:42.000
So the point is in a classic example of non-monotonic reasoning your inference about this one aspect of the world jack strength

42:42.000 --> 42:48.400
It's going up and down as you get various information. So we'd like to understand how that thinking process works how

42:49.280 --> 42:56.320
Updating your beliefs based on linguistic evidence linguistically expressed evidence works. Okay, that's the starting point of this paper

42:56.880 --> 42:58.800
And the idea is to use in this case

42:58.800 --> 43:04.400
We're using the the probabilistic programming language church which is based on a dialect of lisp or scheme

43:04.640 --> 43:07.360
So there's a lot of parentheses and i'm not going to be able to unpack all the language

43:07.440 --> 43:12.480
But hopefully you can get the basic idea that we write we define functions that describe

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
probabilistic distributions on

43:15.520 --> 43:21.600
Strength laziness and so on all work through this and that's you know, that's been that's well-attested work

43:21.600 --> 43:27.920
That's been very good. You know, it's basically the the general toolkit for doing the kind of probabilistic intuitive

43:28.560 --> 43:34.000
Mental modeling that I showed you with two to physics and intuitive psychology, but here we're doing it for this kind of novel domain

43:34.000 --> 43:37.520
It's not there's no core domain that infants are born with for tug of war

43:37.680 --> 43:41.840
But we can write a model like this to capture what adults in our culture at least might think

43:42.240 --> 43:48.400
And then the key new thing here is to understand how to to ground language in these mental models

43:48.880 --> 43:55.440
So this is where we're going to model the translation of a statement in english like jack one against leo or a question

43:55.520 --> 44:02.560
Like how strong is jack into lines of code that support probabilistic updating and querying in this language

44:03.280 --> 44:07.360
And this these the meaning functions, which will be implemented by the neural network here

44:08.400 --> 44:09.760
other the

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
Large or even small language model

44:12.160 --> 44:15.360
Um capture various interesting ideas that have been proposed

44:15.600 --> 44:20.320
You know, I don't have time to review this history but proposed in different eras of linguistics and thinking about

44:21.120 --> 44:26.480
How to think about meaning how to think about concepts and you know, I it's it's a it's a very rich literature

44:26.480 --> 44:29.680
That I'd be happy to try to discuss if we have time during the question period

44:30.400 --> 44:37.200
Okay, um, but the hypothesis here is that maybe these distributional language code models can implement some

44:37.840 --> 44:41.440
human like perhaps approximation to this meaning function

44:42.400 --> 44:43.440
Um

44:43.440 --> 44:50.480
And again, crucially, it's it's we're not trying to now capture like to learn patterns in data in the in in the world

44:50.480 --> 44:54.080
We're trying to learn patterns in our thinking and how thought is expressed in language

44:54.240 --> 44:56.240
So it's a more modular problem

44:56.240 --> 45:00.560
It which I think is better suited to the way language actually works in the human brain, right?

45:00.560 --> 45:04.800
It's there's a delimited part of our brain. That is a language processing network

45:05.200 --> 45:11.360
Strokes or other lesions there can really impact your language ability without impacting your general thinking ability

45:12.640 --> 45:16.640
And you know, it's a relatively late evolutionary addition to us to a brain structure

45:16.720 --> 45:19.760
Which shares a lot with other non-human primates, for example

45:20.240 --> 45:23.760
And so it's it's that that modularity. I think is also really important here

45:24.480 --> 45:26.400
So again, just to unpack how this works

45:26.480 --> 45:29.600
You have a probabilistic program that describes these concepts

45:30.080 --> 45:33.120
That I can just I can describe to you in language in this way

45:33.280 --> 45:37.360
But to the model right now, they're just given in code and I'm not and they just describe for example that

45:37.760 --> 45:41.840
You know players strength is drawn from a gaussian distribution players can occasion be lazy

45:42.480 --> 45:45.520
When you when you're lazy it cuts your effective strength in half

45:45.760 --> 45:51.120
And the strength of the team is that some of the total strength that they pull that the members pull with at any one time

45:51.440 --> 45:54.960
And the stronger pulling team wins. That's basically what this is now for now

45:55.040 --> 45:57.920
We'll just assume that that's you have that kind of mental

45:58.640 --> 46:00.640
Model of a tug of war game

46:00.640 --> 46:02.960
And we'll just talk. How do you update your release language?

46:03.280 --> 46:08.240
And the basic way of doing it is that we're using what I would call now a medium language model

46:08.240 --> 46:16.480
We used open ai's codex, which was the first widely used code llm pretty small by today's standards much smaller than gpt4

46:17.120 --> 46:19.520
Kind of like an early version of gpt 3.5

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
To translate from a sentence in english like this into what in church the probabilistic programming language is called a condition statement

46:26.160 --> 46:30.320
It just expresses the constraint on possible worlds that while the underlying

46:30.720 --> 46:34.960
Define statements define stochastic or probabilistic functions, which give you distributions

46:35.360 --> 46:39.680
Probability distributions on possible worlds. This says we're going to restrict our probability distribution

46:39.840 --> 46:46.160
Which is like our prior to a posterior just those worlds that are consistent with jack beating in one match leo

46:46.560 --> 46:47.760
okay

46:47.840 --> 46:52.960
And then similarly a quest to a query statement like how strong is jack turns into this worry

46:53.680 --> 46:57.040
Which is which the probabilistic programming language then basically

46:57.600 --> 47:03.520
Evaluates it draws samples from possible worlds consistent with the condition and generated from that prior on the left

47:04.000 --> 47:07.840
And and checks what the strength is and then just kind of counts up those distributions

47:07.840 --> 47:12.720
So it's a kind of probabilistic mental simulation the same effectively the same or a generalization of what we were doing

47:12.720 --> 47:17.440
You like those intuitive physics examples and from this one piece of data jack beating leo

47:17.520 --> 47:21.760
You can see the posterior updates from the prior so jack is stronger than average

47:22.080 --> 47:27.200
If I say oh jack also beat alex or proceeded to claim victory from alex that turns into another condition

47:27.520 --> 47:31.200
And that updates the posterior even more so now while jack's a lot stronger than average

47:32.080 --> 47:37.600
Even working as a team leo and alex still could not be jack. Wow now jack's even stronger when you add in that conditioning statement

47:37.920 --> 47:40.640
So each again the where the llm is coming in here

47:41.520 --> 47:49.120
Is it's just it's just adding in the the statements into the language of thought and then we're running inference in our probabilistic programming language to give these answers

47:50.000 --> 47:53.840
It's worth and this is again, especially if we want to understand what I think is

47:55.280 --> 48:00.160
The way forward to thinking about how meaning and language works in humans and where l lm's can come into the mix

48:00.480 --> 48:02.480
What's what's really powerful about?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.800
Neuro language models here

48:04.800 --> 48:11.600
As ways to parameterize a meaning function is the ways that they can pick up on statistics context pragmatics

48:12.080 --> 48:13.120
metaphor

48:13.120 --> 48:19.200
Um semantic associations all the things that in many ways were most appealing in connectionism like distributed content addressable

48:19.760 --> 48:24.720
Uh associate of memory and distributed representations of graded semantic associations

48:25.040 --> 48:28.800
So for example, the llm will translate jack won against leo

48:29.200 --> 48:34.400
Which into this statement which looks like a fairly transparent semantic parse of that natural language

48:34.800 --> 48:39.840
But it'll make basically the same semantic parse of a sentence which on its surface

48:40.560 --> 48:46.480
And and in traditional syntax, you know language structuralities looks rather different, right? The syntax here is more complicated

48:46.480 --> 48:48.880
I'm not actually using the word win, but

48:49.600 --> 48:56.240
In the context the relevant aspect of meaning for thought here is the same namely. This is just another way. It may be more poetic way

48:57.200 --> 49:01.760
Or dramatic way to say that jack won against alex and the model knows that automatically

49:01.760 --> 49:06.160
It doesn't have to be specially prompted or trained for that using its associative memory properties

49:06.480 --> 49:10.240
It's also distributional. These are probabilistic models not on worlds

49:10.400 --> 49:15.120
But on strings and in this case they're probabilistic models on strings in our mental programming language

49:15.280 --> 49:16.800
so they can

49:16.800 --> 49:21.120
Bring into you know bring in classic notions of vagueness if I say jack is strong or very strong

49:21.280 --> 49:25.680
I'm not telling you exactly how strong jack is but you might interpret that as a distribution

49:26.000 --> 49:29.760
On different condition statements saying well jack strength is is greater than some threshold

49:29.760 --> 49:33.200
But I don't know what that threshold is but it's probably pretty big remember this in this case

49:33.280 --> 49:36.960
The mean is 50 and the standard deviation 20 so 80 is you know

49:37.760 --> 49:42.400
One and a half standard deviations above the mean and the idea is this is again like in scalar

49:44.000 --> 49:47.600
Adjectives it's basically saying I'm conditioning on the idea that jack is greater than some threshold

49:47.600 --> 49:53.920
But I but I could be uncertain about what that threshold is and even metaphorical things like if I say jack is pretty strong

49:54.000 --> 49:56.400
And ben is a beast right in this context

49:56.720 --> 50:01.360
It's reasonable to interpret ben is a beast as as saying saying ben is really really strong

50:01.520 --> 50:07.280
You know 80 where jack was maybe 60 or greater in a different context if i'm talking about you know

50:08.000 --> 50:13.440
Whether you should date someone and I say ben is a beast, you know, then i'm probably saying stay away

50:14.160 --> 50:15.280
right

50:15.280 --> 50:23.600
So that that both metaphor sort of context sensitive metaphorical interpretation is the kind of thing that this meaning function is very good at

50:24.560 --> 50:28.800
um, I'll mostly just skip over this but in work with ben lytkin and and

50:29.840 --> 50:36.000
Leo and gape and others we've we've done and this is really all ben's work some very nice quantitative studies

50:36.880 --> 50:40.960
Of showing that these contextual aspects of understanding of strength

50:42.000 --> 50:48.720
In in the kind of tug-of-war context can match very nicely not always but in a lot of cases very nicely with human judgment

50:48.800 --> 50:52.160
so it's suggesting that the distributional aspects of

50:53.120 --> 50:55.520
um meaning that we're capturing here are at least somewhat

50:56.000 --> 50:59.280
Not psychologically real at least consistent with the judgments that people make

50:59.680 --> 51:05.600
Okay, so so but mostly what i've done with this example is just to try to show you how this kind of framework can work

51:06.000 --> 51:10.560
To be a way of implementing what is in some sense a classical idea that language isn't

51:11.360 --> 51:14.240
That directly the medium of thought at least the only one

51:14.640 --> 51:18.560
But it's a way of expressing and communicating thoughts internalizing and externalizing them

51:18.720 --> 51:24.160
Okay, and that statistical distributional mechanisms can be a powerful way of learning that

51:24.560 --> 51:27.600
The mappings from the signs and symbols that we externalize

51:28.240 --> 51:31.600
To the to an internal compositional structured language of our thought

51:32.160 --> 51:35.440
Now a lot of what goes on in this paper and i'll just show you one or two examples

51:36.320 --> 51:43.040
Such as work with sed zhong in an intuitive physics domain or some intuitive psychology work with lan xing and shen or

51:44.000 --> 51:45.520
Tan shi shen

51:45.520 --> 51:49.120
Is showing how we can take the same kinds of things that i showed you in the first part of the talk

51:49.520 --> 51:55.520
And effectively reconstruct them, but now in a world's worlds that are just described by language

51:56.080 --> 52:01.440
So to manage it take that task of the red and yellow thing where before i was showing you the image of a scene

52:01.840 --> 52:04.160
And then i was using language to describe a question

52:04.480 --> 52:07.680
But what if i just use language to describe the whole world, right?

52:07.760 --> 52:09.760
So if i didn't show you an image i just described

52:10.240 --> 52:17.520
What's there, you know in many ways, but but but we're still going to do a a mental simulation a probabilistic mental simulation in a physics engine

52:17.680 --> 52:23.040
There's many cases, you know in our daily life where we use language to describe the physical world as we experience it

52:23.280 --> 52:28.640
It can be extremely expressive very complimentary often to you know images or photos

52:29.120 --> 52:31.840
Um, it has vagueness and uncertainty and that's interesting

52:32.080 --> 52:35.680
So we might describe a scene that like imagine a table and there's some blocks on it

52:35.920 --> 52:37.280
There's some red blocks in the center

52:37.280 --> 52:41.200
There are many tall stacks of yellow blocks on the side of the table if the table is bumped hard enough

52:41.280 --> 52:44.240
So we ask the same question but for scenes that are described in language

52:44.240 --> 52:50.080
And then people make a graded judgment the same one to seven graded judgment of is it more likely to be red or yellow blocks?

52:50.800 --> 52:54.480
And so when we can test this again the same kind of quantitative study with

52:55.040 --> 52:58.080
large number of participants all online all just reading stuff

52:58.880 --> 53:02.720
With different kinds of language expressing exact as well as approximate number

53:03.440 --> 53:08.400
Approximate quantifiers logical quantifiers vagueness like the stacks could be tall or very tall

53:08.800 --> 53:13.200
And and different kinds of spatial relations and across many different stimuli

53:13.520 --> 53:18.000
We we mix up more or less complex sentences using these different kinds of language

53:18.640 --> 53:22.240
And in each case we're using again a relatively small

53:22.640 --> 53:25.840
LLM to translate sentence by sentence into

53:26.400 --> 53:29.600
statements for conditioning and querying in our probabilistic language of thought

53:30.000 --> 53:33.840
Then we run a small number of mental simulations in this case in a 2d physics engine

53:34.320 --> 53:39.360
Compute the outputs and compare those with people and what i'm showing you here is again the same kind of scatterplot

53:39.360 --> 53:46.000
I showed before but on the vertical axis are again our human judgments and on the x-axis now are the model

53:46.160 --> 53:48.960
Or the predictions of this language informed thinking model

53:49.440 --> 53:55.360
So it looks a lot like what I showed you before these are the judgments from the battalion all work on the red and yellow task

53:55.760 --> 53:59.600
We're not we're here the model was given a visual scene people were given visual scenes

53:59.920 --> 54:04.000
And the model did that same kind of probabilistic mental simulation in the physics engine

54:04.480 --> 54:06.480
But in the in the current work on the left

54:07.040 --> 54:13.920
Again, the scene description is constructed from language using the tools that i've shown you by conditioning a prior on scenes

54:14.000 --> 54:19.840
Okay, and the main point is just that the models fit human judgments pretty well in both cases and about equally well

54:20.080 --> 54:22.080
All right, which is which is interesting

54:22.400 --> 54:26.960
We can also compare with just a sort of zero shot or a few shot baseline llm

54:26.960 --> 54:32.800
So these are language models, which don't have an explicit mental model of physics or any doing explicit simulation

54:32.800 --> 54:35.840
And they are are much worse fits to people

54:36.080 --> 54:39.520
Okay, this is this on the what the high up here on the y-axis is

54:39.840 --> 54:44.080
Distance and distribution from human distribution of responses to the various models

54:44.080 --> 54:49.600
The blue one is the rational meeting construction model and you can do a similar thing in the intuitive psychology domain

54:50.400 --> 54:54.960
Like for example in the settings that I showed you with julien harenger's work

54:55.520 --> 55:00.560
This is work that uh lans ying and shen did i won't go into the details, but again

55:00.560 --> 55:03.280
We can describe worlds with various

55:04.000 --> 55:08.160
Goal objects that an agent might have and constraints like you have to go through doors the doors could be locked

55:08.160 --> 55:10.960
You have to use keys that could be a red key that could unlock the red door

55:11.360 --> 55:13.760
And so on people could be told either that you know

55:13.920 --> 55:16.880
You need a key of the right color to open each door of the same color

55:17.280 --> 55:19.280
Or you could be told weird things like

55:19.360 --> 55:21.360
Keys only unlock doors of other colors

55:21.360 --> 55:25.440
Okay, um, you know in these kinds of uh worlds again

55:25.440 --> 55:29.120
The rational meeting construction model does a very good job of capturing people's judgments

55:29.520 --> 55:35.120
For some kinds of judgments easy cases even gpt 3.5 does reasonably well gpt 4 does better

55:35.440 --> 55:40.560
But as the situation gets more complex or unusual things change and break down like especially if

55:40.880 --> 55:44.240
We say well in this world keys only unlock doors of different colors

55:44.320 --> 55:47.280
That's an easy thing to say to somebody and you have to change your mental model

55:47.680 --> 55:55.120
But when you do something like that gpt 3.5 becomes anti correlated with people and gpt 4 just go drops from being highly correlated to just being a chance

55:55.840 --> 56:00.960
So these are examples of the ways in which you know going out of distribution from our training experience

56:00.960 --> 56:06.640
If we're just using a machine learning function approximation approach, which is remarkable as those systems like gpt 4r

56:06.720 --> 56:08.160
That's what they're doing

56:08.160 --> 56:13.600
But ways in which if the function approximation is just approximating a much more modular translation function

56:14.240 --> 56:17.120
And building on our mental model tools. We can just do much better

56:18.080 --> 56:21.760
The last thing i'll just talk about very briefly is you know what is

56:22.400 --> 56:24.800
Any work like this has to raise more interesting questions

56:24.880 --> 56:28.800
If if anything like this is right on the right track, then it's it's not answering

56:29.440 --> 56:33.600
At this point the most interesting questions, but just raising them and perhaps highlighting ways you might get at them

56:34.160 --> 56:39.840
So in all the work i've been doing in in for a couple of decades now in probabilistic inference in mental models

56:40.160 --> 56:44.640
You start by showing how you can do inference with a mental model, but then you have to ask where do you get it from

56:45.120 --> 56:49.680
Now learning from experience is one thing and i've done a lot of work and others in our group and many other

56:49.760 --> 56:57.840
Colleagues a lot of that book i mentioned with tom griffiths and nick shader is about how we can learn using hierarchical bays and probabilistic programs learn abstract

56:58.400 --> 57:02.720
Programs by doing inference over the space of programs to make sense of our data

57:02.800 --> 57:04.640
Maybe even small amounts of data

57:04.640 --> 57:09.600
But much of our learning probably the most powerful form of human learning comes through language more abstract

57:09.920 --> 57:14.080
Generic language as many folks in cognitive science cognitive development

57:14.640 --> 57:15.760
Have shown

57:15.760 --> 57:21.360
So the power of language not only to update your beliefs, but actually to give you new world models is really

57:21.920 --> 57:27.520
Incredible and that's probably the most that that's the real human singularity there right is the ability of language to let us

57:28.160 --> 57:33.360
Learn and think about situations that we haven't directly experienced. I mean think about the tug of war for example

57:33.440 --> 57:35.280
I mean, I don't know if you're like me

57:35.360 --> 57:37.680
I've maybe done one or two tug of war games at my

57:38.320 --> 57:42.720
Most of my knowledge about tug of war or my beliefs at least don't come from my direct experience

57:43.040 --> 57:46.320
They come from things maybe people told me about analogous situations

57:46.720 --> 57:52.240
And and more generally many of our mental models and our intuitive theories come from what people tell us

57:52.400 --> 57:52.880
All right

57:52.880 --> 57:59.600
So the same approach that we talked about for updating beliefs from language can also be used to acquire new mental models

58:00.240 --> 58:03.920
But here what's going on is we're we're modeling how somebody might explain to you

58:04.320 --> 58:11.120
The way this tug of war works and in fact in our experiments with humans and in the in the toby gerstenberg and noah goodman and

58:12.160 --> 58:13.680
colleagues did

58:13.680 --> 58:15.680
This is exactly what we do would tell people

58:16.240 --> 58:20.000
Um about how this work people have various strengths it can vary from person to person

58:20.480 --> 58:22.800
And then now we're using the llm to translate

58:23.440 --> 58:28.560
Those say sentences in english that are generic sentences about the domain describing the world model

58:28.640 --> 58:30.640
We want our participants to use

58:31.040 --> 58:35.120
Into the same kind of probabilistic program code, but now these are defined statements

58:35.200 --> 58:40.960
So these are not these don't condition on a specific a specific world, but they define the general distribution on worlds

58:41.200 --> 58:43.200
But again, they're contextual they're distributional

58:43.440 --> 58:46.400
There could be different ways of understanding the vagueness in language

58:46.720 --> 58:51.680
But the basic idea is that we can describe a world model in english and then the code llm

58:52.480 --> 58:56.400
Can construct that world model. So all the defined statements now are constructed

58:56.480 --> 58:58.640
They're not exactly the ones that we use in the original paper

58:58.640 --> 59:02.160
But they have the same functional role and they can support the same kinds of inferences

59:02.560 --> 59:08.800
So it's just just showing you the way we can I think go towards one of the most interesting ways that language informs our thinking

59:09.120 --> 59:12.560
Not just as a way to convey specific beliefs about situations

59:12.560 --> 59:18.320
But new but new world models and in some recent most recent work that's still in progress with tyler brook wilson

59:19.040 --> 59:25.600
Katie collins and a number of the others I mentioned here tyler is a is a brilliant philosopher who recently graduated from MIT

59:26.240 --> 59:32.720
And he's actually just just accepted a faculty job at Yale. So he'll be at Yale in a in a year or so

59:34.080 --> 59:36.080
But together with with tyler and others

59:36.560 --> 59:39.200
And tyler's thesis goes into some early stages of this

59:39.680 --> 59:44.000
We've talked about we've been exploring the ways that the same approach can support

59:44.640 --> 59:48.480
Constructing new models, even if I don't explicitly tell you in language how the world works

59:48.480 --> 59:54.880
But just by again using your associative memory and marshaling implicit knowledge to construct a model of a new situation

59:55.280 --> 59:58.960
So I could tell you about a relay race and I'm not tell the relay race is like a new domain

59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.920
I'm not really telling you how races work. I'm just giving you some information

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.880
But we're exploring ways in which the LLM can

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.640
Can be queried to construct possible background knowledge

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.040
And write probabilistic program code that can be suitable for reasoning about this domain

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.800
Just on its own the LLM isn't enough

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.240
But you have to do some reasoning about the models that it suggests

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.880
And then those models when suitably

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.280
Reason to put upon can support novel reasoning in this domain and even sensible updating

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.600
So we're really getting you know, at least demos of steps towards

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.040
Computational models that can capture the richness of how we are able to think about new situations

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.960
Even ones that we haven't really thought about very much before or that we haven't been explicitly told how to think about

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.440
but using the combination of

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.640
Language the associative knowledge that's in it and an underlying ability for constructing probabilistic models of the world and updating

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.480
I'm the last thing I just want to leave you with is a set of thoughts about

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440
You know, ridiculously

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.400
It is it is the last thing

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.160
But I think this will set up some of the discussion with with virginia and others too

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.560
Which is many people in cognitive science, whether in linguistics or other areas

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:19.520
Engaged in meaning have been interested in what you could call, you know a unified account of meaning and what we're trying to at least

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.280
Point towards steps towards this with the framework. I talked about

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.480
just to just to again

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.360
Raise controversial points for discussion if you like

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.840
um, but the idea that we can capture the meaning of a word in context as well as more generally as

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.000
Effectively, it's like you might think of it as a form of dynamic semantics if you're familiar with this

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.720
But the meaning being in in context in a discourse the incremental contribution to the probability distribution over

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.360
PLOT expressions in the problem that we're thinking about with a problem in discussion

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.600
And the meaning of a word or phrase or sentence or other unit of language in general

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:02.400
Is a is a higher order stochastic function that can take as input a discourse context and return as output a meaning in context

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.600
And the idea is that if we think about the different approaches

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.880
These are just four

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:13.280
You know traditional ways of thinking about meaning and language which all have great value and have often been seen as being competitors

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.000
Ways in which we can really bring them together ways in which the PLOT ideas that we've talked about

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:25.040
Can integrate the compositional logical aspects of meaning that formal semantics and other areas in the language of thought tradition have emphasized

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.600
As well as in the context of probabilistic language of thought and mental models of the world can give a powerful form of grounding

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.680
That's not grounded in sense data

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:40.320
But in our models of the world that's what the PLOT does and the LLM or more generally a statistical distributional

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.640
Sequence models can capture both the distributional statistical aspects of meaning. It's the base that the

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.440
Both the sort of distributional usage approach, but also more general semantic association needed to make sense of language

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.080
So flexibly as well as some of the very flexible pragmatic communicative ways we use language

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.400
So I'll just leave it at that. Okay. Okay. Could you turn off your share, please? Yes

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.920
First of all, thank you very much

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.880
There's not a chance in the world that I'm going to forget Virginia this time and I'll tell you why

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:24.800
Because I'm gobsmacked at how many different areas you're an expert in and so anyway, here's another one

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.320
uh

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.320
Virginia valium from

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.960
CUNY hunter

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.960
It's all yours. Thanks

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.640
Josh that was such a great talk and so rich

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:44.160
In 10 minutes, which is how much time you and I have will only scratch the surface

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.360
So departing from the comments I sent you

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.640
with respect to the

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.320
Unified theory of meaning

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
Many years ago

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.200
Jerry Katz suggested that

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.640
The question what is meaning could be

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:15.600
Separated into questions like what is sameness of meaning? What is contradiction? What is anomaly?

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.040
What is entailment and so on?

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.200
And it occurs to me that it would be interesting to try this

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.160
To try your model to see just how well

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.680
It can detect

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.440
Synonomy contradiction anomaly and so on

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.640
Yeah, I think that's um, that's a great connection. I mean I I know a little bit about that

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.400
But I you're inspiring me to go back and reread and learn much more about it

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.960
I mean, I think just in the context of the last thing I said

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.960
The idea exactly that in a sense in this framework at least

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.520
What the statistical language model is doing is capturing the notion of sameness effectively because there the distribution on

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.600
Code in the probabilistic language of thought if that distribution is similar

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.400
And that can be measured in different ways then you might say well things

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:17.600
Have the same meaning either in context or in general because and that that distribution function can be contextualized or it can be

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.400
Made higher order. Okay, so that's really interesting, but it doesn't compute entailment or other

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:28.320
You know a conceptual or inferential relations those come from reasoning in the probabilistic language of thought

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.840
um

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.400
And yeah, I mean I think that's that would be great to explore that more see if that can account for

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.800
Unify it both account for the different set of phenomena and unify in that sense

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.960
Yeah, I think that would be really interesting to explore

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.760
um, so going back to

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Some of the more mundane

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960
Which I guess is upon

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.200
Aspects um the way that I'm understanding what you've

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.040
Said about how the theories

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.120
Intersect that is how llm's intersect with basian models

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.480
Is basically you're using the llm as a kind of tool

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.640
To translate from one vocabulary to another vocabulary. Is that accurate?

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.080
Yeah, I mean and that is at the most practical level. That's what we're doing. Um,

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.480
yeah

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.320
Okay, more about that, but let's let's go with that for now. Yes. Okay. Um

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.200
so

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:43.040
The critical difference that I see in what you're doing and what llm's are doing is the

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:49.200
Well, I guess there are two critical differences, but for me the most important one is the use of symbols

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.200
um, the other part is the basian

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.320
Mechanism, but let's separate them. So

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.520
When you put symbols in

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.600
To me you're putting a lot of content into the mechanism. Do you agree with that?

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.160
um, I agree that adding symbols adds a lot of content, but I think

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.760
And I again, I didn't have time to unpack all of this very well

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:24.080
I think but when you say you putting in symbols the in different different things that I'm talking about here

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.600
The you and the putting in are different, but yeah, but whenever you add in symbols that adds a lot of

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:36.960
Content and structure here. Yeah. Yeah content. Right. So I'm thinking about the implications of that for nativism

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.200
So it seems to me. This is a nativist theory

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.200
Um, I would say it is compatible with some forms of nativism that I find plausible

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.600
although none I don't have a horse in that game, but I

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.000
Through a lot of interactions with friends and colleagues like lisbelki susan carry many others

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.680
Come to find

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.160
Certain kinds certain aspects of nativism and conceptual nativism plausible especially in

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.880
Certain core domains that are shared with other animals

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.560
Like intuitive physics about objects that the world is three dimensional objects have some that there's some kind of

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.640
physical interactions

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.360
That are you know our bodies engage with and also some forms of intuitive psychology not necessarily higher order belief reasoning

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.960
But the idea of efficient action and that agents have goals and they pursue actions in the physical world

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.200
Grounded in physics to achieve their goals efficiently. Honestly, there's evidence

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.200
Again, sherry lou who did this work in spelki's lab and continue to build on it has really, you know

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.400
I mean, I was a striking evidence in three month olds

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:46.080
But it's every experiment with three month olds is very small and you know a lot needs to be built on

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400
But as striking as it gets in three month olds

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.400
science

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:56.160
I'm showing that that aspects certain aspects of not only physics, but efficient goal directed action

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.880
Understanding seem to be present that doesn't mean they're innate

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.360
But at least they're not they're present way before language and probably build on some innate stuff

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760
It's compatible with that notion

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.600
I'm not sure who that is but could you mute that was an accident. I think they just

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.360
Should have turned off their okay, but so so yeah, there's this idea that certain kinds of symbols

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.760
Are used in our framework to describe those some of those core systems

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.040
But we are in contrast to like a fedoria nativism which says all concepts are innate

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.640
In this in this framework here. I mean it or you could say in contrast, although some of uh,

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.680
I don't know what jerry would have actually said about this but people like paul patrowski have suggested

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.640
You know, maybe he would love it. I don't know but in in a rather different version of like some forms of radical

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.840
Conceptual nativism most of the concepts in this framework are not innate

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.160
They're written in a language of thought

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.400
That it that could be somehow innate or somehow bootstrapped through natural language

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.360
I find some of the ideas that that uh,

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:13.760
Susan carrey and lis spelti in their different ways along with jesse snettaker have developed their ways in which language acquisition

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.280
and

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:22.000
Mental languages of thought might bootstrap each other and many things in the kind of glitman tradition also I think are reflect that idea

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.520
But I so I I think we we are

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.040
We still need to show this this is like the most interesting thing to do

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.320
But to show ways in which the things I was showing at the very end could be could be used

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.520
To explain how and model how natural language can start off

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.320
Being grounded semantically and logically in a limited symbolic vocabulary of probable worlds that reflect core knowledge

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.120
But then that can support bootstrapping and introducing new concepts via those mechanisms

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.560
I was talking about at the end

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:01.040
Including new concepts, but also new domain theories that we get explicitly or implicitly through our linguistic interaction with

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.360
Other people who we think know more than us

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.600
Okay, um, that sounds great. Um

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.120
It also suggests to me that it is a highly modular

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.800
System even though it's also probabilistic

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.160
um, so it's probabilistic within each of these different modules

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:29.280
And depending on what you think the symbols are that you start with you can

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.080
Iterate what you think the modules of the mind are

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.960
Yeah, no, I think that's right

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.920
And I think you know, I think it's this framework is not a

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.200
On its own a proposal for how our minds start

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.040
But it can be used to instantiate and build and test some of them

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.760
And so that's I think that's right. It's it does suggest that you could have, you know, different

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.560
Sub-languages of thought for different domains

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.000
But crucially the picture that you get with adults from this is both in some ways like strikingly

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.360
Supermodular and in some other ways completely holistic

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:10.160
So the striking super modularity is that the actual reasoning that you do in is in a discourse when I'm thinking about a situation

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.840
And we're talking in a conversation is very modular if it might even be just

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.880
Specific to this context this what Tyler Brook Wilson calls bespoke model construction

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.920
This idea that we might construct a model on the fly to think about a particular situation

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.600
That that we're that's the last thing that we've been working on there

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.960
Is in some sense super modular because that model is is relatively small and all the inference. I'm doing is just here

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.240
so I so I

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:41.120
Side step or avoid the classic problems of what has made Bayesian inference intractable the idea that if I'm going to actually have

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.400
A distribution over all possible worlds. I could think about it update that

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.920
You know, that's completely intractable many people in the nativist tradition dan osherson and others have written about that

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.480
And this this is a a way around that or as Tyler puts it in his thesis

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.800
It's in a sense a kind of way to think about a solution certain kind of solution to the frame problem

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:06.080
So it's super modular, but it's also very holistic in the sense that the world knowledge that's used to construct that

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.080
Comes from like all the code you've ever written and all the semantic associations

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:15.520
And it's like a gigantic holistic almost quinian web of language and code

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.160
What we've sometimes called the github in the mind view

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.920
There's the game engine in the head the github in the mind like github is this

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.640
You know thing on the web which was crucial for training

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.680
Language code models and you can imagine your own mind has lots of chunks of code

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.720
Some of which are maybe innate many of which are not and natural language interweave with it

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:42.080
And and having a content addressable associative memory that can use that and and marshal out from that

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.240
relevant

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.280
symbolic probabilistic models that can be used to reason about a particular situation in some sense that's extremely holistic

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:56.560
And maybe is necessary to grapple with what is in you know very clearly some of the wholism of human cognition

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360
So going back a few steps

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.280
The intuitive physics part

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.960
In principle

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:15.360
Animals could do that as well, right? Yes. So a chimp could have intuitive physics

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.520
Yeah, and joseph call and others have studied that a number of other

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.320
Amanda ced and other brothers had studied other non-human primates and we're actually collaborating

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.880
With erica cart mill and some others studying

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.360
non-human primates on intuitive physics and I know colleagues

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.880
Who are studying analogous kinds of intuitive physics in rats?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.880
And I think even simpler organisms

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.160
Okay, so the difference between humans and

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.560
Other animals is going to be that language allows you to go further

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.240
Language allows you to go beyond intuitive physics

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.680
Whereas nothing is going to help these other animals go beyond intuitive physics

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.400
Yeah, I I think that's right. I mean again

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.160
I wouldn't say that all the all the mental models of other animals is just intuitive physics

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.440
They also have models of their social world like you know the chainy and save farce baboon metaphysics is mostly a social theory

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.920
But yeah, but I would say

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:18.880
Definitely that the key thing here and it's the real human singularity. I would say

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.040
Is that language allows us to construct to both enrich our intuitive physics to think about

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.280
Aspects of the physical world that are not initially intuitive to us and maybe still aren't

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.160
But also to construct things that just go totally beyond any any core domain that evolution gave us

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.920
Right

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.480
Okay, so one question that this brought up to me

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.520
Because what you're talking about are all the ways that humans are so good at what they do

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.120
um

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.120
But then there are ways that they're not so good at what they do

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.760
And far transfer is one of those examples

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.760
um

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:05.280
And there there are some things that are hard for people to learn

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.080
Or some places where it's hard to get from

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200
A to z

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.400
Even though you think you've learned a

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.680
So there's a famous little story about someone going to their logic teacher

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480
asking about

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.600
Understanding if a then b and the logic teacher spends a lot of time on that

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.160
And the student says

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.480
Okay, I think I get it

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.440
But we try it with r and s now

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.600
um

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:45.040
So that's something that just shouldn't occur, but it does occur

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.880
Uh, even with smart people

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.400
So like when you try to teach people about experimental design

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.480
It's hard for them to see confounds often

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.440
um, it's hard for them to

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.720
Get at what's wrong with some experimental design

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:13.280
And it's not that they don't have a general intelligence. It's not that they don't have some principles

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840
but it's as if

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.080
What they've learned is just

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:27.040
Too far away as far as the the string of examples goes for them to get to to the next one

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.320
So I'm wondering how

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.960
On your system

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.720
those kinds of limitations would be modeled

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.600
Yeah, no, that's a that's a great point a great question and a great pointer. I think to work that

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.240
We could and should do more of so the the stuff I talked about at the very end, which is again this the work with

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.040
Tyler and uh, katie collins and

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.560
Lansing and and and very much with leo wang also

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.720
um

01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.840
is

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.720
What we're what we're getting out there like is is again how we can

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.600
Describe a situation in language, maybe even very implicitly just start talking and then see if

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:16.000
See if this architecture can be used to construct a mental model needed to reason about that situation

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And you could also make it better

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.920
More robust if I explicitly give you instructions as in the educational context you're talking about if I try to explain to someone

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.640
Logic or experimental design actually another collaborator on that project said zhong is actually very interested for his thesis

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.840
In how we learn like logic and learn to reason through language

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.880
But so we have you know, our framework is providing possibly a way to do that

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.400
but

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.960
In order for it to work at least in the current system

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.880
We do the kind of thing that lm folks are generally doing these days, which is some kind of few shot prompting

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:55.360
We prompt the system with examples of other mental models and language for describing them in

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.040
Related domains they could be similar or they could be further and what we already can see right is i mean

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.080
The interesting thing is can you generalize to new domains?

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240
So our system is somewhat able to do that

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.280
But you know, this is a place where near or far transfer would be relevant at least so far

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.360
you know as you might expect you have to have some domain that's at least reasonably close

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.440
And for example, we're trying we could transfer from like a tug of war to a relay race or to some other sport setting

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.800
Or from a couple of sport settings to yet some new sport

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:25.680
um

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.560
Or you might transfer from a sport setting to like a math competition or to some other kind of thing

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.080
So if it really interesting ideas about abstraction and metaphor

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.520
Analogy some of the kinds of things that the the transfer literature has studied are going to be relevant here

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.320
We're just beginning but what you're pointing to is actually some set of phenomena and things we should really

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.760
Engage with and I expect you know at least based on our current system

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.720
It will definitely struggle sometimes with far transfer

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.480
Um, which be which might be because at that level, you know, I I I drew this contrast at the very beginning

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.440
between the pattern recognition approach

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.240
Data driven learning and the mental models approach

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.720
But at that level we are doing a kind of pattern recognition. It's just not patterns in the world

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.560
It's patterns and thoughts and thought structures and ways of expressing them

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.640
And you know at that point if if if that kind of really interesting

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.160
But much more abstract kind of pattern recognition is what's driving your ability to construct new models of new situations

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.360
Or at least initially before you've had formal instruction or when you're just at the beginning of formal instruction

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:32.320
Then we should expect that it to have it to have the same kinds of fragility with far transfer that any machine learning approach does

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.920
Okay, sorry to be a gilljoy here. We have about 10 minutes left

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.840
But we have at least four people that want to ask questions. So what I want to suggest

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.360
to alina and julia and

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.520
also

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:52.400
Uh leijin and stephan carlson is to raise your hand again, and I'll recognize you in the order that you raise your hand

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.440
Okay, julia go ahead

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.600
well, um, so I was wondering

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:08.320
I was thinking like maybe you can use the um the LLM translator plus the probabilistic models that system to um

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:16.720
Model how the beliefs of a reader would change over the course of being told a story or like reading a book

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.320
And then you could look across

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.520
The genres or books or whatever to kind of get a sense of

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.320
What the kind of model of those stories being told since the stories are themselves a world model what that would be

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.960
and that you could incorporate

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.560
Because if you have a guess because something that you didn't like touch on in

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.640
You know in your act talk, which I'm sure you didn't have time

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:51.120
But was that like if you have a guess about where you are in the trajectory of the story you expect

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.040
Then you have a guess about

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.040
About what you think's going to happen next

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.240
Wrap it up because we um, so I was just wondering like do you do yeah, that's a great question

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.480
Um, let me just try to answer it really quickly yet

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.880
Leo wong would love that question because in addition to being a great cognitive scientist

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.280
They are also a writer they write stories and even novels

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:15.600
And one of the things that we've been working on is little mini like three act structures and things like that that

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400
Follow either classic narrative structures or other

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.920
Things and and you know, maybe not surprisingly those are places where we see a big gap between

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.640
human story understanding and

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:33.040
LLMs even the state of the art ones, but exactly we're trying to use these models to capture how that kind of

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.960
You know journey of understanding might unfold and also even how

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.840
A creator might create it. So another student that we've worked with Karthik Chandra has

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:48.640
Had had some work at last year's cog side conference on storytelling as inverse inverse planning and the idea that like if somebody's

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:53.360
Understanding another character's journey by doing some inverse planning as in those theory of my models

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.520
Then a storyteller can try to invert that inverse planner to to convey

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.280
the emotional

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:05.520
Or mental journey that the character has and that's a way to use this toolkit for both story creation as well as story understanding

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.720
So again, it's those are mostly promissory notes, but great question and future research

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.200
I think from Karthik and leo and others will address it. Thank you. Thanks

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.360
Hi, I'm gonna ask a question in person josh. This is ever

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.240
Hi, I yeah go for it. I I really liked your talk. By the way, I watched it on video. Yeah

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.240
Cool, great. Okay. So yeah

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.160
I was gonna so following the work that you were showing where you were basically based also on what you were saying and then in the

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.720
Question period where you were, you know, few shot prompting these language models to produce probabilistic language

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.480
World models, I guess I have my I have sort of a more medic question

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.560
Which is do you see that as just a way to sort of help step by step reasoning in these models?

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.040
Or do you think this is sort of evidence for

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:57.600
Early sort of possible world modeling being learned in these models

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.080
Um

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.640
I'm not sure if I see it as either of those. Um, I I mean, uh, uh, so

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.640
I don't think of it as either doing step step by step reasoning in language models or

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.440
Evidence that they do possible world modeling. It might be relate. I mean, there is you know, I've obviously as you know

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.080
You talked about some and others have, you know, there's certainly

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.440
Um, a lot of evidence that llms if you try to just use them as end-to-end reasoning systems

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.000
They can benefit from step by step by reasoning and there might be some emergent world modeling capacities

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.680
But you know, again, I look at that and I see a really interesting and mixed pattern of successes and failures

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.520
And depending on who's writing the paper and what their agendas are you can highlight the successes or you can highlight the failures and the gaps

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.120
um

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.800
The to me that an objective perspective is that it's patchy and fragile although extremely impressive and really interesting

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.560
So the way I think of what we're trying to do is to say, yeah, there's there's you know

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.200
Various kinds of interesting approximate implicit knowledge that those models have that can be used sometimes to succeed

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.880
In reasoning complex sequences of reasoning or world modeling

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.560
But I think a more robust way to use it is the way we're using it a more both a more human like and a more robust for ai

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720
way to use it which is to

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.400
Which is to condition and construct these bespoke world models

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.120
that you know where the

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.960
long chains of sequential reasoning or actual

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.200
You know coherent world modeling are there

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.840
By construction

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.960
But you know, there are other limits like again as as I was saying, you know Bayesian inference in really complex models

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.320
Is very difficult and I don't think people do it. There's a lot of evidence

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.120
They don't do it

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.560
But they seem to do it very generally in in just the right small model

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.440
At least in cases where they have the relevant world knowledge to construct those models and when they don't they don't

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.600
Right, so that's all you know

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.480
Our minds have mixed patterns of successes and failures there too

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.760
But I think this toolkit is better matched to the mixed patterns of successes and failures, which is

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.680
What what i'm trying to get out if that makes sense the the the one that we see in humans as opposed to the the weird head scratching

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.080
Like super intelligent cases in some places and then super dumb Jesus and others that you just see in a pure sequence model

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.040
I'm told Alina can go next. Thanks for your answer. Yeah, thanks

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Good question

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360
Alina pick it up or you lose your turn

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:32.720
Yes, um, hello, uh, thank you for insightful talk. Um, Josh so

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:42.880
You said that um, and correct me if I'm misheard that language allows us to construct meaning that it's totally out of bounds of evolutionary gain

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.200
um

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.640
Is if uh, if this is what you said, I think this is uh, super profound. So

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:01.840
Yeah, I I'm sure I'm not the only person who said that many people sure. Okay. It's just a reminder. I guess profound truth. Yes

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.640
Okay, uh, so the actual question

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.000
So, um, you mentioned that the meaning on the world is constructed contextually and incrementally

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:16.000
So could you please elaborate on how this process occurs and how it impacts our understanding of complex concepts?

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:22.480
So so we transition between the um from incremental construction of the meaning to generalizations

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.160
Right. So the way it works in our

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.280
I can just I can tell you how it works in the models that we've built so far

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.160
And again, this is not to say that it's exactly like this in the mind

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.600
But I think it might be something like this and a lot more work needs to be done

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.080
But the way it works in our models is something kind of like what you're familiar in a chat

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.640
Like if you've used a chat gbt or other

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.040
conversational ai systems

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.440
The way it's working is that basically there

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.240
You know, if you're used to using chat gbt you type something it types something back and in the middle

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.880
Some wheels turn and then you type something more in it wheels turn in the black box and it types more stuff

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.960
Okay, so it's it's basically like that

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.480
It in that you at each each sentence is translated into some

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:12.240
Expression in the language of thought roughly at the sentence level. I think sentences are real units of meaning like I I am very

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.920
respectful and admiring of many insights from language

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.880
Including that words are real and sentences are real and there's real syntactic structure to be understood there

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.320
That is only being approximated in some ways by these models

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.680
But the key is that yes, there's a process the contextual process is like at the discourse level

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.800
You go sentence code sentence code sentence code

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.120
And each sentence to code translation is conditioned on the previous

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:42.000
Conversational history or the discourse that that you have been interpreting. Okay

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.240
That's just a first approximation

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.600
Just another thing you might want to do and surely you'll have to do is go back and edit previous code because if you realize

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.040
Oh, I misunderstood something. I can't just add new code. I have to go back and edit the code that I wrote before

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.120
Which is also something that code llms can do

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.360
I'm not saying they'll do it right

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.600
But there's other processes that involve like checking and refining and fixing models

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.120
That are written in this way

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.760
But maybe that gives you some sense of the contextual dynamics of how language is understood in this model

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440
Last question lay jim

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.600
Hi

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.080
Joshua, thank you for for the presentation. It's very interesting

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.520
Um, I have an engineering background, but I'm not an expert in

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400
artificial intelligence

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400
Uh, I have a few questions

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:33.920
um

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.640
From your presentation, I understand that

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240
actually llms

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.240
the

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.360
The the it's it's kind of a gold mine of human knowledge

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:54.480
And uh, you seem to say that they have a modelized the real world facts and the logics are quite correctly

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:04.080
If you ask the question directly in human language, uh, currently they don't seem to to give the good answer

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.600
because some with some lack of

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.600
algorithm, but if you first translate the

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.480
human questions into

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.200
functional code and like

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.800
The work you are doing and then they are capable of um

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.080
I know we execute the code then we we are capable of having

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:32.800
Result results that are quite close to human behavior. Uh, so is that the correct?

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.560
Yeah, that's I mean, that's more or less correct

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.560
But I don't want to I mean and that's that's what we've been doing in these examples

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560
And what I've been showing but I don't want to

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.560
Claim I don't and I don't think it's true

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.800
But certainly I don't have the evidence for it being true or how true it is that

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.120
You know llms like always do this, right? There's a lot of

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.640
Ways in which language is only an imperfect reflection of the ways that we think

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:05.200
There's certain things that again are partly based on evolutionarily ancient core systems. The language is not very good at expressing

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.000
And that includes also spatial reasoning and you can see ways in which

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.720
Even the best language models break down here and language multimodal language vision models

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.560
Have have had persistent problems always from the beginning there

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.520
So I think you know, I don't want to suggest like I think yes language is a treasure trove

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:30.400
Of knowledge explicit and implicit about the world, but it's and for us it's it's such a valuable resource as human beings

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:38.400
Okay, that's why it's no accident that language models when they're trained to capture patterns on all the language that humanity's basically ever produced and put out there on the web

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.960
Uh, you know start to have remarkable properties at the same time

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:49.440
It's only some parts of our knowledge about the world is key parts to actually understanding and being in the world

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.240
That basically nobody ever talks about

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:01.360
And even if they do talk about it they talk about it very incompletely and imperfectly and yet our brains are designed to understand in those terms

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:08.320
So I I don't want to convey the idea that somehow it's all there in language and it's and that's all you need

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.400
by not by any means

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.880
Wonderful before we, uh, let people applaud

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:21.840
You know, there's some several panels coming. Are there any of them that you can join? They're not today, unfortunately

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:28.640
Yeah, um, I I need to check my calendar and coordinate on some family things and I will I'll I'll try very hard to join one of them

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.800
Okay, now we'll applaud you for

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.760
Thank you

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:44.080
Thanks, and and thanks so much for the discussion Virginia and all the all the questions. There were great questions. So I hope to engage more

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.360
um

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.960
in one of the panels and um in person if if anyone hears
