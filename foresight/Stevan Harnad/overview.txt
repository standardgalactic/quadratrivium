Checking Stevan Harnad/LLM Understanding： 15 J. TENENBAUM ＂Word Models to World Models：  Probabilistic Language of Thought＂.txt
1. **Understanding of LLMs**: Lay Jim asked about whether language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have modeled real-world facts and logic correctly, and if they can perform well when questions are translated into functional code. Joshua Leonard, the presenter, confirmed that LLMs contain a vast amount of human knowledge and can perform tasks effectively when the input is in a language format they understand well. However, he emphasized that LLMs often require translation or reformulation of questions to align with their understanding of logic and structure.

2. **Limitations of Language Models**: Joshua pointed out that language is an imperfect reflection of human thought processes and that there are aspects of cognition and reasoning (like spatial reasoning) that language doesn't capture well. Therefore, while LLMs can be impressive, they are not always reliable, especially when dealing with complex or multimodal tasks.

3. **Further Engagement**: Joshua expressed his intention to join subsequent panels if possible, hoping to engage more in the discussion and address any follow-up questions or topics of interest that may arise from this presentation and the Q&A session.

Checking Stevan Harnad/LLM Understanding： 19. Stephen WOLFRAM ＂Computational Irreducibility, Minds, and Machine Learning＂.txt
1. Steven Wolfram discussed the question of whether artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), can truly understand mathematics. He mentioned that while LLMs are good at mimicking human writing style and generating text that seems plausible to humans, their understanding is not on par with human experts.

2. Wolfram highlighted that there's a difference between what a human mathematician would consider a "theorem" versus a "lemma" or other types of mathematical statements. LLMs can likely learn to classify these based on cues in the text, but it may not reflect a deep understanding.

3. Wolfram attempted to test the capability of LLMs by comparing human-written inequalities with those generated by machines. He found that LLMs could perform reasonably well at distinguishing between the two types of expressions, which suggests they can identify stylistic and cue-based differences.

4. The practical application of this research is significant for automated testing in Mathematica and Moulton language. Wolfram's team has been exploring whether LLMs can generate expressions similar to those seen from human users or guess if an input is plausible based on a dataset of human-generated expressions.

5. There was a slight interruption as the host had to end the session with Wolfram to start the next one on time, but there was an intention to continue the conversation in a subsequent panel within 10 minutes. However, this required restarting the Zoom link for the new session.
