1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Look, I get it, most of you are stuck in tutorial hell, a lot of you can't seem to get yourself

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,820
out of that.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,160
This is something I was in for the longest time that I can imagine and it's one of those

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,000
things that probably frustrated me and just straight up shitted on my career from getting

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
better for the longest amount of time because all I kept doing was going tutorial after

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,400
tutorial and don't lie to me right now because I know you're probably doing that.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,160
There's a high chance of you, whether you're watching clever programmer tutorials and you're

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,240
doing build after build or you're watching Udemy or something else out there, whatever

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,040
it may be, you are not making a lot of forward progress and what do I mean by forward progress?

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,320
What I mean when I say forward progress is really, are you working on projects that

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,440
excite you and are you working on stuff where it's useful to you and going on your portfolio?

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,760
Are you working on things and are you able to code from scratch and build real world

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
things?

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,520
Because if you can't do that, I mean, to be honest, you're kind of screwed, right?

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,680
You're not going to be making forward progress, you're going to be kind of just stuck forever.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,360
If I was to show you on the screen, it's kind of like, let me see if I can open this up.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Boom.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,960
So if I was to show you here, you'd be just like running in and this is what most of the

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,000
people who are coding, right?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,640
You're just kind of running in circles forever and it seems like there's never any getting

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,800
out of there.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,680
Going after tutorial after tutorial and what you want to be able to do is you want to preferably

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,000
be able to go in a straight line where your career is moving forward like this, but right

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,360
now what's happening is you go to one tutorial, make progress, then you go to another one,

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,160
make some progress, then go to another one, and then maybe even start picking up a new

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,920
framework where in my opinion, you're making backwards progress sometimes because if you

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,060
want to get really, really good, you should just stick to one thing and keep getting better

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
at it.

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,960
So in the start, I personally don't think that you should be learning like basics of

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,420
JavaScript and then moving on and trying to learn React and then trying to learn next

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,180
JS and trying to learn like all of these other things because instead of making forward progress,

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,580
really what you're doing is you're branching out, you make some forward progress with JavaScript,

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,620
then you start all over again, make some forward progress with React, then you start all over

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:45,700
again, make some forward progress with what is it, next JS or Tailwind CSS or whatever

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,020
is your flavor of the month and you're not really making any forward progress at all.

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:58,620
In reality, what you should be doing is pick up JavaScript and just start coding day one.

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,100
And this is day two, code day two.

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,660
Then if I keep going, right, this is day three.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,100
And when I say you're coding, I literally mean you are coding.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,260
Like, yes, you can watch tutorials, yes, you can try to pick up exercises, but like code

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,980
shit that you could do with whatever you do know.

42
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,540
For example, if you learn if else, make a freaking game out of if else, you can take

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,900
if else statements so far.

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,380
Make something interactive where if you have an if else block, I can type in something,

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,380
a pop up happens, and then I type in, you know, guess you can make guess the number

46
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,020
game with if else statements, right?

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,980
If I guess 50 goes too low, then I guess for try 30, and then it goes too high, and then

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,020
I guess 40, and then it's like close, and then I'm like 42, and then it goes correct.

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,260
You could do so much.

50
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,460
So then do that, and you should be coding or thinking about coding or problem solving

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,180
for many hours in a day.

52
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,780
So many of you have this crazy freaking problem with being able to sit there and think and

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,820
focus for a long period of time.

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,260
If you cannot sit there and think focus for a long period of time, I'm not gonna say you're

55
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,660
not gonna become a coder ever, but like you're gonna have so much more difficulty, right?

56
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,580
Because for example, if you are sitting there and you have trouble focusing, you're making

57
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,540
turtle like progress every day, right?

58
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,460
So like for example, this is you, you make this much progress, and that's all you got

59
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
done in day one.

60
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,500
And then day two, you make this much progress, and that's all you got done in day two.

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,420
Then you make this much progress, that's your day three, right?

62
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,620
And then you have a freak like me who will code there like a motherfucker and just not

63
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,500
stop, and I'll code for 10, 12, 14 hours, and especially when I was picking it up as

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,380
a skill, I was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a day.

65
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,520
So then you have somebody who's not more talented than you, who's not smarter than you, because

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,960
I failed my math classes, I sucked at them, but I will sit there and code for that amount

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,400
of time, and that's my one day, okay?

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,240
And then if we keep going, this is my second day.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,640
I've made this much progress on day two, this is my day one and day two, whereas like for

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,480
you and most people, you're gonna be here on day six, right?

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,240
What I got done in one day.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,640
Because with coding, unlike, let's say you're doing powerlifting, right?

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,600
With powerlifting, okay, yeah, if you deadlift and squat and bench, if you did it for like

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,640
more than two or three hours, you'll start to have diminishing returns where you've broken

75
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,760
down your muscles so much, you literally need to give it more time to recover and heal.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,360
With learning, you can learn for 14 hours a day and then go to sleep, let your brain

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
process that and then wake up the next day and do that again.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,600
With learning, there's nothing that kind of messes you up or is in the way.

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,760
With when it comes to powerlifting, you need time for recovery because you're literally

80
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,080
breaking down your muscles, but learning, you can just keep going, okay?

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
So that's a huge advantage and you can do this.

82
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,720
For example, where else can you do it, okay?

83
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,400
When you're driving your car, can you listen to a podcast about coding?

84
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Boom, there's your extra learning time, okay?

85
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,800
If you drive for one hour, you're like, hey, I have a long commute, great, one to two hours

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,800
a day, one to two hours, you are able to now, you're now able to learn coding, okay?

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,000
Or learn about coding, which is super, super important.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,400
If there's other things, you're like, hey, I have to use the bathroom, so I just need

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
to kill that time.

90
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,120
If you're in the bathroom or you're showering or if you're not showering, you're just freaking

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,040
going and pooping, right?

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,280
You can watch a YouTube video that's talking about code and maybe it's even interesting

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,060
or maybe pick something that might excite you, but you need to be doing things that constantly

94
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,400
move you forward, excite you, brainwash you to want to code and makes you want to do things,

95
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
right?

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
Most people, first of all, they'll only code very limited amounts of time.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,800
And second of all, they will never do their own learning.

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,520
Most people will just only do the learning that's prescribed to them through whatever

99
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,200
their school tells them to do or whatever their YouTube tutorial tells them to do or

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,000
whatever their Udemy tutorial tells you to do.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,480
If you keep doing that, here's what's going to happen.

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,320
Let me just make sure the audio is good.

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's check the audio.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Okay.

105
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
It's looking good there.

106
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Let's check here.

107
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Beautiful.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,680
So what's going to happen when you do this is that you're just going to be like stuck

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,920
and you're just going to be confused and you're not going to make forward progress.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Okay.

111
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,880
And also when you go to a job interview, if you weren't able to turn things into your

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,600
own and you weren't able to code something creatively and you go to a job interview and

113
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
I tell you, hey, turn it into this, you won't be able to do that.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,720
You won't be able to make it something custom and you won't even be able to solve the problem

115
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,500
they gave you because all you taught yourself how to do is to follow a tutorial.

116
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,640
So you got the skill of following tutorials, but you did not work on your skill of thinking

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,880
and you did not work on your skill of problem solving.

118
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,520
So you're not going to get the job.

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,360
You're just going to be stuck.

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,320
So this is why, right?

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,000
This is so important.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Like, use all this time that you have at your disposal.

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:55,000
If you're washing dishes, learn coding, watch a video, listen to something, okay?

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What else is there?

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
There's, there's dishes, driving.

126
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
There's tons of countless.

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:09,080
After cleaning the house, you can be listening or watching something related to coding, okay?

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,400
If you drive a truck all the time, that's perfect for listening to audible.

129
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Listen to the story of how Linus Torvalds, you know, built Linux, listen to Elon Musk's

130
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,760
autobiography, listen to books that either personally developed you or make you interested

131
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,280
in coding or straight up podcasts that talk about coding.

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,960
I know Wes Boss has a podcast called Syntax and there's a bunch of other ones out there.

133
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't care what you pick.

134
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,800
I just care you pick something and you learn and you keep improving your skill because

135
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,720
at the end of the day, it's about the hours that you actually put into the skill and that's

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
all that comes down to.

137
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
If you're not putting, if I have more hours, like assuming our intelligence levels are equal.

138
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,160
So let's say that your intelligence level is here and my intelligence level is here,

139
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
okay?

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,160
My bad.

141
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
I meant to make equal lines.

142
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,120
So these lines are fairly equal, okay?

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
This is line one and this is two.

144
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
They're fairly equal.

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,160
Well, we're both going to be pretty much at the same level, right?

146
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,160
But now if you, if we're same amount of talented, but now if you're putting in two times the

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,760
time as me to learn coding, you have just two X yourself, okay?

148
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,840
Now if you're brainwashing yourself and watching documentaries, like instead of watching Netflix

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,320
at night in your wind down time, maybe you're watching Mr. Robot.

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Maybe you're watching a show like Silicon Valley that is entertaining, funny, but still

151
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,680
hypes you up and excites you about coding and programming and you're kind of altering

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,520
your reality to become that of a developer.

153
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:56,280
Now instead of two X in your results, now you have four extra results, okay?

154
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,520
This multiplier can keep increasing if you're taking care of your body and you're sleeping

155
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,440
healthy and you're eating healthy and your body is clean.

156
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,800
And now when you code and learn coding, your memory is stronger because you're able to retain

157
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
more information.

158
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,760
You have less fogginess so you can absorb more information and actually apply more information.

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Now you've doubled maybe the result of the previous four X multiplier and you've eight

160
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,600
X your results, okay?

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Anytime you add a new element, you essentially double your results.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
So one is for example, maximizing your time, right?

163
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,400
The other is kind of immersion, which is like what I was calling like brainwashing yourself.

164
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,600
And then, I don't know, what was the third one?

165
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I forgot.

166
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Somebody in the chat will let me know, but I'm not live, so that won't help.

167
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,640
But whatever the third one was, right, that is what gives you that multiplier, each new

168
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,280
thing that you do, oh yeah, body, okay?

169
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:07,960
With each thing you do, essentially that is a new multiplier and gets you freaking jacked

170
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,120
in your career.

171
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,360
And when we say eight X, well eight X is massive because what eight X really means, we get

172
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,920
out of this, is you're going to achieve in one lifetime the results I will achieve in

173
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,320
eight lifetimes.

174
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,280
You've eight X your results, eight extra career results, you've also eight X shortened your

175
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
results that you would get.

176
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,800
So for example, let's say in your coding career, the success you would achieve in 30 years,

177
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,400
well now you've eight X it.

178
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,320
So just divide 30 by eight.

179
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,320
So what's 30 by eight 30?

180
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,760
This is my 30 divided by eight.

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,400
That's 3.75, 3.75 years.

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:56,160
So now you're getting 30 years of results in 3.75 years, which is kind of ridiculous when

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
you put it like that.

184
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
But you're essentially getting incredible results.

185
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,280
So then people ask you, hey, how did you get that six figure income so fast?

186
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,800
Hey, how are you able to build these real world applications and you were able to figure

187
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,200
that out so fast?

188
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,760
That's how you have maximized your time.

189
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:23,360
You've maximized your body and you've maximized how much you believe in it, the immersion.

190
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,640
If you start to now make friends, this also goes towards immersion.

191
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,080
If you now go from friends who talk about Gears of War or Call of Duty or League of

192
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:40,480
Legends or complain or negativity, now if you replace that with friends who are cool

193
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,180
friends and also talk about coding, that's another multiplier.

194
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,000
That's part of the immersion multiplier.

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Now what you've done is you have friends that add value to your life and you have they fasten

196
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,040
to speed up your growth because as you're speaking with them, yes, you're having fun,

197
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,880
you're having a conversation, but you're learning at the same freaking time.

198
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,000
They're real time tutorials that are teaching you, but they're more practical even than

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,320
tutorials because tutorials are great, but they will not make you a better developer

200
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,400
a lot of the times because you're stuck there watching somebody else.

201
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
You will make progress when you do it.

202
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,640
Even when you watch tutorials, I highly recommend you keep pausing them.

203
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,200
You keep building your own thing.

204
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,960
You keep switching it and changing it until that app is now yours, completely yours, completely

205
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
unique.

206
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,360
Or maybe if somebody is building a blogging app, you copy that and turn it into a video

207
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,960
app.

208
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
That's how you win.

209
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
That's how you will win.

210
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,000
These are some of the things I wanted to share with you.

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,680
Maximize your time with coding.

212
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't go, wow, I have one hour a day, two hours a day.

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
It's not going to make you good.

214
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,040
You have to invest a lot of time.

215
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,040
If you have a family, if you have kids, which I know a lot of you do, a lot of the students

216
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,680
that are in our coding bootcamp, I know you.

217
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Hi.

218
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,520
If you're watching this, Urchina, hi.

219
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,440
If any of you are watching this, hello, Brandon.

220
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,160
I understand you have families, you have kids, you have maybe even a job that takes up so

221
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,240
much of your time.

222
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,080
Whenever time is left over, spend it into coding and during your time, you can still

223
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
be listening and learning about coding.

224
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,000
You can be literally watching my YouTube videos and hearing me talk about coding.

225
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Even if you're not seeing the screen, even that might help just because you're getting

226
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,000
familiar with the thought patterns, what I'm saying, the lingo.

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,320
It makes it less intimidating.

228
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,920
It has a huge impact.

229
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,640
Keep an eye out for that.

230
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,000
That's all I have for you today.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
If you enjoyed this video, smash the like button, subscribe to the goddamn channel because

232
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,480
this is the channel where you learn everything react, react native, and also full stack development.

233
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Last thing I want to let you know is that for the cohort of June, we're going to be shutting

234
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,960
down enrollment for our full stack mastery bootcamp in just a few days.

235
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,880
For the June cohort, it starts June 1st and the next five to six days, we're going to

236
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,480
be shutting down enrollment for that.

237
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,640
If you want to learn with me and my team and you want to be in our immersive coding bootcamp

238
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,200
that we just recently launched, it's an incredible bootcamp.

239
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,320
We just dive deep in this bootcamp.

240
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Just a couple of things that you should know.

241
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,160
It's six to eight months long right now where we are making it even eight months because

242
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
other bootcamps, they just don't do you justice.

243
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
In two to three months, you're not going to become a great developer.

244
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
I'm sorry, but that's just the truth of it.

245
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,080
The only people that become successful out of those bootcamps are people who already

246
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,160
know coding.

247
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,560
This bootcamp is mainly for people who are looking to switch careers or complete beginners

248
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,720
and looking to learn all of the skills.

249
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,280
If you're more advanced, you will still get your ass kicked and learn a ton of things.

250
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,240
You're going to learn data structures and algorithms.

251
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,840
We're going to teach you all the front end, back end.

252
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,340
You're going to learn everything.

253
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,160
If this is something exciting to you and you want to speak with me or my team members

254
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,120
about schedule a call with us, in the link below, there's a form.

255
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,400
Fill that out in as much detail as possible.

256
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Currently, we're mostly working with US students.

257
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,360
If you're US, go ahead and apply and fill out the details because we are very selective

258
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,760
about the students that we take so we can only take a couple of students at a time.

259
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,840
Please fill it out in as much detail as possible so then that gives you a chance for me to

260
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,880
pick up and get on a call with you or one of my team members to get on a call with you.

261
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
We'll just let you know.

262
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm going to be honest with you.

263
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
We're going to be honest with you.

264
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,360
If it's a good fit for you, we're going to let you know.

265
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,480
If it's not a good fit for you, we'll tell you, hey, self-teaching is better for you,

266
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,680
so save your money.

267
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,320
Hey, this other bootcamp might be better for you.

268
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,840
We will just be honest with you.

269
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,040
My number one goal is that you actually get a job.

270
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,160
You actually increase your skills.

271
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,920
My number one goal is not to take your money.

272
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
I don't care.

273
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
I want to see you succeed.

274
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,720
I love your beautiful face.

275
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
This is Kazi.

276
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,560
As always, I'll see you in the next video.
