0	7360	Look, I get it, most of you are stuck in tutorial hell, a lot of you can't seem to get yourself
7360	9820	out of that.
9820	14160	This is something I was in for the longest time that I can imagine and it's one of those
14160	21000	things that probably frustrated me and just straight up shitted on my career from getting
21000	25920	better for the longest amount of time because all I kept doing was going tutorial after
25920	31400	tutorial and don't lie to me right now because I know you're probably doing that.
31400	35160	There's a high chance of you, whether you're watching clever programmer tutorials and you're
35160	40240	doing build after build or you're watching Udemy or something else out there, whatever
40240	47040	it may be, you are not making a lot of forward progress and what do I mean by forward progress?
47040	51320	What I mean when I say forward progress is really, are you working on projects that
51320	57440	excite you and are you working on stuff where it's useful to you and going on your portfolio?
57440	62760	Are you working on things and are you able to code from scratch and build real world
62760	63760	things?
63760	70520	Because if you can't do that, I mean, to be honest, you're kind of screwed, right?
70520	78680	You're not going to be making forward progress, you're going to be kind of just stuck forever.
78680	84360	If I was to show you on the screen, it's kind of like, let me see if I can open this up.
84360	85360	Boom.
85360	91960	So if I was to show you here, you'd be just like running in and this is what most of the
91960	94000	people who are coding, right?
94000	99640	You're just kind of running in circles forever and it seems like there's never any getting
99640	100800	out of there.
100800	106680	Going after tutorial after tutorial and what you want to be able to do is you want to preferably
106680	114000	be able to go in a straight line where your career is moving forward like this, but right
114000	118360	now what's happening is you go to one tutorial, make progress, then you go to another one,
118360	122160	make some progress, then go to another one, and then maybe even start picking up a new
122160	126920	framework where in my opinion, you're making backwards progress sometimes because if you
126920	130060	want to get really, really good, you should just stick to one thing and keep getting better
130060	131060	at it.
131060	137960	So in the start, I personally don't think that you should be learning like basics of
137960	143420	JavaScript and then moving on and trying to learn React and then trying to learn next
143420	149180	JS and trying to learn like all of these other things because instead of making forward progress,
149180	153580	really what you're doing is you're branching out, you make some forward progress with JavaScript,
153580	157620	then you start all over again, make some forward progress with React, then you start all over
157620	165700	again, make some forward progress with what is it, next JS or Tailwind CSS or whatever
165700	171020	is your flavor of the month and you're not really making any forward progress at all.
171020	178620	In reality, what you should be doing is pick up JavaScript and just start coding day one.
178620	183100	And this is day two, code day two.
183100	188660	Then if I keep going, right, this is day three.
188660	192100	And when I say you're coding, I literally mean you are coding.
192100	197260	Like, yes, you can watch tutorials, yes, you can try to pick up exercises, but like code
197260	199980	shit that you could do with whatever you do know.
199980	204540	For example, if you learn if else, make a freaking game out of if else, you can take
204540	207900	if else statements so far.
207900	212380	Make something interactive where if you have an if else block, I can type in something,
212380	217380	a pop up happens, and then I type in, you know, guess you can make guess the number
217380	219020	game with if else statements, right?
219020	223980	If I guess 50 goes too low, then I guess for try 30, and then it goes too high, and then
223980	229020	I guess 40, and then it's like close, and then I'm like 42, and then it goes correct.
229020	230260	You could do so much.
230260	234460	So then do that, and you should be coding or thinking about coding or problem solving
234460	237180	for many hours in a day.
237180	244780	So many of you have this crazy freaking problem with being able to sit there and think and
244780	246820	focus for a long period of time.
246820	251260	If you cannot sit there and think focus for a long period of time, I'm not gonna say you're
251260	255660	not gonna become a coder ever, but like you're gonna have so much more difficulty, right?
255660	260580	Because for example, if you are sitting there and you have trouble focusing, you're making
260580	262540	turtle like progress every day, right?
262540	267460	So like for example, this is you, you make this much progress, and that's all you got
267460	268460	done in day one.
268460	272500	And then day two, you make this much progress, and that's all you got done in day two.
272500	275420	Then you make this much progress, that's your day three, right?
275420	279620	And then you have a freak like me who will code there like a motherfucker and just not
279620	284500	stop, and I'll code for 10, 12, 14 hours, and especially when I was picking it up as
284500	288380	a skill, I was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a day.
288380	292520	So then you have somebody who's not more talented than you, who's not smarter than you, because
292520	298960	I failed my math classes, I sucked at them, but I will sit there and code for that amount
298960	304400	of time, and that's my one day, okay?
304400	310240	And then if we keep going, this is my second day.
310240	315640	I've made this much progress on day two, this is my day one and day two, whereas like for
315640	320480	you and most people, you're gonna be here on day six, right?
320480	324240	What I got done in one day.
324240	328640	Because with coding, unlike, let's say you're doing powerlifting, right?
328640	333600	With powerlifting, okay, yeah, if you deadlift and squat and bench, if you did it for like
333600	337640	more than two or three hours, you'll start to have diminishing returns where you've broken
337640	343760	down your muscles so much, you literally need to give it more time to recover and heal.
343760	349360	With learning, you can learn for 14 hours a day and then go to sleep, let your brain
349360	352560	process that and then wake up the next day and do that again.
352560	358600	With learning, there's nothing that kind of messes you up or is in the way.
358600	364760	With when it comes to powerlifting, you need time for recovery because you're literally
364760	368080	breaking down your muscles, but learning, you can just keep going, okay?
368080	371120	So that's a huge advantage and you can do this.
371120	373720	For example, where else can you do it, okay?
373720	379400	When you're driving your car, can you listen to a podcast about coding?
379400	384600	Boom, there's your extra learning time, okay?
384600	388800	If you drive for one hour, you're like, hey, I have a long commute, great, one to two hours
388800	397800	a day, one to two hours, you are able to now, you're now able to learn coding, okay?
397800	402000	Or learn about coding, which is super, super important.
402280	406400	If there's other things, you're like, hey, I have to use the bathroom, so I just need
406400	407520	to kill that time.
407520	412120	If you're in the bathroom or you're showering or if you're not showering, you're just freaking
412120	415040	going and pooping, right?
415040	419280	You can watch a YouTube video that's talking about code and maybe it's even interesting
419280	425060	or maybe pick something that might excite you, but you need to be doing things that constantly
425060	431400	move you forward, excite you, brainwash you to want to code and makes you want to do things,
431800	432800	right?
432800	436960	Most people, first of all, they'll only code very limited amounts of time.
436960	440800	And second of all, they will never do their own learning.
440800	447520	Most people will just only do the learning that's prescribed to them through whatever
447520	452200	their school tells them to do or whatever their YouTube tutorial tells them to do or
452200	455000	whatever their Udemy tutorial tells you to do.
455000	457480	If you keep doing that, here's what's going to happen.
457480	461320	Let me just make sure the audio is good.
461320	462320	Let's check the audio.
462320	463320	Okay.
463320	464320	It's looking good there.
464320	465320	Let's check here.
465320	466320	Beautiful.
466320	472680	So what's going to happen when you do this is that you're just going to be like stuck
472680	475920	and you're just going to be confused and you're not going to make forward progress.
475920	476920	Okay.
476920	480880	And also when you go to a job interview, if you weren't able to turn things into your
480880	486600	own and you weren't able to code something creatively and you go to a job interview and
486600	490000	I tell you, hey, turn it into this, you won't be able to do that.
490000	494720	You won't be able to make it something custom and you won't even be able to solve the problem
494720	500500	they gave you because all you taught yourself how to do is to follow a tutorial.
500500	506640	So you got the skill of following tutorials, but you did not work on your skill of thinking
506640	511880	and you did not work on your skill of problem solving.
511880	513520	So you're not going to get the job.
513520	516360	You're just going to be stuck.
516360	519320	So this is why, right?
519320	521000	This is so important.
521000	525120	Like, use all this time that you have at your disposal.
525120	535000	If you're washing dishes, learn coding, watch a video, listen to something, okay?
535000	536000	What else is there?
536000	539440	There's, there's dishes, driving.
539440	540440	There's tons of countless.
540440	549080	After cleaning the house, you can be listening or watching something related to coding, okay?
549080	553400	If you drive a truck all the time, that's perfect for listening to audible.
553400	559600	Listen to the story of how Linus Torvalds, you know, built Linux, listen to Elon Musk's
559600	565760	autobiography, listen to books that either personally developed you or make you interested
565760	570280	in coding or straight up podcasts that talk about coding.
570280	574960	I know Wes Boss has a podcast called Syntax and there's a bunch of other ones out there.
574960	576280	I don't care what you pick.
576280	582800	I just care you pick something and you learn and you keep improving your skill because
582800	586720	at the end of the day, it's about the hours that you actually put into the skill and that's
586720	588560	all that comes down to.
588560	593680	If you're not putting, if I have more hours, like assuming our intelligence levels are equal.
593680	598160	So let's say that your intelligence level is here and my intelligence level is here,
598160	599160	okay?
599640	600160	My bad.
600160	601280	I meant to make equal lines.
601280	603120	So these lines are fairly equal, okay?
603120	604880	This is line one and this is two.
604880	605880	They're fairly equal.
605880	613160	Well, we're both going to be pretty much at the same level, right?
613160	620160	But now if you, if we're same amount of talented, but now if you're putting in two times the
620160	626760	time as me to learn coding, you have just two X yourself, okay?
626760	631840	Now if you're brainwashing yourself and watching documentaries, like instead of watching Netflix
631840	635320	at night in your wind down time, maybe you're watching Mr. Robot.
635320	640320	Maybe you're watching a show like Silicon Valley that is entertaining, funny, but still
640320	645680	hypes you up and excites you about coding and programming and you're kind of altering
645680	648520	your reality to become that of a developer.
648520	656280	Now instead of two X in your results, now you have four extra results, okay?
656680	661520	This multiplier can keep increasing if you're taking care of your body and you're sleeping
661520	665440	healthy and you're eating healthy and your body is clean.
665440	671800	And now when you code and learn coding, your memory is stronger because you're able to retain
671800	672800	more information.
672800	677760	You have less fogginess so you can absorb more information and actually apply more information.
677760	682560	Now you've doubled maybe the result of the previous four X multiplier and you've eight
682560	684600	X your results, okay?
684600	688600	Anytime you add a new element, you essentially double your results.
688600	692920	So one is for example, maximizing your time, right?
692920	700400	The other is kind of immersion, which is like what I was calling like brainwashing yourself.
700400	703600	And then, I don't know, what was the third one?
703600	704600	I forgot.
704600	708080	Somebody in the chat will let me know, but I'm not live, so that won't help.
708080	714640	But whatever the third one was, right, that is what gives you that multiplier, each new
714640	719280	thing that you do, oh yeah, body, okay?
719280	727960	With each thing you do, essentially that is a new multiplier and gets you freaking jacked
727960	729120	in your career.
729120	735360	And when we say eight X, well eight X is massive because what eight X really means, we get
735360	740920	out of this, is you're going to achieve in one lifetime the results I will achieve in
740920	742320	eight lifetimes.
742320	749280	You've eight X your results, eight extra career results, you've also eight X shortened your
749280	750280	results that you would get.
750280	755800	So for example, let's say in your coding career, the success you would achieve in 30 years,
755800	757400	well now you've eight X it.
757400	759320	So just divide 30 by eight.
759320	762320	So what's 30 by eight 30?
762320	765760	This is my 30 divided by eight.
765760	769400	That's 3.75, 3.75 years.
769400	776160	So now you're getting 30 years of results in 3.75 years, which is kind of ridiculous when
776160	778720	you put it like that.
778720	781360	But you're essentially getting incredible results.
781360	785280	So then people ask you, hey, how did you get that six figure income so fast?
785280	789800	Hey, how are you able to build these real world applications and you were able to figure
789800	791200	that out so fast?
791200	794760	That's how you have maximized your time.
794760	803360	You've maximized your body and you've maximized how much you believe in it, the immersion.
803360	807640	If you start to now make friends, this also goes towards immersion.
807640	812080	If you now go from friends who talk about Gears of War or Call of Duty or League of
812080	820480	Legends or complain or negativity, now if you replace that with friends who are cool
820480	826180	friends and also talk about coding, that's another multiplier.
826180	829000	That's part of the immersion multiplier.
829000	839400	Now what you've done is you have friends that add value to your life and you have they fasten
839400	843040	to speed up your growth because as you're speaking with them, yes, you're having fun,
843040	846880	you're having a conversation, but you're learning at the same freaking time.
846880	853000	They're real time tutorials that are teaching you, but they're more practical even than
853000	859320	tutorials because tutorials are great, but they will not make you a better developer
859320	864400	a lot of the times because you're stuck there watching somebody else.
864400	866800	You will make progress when you do it.
866800	869640	Even when you watch tutorials, I highly recommend you keep pausing them.
869640	871200	You keep building your own thing.
871200	877960	You keep switching it and changing it until that app is now yours, completely yours, completely
877960	878960	unique.
878960	885360	Or maybe if somebody is building a blogging app, you copy that and turn it into a video
885360	887960	app.
887960	889280	That's how you win.
889280	892280	That's how you will win.
892280	895000	These are some of the things I wanted to share with you.
895000	897680	Maximize your time with coding.
897680	900600	Don't go, wow, I have one hour a day, two hours a day.
900600	901800	It's not going to make you good.
901800	904040	You have to invest a lot of time.
904040	908040	If you have a family, if you have kids, which I know a lot of you do, a lot of the students
908040	911680	that are in our coding bootcamp, I know you.
911680	912680	Hi.
912680	915520	If you're watching this, Urchina, hi.
915520	919440	If any of you are watching this, hello, Brandon.
919440	925160	I understand you have families, you have kids, you have maybe even a job that takes up so
925160	927240	much of your time.
927240	932080	Whenever time is left over, spend it into coding and during your time, you can still
932080	934720	be listening and learning about coding.
934720	940000	You can be literally watching my YouTube videos and hearing me talk about coding.
940000	943760	Even if you're not seeing the screen, even that might help just because you're getting
943760	949000	familiar with the thought patterns, what I'm saying, the lingo.
949000	950320	It makes it less intimidating.
950320	953920	It has a huge impact.
953920	956640	Keep an eye out for that.
956640	958000	That's all I have for you today.
958000	961360	If you enjoyed this video, smash the like button, subscribe to the goddamn channel because
961360	967480	this is the channel where you learn everything react, react native, and also full stack development.
967480	971440	Last thing I want to let you know is that for the cohort of June, we're going to be shutting
971440	976960	down enrollment for our full stack mastery bootcamp in just a few days.
976960	980880	For the June cohort, it starts June 1st and the next five to six days, we're going to
980880	983480	be shutting down enrollment for that.
983480	989640	If you want to learn with me and my team and you want to be in our immersive coding bootcamp
989640	994200	that we just recently launched, it's an incredible bootcamp.
994200	996320	We just dive deep in this bootcamp.
996320	998760	Just a couple of things that you should know.
998760	1004160	It's six to eight months long right now where we are making it even eight months because
1004160	1006320	other bootcamps, they just don't do you justice.
1006320	1009040	In two to three months, you're not going to become a great developer.
1009040	1011680	I'm sorry, but that's just the truth of it.
1011720	1015080	The only people that become successful out of those bootcamps are people who already
1015080	1017160	know coding.
1017160	1021560	This bootcamp is mainly for people who are looking to switch careers or complete beginners
1021560	1023720	and looking to learn all of the skills.
1023720	1028280	If you're more advanced, you will still get your ass kicked and learn a ton of things.
1028280	1030240	You're going to learn data structures and algorithms.
1030240	1033840	We're going to teach you all the front end, back end.
1033840	1035340	You're going to learn everything.
1035340	1039160	If this is something exciting to you and you want to speak with me or my team members
1039160	1045120	about schedule a call with us, in the link below, there's a form.
1045120	1047400	Fill that out in as much detail as possible.
1047400	1050400	Currently, we're mostly working with US students.
1050400	1058360	If you're US, go ahead and apply and fill out the details because we are very selective
1058360	1062760	about the students that we take so we can only take a couple of students at a time.
1062760	1066840	Please fill it out in as much detail as possible so then that gives you a chance for me to
1066840	1070880	pick up and get on a call with you or one of my team members to get on a call with you.
1070880	1071880	We'll just let you know.
1071880	1072880	I'm going to be honest with you.
1072880	1073880	We're going to be honest with you.
1073880	1075360	If it's a good fit for you, we're going to let you know.
1075360	1079480	If it's not a good fit for you, we'll tell you, hey, self-teaching is better for you,
1079480	1080680	so save your money.
1080680	1083320	Hey, this other bootcamp might be better for you.
1083320	1084840	We will just be honest with you.
1084840	1087040	My number one goal is that you actually get a job.
1087040	1088160	You actually increase your skills.
1088160	1089920	My number one goal is not to take your money.
1089920	1090920	I don't care.
1090920	1092320	I want to see you succeed.
1092320	1093720	I love your beautiful face.
1093720	1094720	This is Kazi.
1094720	1097560	As always, I'll see you in the next video.
