00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Look, I get it, most of you are stuck in tutorial hell, a lot of you can't seem to get yourself

00:07.360 --> 00:09.820
out of that.

00:09.820 --> 00:14.160
This is something I was in for the longest time that I can imagine and it's one of those

00:14.160 --> 00:21.000
things that probably frustrated me and just straight up shitted on my career from getting

00:21.000 --> 00:25.920
better for the longest amount of time because all I kept doing was going tutorial after

00:25.920 --> 00:31.400
tutorial and don't lie to me right now because I know you're probably doing that.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.160
There's a high chance of you, whether you're watching clever programmer tutorials and you're

00:35.160 --> 00:40.240
doing build after build or you're watching Udemy or something else out there, whatever

00:40.240 --> 00:47.040
it may be, you are not making a lot of forward progress and what do I mean by forward progress?

00:47.040 --> 00:51.320
What I mean when I say forward progress is really, are you working on projects that

00:51.320 --> 00:57.440
excite you and are you working on stuff where it's useful to you and going on your portfolio?

00:57.440 --> 01:02.760
Are you working on things and are you able to code from scratch and build real world

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
things?

01:03.760 --> 01:10.520
Because if you can't do that, I mean, to be honest, you're kind of screwed, right?

01:10.520 --> 01:18.680
You're not going to be making forward progress, you're going to be kind of just stuck forever.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.360
If I was to show you on the screen, it's kind of like, let me see if I can open this up.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.360
Boom.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.960
So if I was to show you here, you'd be just like running in and this is what most of the

01:31.960 --> 01:34.000
people who are coding, right?

01:34.000 --> 01:39.640
You're just kind of running in circles forever and it seems like there's never any getting

01:39.640 --> 01:40.800
out of there.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.680
Going after tutorial after tutorial and what you want to be able to do is you want to preferably

01:46.680 --> 01:54.000
be able to go in a straight line where your career is moving forward like this, but right

01:54.000 --> 01:58.360
now what's happening is you go to one tutorial, make progress, then you go to another one,

01:58.360 --> 02:02.160
make some progress, then go to another one, and then maybe even start picking up a new

02:02.160 --> 02:06.920
framework where in my opinion, you're making backwards progress sometimes because if you

02:06.920 --> 02:10.060
want to get really, really good, you should just stick to one thing and keep getting better

02:10.060 --> 02:11.060
at it.

02:11.060 --> 02:17.960
So in the start, I personally don't think that you should be learning like basics of

02:17.960 --> 02:23.420
JavaScript and then moving on and trying to learn React and then trying to learn next

02:23.420 --> 02:29.180
JS and trying to learn like all of these other things because instead of making forward progress,

02:29.180 --> 02:33.580
really what you're doing is you're branching out, you make some forward progress with JavaScript,

02:33.580 --> 02:37.620
then you start all over again, make some forward progress with React, then you start all over

02:37.620 --> 02:45.700
again, make some forward progress with what is it, next JS or Tailwind CSS or whatever

02:45.700 --> 02:51.020
is your flavor of the month and you're not really making any forward progress at all.

02:51.020 --> 02:58.620
In reality, what you should be doing is pick up JavaScript and just start coding day one.

02:58.620 --> 03:03.100
And this is day two, code day two.

03:03.100 --> 03:08.660
Then if I keep going, right, this is day three.

03:08.660 --> 03:12.100
And when I say you're coding, I literally mean you are coding.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.260
Like, yes, you can watch tutorials, yes, you can try to pick up exercises, but like code

03:17.260 --> 03:19.980
shit that you could do with whatever you do know.

03:19.980 --> 03:24.540
For example, if you learn if else, make a freaking game out of if else, you can take

03:24.540 --> 03:27.900
if else statements so far.

03:27.900 --> 03:32.380
Make something interactive where if you have an if else block, I can type in something,

03:32.380 --> 03:37.380
a pop up happens, and then I type in, you know, guess you can make guess the number

03:37.380 --> 03:39.020
game with if else statements, right?

03:39.020 --> 03:43.980
If I guess 50 goes too low, then I guess for try 30, and then it goes too high, and then

03:43.980 --> 03:49.020
I guess 40, and then it's like close, and then I'm like 42, and then it goes correct.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.260
You could do so much.

03:50.260 --> 03:54.460
So then do that, and you should be coding or thinking about coding or problem solving

03:54.460 --> 03:57.180
for many hours in a day.

03:57.180 --> 04:04.780
So many of you have this crazy freaking problem with being able to sit there and think and

04:04.780 --> 04:06.820
focus for a long period of time.

04:06.820 --> 04:11.260
If you cannot sit there and think focus for a long period of time, I'm not gonna say you're

04:11.260 --> 04:15.660
not gonna become a coder ever, but like you're gonna have so much more difficulty, right?

04:15.660 --> 04:20.580
Because for example, if you are sitting there and you have trouble focusing, you're making

04:20.580 --> 04:22.540
turtle like progress every day, right?

04:22.540 --> 04:27.460
So like for example, this is you, you make this much progress, and that's all you got

04:27.460 --> 04:28.460
done in day one.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.500
And then day two, you make this much progress, and that's all you got done in day two.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.420
Then you make this much progress, that's your day three, right?

04:35.420 --> 04:39.620
And then you have a freak like me who will code there like a motherfucker and just not

04:39.620 --> 04:44.500
stop, and I'll code for 10, 12, 14 hours, and especially when I was picking it up as

04:44.500 --> 04:48.380
a skill, I was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a day.

04:48.380 --> 04:52.520
So then you have somebody who's not more talented than you, who's not smarter than you, because

04:52.520 --> 04:58.960
I failed my math classes, I sucked at them, but I will sit there and code for that amount

04:58.960 --> 05:04.400
of time, and that's my one day, okay?

05:04.400 --> 05:10.240
And then if we keep going, this is my second day.

05:10.240 --> 05:15.640
I've made this much progress on day two, this is my day one and day two, whereas like for

05:15.640 --> 05:20.480
you and most people, you're gonna be here on day six, right?

05:20.480 --> 05:24.240
What I got done in one day.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.640
Because with coding, unlike, let's say you're doing powerlifting, right?

05:28.640 --> 05:33.600
With powerlifting, okay, yeah, if you deadlift and squat and bench, if you did it for like

05:33.600 --> 05:37.640
more than two or three hours, you'll start to have diminishing returns where you've broken

05:37.640 --> 05:43.760
down your muscles so much, you literally need to give it more time to recover and heal.

05:43.760 --> 05:49.360
With learning, you can learn for 14 hours a day and then go to sleep, let your brain

05:49.360 --> 05:52.560
process that and then wake up the next day and do that again.

05:52.560 --> 05:58.600
With learning, there's nothing that kind of messes you up or is in the way.

05:58.600 --> 06:04.760
With when it comes to powerlifting, you need time for recovery because you're literally

06:04.760 --> 06:08.080
breaking down your muscles, but learning, you can just keep going, okay?

06:08.080 --> 06:11.120
So that's a huge advantage and you can do this.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.720
For example, where else can you do it, okay?

06:13.720 --> 06:19.400
When you're driving your car, can you listen to a podcast about coding?

06:19.400 --> 06:24.600
Boom, there's your extra learning time, okay?

06:24.600 --> 06:28.800
If you drive for one hour, you're like, hey, I have a long commute, great, one to two hours

06:28.800 --> 06:37.800
a day, one to two hours, you are able to now, you're now able to learn coding, okay?

06:37.800 --> 06:42.000
Or learn about coding, which is super, super important.

06:42.280 --> 06:46.400
If there's other things, you're like, hey, I have to use the bathroom, so I just need

06:46.400 --> 06:47.520
to kill that time.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.120
If you're in the bathroom or you're showering or if you're not showering, you're just freaking

06:52.120 --> 06:55.040
going and pooping, right?

06:55.040 --> 06:59.280
You can watch a YouTube video that's talking about code and maybe it's even interesting

06:59.280 --> 07:05.060
or maybe pick something that might excite you, but you need to be doing things that constantly

07:05.060 --> 07:11.400
move you forward, excite you, brainwash you to want to code and makes you want to do things,

07:11.800 --> 07:12.800
right?

07:12.800 --> 07:16.960
Most people, first of all, they'll only code very limited amounts of time.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.800
And second of all, they will never do their own learning.

07:20.800 --> 07:27.520
Most people will just only do the learning that's prescribed to them through whatever

07:27.520 --> 07:32.200
their school tells them to do or whatever their YouTube tutorial tells them to do or

07:32.200 --> 07:35.000
whatever their Udemy tutorial tells you to do.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.480
If you keep doing that, here's what's going to happen.

07:37.480 --> 07:41.320
Let me just make sure the audio is good.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Let's check the audio.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Okay.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
It's looking good there.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
Let's check here.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.320
Beautiful.

07:46.320 --> 07:52.680
So what's going to happen when you do this is that you're just going to be like stuck

07:52.680 --> 07:55.920
and you're just going to be confused and you're not going to make forward progress.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Okay.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.880
And also when you go to a job interview, if you weren't able to turn things into your

08:00.880 --> 08:06.600
own and you weren't able to code something creatively and you go to a job interview and

08:06.600 --> 08:10.000
I tell you, hey, turn it into this, you won't be able to do that.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.720
You won't be able to make it something custom and you won't even be able to solve the problem

08:14.720 --> 08:20.500
they gave you because all you taught yourself how to do is to follow a tutorial.

08:20.500 --> 08:26.640
So you got the skill of following tutorials, but you did not work on your skill of thinking

08:26.640 --> 08:31.880
and you did not work on your skill of problem solving.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.520
So you're not going to get the job.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.360
You're just going to be stuck.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.320
So this is why, right?

08:39.320 --> 08:41.000
This is so important.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.120
Like, use all this time that you have at your disposal.

08:45.120 --> 08:55.000
If you're washing dishes, learn coding, watch a video, listen to something, okay?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
What else is there?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.440
There's, there's dishes, driving.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
There's tons of countless.

09:00.440 --> 09:09.080
After cleaning the house, you can be listening or watching something related to coding, okay?

09:09.080 --> 09:13.400
If you drive a truck all the time, that's perfect for listening to audible.

09:13.400 --> 09:19.600
Listen to the story of how Linus Torvalds, you know, built Linux, listen to Elon Musk's

09:19.600 --> 09:25.760
autobiography, listen to books that either personally developed you or make you interested

09:25.760 --> 09:30.280
in coding or straight up podcasts that talk about coding.

09:30.280 --> 09:34.960
I know Wes Boss has a podcast called Syntax and there's a bunch of other ones out there.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.280
I don't care what you pick.

09:36.280 --> 09:42.800
I just care you pick something and you learn and you keep improving your skill because

09:42.800 --> 09:46.720
at the end of the day, it's about the hours that you actually put into the skill and that's

09:46.720 --> 09:48.560
all that comes down to.

09:48.560 --> 09:53.680
If you're not putting, if I have more hours, like assuming our intelligence levels are equal.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.160
So let's say that your intelligence level is here and my intelligence level is here,

09:58.160 --> 09:59.160
okay?

09:59.640 --> 10:00.160
My bad.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.280
I meant to make equal lines.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.120
So these lines are fairly equal, okay?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.880
This is line one and this is two.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.880
They're fairly equal.

10:05.880 --> 10:13.160
Well, we're both going to be pretty much at the same level, right?

10:13.160 --> 10:20.160
But now if you, if we're same amount of talented, but now if you're putting in two times the

10:20.160 --> 10:26.760
time as me to learn coding, you have just two X yourself, okay?

10:26.760 --> 10:31.840
Now if you're brainwashing yourself and watching documentaries, like instead of watching Netflix

10:31.840 --> 10:35.320
at night in your wind down time, maybe you're watching Mr. Robot.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.320
Maybe you're watching a show like Silicon Valley that is entertaining, funny, but still

10:40.320 --> 10:45.680
hypes you up and excites you about coding and programming and you're kind of altering

10:45.680 --> 10:48.520
your reality to become that of a developer.

10:48.520 --> 10:56.280
Now instead of two X in your results, now you have four extra results, okay?

10:56.680 --> 11:01.520
This multiplier can keep increasing if you're taking care of your body and you're sleeping

11:01.520 --> 11:05.440
healthy and you're eating healthy and your body is clean.

11:05.440 --> 11:11.800
And now when you code and learn coding, your memory is stronger because you're able to retain

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
more information.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.760
You have less fogginess so you can absorb more information and actually apply more information.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.560
Now you've doubled maybe the result of the previous four X multiplier and you've eight

11:22.560 --> 11:24.600
X your results, okay?

11:24.600 --> 11:28.600
Anytime you add a new element, you essentially double your results.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.920
So one is for example, maximizing your time, right?

11:32.920 --> 11:40.400
The other is kind of immersion, which is like what I was calling like brainwashing yourself.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.600
And then, I don't know, what was the third one?

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
I forgot.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.080
Somebody in the chat will let me know, but I'm not live, so that won't help.

11:48.080 --> 11:54.640
But whatever the third one was, right, that is what gives you that multiplier, each new

11:54.640 --> 11:59.280
thing that you do, oh yeah, body, okay?

11:59.280 --> 12:07.960
With each thing you do, essentially that is a new multiplier and gets you freaking jacked

12:07.960 --> 12:09.120
in your career.

12:09.120 --> 12:15.360
And when we say eight X, well eight X is massive because what eight X really means, we get

12:15.360 --> 12:20.920
out of this, is you're going to achieve in one lifetime the results I will achieve in

12:20.920 --> 12:22.320
eight lifetimes.

12:22.320 --> 12:29.280
You've eight X your results, eight extra career results, you've also eight X shortened your

12:29.280 --> 12:30.280
results that you would get.

12:30.280 --> 12:35.800
So for example, let's say in your coding career, the success you would achieve in 30 years,

12:35.800 --> 12:37.400
well now you've eight X it.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.320
So just divide 30 by eight.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.320
So what's 30 by eight 30?

12:42.320 --> 12:45.760
This is my 30 divided by eight.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.400
That's 3.75, 3.75 years.

12:49.400 --> 12:56.160
So now you're getting 30 years of results in 3.75 years, which is kind of ridiculous when

12:56.160 --> 12:58.720
you put it like that.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.360
But you're essentially getting incredible results.

13:01.360 --> 13:05.280
So then people ask you, hey, how did you get that six figure income so fast?

13:05.280 --> 13:09.800
Hey, how are you able to build these real world applications and you were able to figure

13:09.800 --> 13:11.200
that out so fast?

13:11.200 --> 13:14.760
That's how you have maximized your time.

13:14.760 --> 13:23.360
You've maximized your body and you've maximized how much you believe in it, the immersion.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.640
If you start to now make friends, this also goes towards immersion.

13:27.640 --> 13:32.080
If you now go from friends who talk about Gears of War or Call of Duty or League of

13:32.080 --> 13:40.480
Legends or complain or negativity, now if you replace that with friends who are cool

13:40.480 --> 13:46.180
friends and also talk about coding, that's another multiplier.

13:46.180 --> 13:49.000
That's part of the immersion multiplier.

13:49.000 --> 13:59.400
Now what you've done is you have friends that add value to your life and you have they fasten

13:59.400 --> 14:03.040
to speed up your growth because as you're speaking with them, yes, you're having fun,

14:03.040 --> 14:06.880
you're having a conversation, but you're learning at the same freaking time.

14:06.880 --> 14:13.000
They're real time tutorials that are teaching you, but they're more practical even than

14:13.000 --> 14:19.320
tutorials because tutorials are great, but they will not make you a better developer

14:19.320 --> 14:24.400
a lot of the times because you're stuck there watching somebody else.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.800
You will make progress when you do it.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.640
Even when you watch tutorials, I highly recommend you keep pausing them.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.200
You keep building your own thing.

14:31.200 --> 14:37.960
You keep switching it and changing it until that app is now yours, completely yours, completely

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
unique.

14:38.960 --> 14:45.360
Or maybe if somebody is building a blogging app, you copy that and turn it into a video

14:45.360 --> 14:47.960
app.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.280
That's how you win.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.280
That's how you will win.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.000
These are some of the things I wanted to share with you.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.680
Maximize your time with coding.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.600
Don't go, wow, I have one hour a day, two hours a day.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.800
It's not going to make you good.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.040
You have to invest a lot of time.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.040
If you have a family, if you have kids, which I know a lot of you do, a lot of the students

15:08.040 --> 15:11.680
that are in our coding bootcamp, I know you.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
Hi.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.520
If you're watching this, Urchina, hi.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.440
If any of you are watching this, hello, Brandon.

15:19.440 --> 15:25.160
I understand you have families, you have kids, you have maybe even a job that takes up so

15:25.160 --> 15:27.240
much of your time.

15:27.240 --> 15:32.080
Whenever time is left over, spend it into coding and during your time, you can still

15:32.080 --> 15:34.720
be listening and learning about coding.

15:34.720 --> 15:40.000
You can be literally watching my YouTube videos and hearing me talk about coding.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.760
Even if you're not seeing the screen, even that might help just because you're getting

15:43.760 --> 15:49.000
familiar with the thought patterns, what I'm saying, the lingo.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.320
It makes it less intimidating.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.920
It has a huge impact.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.640
Keep an eye out for that.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.000
That's all I have for you today.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.360
If you enjoyed this video, smash the like button, subscribe to the goddamn channel because

16:01.360 --> 16:07.480
this is the channel where you learn everything react, react native, and also full stack development.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.440
Last thing I want to let you know is that for the cohort of June, we're going to be shutting

16:11.440 --> 16:16.960
down enrollment for our full stack mastery bootcamp in just a few days.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.880
For the June cohort, it starts June 1st and the next five to six days, we're going to

16:20.880 --> 16:23.480
be shutting down enrollment for that.

16:23.480 --> 16:29.640
If you want to learn with me and my team and you want to be in our immersive coding bootcamp

16:29.640 --> 16:34.200
that we just recently launched, it's an incredible bootcamp.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.320
We just dive deep in this bootcamp.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.760
Just a couple of things that you should know.

16:38.760 --> 16:44.160
It's six to eight months long right now where we are making it even eight months because

16:44.160 --> 16:46.320
other bootcamps, they just don't do you justice.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.040
In two to three months, you're not going to become a great developer.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.680
I'm sorry, but that's just the truth of it.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.080
The only people that become successful out of those bootcamps are people who already

16:55.080 --> 16:57.160
know coding.

16:57.160 --> 17:01.560
This bootcamp is mainly for people who are looking to switch careers or complete beginners

17:01.560 --> 17:03.720
and looking to learn all of the skills.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.280
If you're more advanced, you will still get your ass kicked and learn a ton of things.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.240
You're going to learn data structures and algorithms.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.840
We're going to teach you all the front end, back end.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.340
You're going to learn everything.

17:15.340 --> 17:19.160
If this is something exciting to you and you want to speak with me or my team members

17:19.160 --> 17:25.120
about schedule a call with us, in the link below, there's a form.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.400
Fill that out in as much detail as possible.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.400
Currently, we're mostly working with US students.

17:30.400 --> 17:38.360
If you're US, go ahead and apply and fill out the details because we are very selective

17:38.360 --> 17:42.760
about the students that we take so we can only take a couple of students at a time.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.840
Please fill it out in as much detail as possible so then that gives you a chance for me to

17:46.840 --> 17:50.880
pick up and get on a call with you or one of my team members to get on a call with you.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.880
We'll just let you know.

17:51.880 --> 17:52.880
I'm going to be honest with you.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.880
We're going to be honest with you.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.360
If it's a good fit for you, we're going to let you know.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.480
If it's not a good fit for you, we'll tell you, hey, self-teaching is better for you,

17:59.480 --> 18:00.680
so save your money.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.320
Hey, this other bootcamp might be better for you.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.840
We will just be honest with you.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.040
My number one goal is that you actually get a job.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.160
You actually increase your skills.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.920
My number one goal is not to take your money.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.920
I don't care.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.320
I want to see you succeed.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.720
I love your beautiful face.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
This is Kazi.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.560
As always, I'll see you in the next video.
