Hi, welcome to the Origins Podcast. I'm your host Lawrence Kraus. I'm extremely
excited about this episode with Jordan Peterson. Jordan and I did an episode of
his podcast some time ago during which he peppered me with questions and we
decided we do a second podcast where I could return the favor for the most
part. And in this discussion that we had I was able to probe a lot of aspects
that I've tried to understand about Jordan's writing and his thinking, some
of which I found difficult to appreciate. And we talked about his own
background as interested in becoming a psychologist and also studies in addiction
and personality. And then we moved to a topic that we both decided we wanted to
focus on which was that in some sense the nature of meaning based on his book
Maps of Meaning. And I wanted to parse some of the ideas that he he talks about
there a little more carefully which we did and talked about things from
existential threats to values and what you mean by values to the nature of
narrative and life as storytelling. It was a wide-ranging discussion including
also discussing such things as how to do research in a time era of PC
commandments that make that research difficult. I particularly enjoyed the
discussion and I think many of you who might have listened to Jordan before
will find a new side of Jordan here as we try to explore in-depth the ideas
behind what he some what he talks about and where he's coming from. So I hope
you enjoy this as much as I did. For those of you who are watching this on

Peterson. Well welcome Jordan it's great to have you now on my podcast after I was
on yours it's really great to have a chance to talk to you again. Well thank
you I'm really looking forward to it and I hope you are. I should say that this
has perhaps been for me one of the most difficult and exasperating and furating
preparations for podcasts I've had to do. I have enough notes here for about 21
hours. We won't go more than two but I know I have a lot because there's so
much to parse. So what made it difficult and exasperating? It's kind of a
compliment. It is. I want to give a preface because I want to be
in full disclosure about how I've come to understand you before and after
and after our last meeting. I'm often certain I know for a long time when I've
read you that I'm not sure I understand what you're saying just in the reading.
I've had a hard time understanding what you're saying or at least whether it's
me or the or the or the work and before I met you there's a line from the Dick
Van Dyke show from Carl Reiner that I always remember where he said one on the
surface seems vague is in reality meaningless. And when I read a lot of
the stuff I thought well this is vague I don't exactly know where it's coming
from and as I read you and now I've been reading in preparation for this I've
been reading you in depth. I've read you before. I alternate between this sense
of some things I think are just clearly true but they kind of seem like
truisms like I often wonder whether when I first my first reaction at 12
Rules for Life was maybe it should be 12 pages. I mean the Ten Commandments was
one tablet and and and and whether one you know it's a long book and you
taught you you know you write and you write you write a lot it's just the
property of the way right and that and and and then sometimes there were
illusions and discussions that I really couldn't comprehend or I thought were
vague sometimes there were insights and there are insights that seem incredibly
deep and profound and true that you're reaching towards and I find them
fascinating and sometimes there are statements that I disagree with completely
so I alternate between all of that and it's been and it's and it's a
fascinating way to go. I was naturally skeptical before I before we had our
dialogue. I want to tell you that. A skeptical physicist? Yes. Really? Exactly.
But I was skeptical of you because I couldn't understand a lot of it and
and and um there were lots of there were lots of reasons but I've been
primarily was that Carl Reiner quote that kept me in the back of my head.
But after our last dialogue I totally changed my view because you your
questions were deep and interesting and curious and what I became convinced of
was that you are a man who's seriously wants to understand
the world and engage in conversation and I and it switched and my respect for
you just went through the roof as a result because that that conversation
demonstrated to me that you're earnest and serious in your desire to
understand the world and then I decided to look at what you wrote in a
different way and try and seriously understand it.
So that's um uh you know I hadn't expected that and the strong connection
that I do feel uh as an academic and as a human being towards you which is
which is a wonderful thing because I love I love being wrong
and or at least I love having my viewpoints change
and they certainly did after our discussion so I wanted to in full
disclosure I want to say I came into our first discussion
as a complete skeptic and more so maybe maybe even
suspicious and then um and then um then it changed
but um I'm very glad to hear that and and it is good to
it is good to be wrong and find that out unless everything in your life is so
perfect that it's clear that you know everything
and you know yeah yeah well we now the other thing I want to do
I want to give you a chance to ask some questions too because I enjoy your
questions and I know in some of our email dialogues
back and forth between there's some I know there's some things you've been
reading that you want to about cosmology they want to talk about so I
want to I'll give you a chance to ask some of
those after in the latter part or maybe if there's a
relevant point in the middle you can bring it up and feel free to ask the
question in the middle as far as I'm concerned I know the thing is about
fine tuning and yeah and and and and or universe before our universe there's a
number of things also I want to for the listeners I
want to preface this because what what we discussed you asked me really
said the thing you want to discuss with me was mostly maps of meaning
and that's what I've now focused on and in particular
what you suggested I really passed carefully was
from the new book Beyond Order rule 11 and so that's what I've done just so
you're aware I've tried to try so the discussion I want to have and you've
written a lot of different things will be primarily about those things but of
course it'll it'll overlap with other other things but that's
where the the discussion is going to focus on and can you remind me what rule
11 was I'm having some memory troubles so that's
all right I mean I can never remember what I write
the day after I do either and the thing is about rule 11
like many things in the one I read you is that the title of rule 11
it only by the end of it I kind of vaguely understood where the title came
from rule 11 really seems to me to be a summary
of maps of meaning in fact but it's do not allow yourself to become resentful
deceitful or arrogant oh yes and and really that
and those and and as you and as I now understand
understanding from having read you that the sources of those
of those three ills are really related to the sources of the problems of
dealing with the the the meaning the map of meaning
in a sense and so that's why it was a good place I think for you to direct me
to yes I remember why now yep okay
but before before we get to those because it is an origins podcast I want
to go into your origins because I know some of the things but I have some
questions about this so you know I know you're very
interested in fact in some sense in my mind origins I mean
I mean maps of meaning is really about the origins of the psyche in some sense
but I want to understand the origins of your psyche first so that's where I want
to go born in Edmonton yes okay
and what what what what influence did what what did your parents do
my dad was a teacher of what it and my mother was a nurse trained as a nurse
and then she worked as a librarian in that was mostly her career was a
librarian at the local college and my dad was a teacher for most of the
time I was at home a high school teacher or a no junior high
teacher or elementary school teacher grade six he was the
vice principal of our local elementary school and he taught me when I was in
grade six some classes oh that must have been an interesting
experience itself it was extremely interesting
both for good and not good yeah I know I can imagine it's difficult I
I once taught my daughter took a summer course in physics
and and I taught her and it was really fascinating for me because I saw a very
different side of her in class she was very different as a student than she
was as a daughter I imagine your father was a very
different teacher than he was as a father or maybe no no he was pretty much
well tell you a story about my dad in grade six and so you know by grade six
kids are pretty noisy and horrible and yeah they get really bad in grade seven
but by grade six they're already pretty bad and
my homeroom teacher was not my dad he was the print
my homeroom teacher was the principal my dad taught math
and for for at least 10 minutes before he walked in to teach our math class
no one said anything they were quiet yeah my dad was not someone you messed
around with and so and he was like that at home too
like he's a tough guy my dad and and and he's a good teacher he's a
very good teacher he taught me to read when I was very young and
spent a tremendous amount of time with me but he was not someone you
you trifled with lightly and all the kids knew that
he had that kind of authority that's rare actually but necessary for teachers
and he didn't really have to ever resort to any kind of
discipline other than that underlying threat of absolute mayhem that was there
all the time and so and so that that had some trouble for me
because some of this kids didn't really like him
even though they respected them and now and then they took that out on me
but you know whatever yeah there's all sorts of things that happen when you're a
kid yeah character it's all character building and as we'll
talk about both you and I agree that you know some bad things happening is an
important part of your life and and and that you shouldn't be
shielded from it did did so was did your dad sort of practice
tough love I mean because I kind of you know that's sort of in some sense
one gets a sense that he didn't suffer fools gladly
okay and so so yes I would say he did do that he had very high
high standards and although he's also extremely good with little kids my
dad was really had a great hand with kids from say
well two to twelve he was he wasn't so fond of teenagers and
you know you can understand why well yes yes
but he's great with little kids he was he's still alive and he's great with
Mike he was great with my kids too oh that's great so
so I don't know he has this genuine
unbelievably genuine love for little kids you know and and it's a cool thing to
see in someone who's so fundamentally tough you know my dad's a hunter and a
trapper and and a sharp shooter and uh wow
canoeer and yeah so he's the sort of guy yeah yeah I was too soft hearted
really to hunt I did trap with him but even that
because I'm temperamentally I'm very high in compassion and so
that sort of thing was hard on me we didn't see exactly eye to eye
temperamentally there he taught me to shoot I can shoot pretty well
not as well as him he was a provincial level
shooter and our house was full of guns it's like 400 rifles and yeah my
wife's father was like that he taught her how to he had she had guns from the
time she was young he taught her how to shoot and how to take care of them
responsibly and and I guess she she was shooting
with him for ducks but she drew the line she didn't want to do deer
eventually couldn't do that did did do you think
you know I'm that influence of that tough love I mean when I
here in some sense one even before I knew much about you
I knew of in some sense you were preaching tough love
in a way you know man up you know basically get over it
get over it get over it and just move on well you know it's not really true
what I was pointing out more was the danger of regarding yourself as a victim
and a lot of that was it a lot of that was influenced by my reading of Freud
in particular because Freud was very concerned about the pathology of the
devouring mother and you see that in Jung as well but
Freud really came up with that insight to begin with and that
an excess of compassion is destructive and I see that manifesting itself in
victim mentality and what that does to people and I also see it as a
manifestation of the female proclivity towards authoritarianism
now it's funny to think of that as a manifestation of compassion but
we don't know much about female political pathology right because
females haven't been involved in in the political sphere for that long and but
in a modern world in the ancient world they were well exactly yes yes yes
but to think that there's no tilt towards pathology that's specifically
feminine is well that's naive it's foolish and
to not think that an excess of compassion
can be a catastrophe is to be blind and so and the Freudians were very I think
it's a quote from Freud or at least one of his
astute followers that the good mother necessarily fails
and so what I see so it's not so much tough love I would say is that
the proper balance for a child is something like an embrace right that's
the maternal embrace and that's absolutely necessary and encouragement to
transform and that's more the paternal territory now
both parents can play a role in those two territories I'm speaking more
symbolically in some sense but you know women are tilted towards
compassion temperamentally they're higher in trait compassion than men on
average there's individual variability that's quite
substantial but a very building my wife is more
more encourages encouraging of transformation and I'm well she's
also probably more compassionate too than me and she probably has both traits
more than me yeah well I'm at least in terms of
agreeableness and probably negative emotion I have quite a
feminine temperament and so I'm probably more agreeable than my wife I think
when we took my personality test that was the case
and so we're a bit mixed on that front when when kids used to come over and
visit my kids we used to have a talk with the
kids when they come over teenagers is like we're really happy you're here and
and you're welcome here but if you do anything stupid and we never see you
again that would be just fine so and that worked pretty well and
when they first came to my house they were always more scared of me but after
they came about five times they were more scared of my wife
so there you go I can see that now let me let me the other question you know
that comes to mind when I hear about your father and I didn't plan to go this way
and I'm certainly not blind trying to psychoanalyze you because I couldn't
but did he affect did he did his teaching style
affect your teaching style you've been a teacher for a long time did
do you my understanding is that you're not a teacher that
that your students are afraid of rather they they think you're rather
compassionate but but do you think they were quiet before they came into your
classroom that's a good question I don't know
if my dad's teaching style overtly affected me I think all the
interactions he had with me when he was teaching me to read did
and I think his attitude towards learning did and his
and his fundamental sense of encouragement like I always knew and
this made me very rare among my friends by the way because most of them have
pretty pathological relationships with their fathers where I grew up in northern
Alberta my dad I knew he always had my back
even when we were at an odds with one another fundamentally and even when he
was displeased with me it was almost always you know barring
human frailty because he was disappointed that I wasn't
living up to the high standards he expected of me
and they were high and and sometimes I think they were perhaps
unreasonably high it's very hard to say because it's not that easy to figure
out how to balance that embracing compassion with
that the compliment that high standards truly are right I mean
that's a tough thing to get right and now my mom I really I always got along
really well with my mom and I could make her laugh she's a lovely person
she's very easy to be around and so so I was fortunate my parents because
the toughness of my father was quite nicely counterbalanced by the warmth
of my mother and so you know I was fortunate in that regard
and many others but certainly that now you
eventually became an academic and a practicing
psychologist clinical psychologist did they encourage
did they have well did they encourage your reading your academics oh yes
okay oh yes books were very important in my family and I learned when I was four
like books were at the top of the list and I used to virtually every night
when I was 10 9 10 11 I read a book a day
science fiction my neighbor across the alley had a huge science fiction
collection and he used to just let me go in there and take like 15 books and
then I bring them back in two weeks and take 15 more and so I was reading a book
a day up until I think all the way through high
school I started reading more literature in junior high
a librarian there who was a pretty educated woman by the standards of our
hometown sort of tilted me towards genuine literature and that's when I
started reading I would say seriously and so I was 13 when that happened
so but yes books were very important in our household you read science fiction
literature did you read any much nonfiction or was to primarily
fiction when you were younger it was mostly fiction when I was younger
yeah yeah no I didn't switch to nonfiction till I
well I said after I read Dostoevsky when I was in my
early 20s almost all fiction seemed sort of
bloodless and but also by that time I was starting my research career and I
got a lot more interested in nonfiction I also think that's a
maturation issue and I'm not saying that in a
like in a negative sense towards fiction is that at some point it just didn't
have the same attraction for me as nonfiction started to and so yeah
no I know the feeling I mean I'm trying to relate it because I
I think it's incredibly important and useful I mean I read
well I had more time it seemed to me then but I read that's all I just read an
incredible amount when I was younger all the time that's what I did during the
summer even during just reading it was a way to
get away from the family too I just would immerse myself in reading
and you're right it was mostly um well there was some science fiction
and and and literature but I the one of the reasons I asked
you this is because it's not surprising to me
that because in some sense you you're arguing
that that all of understanding comes from stories
in a way yeah yeah well that's the thing about surprising that you were
you know that your own understanding began with stories I think psychologically
it seems it makes sense yeah well and also that switched to
nonfiction let's say did dovetail with my I started to be much more analytic
in relationship to fiction at some point especially when I started
thinking as a clinical psychologist and a research psychologist I got more
interested in well oh yeah these are stories well
stories are a particular kind of information okay well
what are they exactly what's going on there psychologically and
I was doing a lot of reading at that point too uh at the
neurophysiology level and and and animal behavioral biology
essentially a lot of it about perception and I came to realize that
the most advanced uh researchers into perception
were essentially making the argument that we actually look at the world through
a story and that really that was really
quite the key insight I really developed that insight when I was reading
Jeffrey Gray's book the Neuropsychology of Anxiety and he doesn't ever say that
we perceive through a story but the frame that he used to describe
perception was a narrative frame and so that was
extremely interesting to me it was a key insight
but yeah no well that's I wonder where you got that I mean that's
again that seems to be a central one of your central
theses is that the world is seeing we see the world of stories and that's what
determines their meaning and we'll get into that but
but I it's interesting that it came that realization came later but your own
interest in stories was really generic I mean it was not
by nature you were interested in stories as a young person
yeah well and it's so interesting how powerful that interest is
among young people I mean it's easy to teach a kid anything if you
embedded in a story and then even later when I was writing like when I was
writing my more popular books I also knew by that time
technically that facts inside stories were much more effective
and so the story well partly I think because we also remember in stories
and and stories are about action and we're really interested in action so
yeah well now the
it's interesting because it's kind of sad in a way that people get
I remember my daughter stopped being interested in reading because she was
forced to read books that she went in I guess probably
middle school but read books that she hated in school and and and yeah taught
by people who hated books yeah and and and her own love of therefore
our own love of reading as something you do as a
or stories as something you do for pleasure
you know went away and that was that was that's sad I remember in grade eight
this just drove me crazy at this I usually read the whole
language arts curriculum for the year in
the first day oh really wow and so yeah yeah it was
I was very fast reader and I remember who had a teacher in grade eight and I
said I told her I think two days in I said I already read all these books what
should I do she said read them again oh god I thought
yeah oh god is right like in a major way it's really that's your bloody attitude
you can't give me another book so I used to put books behind the books I was
supposed to be reading and just read them and
yeah there's a delinquent reading that was my specialty yes right there's I
remember that I'm runs me of a famous um uh I don't know whether it was from
movie or whatever about a kid who you know normally they've got playboy
behind their their math book but he basically he had his
serious books in behind playboy so yeah right right exactly um okay you went
interestingly so your parents who encourage they
did they encourage you to consider being an academic or they just encourage you
to just go wherever you want it to follow whatever was yes yes
now I was interested that you went to what looked like a community college
before you went to university is that yes was that I'm surprised unless that
was a normal trajectory where you're from it was
well the normal trajectory where I was from was to drop out of school in grade
nine and go work on oil rigs and so you know going to college
it was expected in my family it was an implicit expectation that I would go to
college university the level that was different my dad and my mom both had
bachelor's degrees and I don't think there was anybody in
either of their family that had ever advanced past that and so
that wasn't part of the landscape right and that wasn't for me even
until I was through my degree I never considered going further I didn't
read even in some sense I didn't really even understand
the distinction between bachelor's masters and phd you know because I
hadn't met anybody I don't think by that point that had
a master's degree not not in fairview there might have been some but there
weren't very many so fair fairview is a small town
outside of Edmonton is it 400 miles north yeah way outside oh it's I
I thought you lived in Edmonton so I okay yeah no no no that makes much more
sense than that I was wondering why in a big city your father would be your
teacher but if you're a small town that often happens yeah maybe it was just
scraped out of the prairie 50 years beforehand it was the end of the
railway it was the northern most reach of the
prairies and the last place settled likely really settled in North America
okay that makes a more sense than that you would have gone to a community
college first and but both your parents said
we're obviously not from there they both had my neither my parents happened as
it worked out I have either got graduated high school
so but but your parents had both gone to university in Alberta yes
okay Saskatchewan Saskatchewan and then they moved up there to work
they were yes okay now so okay so they they said go what you want to do and
then you took but your interest in psychology wasn't
originally a case you studied political science
in literature and um and there's a and you you fell out of love with with
political science I I there's a there's a there's a
discussion here somewhere in in in in fact maps of meaning as you
talk about losing interest in political science
yeah well the thing is I was really interested in well I was interested in
politics to begin with I ran for the vice presidency of the socialist party
NDP in Alberta when I was 14 oh really and
yeah yeah I was quite quite engaged in politics when I was a kid
and I was I've always considered in the back of my mind a political career but
it has always fought against I would say my more aesthetic
and psychological interests and they've always won
and with political science I when I went to that community college where I got a
great education by the way the teachers are really good the
professor really good and they really we had little tiny
seminars five or six people in the first year
and oh they all love to teach I had like six great professors so it was
wonderful it was wonderful man and I like political
science to begin with because we were reading philosophical classics
you know and but then as I advanced in political science
there was this implicit assumption that people's values
essentially that were motivated by economic interest and I thought yeah but
why are we motivated by economic interest I was interested in something
under that that was never discussed by the political scientists their axiomatic
presupposition was pseudo marxist in some sense you know that our fundamental
motivations are economic and that's true because we don't want to starve to death
but but it's not wasn't true enough for me for the questions I was interested in
and what I was really started to dominate my interest was war and atrocity
and I just became obsessed by that now that's interesting to me because
what by the way what I'm going to do throughout this discussion if I can
is I'm going to refer I'm going to quote you on because then oh god don't do that
I am because then I'm going to ask you to explain to me what it means sometimes
okay but but but um but this early on in maths and meaning you
actually discuss this in a way that I think is relevant to understanding
the importance of meaning for you said I could not believe it's this
resonates with what you just said I could not believe and still do not
believe that commodities natural resources for example had intrinsic and
self-evident value in the absence of such value the
worth of things had to be socially or culturally
or even individually determined this act of determination appeared to me moral
appeared to me to be a consequence of the moral philosophy adopted by the
society culture a person in question what people valued economically
merely reflected what they believed to be important this meant that
my real that real motivation had to lie in the domain of value of morality
the political scientists I studied did not see this and did not think was
relevant well that when I read that of course
that's a way better answer to the one I gave you well sometimes when one
writes things one thinks about them a little more carefully
but but I find it enlightening because it's
it not just because it reflects your view of political science
but it clearly reflects the underlying view you're trying to get across in what
you're saying in what you're saying throughout massive
meaning as far as I could tell throughout everything that
that that there is that that objects themselves have no meaning
but we ascribe meaning to things and it's based on a variety of things which
we're getting into some of which are cultural and
in basis and so I was surprised I was interested to see that your
your your disillusionment with with political science was due to the some
in some sense an emerging idea which probably wasn't even yet conscious in
your mind that you eventually produced in maps of
meaning and some of the other things you've been writing about
yeah well I mean people obviously fight in wars sometimes over economic issues
but they also fight wars over religious issues
and they do that a lot more I think of course right and right now our political
trouble in the west I believe is religious fundamentally and we can get
into that what I mean by that because I mean that
psychologically I try not to actually speak religiously
because I think it muddies the water most of the time
I'd rather speak psychologically and we could get into that distinction too and
anyways I had the sense that no there's something much deeper here
underneath the surface which which the political scientists are
treating as an axiomatic fact and not investigating so
and then I well that's what led me into psychology
really so that I was going to say eventually so you first
but the first degree you did was political science right
you did I did a three-year degree that was political science and literature
then I worked for a year then I took nothing but psychology
you decided that you came back I was impressed so you have two BAs as it is
yes yes rather than two BS's I guess yeah I probably have 10 of those
um well yeah so I want to get to your emerging interest psychology but you
interested you said you were fascinated by war yet at the same time
you said you're you was more atrocity it was more of the Nazi thing was really
and yeah and then later that what happened in the Soviet Union and China but
it was the it was the Nazi concentration camp issue that really
it just wouldn't go away for me it just and I don't know why like that happened
at 13 though I wrote I remember I wrote an essay in grade seven
on the concentration camps and there was a Jewish dentist in our town who had a
tattoo from from the camps and he was my dentist and I had seen the tattoo
and I asked him if I could talk to him about and he said no and you know fair
enough but that interest was there at 13
so yeah and it's not weird eh I mean who knows what what hooks you way down deep
and where that comes from I mean part of it was you should know more than me
yeah well our deepest intuitions they guide us rather
than being under our control and they're deeply rooted in our temperament
our biology and and in things we certainly don't understand part of it was
kind of an obsession about the Cold War and thermonuclear catastrophe
you know and that was pretty typical of my generation how old are you
I'm a little older than you I'm 67 so I guess I'm five years older than you or
something yeah same same thing though right and so
that was always lurking in the background and my friends and I used to talk
about that a fair bit and so but but and then I guess when I started
thinking about that more deeply that led me into what had happened in World War
two and and then it was what happened in the camps
especially that or tended to that proclivity to eradicate
and I was interested in that psychologically not not politically
precisely at the level of the individual and that's
always been that's I think why I never did go after a political career I just
got way more interested in the individual level of analysis
now but you but interestingly of course you made as a number of people do
that you were and you you were sort of socialist and then
moved away and you said you're conservative by nature
interestingly you said that Orwell influenced you in that regard but Orwell
also was fascinated by atrocity and and so and impacted so
is that what attracted you Orwell in the first place or or or not
well part of I think what attracted me to Orwell was that he's just such a
great writer yeah he is he's such a great writer
especially as an essayist non-fiction writer road to Wigan pair is just a
deadly book and it's the sort of book that's very attractive to intelligent
socialists because like those working class people man
you think your life is rough you should read those people had to
like crawl to work underground in the coal mines in tunnels that they couldn't
stand up straight in for two miles before they got to work
yeah right so it's an amazing book but Orwell was a very
astute critic of socialist thinking as well
although he was also very sympathetic to it so I loved reading Orwell and well
interestingly I want to pick up on one thing which I read
because I want you to have a chance to in some sense respond but
um so you would said somewhere that Orwell basically
got you thinking about turned you off from socialism because he
became convinced he basically convinced you that
socialists themselves didn't care about poor people they just didn't like rich
well look I went to a lot of these NDP conventions new democratic party
conventions and I had like a front row seat because the librarian
was the wife of our MLA our legislative assembly member
he was the only socialist in Alberta and the only person who was in opposition
for like 15 years and he was voted in by the people in my constituency not
because they were socialist but because he was really a good man
and so I met the Premier of Saskatchewan I met
Ed Broadbent who was the leader of the NDP in Canada
and Labour leaders and I got to sit and listen to them talk and sometimes
sing old you know union songs and a lot of them were they were admirable
people a lot of them and they really cared about the working class it wasn't
it wasn't a facade and they were honest and I don't remember any of those
discussions where I thought something was off but
at the conventions there were often demonstrations and there were a lot of
low-level activists of the sort who became woke the woke crowd later
and I just kind of recoiled from them psychologically and then at the same
time and I talk about this in maps of meaning a bit I was sitting on the
Board of Governors at that local community college and
there was all these self-made guys there most of them were immigrants because
there was an immigrant place and they were all conservative
politically and temperamentally and I really respected them
and so that really put a lot of existential angst into me because on the
one hand you know intellectually I was attracted to the socialist ideas
and maybe on compassionate grounds too who knows
but then I had this countervailing tendency which was well yeah but I don't
really like the activist types they really drive me crazy
and I respect these guys so that was hard on me I didn't know exactly
what to do and then well then what I did do is I realized that I didn't know
anything that's what happened and that was my roommate
who taught me that you know he was he'd kicked around a lot he was a little
older than me still a really good friend of mine
he's tough guy came from an even smaller town than me
rough upbringing real cowboy type tough as a boot he came back to college and
got literate and we had some good talks continually one of the things he said to
me was you know that ideology of yours that just
doesn't explain the world and I thought by then I kind of knew
that but that really crystallized it for me and then I also realized that I
thought I knew way more than I actually did because I had
imbued that ideology and it gave me a map right of everything
yeah but then I realized well look you haven't had a family I had worked a lot
by then because I started working out very young but there was just I just
didn't know anything to speak of and then so then I thought well
I'm never going to consider a political career until I'm a competent person
because I could have had a political career I knew it when I was like 17
so no I can see it yeah I can see you so you certainly have a
you you went yeah you I could see it your way of capturing people into
and in your in your discussions and and um but okay so that it was more
the people there because you know there was there's a you you probably know of
this rather scathing review of you by Nathan Robinson and
oh yes he's fun and um but he his argument was well
you didn't understand or Orwell because he said you know yeah right
Orwell turned you off from it and Orwell's whole point was you shouldn't
not like socialism but just because you don't like socialists
and oh no that wasn't Orwell's whole point or one of Orwell's points was
you should be skeptical of people who say they're acting in the best interests
of others and are also simultaneously on after power
yeah so yeah I don't think I misunderstood Orwell and I
you know and Robinson can think that if he wants if that's comforting but
I don't think so I want to give you a chance take a response to that okay yeah
so but but but so um look it's not like I'm not
sensitive to left-wing concerns no of course I understand
look I am part of the reason I really don't like left-wing ideologues is
because they don't take the issue of inequality seriously enough
yeah they think it's a consequence of capitalism it's like
no it's way worse than that it's way deeper than that
and that's a big problem because it is a problem inequality
and if it's so deep that even getting rid of capitalism won't solve it like
it's a real existential problem and it's threatened many societies with
with complete chaos so but that's not the solution
like it's capitalism that causes inequalities like no that's stupid
yeah no sorry it's too able to label things uh and we'll get in it well
people yeah well Lawrence you might know you might know do you know about the
work of the econophysicists I know of some of it I I have been
like many things skeptical yeah well fair enough you know but
but there are physicists who've modeled such things as the distribution of
money into a society using the same equations that they use to describe the
distribution of gas into an atmosphere diffusion yeah
yeah yeah so it's really well it points to something
way deep down right and that's something like the proclivity
to get more more easily once you already have and the proclivity to lose more
more easily when you don't have it's not linear there's a non-linear function
there and it's way under things you know like many things I
it's more easier to deal with the large groups of people than individuals
that's one of the reasons psychology itself is probably so hard
people as groups behave in ways that just like
particles just like just like galaxies on the large scales it's easier to
understand if you have many things because you can argue statistically and
that's one of the reasons why I've always sort of
like to look at you know in some sense at large scale structures
by the way I do want a number of my colleagues I remember when I was
Harvard one of my uh a really good uh physicists and
cosmologists that later on actually ended up going into
neuroscience but for a while he decided he would be
going economics because the simple thing was he looked and he said well
you know physics is getting really hard but if you look at economics these
people win economics Nobel prizes for for studying
equations that we study in first-year physics
and so all I have to do is look at the equations from second-year physics and
try to apply them and I can become a big person that feel but
but I have a great um I will tell you my I have a huge
skepticism about economics so I I find I yeah well fair enough
the calling it calling it as science is it is
is really um really generous in my mind because it doesn't make predictions
that are accurate so yeah well you get real rich if you're an
economist you could make predictions that were accurate wouldn't you
yeah and well I mean econometrics studying the data is really important but
but but uh general theories of right now I'm very
anyway I'm very skeptical of it and I'll that will undoubtedly bring
yet more hate mail but anyway um the um okay we're almost to the point where I
want to get to maps of meaning but I wanted I'm really interested in your
own progression there and I'm already beginning to see things which I think
are interesting and I hope maybe others will be interested in in your own
background that led you to this these ideas
yeah well I what I got obsessed when I was about
I kind of have an obsessive mind in some ways and yeah and it
it runs away with me and I got obsessed about I think it was
thermonuclear war to begin with it's like what the hell's going why do we want
to blow all this up why do we want to blow this up
what's going on exactly and then and then that dovetailed with the atrocity
issues like what what's going on with the concentration camp guard exactly and
that that desire to annihilate and burn
and when I mean obsessed like I do I really didn't think of anything else
in some sense for like 20 years and I probably thought about that
manically for 15 hours a day wow it's like and so you know I had a life and
all that but man it was just there as soon as I woke up in the morning it was
just running through my head non-stop and I wrote maps of
meaning three hours a day for 15 years
yeah okay well but you know that well and I have to ask you again
in all due respect it's interesting you say you get
your mind runs away with things with you and I can't help but when I read it
think that somehow I don't know if you were edited but sometimes
it seems to me you get obsessed with the idea and you run away with it
well in maps of meaning in particular see I didn't write that really for people
to read I wrote that to figure something out
okay right so I was thinking thinking thinking thinking the later books
they I wrote those for audience yes right it's clear there's a difference it's
oh yeah maps of meaning it goes on and it yeah I really
feel like it's it's it's you talking to yourself
and getting wrapped up in ideas and that's why it was hard for me because
you got to distill from all of that what you're talking about and at times I had
a hard time oh well it's yeah well yeah fair enough
and I'm sure it's a flawed book but I don't think I could make it any better
now even I read it I read the audio version recorded it
last year when I was like three quarters dead and
I I've thought about editing it but I don't think I've got the brain power to
to dive into it and do it it was certainly something you it was
core dump and yeah it would be hard to core dump again
I think um but okay so you got interested in psychology
and well before that I gotta ask this I know I know a little bit about this but
were your parents religious um that's a hard question but no not really my
mother attended church united church Protestant church and she went every
Sunday and we went when we were little kids but I stopped going when I was 13
because the the pastor well because I didn't like it but also because the
pastor the minister he didn't couldn't answer my
questions about reconciling evolutionary theory with
with biblical stories and and I thought well you don't believe what you're
saying which is something I've often thought while sitting in church
and I was looking for an excuse anyways and my dad didn't go to church
and so so I bailed out then and and my mom didn't like that um but
it wasn't like she was she wasn't overtly religious my mom is a
a very in the best sense a very normal sort of person you know she she's not
extreme in any ways and she went to church because that's what people did
and she liked to sing and she liked the community and you know she had her
beliefs in some sense but not really because it was just
part of the culture and that's what she did and so in a small town that's what
people do I mean I know my first wife's mother you
came from a small town her mother went to you know church and it was a social
thing as much yeah also for better or worse if you
didn't go it reflected badly on you which is
one of my problems with religion I met a lot of people you know if there is a
lot of social pressure in a small town especially
to conform religiously what you know just because if you don't go
it it gives the impression that somehow you're a bad person and that's one of
the problems I've had with at least organized religious yeah well we could
talk about that in some detail too I think because there's
you know with situations like that are always really complicated because
one of the things people are doing when they go to church is
indicating that they're willing to sacrifice an hour a week in a
disciplined manner to the community as such
you know and then so you don't go well maybe it's because you're a conscientious
object or let's say and that's a moral reason but maybe it's just because
you're lazy bastard and you don't care about the community and
you know I'm not saying that's the case but I'm saying these rituals are
complex I think I was more influenced by
Babbitt and St. Clair Lewis the notion that you don't that if you don't go it
means that you're somehow slapping the community expects you to go if you
don't go it means you're not respecting the community yeah right there's a lot
of social pressure and and you have to go to keep
better or worse to keep up appearances what because it's not yeah so I that and
that part well we'll get there I want to I want to get if we'll see if we get
there yeah because I have somewhere where we're at the
beginning but you I but I I'm intrigued as much by you
as well I'm intrigued equally by you and what you say so I want to I want to get
the you part done you moved you did you move
decide to your go back to school and do psychology and then you decide to go to
graduate school which as you say was a new thing
you know I I don't know why I guess I decided I wanted to be a professor or
I wanted to be an academic and I don't know
in my case and I've said this often our podcast it was just that my mother
wanted me to be a doctor and I she convinced me doctors were scientists
which was her mistake and then I got interested in
science and so and then I look yeah I really
wanted to go and be a clinical psychologist and and but I didn't
really get into research interested in the research end until I got to
McGill and that was under the influence of my
supervisor who was a clinician but mostly a researcher and he sort of opened
up the research world to me and and then that got really fascinating to me
and so I got to do both because I was a clinical and
McGill was a real research school you know I had 15 publications and right at
the time I yes exactly wilder penfield and all the
exactly the Montreal Neural was a major place and
and a lot of fundamental discoveries about the brain were made at McGill and
at the Douglas and or at the Montreal Neural
and so I had great advisors there Robert Peele and Maurice Dongier man they
were top rate Frank Irvin I got to know he had a monkey farm on
St. Kitts where he raised alcoholic monkeys which is quite funny
and so McGill was great man it was wonderful and I got really interested
in being a scientist there and then I found out I could do both
that's so that's where that switch came I wondered about that yeah no I mean I
am a good friend of mine's a neurologist and he actually
you know was a resident out in down at McGill and
and I get to see the impact of that on him he's now a professor actually in the
west coast but okay so that's what got you
interested in research but I was interested so you wanted to be a
clinical psychologist why I mean early on
I was going to ask you why well I like help I like trying to help people
you know and I was interested in what made people tick
and you know I had some friends and whose problems I tried to straighten out
and I was interested in in what it meant to live a
I suppose a psychologically healthy life if
you know to speak I guess that's a reasonable way to put it
yeah so and I'm I'm well I am high in compassion that's part of it high in
openness and high in compassion so that's good
good route for clinical psychology is good route for someone like that because
people are endlessly fascinating so you know it's it's actually interesting
you know I actually you are it's another thing that surprised me you are
open high and openness which is something maybe because you've been
interviewed publicly in a very aggressive and antagonistic way
I got the sense that you were much more defensive than you are
and yeah well some of those interviews you know that especially the GQ
interview which is like 40 million views is like I was exhausted
at that point and and it was a very
unfriendly environment I mean it was hostile the second I
set foot in there which was like an hour before the interview started and so
hostile in that sort of cold underlying subtle way that permeates
everything and so by the time the interview started I was sort of like a
cat that was too close to the you know the doghouse and
and so I didn't handle myself with as much humor
humor as I would have liked to you know because if you're really on top of
something you can do it with a light touch and yeah I wasn't really light
touch in that interview but I was also partly because I was I knew
perfectly well at that point that if I said anything
wrong or that could be twisted to be wrong I was dead in the water
so that's not that's that automatically yeah if you're up yeah if
you feel you can't open up then that really makes it yeah
anyway you remain the question that intrigued me
before I even heard any of this so now but early on was why you remain a
clinician why during your academic career
I mean I guess it was great for teaching it was great for teaching man
oh god because you can use examples I noticed in the book there are lots of
time and in all your books I think but well at least I haven't voluminously
read well and it kept the theory tied to the reality
eh because I was very interested in psychological theories of all sorts
yeah I mean a taught personality theory and that's basically a walk through
great psychological thinkers in the clinical domain and
but practicing continually meant that you know I was always where the tire was
hitting the road and that was unbelievably useful because I
could test out these ideas in the practical application and see where
they were useful and where they weren't and
they were useful man unbelievably useful you you got into
personality eventually your first interest was more a sort of addictive
thing alcoholism right yeah and is that because of was that a personal
interest or is it because your professor was had alcoholic monkeys or
well it was it was it was a little bit of one a little bit of a the other it
probably wouldn't have been my first choice but I was really interested in
why it was that certain substances were so attractive to people and that was
tied with an underlying interest in neurobiology and so
when Robert Peele offered me this position at Miguel it was like oh good I
get to go to Montreal because I always wanted to do that
and yeah I could I could do that I could look into that and
alcohol use turned out to be a great field of study because alcohol crosses
the blood-brain barrier like water unlike say cocaine and
and and and heroin and so forth and benzodiazepines they're much more
specific in their action but alcohol affects everything so to understand the
pharmacology of alcohol you have to study the whole nervous system
and that was really really that was great because I did a lot of
neuroscience work at Miguel okay and then and so and do you I shouldn't know
this but do you still continue to do clinical work no I stopped in when all
when everything exploded around me partly because look when you do clinical work
nothing can should be on your mind except that person right there and then
and I couldn't do that I was so distracted by everything that was happening
and and you have to be around and you have to be on call you have to be
available you have to have some leftover emotional space
yeah and and none of that was possible and so
I just had to stop and it's too bad because I love doing it but the
podcasts are a good substitute so yeah I could yeah it gives you a chance to
connect and then okay and then you and then you did a
postdoc there and then and then went to Harvard
well I was on the academic job market during that postdoc so I went to a
few places and generally got mixed reviews for my
for my approach because I was I had a hard scientific
research what would you say CV at that point
I think I published more papers when I was at McGill than any graduate student
ever had and and you know that what that was
attractive to many of the places that were hiring but I also had these weird
side interests that people were less you know more skeptical about and I
wouldn't shut up about them even though people told me to but that worked
really well when I went to interview at Harvard
why well because see one of the things you see
in people who are educated is they think that if they don't know something
then it's probably not worth knowing and they don't just know that they just
don't know yeah well lesser lesser academics are like that
yeah well when I went to Harvard the professors were so damn smart there that
I couldn't say anything that they didn't know about and so there was nothing
about what I was interested in that bothered them
in fact they were interested in it oh it wasn't oh I thought I see you surprise
me again I thought you're going to tell me
they didn't mind hearing from you things they didn't understand or didn't know
about because it intrigued them but you tell me they already knew I thought I
was well they knew at least enough to know that there was something there they
they wouldn't just like say well no anybody who's interested in that like
Jung for example there were a lot of them are skeptical of Jung and fair enough
you know I can see why but yeah well fair enough
but but that didn't mean that they didn't understand that there was such a thing
as the psychology of literature and narrative and so
yeah that worked and that's when you went there you you expressed early on
that that was what you were interested in the psychology of literature and
narrative I talked about everything I did I talked about the alcohol research by
that time the the ethics committees had made the sort of research I was doing
basically impossible and so I had to switch and I interesting
yeah yeah well because you know let's pick up on that I mean I like to go place
ahead and plan but I suspect that impacted on some of the things you're
talking about later on the yeah you did it definitely I hate ethics committees
they're they're terrible and I understand why why don't you elaborate on a
little bit because well first of all you know they'll come back and say well
why don't you do this experiment this way it's like do your own goddamn
experiment part of the reason I'm doing this is because that's what I'm
interested in you want to do a different experiment
get your PhD set up your lab do the goddamn experiment
and don't come in and fix mine who the hell are you anyways
that just irritated me to death and then oh so irritating because I love doing
it you know and scientists you got to leave them alone because they're weird
people it's like they got these strange obsessions
don't interfere with that well that's I mean you know one of the things that
sort of made you at least more famous publicly was the response to being told
what to say or do and in some ways which yes really
push I don't like that oh that's clearly pushes your button
zero doubt about it but but I can see it the origin in the
in the ethics community well here's what happened in it Miguel I was studying
we had a very specific population we were studying they're very very hard to
find these people non-alcoholic men 18 to 23
so they had to but they had to drink they couldn't be alcoholic but they had to
drink they had to have an alcoholic father an
alcoholic paternal grandfather and an alcoholic paternal
first or second-degree relative in addition very hard to find
so we were studying the psychophysiology
psychophysiological responses of people who had males who had a genetic
predisposition to alcoholism very specific population we couldn't
study women because if your mother was alcoholic you
might have fetal alcohol syndrome and so that just
that that muddies the waters too much and so
well when i went to harvard to try to do this research by that time the ni trip
oh and so what would happen we'd bring these guys into the lab
and we'd give them three shots of alcohol in 20 minutes and get their blood
alcohol level up to about point one zero above legal intoxication and that's
where the interesting psychophysiological responses manifested
themselves lower doses which almost all other labs used
didn't produce that effect so then i went down to harvard
ni triple a had got all ethical by that point and
they wouldn't let us let our research subjects leave until their blood
alcohol level was at point oh two we used to leave them go at point oh four
point oh six something like that and usually we'd make sure they got a
taxi home and all that we were sensible but that meant that these guys
had to sober up in the lab awake for like 10 hours
well no one was going to do that it was torturous and then we had to include
half women it's like well we can't and first of all male alcoholism is
primarily a male disorder although not entirely and and the reasons for female
alcoholism are probably different and so i couldn't give the doses i couldn't
use the research population and basically what happened is
every single research psychologist stopped studying
the response to alcohol because it became impossible and
you know how ethical is that it's just alcoholism right
it's like the fifth leading cause of death or some damn thing it's
it's not important yeah so end of that so then i i just couldn't do it so well
that's yeah and that's something we both are i mean where we where we
began to converge you and i at least intellectually it seemed to me
is our concerns whenever i see research being interfered with
i get upset well here's an example do you know that 70 percent of this
research applicants to the uc system this year
were dispensed with at hiring because of their diversity statements
i've written an article on it i just wrote an article about it just if it
actually 76 percent oh okay well that's better
no no i just i've actually have a piece coming out in the wall street journal
which will probably come out but before this
appears uh yeah that's not bad that's devastating right it's devastating no
i'll send you my piece i'm totally angry about it but that's
that kind of interference with academia is something that we'll
we may get to i'd like i'd like to explore your thoughts more than that
maybe in another time we can because it's something we both relate to
let me ask you just to close off this because
yeah this is a great concern to both of us but has that has research in
alcoholism has it died has it has research in that area died or has it
ever come back in terms of uh looking at well the
research of the sort we were doing that's you can't do it so yes it's dead
it's just not possible to do that you can't get funds for it
for example plus they made it we would we'd like to get these guys back
three or four times you know because they were hard to find and
and we were on to something we found that a substantial proportion showed a
pronounced heart rate increase to alcohol administration
that looked like it was associated with opiate release
it could be blocked by nail trek zone it was deadly deadly research
but you know whatever well done so i'd really irritated the hell out of me
so you would well you know it's true and i can
understand irritated the hell out of you but sometimes when one door closes
another one opens and and and that's clearly what happened i mean you might
have gone on to be a wonderful researcher in
alcoholism but instead you shifted gears a little bit
and yeah well i was hired to teach person i would it was hired to teach
personality i was in personality and psychopathology
subsection there and and so i started to turn my research towards personality
although i kept a bunch of other research lines going until i was
up for promotion i think it was to a full professor at the u of t and they
basically said we can't put your research record forward because
you haven't specialized in any single area enough and i thought well
i've published in like seven areas you know there's something to be said for
that but then i i thought well it's way easier
actually only to publish in one area so if that's what you want me to do
so that was also annoying to say the least but anyways i did it and it worked
and i i focused more on personality for for a bunch of reasons why were you
hired in personality if your work had been on a
sort of alcoholism when you said you were hired to teach personality
was that just the available slot at harvard or what was what was that
well i was a clinical psychologist and i knew the personality theorists well and
so that was a big part of that and they liked the fact that i had a hard
research edge because well because psychology
at least when it's done right is a hard you know it's a research discipline and
harvard was certainly it was a great place i loved being there it was great
mcgill was great too yeah i enjoyed i was at harvard well i was in the
boston area for 10 years and did my phd at MIT and then moved to harvard
yeah i loved the faculty man they i loved our faculty meetings they were so
funny because no one wanted to be there and they were already funny and so
if anybody ever objected to something the chair would say
uh you're head the subcommittee to discuss that somewhere else and
which is perfect right it's like that'll teach you to make the meeting longer
yeah that's what happily i didn't have to i had a position and there's something
called the society of fellows and where i had where i was
allowed to totally avoid anything related to anything but what i wanted to do so
i didn't teach i didn't have to i didn't have to i was supposed to just think so
i happily didn't i didn't learn of the of the tedium of faculty
meetings to later on actually the interesting thing is i went to
Yale to become an assistant professor and Yale has the policy that assistant
professors aren't worth worthy of faculty meetings
so they don't even allow them in the faculty meetings
oh so that was good for you yeah yeah and then i let yeah and then only
later on when i became when i got promoted and then i quickly became
chair of a department and then i had to run faculty meetings
it's a lot easier well it's a lot easier to be in a meeting when you run it
then someone else is true yeah true and i love teaching so that was that was
never an impediment to me yeah and i hear that you were an incredibly popular
teacher at least that's what the word on the street or at least word in the
literature i've read is yeah it was fun i love teaching it was especially
personality so it's so fun to teach that to people it's so engaging that as a
subject especially for people at age that you had a big following at harvard did
that continue when you moved to u of t yes well again let me ask a
question and in you know i don't know whether it's
you're free not to answer it or we can cut it out or whatever but
um why do you move back to canada well um the probability of being promoted to
full tenure from an associate position at the ivy leagues is basically zero it's
zero i yeah that's why i left and i knew i knew that and i had this
attitude i i got my attitude right because i saw some of the people there
the assistant professors who were or an associates who were on the verge of
leaving and they were all annoyed not all of them but mad that they weren't
going to be make it you know and i thought i thought look if you could be
promoted to full professor these slots that you occupied would have never been
opened so you can't be unhappy about what brought you
here and then i thought i'll just accept that it's like okay i got to come here
let's say i'm not the way i looked at was hey i got to go to harvard for
six years and i got paid for it like that's a deal man it was a great deal
and i was really sad to leave and you know i wanted to fight for promotion on
the basis of maps of meaning and i think you know i think i had a shot at it you
know because some of the professors there really liked what i had done
but i got sick then and i didn't have the bloody spirit to put up the proper
fight and so and then this and then this position came up at the
toronto and it was perfect for me it was tailor made for me in some sense and so
then that's what we did and it was hard to leave though because i loved harvard i
loved living in our like just when i left boston for yale it was very hard to
leave back i kept one day a week i went back to harvard
and be you you know just to it's hard to break that umbilical cord right away
and i really liked my colleagues too and a lot of them are still my friends and
okay so that was all that's great oh that's wonderful uh yeah well i but i
understand the again the psychology of it uh i i left yale again before i i'd
already been promoted to like you i guess associate professor but i i i saw
that there was no there was you know the opportunities at yale were going to be
minimal especially my own field and so when when when the opportunity came
along in this case to build a department to become chair of another department
and have 12 faculty positions so i was it was so attractive to me that i couldn't
i couldn't resist but i wondered why i left and i i'd know if it was a yearning
you know as a canadian who moved to the states i moved much earlier than you
because i i i went to graduate school down there um
you know the question of whether i'd return to canada was always on my mind
i didn't until after i retired and but but uh but i always
thought about it i often often considered coming back and there were a few
times actually to toronto but anyway let's now now having i i hope that this
has been interesting for you it's been interesting for me but and i think it'll
i hope it'll be interesting for people who who are interested in what you have
to say because understanding you as a person i think
is important and i never have heard much about it but now i want to move to
what you've written about and um in pretty grand maps of
meaning and in and in and in and as i say in in rule
11 at least what i surmise from it and the best way i can do it as i say for
better or worse uh jordan is to is to read quotes from you and
ask you about them so i'm gonna do that and we'll we'll just skip
through and we'll see how far we get and then i want to give you some
chance hopefully for for us to discuss some of those issues and i know that
you were still interested in following up with me
some of the things i'm going to talk you about will follow up on for people
listening will follow up on our discussion i didn't realize actually i
hadn't done my preparation which is fine i was i was being our dialogue was you
asking me questions i realized that i forced myself to watch
our our podcast only i hate it because i had to listen
myself for a lot of it but um but i didn't realize how many of the
ideas and things you were bringing up if i'd known about it from your books
would have meshed perfectly and so i we can follow up on some of that
discussion because now i understand where you are coming from
but let me let's talk about how right at the early on maps of meaning by the way
you basically say beliefs make the world and let me let me read this quote
i discovered that beliefs make the world in a very real way
that beliefs are the world in a more than metaphysical sense
this discovery has not turned me into a moral relativist
however quite the contrary i've become convinced that the
world that is belief is orderly that there are universal moral absolutes
although there are they are struck these are structured such that a diverse
range of human opinion remains both possible and beneficial
i learned um let's see
okay i believe that individuals in societies who
flout these absolutes in ignorance or in willful opposition
are doomed to misery and eventual dissolution
and i learned that the meanings of the most profound substrat of belief
systems could be rendered explicitly comprehensible
let's get to that later let's let's talk about the first thing
i believe that individual societies who flout these absolutes in ignorance or
willful opposition are doomed to misery and eventual dissolution
do you want to elaborate on that because i'm shocked
uh it's interesting to me to hear you say that because again it
goes against the grain for me so i want to hear i want to understand where you
came from in writing that well i first started to understand
that what we perceive in some real sense isn't
exactly material reality and partly that's because
that's actually impossible and i mean that technically
and that's something we could go into in great depth because that realization
paralyzed a number of fields it really started to come to the forefront in
many fields in about in the early 1960s especially in ai
when the ai type started to try to make machines that could see the world
in some sense like we do and then act in the world and what they
instantly realized was that oh there isn't just something there that we see
this is way harder than we ever possibly imagined
in fact it's so hard that it looks like it might be impossible in some sense so
how the hell do we do it and like we still don't have
robots that can move around the world like we do
you know endless generations i'm not i'm not i'm maybe it's improved the last
time i looked at this great detail we didn't have robots that could
fold laundry very efficiently either so yeah well a lot of these so-called
simple things like seeing well it's half your brain it takes you half your
brain to see and most animals like we see way better than almost all animals
say eagles raptors really because i we have two bald
eagles in my backyard yeah they can see they they their eyes are the same size
as yours and they have two foveal spots eagles
falcons they're the animals that can see better than us but other than that
it's us and it's half our brain just to see well so why
well you're a physicist you understand that reality is composed of levels
of being right from the subatomic up to the cosmic it's like well
first of all how do you specify the proper level of analysis
well one of the things that's quite interesting psychologically is that we
have short words are generally used to describe
things that manifest themselves to us at our level of analysis
cat we see a cat we don't see a species we don't see cat
parts we see this cat well why well that's
that's the level that's most biologically relevant to us given our
embodiment that's an evolutionary answer and so we see
what we see first of all what we see a lot of his memory
but we see something that's overlaid on the world we actually see the overlay
and hopefully it reflects what's underneath and generally it does and
it's a hell of a shock to us when when we make a perceptual error
but I see I and then I started to learn especially from reading Jeffrey Gray
that we we also see the world within a motivated frame
and he was influenced by Norbert Wiener who was one of the world's first
cybernetic scientists essentially a great influence on AI
yeah and and Gray never talked about narrative but
the frame that he described that we see and in animals as well
basically has a point A and a point B so we're always moving towards a goal if
we're mobile animals and I thought oh well the
description of the movement from point A to point B that's the simplest
unit of meaning that's a story and then I learned that
a better story is a story about how stories transform and so
those are actually perceptual frames of reference that transform
and then I understood that if you don't have respect for the transformation
process above all else then you can't transform your perceptual frames when
necessary and then you can't adapt to error and that destroys you
and so that's that's all part of that when you okay there's two bits of this I
want to parse more carefully first the statement the beliefs
are the world I mean yeah as a psychologist
I'll accept that statement if you're talking about a psychologist
namely the human psyche I won't accept that statement as a scientist as a
physicist yeah well that's where we could really have a good conversation well
let's have that good yeah yeah yeah okay okay
so so look it has been very difficult for scientists
to describe the world in a way that isn't like that narrative
right and so the idea that there's a tension between science and religion in
some senses is just a statement that it's been
very hard for scientists to pull out an objective description of the world
given the way we perceive well it's been easy for physics not easy but it's
worked for physicists oh it's why I didn't say it didn't
work I'm not making that claim at all I'm saying we didn't manage it
till 400 years ago exactly and I think we talked this is something we
talked about before actually that we both
read about that science is hard and I don't mean hard in the mathematical sense
no in the sense that it goes against the grain that's right
it's unnatural it's very unnatural and and if we didn't
we wouldn't need science if it wasn't unnatural I mean everyone would be a
scientist if it wasn't and instead we and so that
okay so that's that's that's an insight into that issue so then the question is
well what is it that science as a as a technique
struggles against well it struggles against the fact that we see everything
through a value-laden lens and I mean see well here here's an example like
look when I'm looking at you on this screen
there are almost an infinite number of ways things I could be looking at
so first of all there's each pixel in so far as I can see pixels
but then there's all the combinations of pixels right and there are a lot of
combinations of pixels and I could concentrate on one hair on
your beard or I could concentrate on the blurry
cupboard behind you or that book or like it's endless but I don't
I look at your eyes and you look at my eyes yeah and you look at my eyes because
you've made a value judgment that there's nothing more
valuable during the course of this perceptual exercise
than looking at my eyes and that's a biological judgment
well yeah well when you say a value judgment that's interesting let me take
here's why again I'm in I'm a neophyte so well I mean I've read a lot but
I wouldn't describe as a value my understanding is that infants are hard
wired to look at eyes and there's an evolutionary reason no problem man
there's values that are hardwired that's no problem why why do you call them
values because look to to segregate out a particular
element from a background of elements I have to make that primary have to make
it most important and the other things less important
okay so that's what you mean by value you yes yeah it's technical idea it's
like you have to look through the world you have to look at the world through a
hierarchy of value there's no way to look at the world without doing that
okay you could take an economic our attitude which you look at the world
which what's what's more what's most what's most
effective what that's fine the results most quickly that's fine
eyes certainly if you're dealing with humans looking at eyes
gets you where you want to go on here here's here's why
it's like our eyes have evolved the whites
and the reason for that is because the fact of the whites make
it much easier for us to see where eyes are pointing and what that implies is
that all of our ancestors who had eyes that weren't easy to see
either got killed or didn't mate and the reason that we want to see where people
point their eyes is because foveal tissue is extremely expensive
and you're not going to waste it looking at something useless and so that if I
can see what you're looking at then I know what you're interested in
then I know your value structure for that moment I can understand you
plus I've been directed to the valuable part of the
visual landscape and we're unbelievably good at that
it's part of a shared reference and kids have that
extraordinarily early as you already pointed out like unbelievably early
and so it would work so evolutions pick that out okay so when I say value
structure I mean a decision about the hierarchy of
importance okay okay and I mean it in some sense both economically and
evolutionarily like there's nothing about this that's
that's not nailed down especially into evolutionary theory
it's like there's a reason we oh yeah no I'll buy that yeah I mean we have we
okay okay I think that's the value hierarchy issue so when you but then
when okay the value hierarchy and when you say that okay so when you say
beliefs are the world you're talking about psyche that namely beliefs are
related to values and some I mean when you say beliefs are the world I still
want to go back to that okay you're saying as a human being yeah well it's
partly because the world is could we can be wrong
what was that well it's partly because we can be wrong like I may think that
something's important and look at it but I might be so wrong
I'm driving down the highway and I focus on something and some car hits me and
I'm dead well that's kind of why it's a belief
it's like well I believe that that was the best thing to look at and
there was evidence to support that but man it was really wrong
it was wrong and so part of its fallibility the part that's partly why
I refer to it it's not only that there's there's a lot to it than that
my I guess my way of phrasing it would be a think
about is that beliefs that the world conditions our beliefs namely
we continually we continually reappraise our beliefs
and the world tells us whether those which beliefs are
if you want to call beliefs which beliefs are reasonable and which aren't by
you know I'm I might be killing us I could walk out yeah I can walk out this
window but the world pretty well tells me no that that doesn't work and
and then I don't reproduce but but uh although it's too late I already have
but um uh so I guess I think the world is conditioning
beliefs rather than the other way around no no it did oh yeah that's fine and it
does and and that's that's a very what would you say
an eternal philosophical dilemma because you can look at it both ways so the
existential psychologist for example taking a page from Heidegger
one of them was one of them one of them made the presumption that
you know we lay values on the world and the other made the presumption that
values reveal themselves to us through the world
and that's they're both right they're both equally right you can look at it
either way and it works so and and for the reasons that you pointed out
so but you see it's it's not so it's not so clear always where the objective
reality is so for example you can train rats to
produce a dopamine surge to an electric shock
okay so the shock is punishing right generally punishment will bring behavior
to a to a halt yeah but if you pair the shock
with a reward but now that's you know
intensity of shock matters but it can be a pretty good shock
if you pair the shock with a reward frequently then
the shock becomes positive and so there's a good example even in a rat
where yeah yeah it's a shock and that's an objective reality it's electricity
but the valence of that can be shifted by learning
and so there is this interaction between the psyche and the
and the objective well in the in the domain of value
and the thing is so for an astute perceptual psychologist
the best one how is an ecological approach to visual perception it's
great book hard-nosed book doesn't really go into narrative
in any direct sense but is very much akin
he was one of the founders of modern perceptual psychology
person who wrote that book and he said for with children for we don't see a
cliff we see a falling off place and even six months old
six month old see a falling off place they also see beauty they see symmetry
a lot of this is deeply wired right but still malleable
right still malleable by learning so and that's partly why there are these
archetypal values because they're built into us biologically
and then if you float them well i can give you a quick example of how
floating this is catastrophic well so you know part of the
strange question i suppose is what exactly are we interacting with
and you you might say well it's the material world and i would say no not
exactly we interact more what we interact with
is more like a field of potential now we resolve that pretty quickly into
perceptual objects but it really is a field of potential because it can go
one way or another and somewhat unpredictably yeah you talk about that
yeah well and consciousness reason well it's strange consciousness
consciousness snaps that into well the being that we perceive anyways
and so it's a field of potential and so you can kind of experience that you
wake up in the morning and you think what am i going to do today
and what you're saying is well i've got these degrees of freedom
weirdly enough and if i act a certain way
i hope these things will happen as opposed to these things and so
what presents itself to you in the morning you've already seen your damn
room you don't even look at it really because you've memorized it
well what you perceive in the deepest sense is this field of potential
that you can interact with yes okay now now the issue is
what's the best way of interacting with that field of potential well think
about it collectively okay you and i are having a discussion
right now because you you can think and i can think but we think
differently now we're hoping that if we exchange thoughts
that we'll be able to master what's coming out is better
and hopefully we will be able to now imagine we shut that down
well then we can't interact with that with what's coming out is better
and it'll kill us and so that's partly why free disc free discourse isn't an
option it's not different than thinking and
thinking isn't different than dying so that's
that's one example of why the west has elevated
free speech to the highest place even religiously that's the divine word
essentially and that's the idea lurking underneath
that it's like everything else is dependent on that
well you know that's intriguing to me because yeah we both are
have been speaking out about free speech in various ways and I lately
but one of the things that was intriguing to me that never hit me and you
just sort of it relates to what you said
and i was talking about this recently that actually Stephen Fry but but the
it came to me from watching a speech by my friend Christopher Hitchens
who said that the problem of censorship the problem of cutting down free
speech doesn't just it the saddest part isn't
that you're infringing on the rights of the speaker
no that's not that's that's bad but it's but but you're infringing on your own
rights because you lose the opportunity to learn that you might be wrong
yeah well and that's fine if you're if you're already in paradise and you
already know everything that you need to know to make your life just how it
should be that's no problem but if you've got some
problems well maybe you should listen a bit because well even if you don't the
point is if you shut down others you really lose that opportunity
to learn even if they're what they're saying is reprehensible
you are at least forced to ask why do i believe what i believe
why do i know they're wrong and maybe they're not wrong
and that is a right in some sense you fringe upon your own rights
more than others because you lose that opportunity to to learn absolutely
absolutely there's no doubt about that look one of the things i really learned
from carl rogers even though i talk so much
was the importance of listening the vital vital vital importance of listening
and it's i've met many many people in my life who
who no one has ever listened to not even once
and you know if you listen to people they unfold that's that's the secret to
rogerian psychotherapy and Freudian to some degree because he let his people
free associate it's like if you just let so you
listen because then they watch while they're talking how your face changes
and then maybe you asked them well i didn't understand that
and so they're thinking and and they're on that edge
and they're putting themselves together not metaphorically man this is
they are they're reorganizing the internal chaos
right in front of you and that's part of what's so fascinating about being a
clinical psychologist because you get in that groove and it's so
remarkable it's what's so fascinating for me
as some but doing these podcasts which is
which is different for me i'm used to expounding for most of my life
and and um learning how to listen effectively and and and get people to
it's real for me it's been a fascinating thing to do and that's one of
things i'm enjoying right now at this very instant
um by asking you questions that you can associate about free associate about
okay let i think we've we've we've beaten that hoarse about belief and
and where you come from it to death all problem i may come back to it also
but the second part of that is what i find fascinating
that you become up that you believe that this that this that you've convinced
that the world that is belief has universal moral absolutes and that and
that if you ignore them and individuals or
societies ignore them are doomed to misery and eventual
dissolution it's interesting where's how much we'll get through here because
we're just at the beginning but but i find that
um again it's something that i that doesn't resonate with me at all
so so uh why don't why don't you expound on it a little bit
well i can give you some examples i i guess so um
and these these are these are like pointing to narrative substructures
let's say well when i look at what's happening
on the far left edge what i see is an existential issue
so here's the existential issues there's the tyrannical father
there's the benevolent father there's the tyrannical mother
there's the benevolent mother that's four and we can easily become obsessed
with any one of those well you get obsessed with the tyrannical
father well that's an existential absolute in some sense and the reason
for that is that well we're historical creatures
right so we have a culture it's often viewed as a patriarchy and that's one
way of looking at it and it definitely has its evil edge i mean
and everyone to some degree suffers from the guilt of history
that's privilege right it's like well do you really deserve what you have i mean
you didn't invent all of it and there's people who maybe you're just as worthy
as you who don't have the same stuff and you know what about
european invasion of north america let's say and etc etc right and so that's an
existential absolute we always have to contend with the tyrannical father
well fair enough but what there's another half to that
and if you just get obsessed with this one thing you're so off balance that
you're gonna you're not gonna you're not gonna fix the problem you're just
gonna make it worse because you just don't you don't have
a sufficiently in some sense even a sufficiently random view of the world
randomized let's look at it that way your sampling is off
in a major way and so then well and that tyrannical father let's say that's
also something really easy to identify with that's what happens when people
become authoritarian and there's a shadow to that
and so that's part of and if you ignore that well then your society becomes
totalitarian and it's like well good luck to you
it's like we've seen what happens when that happens
and there's a difference between a totalitarian society and a free society
and the difference isn't trivial and it's associated with value
and what's at the top at the highest place well you said more it didn't use
values the word moral which is intriguing to me
what do you mean by morality
well morality basically is the difference between good and evil
fundamentally and so if you push if you that's how i'm defining it okay so okay
that's well and you know you might say well is there evil or is there good
and and i know that's a complicated question but at some point there's an
answer to that so here's how i answered it for me
well you can be dubious all you want about an ultimate good
but there are things that have happened in the recent past 100 last 100 years
that are so terrible that i defy you to look at them and say they're not evil
and then you have to think very carefully if you say that they're not
evil just exactly what are you saying and so
so then i invert that and say well i don't know what good is but it's the
opposite of that right and that's a good starting
point right it's like i don't know it's whatever
takes me farthest away from that and i this was a
personal thing for me to some degree because when i was wrestling with the
issue of atrocity and this is what i think i think this is one of the things
that made me different from most people who think about these things
i didn't think of myself as concentration camp victim
and i didn't think of myself as you know schindler
yeah or or the dutch family that hid and frank because that's pretty bloody
unlikely it's like let's do some stats here
i thought of myself as a resentful concentration camp
camp guard okay and that that was quite shocking
to do that yeah well it's like are you a victim or a perpetrator are you a hero
or a perpetrator well i can tell you for sure that you are at least in part a
perpetrator and if you don't understand that then
if the temptation to become a perpetrator arises
you won't know how to withstand it and you may even want it
and you think well i wouldn't want that it's like oh yeah really is that right
you really know yourself that well do you and you actually know what happened
in germany do you and the steps that people took
read ordinary men that's a great book talk about step by step that's a great
book man and those were ordinary guys and
they weren't particularly reprehensible but what they did it's like
they were taking pregnant women out into fields stripping them naked and
shooting them in the back of the head you think i couldn't do that it's like
yeah okay maybe and you think you wouldn't enjoy it's like
yeah maybe you there's a lot more in there than you think
unfortunately so well well so let's go back to the hierarchy of value like
that is embedded inside a framework of good and evil there's no way around it
it's part and parcel of it's way out at the fringes and so
when i talk about what's religious so imagine there's a hierarchy of value
and here's how this hierarchy works the deeper the value the more other values
are dependent on it so that's the definition of deep
when you look at the deepest values you are in the religious domain
psychologically speaking well okay again
explain that you obviously things and i and then the word
yeah and i well we got to think about what you mean that's that's we got to
think about this experientially and not i'm not talking about propositional
description yeah i'm talking about something
different or you equate religion to
biology it throughout at least in many many places
yes and to and and to mythology which i find
yeah i know and and it's something i have to get over because i that's okay
it's hard it's hard man well it's not just hard i find it sort of
i guess for me it diminishes the argument i mean you you say
oh i i i i i you really say i learned that the meanings of the most profound
substrat of belief systems could be rendered explicitly
comprehensible even to the skeptical rational thinker
and then you just and then you say and to me this is sort of naturally turns me
off because yeah you say the world as a form for
action is composed essentially of three constituent elements
which tend to manifest themselves in typical patterns
of metaphoric metamorphic metaphoric representation
first is the unexplored territory and that's a fine but then you automatically
go to mythology as if it's as if it has some you
say the great mother nature creative destructive sources of final resting
place of all determinant things second second is the explorer territory the
great father culture protective and tyrannical cumulative
and ancestral wisdom third is the process that mediates
between unexplored and explorer territory the divine sun the archetypical
individual creative exploratory world we're adapted to this world of divine
characters as much as the objective world you are and i see that you i mean the
whole point as far as i can see of a lot of what you're
saying is something that on the surface seems
straightforward it would be horrible if you didn't object to all that
well i have you should but i object to it
one of the reasons i object to it by nature is to say
well it seems obvious that myth it to the extent that it's
there's any universality of various myths and the fact that it goes back a
long way is is intimately
intimately reveals aspects of the way humans
thinking evolved you know evolutionary psychology right and myth
are related okay that seems obvious and but i don't know whether
why one needs to take more of it than that i guess the question is
why i don't think you need to make more or more of it than that
that's quite a lot right there there's a lot of it right here there's a whole
but yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to unpack it so well i'll give you an
example this is okay i mean the examples are quite nice so
the egyptians viewed horus now remember they're trying to figure things out
and they're trying to figure out how to assemble a very large state and they're
trying to figure out what should be sovereign
so they're trying to figure out well who is this pharaoh and what should he
embody and how should he act if things are going to work and they're
they're doing this for like thousands of years they're they're trying to puzzle
this out and they're using their imagination and so
they parse out their patriarchal god into two forms there's osiris
and he's the old state he was once a hero he is
pretty good but he got archaic and ossified turned to stone in some sense
so and he has a son horus now horus is that egyptian eye
and everyone knows that eye it's the eye why the eye well that's a falcon
because falcons can really see and so horus was also a falcon
okay so the what the egyptians were doing was worshiping attention
okay so now what what does that mean well attention isn't the same as thought
so when you're listening in these podcasts you know when a podcast going
real well you you get into it and time yeah disappears
okay it's because you're attending right and what you're attending to
fundamentally you're on that edge where you're willing to let the things that
are ossified about your cognitive structures
flex and and you're expanding yourself out into unexplored territory and
that's way better than being right it's way more fun than being right although
being right protects you from being anxious
not eventually doesn't work eventually but being on that edge well we're
we're adapted to that edge i mean i mean seriously adapted to it
yeah i'm i'm i'm certainly am well everyone is although the this the let's
say the breadth and intensity of that edge is much different between different
people and where they find it for them differs with their temperament
but you need everything about your beliefs needs to be subordinate to the
process of transforming those beliefs unless you already know everything
and so that's just one and so and that's played out to some degree you see that
to some degree in christian symbolism let's say with it where there's a
tension between the son and the father and the father is more
this is what is it's already established and the son is more well wait a sec
yeah but there's this horizon of possibility that we have to contend
with so this needs to be updated and that's a very it's a tough thing for
human beings because well it's a lot easier just to go
with what you know but we just don't know enough so we
have to subordinate that to this process of exploration that creative and that
i believe that's encapsulated fundamentally in hero mythology
hero mythologies about transforming ideas that's essentially what it's about
i'll buy that but why i guess if i'm one if one's trying to explain something
which i which you're talking about now which i find fascinating and
and can relate to why cannot why what utility in
is there in in reverting to the myth well
that's a good question i mean partly it's the same utility
that there is in me using an example to describe what i meant
but yeah but but but but you're right and the example and i find
when you write well that was sort of a more compelling
more compelling when you talk about say and i say i'm used to find the same
thing about oliver sacks and other but more compelling when you talk about
your experience as a clinical psychologist which something can relate
to then then when you talk to me about the great
father or the tyrannical mother or the hero or
yeah well it should be more compelling because the problem with those
say low-level abstractions is they lack concrete embodiment
so i'll give you an example of that this is a weird
example but it'll work marcia elieta he's a great historian of religions
and he was cognizant of niches proclamation that god had died and
elieta knew what that meant and what the consequences would be
but he went back when he was doing his pioneering work into the history of
religion he said this has happened many times this is not the first time
why well what happens is a community comes together
and forms some representation of the summum bonum right the thing that should
be on top the ultimate good but it's so damn gets so damn abstract
that it doesn't connect to life it's like well that's god but what does it
have to do with me like interacting with my wife or
doing something embodied and practical gets so abstract it floats away
no one has any relationship to it anymore and it dies
but that's not good for for a variety of reasons which we can get into
well part of the way that the christian imaginations
address that problem speaking psychologically
is to take that abstraction and make it incarnate in a particular time in
place and it pulls the story down to earth
and it makes it much more compelling a student once asked me look if there's
all these archetypal structures why don't we just tell the archetype over and
over i thought oh it has to be particularized it
has to be optimally particularized for imitation
that's why and so if i get too abstract you don't know what it means for
perception or action and loses all significance and you drift away
a good storyteller he knows his audience and he can
he can put the story on the edge of their cognitive transformation
and then it's absolutely captivating but it means the archetype has to be
particularized constantly and reparticularized constantly
well it's another way i mean i yeah i guess it's a that's often you frame
things in a way that i think is a fancy way of something saying something that
maybe i'm just too pedestrian i would just say you know
that that i said before teaching is seducing
car salesman is seducing if you want to get to people you have to go ask
where they're coming from and you have to tell your arguments to where they're
coming from so that they can emotionally relate
isn't that just the case isn't that what you're saying
well i'm trying to explain why those things are seductive
okay but why okay they are because no that's the thing that it's the
experiential issue and that's also relevant
with regard to the notion of religious depth which we should just take a quick
side step yeah no i was we're gonna go there
eventually anyway so yeah because it's a technical issue
as far as i'm concerned because i'm trying to speak psychologically
so when you start to toy with the deepest values
upon which all these other values depend that has an embodied consequence
one is it's deeply upsetting so it's anxiety provoking the other is it's
deeply wonder provoking and those things those are both there and the
reason they're both there is because well you blow apart that
base level map and all sorts of things fly out of pandora's box and
some of those things might kill you but some of those things might be just
what you need to solve your current problem
so it's very it's very it's tense when you speak at religious depth
there's an embodied consequence of that it's independent
of any discussion about you know religious propositions as logical
statements about the structure of reality for me most of that's beside the
point it's like no no you don't it's but no for me
most of it's only beside the point most of it's irrelevant
yeah well it's it's irrelevant to to what we're discussing because there are
depths most of it's silly yes yes and there are
depths and if you get deep enough you have religious experiences
now what that means about yeah what is a good one
well okay so that's so the Einstein's goddess you know Spinoza's god the
the fact that the universe is comprehensible of the universe yeah those
call that a religious experience yeah i think all in fact
i'm defining this in some sense okay i want to know right i'm defining okay
okay so yeah yeah yeah so so all let's take the the the emotion of all it's a
mixture of emotions it's both positive and negative emotions
and it's predicated on a prey response to a predator
that's the biological underpinning so for example your hair will stand on end
well why well it's because that's pile of erection it's what happens when a
prey animal sees a predator it's like poof well that's part of all it's like
you're in you you something greater than you and
potentially dangerous has come into view that's the embodied part of that
of course it's way more if i look at the nice guy yeah i'd buy it
yeah yeah that's certainly something greater than me yeah it's certainly
something greater than me i don't know whether it's potentially dangerous
because it sort of seems to be out there and separate
i mean unless unless you have astrology or some
bit of nonsense but well it's awe-inspiring even though it's completely
at least on the surface unrelated to me well it's it's also a place though where
you do in some real sense confront the infinite unknown
oh yeah right there it is well the infinite unknown will swallow you
it swallows me every day well it'll swallow you when you die
it will do that you're surrounded by it well i when i die
it won't swallow it i mean yeah when you know
when you what do you mean when you say things like that i don't know what you
mean well you dissolve into it because it's a
hurrah you just end you just well it's yeah i know but you don't get
you don't dissolve into some mystical i understand i'm not i'm not i'm not
trying to say that i know you're not but then when you say it look it's
natural for people to then jump into this new age nonsense yes i
right absolutely i want to hold your feet to the fire only because i can you
should you absolutely should absolutely
look here what is one thing you experience at a funeral
you know i've seen this many times is people will stand by the body of the
person they loved and they cannot speak
there's nothing to say and it's because they're on the horizon
now i'm not saying that you dissolve into anything particularly
i'm saying it's a limit experience and when you look up into the sky
it's it's an analogy of that experience you're on the you're on the frontier in
some sense when you look up into the sky and you're faced with
in some sense you're faced with what you are in relationship to that
and now that's also okay now i'm going to go sideways here for a second tell you
a bit of a story okay so i have no agenda i've been looking at this image
with my wife and and this friend of mine and it's of mary the mother of god okay
it's a very interesting image and renaissance painters were all over
this so you can google mary serpent stars and you'll see like these beautiful
paintings okay so there's mary her head's in the stars
12 of them there's a reason for that and her foot's on the world and on a
serpent yeah yeah that's right well it's the seasons
it's a bunch of things man it's a bunch it's a bunch but it's it's the cosmos
but but okay so there's that image and many many painters spent much time on
that image it's like it's very weird image her head's in the stars her foot's
on the serpent the earth is down there what the hell's going on
well here's part of it so
when you face something that's deeply unknown it calls to you in some sense
to be more than you are now how is that related to the prey predator
relationship well if you're a prey you should be
a little more than you are in relationship to that predator
and so there's a call to adaptation in the awe response to a predator it's like
be more or die and look at us man we've done a pretty good job of doing exactly
that for like little skinny naked apes it's like look the hell out man wolves
run away from us okay and so in some sense we
imitated the predator as a consequence of that awe response and we're good at
imitating and god only knows what we're
imitating when we look up at the stars but this
image of mary is an attempt to puzzle that out so that serpent that she has her
foot on that's the snake well okay mary's a
mother it's like don't eat my kids snakes for 60 million years
right this is a deep image but it's deeper than that too because
there's this line of thinking and jewish thinking and a christian thinking
that associates the serpent in the garden
with malevolence itself so that's the weird association between the snake and
satan which is not in that original story it's part of the after story in some
sense and i puzzled over that for a tremendous
long it's like what's going on there why is that
association exists well the worst snake is not a snake
the worst snake is like a meta snake it's like
it's like the essence of snake and then that becomes something psychological
and the good mother doesn't just protect you from snakes
it protects you from the snake in your heart
and that's a real snake man and if you're going to protect your kids
one more thing if you're going to protect your kids from the snake in their
hearts and and in your heart too you better
bloody well have your head in the stars that's a nice analogy i have i'll give
you that that's one of the ones that i can sort of
well that's what those artists were trying to puzzle out hey i i i guess so
but but at the same time um
why i i can't understand what's so important about
why for you is important to puzzle that story
about that specific myth that makes it worth
that makes it worth analyzing and and and and perseverating over
why people paint mary that way or why why that myth of the
garden of eden is what it is well i mean i guess you're because
because again is it just simply because you think let me make it
i can understand one aspect and the other i can't so i'm hoping the answer is
my hoping the answer is because you think it tells you something about the
human psyche not because you think it tells you
something about about the world beyond the human psyche
the first claim is plenty for me okay that's fine i buy that
then i understand that the only thing that i worry about is sometimes the one
gets the impression that that in in well this is where i get
trouble because you see there is a fundamental problem here that we could
talk about as scientists it's like yeah people parody me because people will
ask me questions like do you think that's real
and so that's an equation is a b it's like yeah well
you think a is self-evident when you ask me that question
but it's not and so then you might say well is this real
and so you might ask me well does this mean anything about the structure of
reality and my answer would be what do you mean by
reality and why are you so sure that your presumption
about what reality is is the right presumption
so because i could say well reality pretty clearly has a narrative edge
and i don't know what that means when you say real i guess yeah but that's the
issue that's the quest well look when you come in as you say real when no no i
understand i think i understand that and i'm trying to
i'm trying to get into your head here a little yeah so
your when you say reality you mean human reality because you're so tied
to being here's the question here's a question for humans are relevant here's
a question for a physicist for a scientist good
okay what if darwin and einstein are in conflict they are
they're in conflict because go on okay the fundamental
presupposition of darwinism in some sense
is that there's nothing more real than that which selects
whoa hold on i think you're posing more on it than that than your
it's the fundamental let me rephrase that to me are we adapted are we
adapted to reality are we adapted to reality
we we are adapted to our own reality yes no no no no no wait a minute wait a
sec remember earlier in our discussion when you
said that you won't walk through the window
okay so we're not just adapted to our reality okay
we are fine tuned for the world around us to survive
right if you had okay and the world around us is reality
okay that fine tuning has a narrative structure
go on why well because we have to i know i know i know look i do too i do too
because we have to act out we have to act and our descriptions of actions
because the question for us isn't what is the question is how to act
how to act how to act and what right now scientists enough of you to okay
by definition i believe this by definition the objective materialist
types cannot answer the question how to act in
fact if they do they're not doing what they should be doing but that leaves us
with this question which is which is the question
how to act and so here we could have a discussion
what's the more fundamental question what is that's the scientific
presumption or how should we act now you might think it's obvious that it's what
is but it is not obvious it's tough that now we're great in fact the next
question i was going to ask actually i was going to i was going to take a
digression into something you wrote about reason and
hell we'll get back to that but but but at the very beginning of
maps of experience you you have these you say the world
as a form for action is a place of value a place where all things have meaning
this meaning which is shaped as a consequence of social interaction
is implication for action or at a higher level of analysis
implication for the configuration of the interpretive schema
that produces or guides action that's a long wind away yeah yeah no
completely terrible i know you tend to be long winded it's just the way you are
but that's okay i'm working through that um but
it's a definition of meaning that sentence is a definition of meaning if
it means something to you it means either it's relevant
for you to change your action or it's relevant for you to change your
perception and the meaning signals that
okay but let me so you can say the world is a place of things or a place of
action but no complete worldview can be generated
without using both modes of construal the fact that one mode is generally set
at odds with the other means only that the nature of their respective
domains remains insufficiently discriminated adherence of the
mythological worldview tend to regard the statement of their
creeds as indistinguishable from empirical fact
even though such statements were generally formulated long before the
notion of objective reality emerged those who by contrast accept the
scientific perspective who assume that it is or might become complete
forget that an impassable gulf currently divides what is
from what should be yeah again and i mean this
you know in my respect i am not taking any offense to your your question there's
no offense intended i'm really uh what's
different in that long discussion from human statement
that you can't get ought from is well what's different is that
the world of of ought is structured narrative and it's evolutionarily
determined and since it's evolutionarily determined well
that gives us a scientific conundrum which no one's addressed
well you know you often hear this is the other thing that interested me as a
psychologist i don't know where in somewhere i have a quote and i was
going to get to it but we're certainly not going to get to all the quotes
obviously not in this discussion anyway um but you basically say science has a
problem oh yeah with the fact that it can't
it can't really appreciate that there's a there's narrative and meaning and it
doesn't embody that but what about the science of
psychology i mean your yeah when it's a weird hybrid
it's a weird hybrid and and isn't that the whole purpose of psychology is to
understand well it's got two purposes so psychology is
a weird hybrid because it's half medicine and half
research you know it's it's truly a hybrid because the clinicians they're
all these weird characters like Freud and Rogers and the existential
psychologists and yung and then there's this the straight
research psychologists and they're more like the cognitive
behaviorists on the on the let's say on the clinical front
and so it's facing both ways and in principle could bring those things
together but you see the scientific the scientific
this is a terrible problem because one of the things that the scientific
perspective has done is made things look quite
bleak existentially now i know there's wonderment in scientific investigation
i understand that but because but it's strange because
science attempts to push subjective meaning out of the way
right i mean as part of its process sure and it should do that but
it should but there's a but there's an existential problem there
that leaves us adrift and look one of the things i concluded from reading
Milton's Paradise Lost in his figure of satan satan for him was
that really the tyrannical and authoritarian rational mind the mind
that presumes that his assumptions are final satan to reason
in yeah exactly yeah he said that and you know that was the quote that not
not reason so much not reason so much not reason exactly although
the reason that the uh the reason that the french revolutionaries tried to
make a deity in in uh in the great cathedral in
paris that reason that's melton melton satan why
because it falls in love with its own productions and raises them to the
highest point and for melton he was a poet right he's
imagining this he doesn't know what's coming but for me that's a
warning from an artist about the dawn of totalitarian reason in the
aftermath of the scientific revolution
okay well yeah but you know but you actually say it i think um
the adoption of god's place by reason yeah it's something that inevitably
generates a state of personal and social being
indistinguishable from hell yes well what do you mean by that
okay i mean that's a really quite a dramatic statement about
that doesn't seem to suggest that reason is a good thing
really it uh no it's just not a good thing when it's elevated to the highest
position it's a really good thing look even
even in melton's work satan is god's highest angel
and he falls the farthest it's not like this is not a good everything in its
proper place in genesis man is instructed to subdue
things properly put them in order put them in order
that's what it means subdue make everything give everything it's due
where does reason fit not at the top attention why do you think there's
intrinsic wisdom to something like genesis
why do you think there isn't because it's it's five thousand years old and
probably way older than that yeah i know but why are things that
ain't that are things that are ancient give me
insight into human psyche but they don't necessarily give me insight into
profound under to profound understandings of the world around me i
think we've not in a scientific way they don't not not in the way that modern
science does they're not that isn't what they are at all
they're not that there's something completely look here here's what they
are in some senses look we have an idea that
we can rank order literature by depth right because you read a shallow book
someone tells you a shallow story you read a deep book and you have a sense of
depth i have it do yeah mm-hmm yeah okay so
the deepest stories are religious why that's a definition
oh hold on it's a definition i'm allowed to make that definition because i
disagree with it it's because it's because religious
emotions start to be aroused when stories are told at that level
this has nothing to do with with propositional belief it's a definition
so you're saying if you're saying okay you use the word religion
you tell me that i should use the word oh which i like better
if you're saying the stories that that that are deepest are ones that relate
to awe i can understand that if that's if it
yes translate what you're saying yes yes and then this is experiential right
and then i would also say awe is a biological instinct
and part of the manifestation of that instinct is the impulse to imitate
it's the impulse because yeah okay so then the quote here's another question
what do we imitate well we don't just copy each other
we don't literally move the same way as the person we're imitating
we see someone that we are in awe of that we respect and admire
we're gripped by the instinct to imitate what are we imitating
well imagine that we can see that in five people and then the person those
people they do some bad things but we ignore those
okay we're imitating something central about all of them
that's a spirit that this is a definition this is it's a definition
because it's disembodied abstraction it's a disembodied abstraction of action
it's a spirit for all intents and purposes we're really smart
we abstract out the admirable and imitate it that's also part of the religious
process exactly that what is it that's admirable
across instances of admirable behavior and we imitate that and when your
child look here's an example this is a good example your kid goes out on the
field and he can zip down and score a goal in
soccer and he's got a pretty good shot at it but a
teammate and maybe not one that's so good is really open
and so he passes and the other kid scores and you're happier about your damn
kid doing that then you would if you're having any sense
then you would be whether if he scored a goal because he
is embodying the spirit of being a good sport that's way better than scoring a
goal okay so that that's a good example of
because if you're smart and i see parents who do this badly all the time
when i go to sports exactly i hate them watching the parents
yeah it's terrible because they don't do this hey
they they subordinate the they subordinate the local victory
to the character development yeah yeah no they sorry the other way around they
subordinate the character development to the local victory yeah i was wondering
what you were going to get yeah exactly so they're they're worst
yeah it's terrible sportsmen oh yes i can't stand going
yeah and then you look underneath that it's like oh you have a lot of under
unrealized dreams a lot of resentment you're projecting that all in your
child and that has to do with your unresolved shadow and
to the pathology that you had with your parents and it's like just an endless
nightmare going down into that sort of stuff and you go
way down you find some things down there and they are really ugly
and that's why you don't like going to those soccer games and no wonder
so no so a lot of this is definition right rather than an argument in favor
of in some sense i guess i guess for me yeah but the what so
yes and i think you know i'm gonna try and segway slowly here
because we could go on for another two hours and i'm not gonna i know we've
gone i can't because i'll die before no i know and we're gonna go we're gonna
go on for about another 20 minutes okay because i've got tickets i've got tickets
to a movie it's even more serious okay okay
but um uh but uh so i i tend to put reason up at the
top i still maintain that that that that even that reason
ultimately even though you can't get off from is without is and a reason
applies to is you can't get off and and and so i think it's okay i want to
quibble with that okay i want to quibble with that sure
sure okay to some degree this is going to hinge on how we define reason right
because it's kind of an expandable word and yeah but but i think it's useful
to draw a distinction between reason and attention
and attention should be higher because attention feeds reason
right you're so when you're in these podcasts and you're
attending new information is flooding in now that's reasonable but i wouldn't
say that's reason oh reason is more like yep it's it's imp or no i agree with
you there in fact actually i think you said something in my
desperately disagreed with it the idea you say somewhere that the person
who is truthful is then going to naturally
do the right thing or something like that and i think eventually
well yeah but but that really read that really graded on me
because it because it missed the attention part namely
revel you don't get knowledge by revelation you only get knowledge
by attention and what i would call attention being empirical
being experiment and testing the world around you no you get it no you get
knowledge from revelation all the time all the time
sure i'll give you an example you get wisdom maybe no i'll give you an example
man you this happens to you all the time but it maybe it's an issue of
definition okay okay so you're trying to solve a scientific
problem so you ask yourself the question
well what happens is that answers pop up now you have to use reason to
differentiate the quality of the answers but the fact that those answers
manifest themselves in the field of your consciousness
that's revelation oh no no it isn't it's based on my
previous empirical observations the world i say not just
what would happen it's way more than that it's way more than that what would happen
no no no no sure it's based on the entire history of your biology
if you lock theoretical physicists in a room yeah for 40 years and ask them to
come up with a theory the theories they come up with
would have no relation to the world around us
because they constantly have to be prodded and changed
by by observation and experience of course of course
and the and the brilliant insight i've had you know gosh i used i
there are times in my life i've had a brilliant insights and i wrote them
down as papers nature didn't happen to agree with them
of course and so that's what i mean i didn't say
i didn't say that that kind of revelation was infallible by any
stretch of the imagination it's not and that's partly why you have to discuss
it with other people i guess i think of no well it defines it once again and
it's all epistemology i suppose and that's why i'm a
that's why i'm a physicist and not a philosopher a psychologist i guess but
you know when you say that oh what do you mean by knowledge
to me knowledge is an understanding of the the way the world works
that's what do you mean by works the way it functions so you make predictions
and you if you understand the way the world works if i say
if this happens now that will happen then yes to me you know that's just a very
pedestrian thing it's why i'm a physicist but that's i guess what how i
would define knowledge what how would you define it
well i think that knowledge is basically experienced in relationship to
action and predictions about the outcomes of actions so we're so we agree
oh yes yes yes and then that kind of knowledge can only come from experience
then no because you can't you can't say how the world's going to work
if you haven't next if you haven't watched at how the world worked up to now
but you know that that's not true because well because the apparatus that
you're using to acquire that knowledge of the world
is like three and a half billion years old
and all of that had to come for you to draw those conclusions from the
experience that presents itself so revelation is definitely a consequence
of your experience with the world but think about the platform that's doing
that there's revelation i think it's just reason applied to observation right
that you could call that revelation if you want it's my reasonable rational
mind yeah but where do you think over where does what i see
fair what fair enough well where does thought come from
where does thought come from you're supposed to tell me you're the
psychologist i am telling you no no no but i'm saying it bubbles up from the
depths right there's no doubt look and i'm not i'm not being naive i you know
again we've talked about this before and you made this other wonderful statement
about reason being the slave of the passions and i'll buy that so i'll
understand that there are all sorts of human reasons why i do what i do
and i pretend afterwards it's rational thinking
but the not but the knowledge ultimately comes when
all of that is is filtered by the results of experiments
that so so that so that yeah there may be all sorts of
things reasons i do things i don't understand why i'm doing them
but the knowledge that comes out of it doesn't come from any of those reasons
or any that internal machinations it comes from a
from a process that eventually i can compare to reality
and test it and then its knowledge but it doesn't come from just sitting there
and saying the world works this way because who the hell knows how the
world works unless you unless you observe the world yes
constantly look most of that i'm in complete agreement with
but but we think about the scientific process
i mean one of the things that we don't teach young researchers is how to
generate hypotheses yes like hypotheses hypothesis
testing okay so now you want to generate hypotheses well here's
something you can do that will help read a lot
widely a lot yeah right and then ask yourself some questions and
hypotheses will come bubbling up okay are they knowledge
no they're proto knowledge but they're absolutely in fact i wanted to read you
not only read a lot but that's one of the problems you may not get this as a
say oh you may because people are fascinated with the consciousness
so you may get some of this but as a physicist i get this all the time
i get every day people writing me five times a day with their
theories of of the of everything and well intentioned people i don't want to
put them down they thought hard they've done it
but what they don't realize is that you the the hypotheses
the to get good hypotheses to which is really asking good questions which is
something we talked about earlier which is really what it's all about
requires a lot of baggage you have to have read a lot you have to in
in order to know what the good questions are you have to know
where the current state of knowledge is and so the problem with all of these
letters i get is they're well intentioned but they don't know
they don't have all the baggage that goes along with it and it's hard to tell
people oh you really have to well you can't yeah but i mean it's it's it's
sad to say to people this is nice but you really haven't you don't understand
all the precursors that are necessary to get to the point where your question
makes sense yes you don't also don't understand how ruthless
you have to be in killing off your own beloved hypotheses
absolutely and right and yeah that's right but but again to be fair to them
these people they haven't had the opportunity to do that yet
yes just at the early stages of their person but you but you have to have
the built as you say to get to the right hypotheses you have to read a lot
or at least or either that or experienced a lot i mean
that's the other way you can do it and or you know if you're Richard Feynman
instead of reasoning by experiencing i mean you you know you write 60 000 pages of
equations and you've figured out a lot so you now know how to address any
situation because you have a lot of intellectual you have a lot of this
baggage you have a lot of intellectual armor with you so you know how to
address situation a b c and d because you've prepared for that and
some of what you're saying when i when i read you and and i'm being generous
um it is you're saying look as an adult you have to get that intellectual
armor as well you have had to have the bad experiences
you've had to have these things so you know that the world can be a bad place
as well as a good place and you're prepared for it and you have
you have the armor so when someone is mean to you you know that you know you
can respond to different ways you can become resentful
which is the you know in in that particular you can become bitter
and resentful and all the rest or you can say let you know let me let me take
it an attitude that makes my life better rather than worse
and that's part of the armor that i think you're trying to provide people with
and so yeah part of it is sure i'm trying to to ask broadly speaking
do we actually want things to be worse you are exactly and that's why both of
you react so both you and i react the same way so bitterly to these people who
not only feel victimized but these people who want to
make sure that no one the makes the impossible
happen which is that no one ever has anything bad happen to them
because you because you you you do poignantly say at one point i i wrote
down this is the point where he's really getting something deep
and it's where you talk about the fact i think the example of the young girl
who never has any who's protected her whole life and never has any
anything bad happen to her and oh it's a Maleficent it's the example again
you see you always have to use these two stories which to me don't add
anything but to others they might but but um the notion that it's going to come
back and bite you in the butt literally or the finger if you if you if you've
been protected from the recognition that bad things can happen and how to deal
with them that and that they never should happen
and if they happen to you that's unfair then you don't understand that the
world is unfair and you better be prepared for a world that's unfair
yes and if you've protected your children from
all snakes then you're the snake yeah okay well i think there we agree
let me let me the last thing i'm gonna do i mean we could there's so many ways
tangents and maybe we'll have a whole bunch more i would also say lauren so
something we should think about temperamentally too you know
so people like you speaking broadly and respectfully because i know lots of
people like you they're more thing oriented in their
thinking right that's what makes you interested in physics and engineering
that's a real temperamental difference and you would be less inclined to stories
no i love i love stories in fact when i write i write stories but i i guess i
think of them as a hawk to understand something else rather
than something deep within themselves i guess that's the difference between you
i love stories because i think they're a useful way of explaining
a useful way of getting people interested and and but but for me the
underlying what i would call the underlying reality is more interesting
than the story well think of a map map is an interesting
thing so because a map you know they're maps
meaning there are no maps in your book well stories are maps i know but you're
looking for them to see if there are any maps well think about a map though
because a map in some sense is an objective representation of the
territory but in some sense it's not because the only thing that's on the
map are things that people find valuable
and so even in that you see this weird interplay of narrative and reality right
course it's a map it's it's it if it isn't accurately laid on the
world you don't get to where you want to go yeah but it only shows you where you
want to go right exactly you might want to go
or the author of the map thinks you might want to go which is always
frustrating for me when i look at maps because they often or where the
consensus has and look at a map most of it's like really vague
yeah why well because you don't want to go there
and so and that is really in some sense how we look at the world is we we we
put a map on it and it's a narrative filter out where we are
absolutely yeah and and i defer to you in that sense because you're
i mean because yeah because you you you're interested in the psyche and you
know much more about it than i do but i guess
i don't give it a higher priority i say yes
that is the way humans interact with the world but to me
that's that's of some interest but it's not
of key interest to me what's interesting is the world
right not so much not so not so much the way the humans well that that's fair
that's fair and and look at how where it's got us i mean
we can't underplay the power of of that kind of thinking
but one question that haunts me continually is
well what does the fact that that's the way we look at the world
say about the world itself and then that gets
tough because it's start because you start to have to have conversations
like well what do you mean the world exactly well no but that you really to
hit it that what that question you ask what is how
the way we look you said it very well the way we look the world so what does it
say about the world itself yes and to me i think that is a dangerous path
it represents it to me it says a lot about how how
how we learn as human beings to understand the world
and deal with the world evolutionarily and successfully or
unsuccessfully which as a psychologist i think you know you're trying to help
people avoid the latter but i think it's i i'm
wary about the claim that you can use that to understand the world itself
i didn't i didn't claim that i didn't claim that you could i claimed that it
was an interesting question but i'm gonna put an interesting question i'm
going to put a knot in your tail in one way i think hopefully okay
well one of the things that's happened in biology and i think i probably have to
stop after this because i'm getting okay i have one question i have to do one
just one question after this sure okay okay okay so
one of the key insights of darwin that was underplayed by biologists for
decades but has recently come back more into
favor is the fact that a lot of our being and that of many other
creatures was a consequence not of natural selection per se but of sexual
selection okay now sexual selection is mediated by
consciousness certainly i'll buy that consciousness shaped evolution
okay we evolved to adapt to what's real
what does that say about consciousness and its reality
now the the religious stories one of the things that's interesting about them
is they claim a kind of primacy for consciousness
that isn't in keeping generally speaking with the scientific viewpoint
but if consciousness is so deeply structured into reality that it
selected us then it's real man now but what do you mean real
well that's that's the rub and it's not an
invasion it's like no no wait a second here like
is consciousness just epiphenomenal well it seems pretty similar across animal
species so that's interesting and maybe it's epiphenomenal
maybe it's not i mean i don't know because i don't understand consciousness
at all i don't know what consciousness is right i i i'm and far i i don't even
know if we have other there's big debates i thought of whether other
species have consciousness per se and that in at least
in the way that you know humans well they don't seem to have this
elaborated self-consciousness for sure yeah self-conscious right right and
some of them can recognize themselves in a mirror but they don't have
they don't have an elaborated self-consciousness and as i say yeah
i mean that's and you're right and that's a deep question and one it's one of
the i said to you at the last time we talked that's one of the reasons i
became a physicist because it's too complicated for me
i still i've talked to many people no one's given me a definition of
consciousness that i can yet understand and and and and yeah well i think i
think the i don't think the problem of the question of what consciousness is i
don't think that's an epist... epistemological question i think it's an
ontological question it's like way down there
it's certainly way down there i you know what someone once said to me i don't
know if we i said that last time it was interesting observation
that you could tell how little we know about something by the number of books
that are written about it more the more books written the less we know and
there's tons of books about consciousness there are a few books
about quantum mechanics because we you know once dirac wrote down quantum
mechanics you don't have to write another book about it
let me let me read you two quotes this is the last thing i want to do and maybe
i'll just we may not even be a question to me this
illustrates in some sense the difference of our psyches
okay there's a quote here in in in in beyond order
first a question what is the world made of to answer this
we will need to consider reality the world
as it is fully experienced by someone alive and awake
with all the richness of subjective being left intact
dreams sensory experiences feelings drives and fantasies
this is the world that manifests itself to or better
that you meet that you meet head on with your unique
individual consciousness i think that encapsulates a lot of what you've just
been saying but it reminded me of a quote from
one of the people i admire most as a science popularizer and maybe as a
scientist jacob brunowski who who who more than carl
sagan i think did a wonderful i just hold him in the
highest regard and his here's the quote from him dream or
nightmare we have to live our experience as it is
and we have to live it awake we live in a world which is
penetrated through and through by science and which is both whole
and real we cannot turn it into a game
simply by taking sides and so i think that is the that maybe
maybe that's a good place to end because i think it's a great beginning point
of a further dialogue between you and me because i view his view
and the two are very closely related the two statements
but they have very different perspectives i think and and i and and
look i really like the questions you know and and i know you were
apprehensive to some degree about peppering me with them but
i'm perfectly happy although it's difficult to be questioned in that
manner like i i know that many of these things are
seem obscure and they were a bloody obscure to me when i was first starting
to figure them out but the questions that you
threw at me are questions that people have all the time about
what i'm trying to talk about and what people like Jung were trying to talk
about i mean he's even more impenetrable than me
so that's why i don't read philosophy but very much but i have i i gotta admit i
pretend i don't but i have but um uh but no look look i wanted
look if i didn't think it was worth parsing what you're saying i wouldn't
have i i absolutely understand that and um and i'm
sorry because i agree with you i love the questions and
i told myself when i was preparing this let me just let Jordan ask me questions
because it's so much more interesting for me
than than than the other way around but i thought i owed it to you to ask you
those questions but there's a whole bunch of questions that i know you still
had for me which i'd hope to have in the last hour of this
talk we of this discussion we haven't done it again
well let's do it again yeah let's let's agree to do it again and i hope you've
enjoyed it and i hope it's in some of the
things we're new and i hope that for people listening that they'll
that this will provide additional insights into both you and the things
you're saying and and for me it's always i was going to say a revelation but i
won't use that word but it's but it's but it's it's
fascinating for me to learn so i've really enjoyed it and i really do
appreciate your time and uh and um yeah this is uh just the
beginning i hope of of more thank you thank you
yes well and i it's a great compliment to be taken seriously
i can i i understand that you know yeah no in fact i i i think that's maybe
what charmed me about when we first talked to me is the questions you had
you know it's good people react a lot better when they're taken
seriously but i do and and and and you were and i'm glad that you feel that
way
