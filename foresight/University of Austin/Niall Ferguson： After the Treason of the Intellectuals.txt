We really want to welcome you into the beating heart of this organization now
And you've had some fantastic models already
Of what great citizen leaders look like you've had a really good look at the kind of people
That we are going to invest in you so that you can become
I'm going to turn over to Joe. He's going to give a few remarks and then Joe will throw Daniel. Thank you, Joe
Thank you, Ben
Neil Ferguson is one of the I guess great minds in our world
He jokes there's not there's not too many other geniuses going into history these days, but I think he definitely meets that bar
You know, it's true. Unfortunately a lot of the departments have become so politicized that you don't get a lot of great minds there anymore
But he he's definitely you know a top thinker who's at Oxford at Harvard at Stanford
So when I learned a lot from every time I interact with him and Neil
It's really awesome to be your partner in building this and thanks for everything you're doing
Well, thank you, Joe
Thank you everybody
For being here tonight
I'm being told to shout I
Can shout and I have a lot to shout about tonight. I
Was asked to talk to you
Seriously
academically, I
Have some content for you tonight
Let me begin with the quotation. It's the epigraph of a book
The world is suffering from a lack of faith
in a transcendental truth
Those words are written by a man named Julian Bonda a French
intellectual in a book published in the later 1920s
La traison des clerks
Normally translated as the treason of the intellectuals
It's a book worth reading
When he used the word clerks
What bond our men was quote all those whose activity is not the pursuit of practical aims
All those who seek their joy in the practice of an art of science or metaphysical speculation
We would say intellectuals perhaps academics
People like me who are not clever enough to be founders of great companies like Joe
This is what Bender observes
At the end of the 19th century he wrote a fundamental change occurred
The clerks began to play the game of political passions
The man who had acted as a check on the realism of the people began to act as its
Stimulators and share in the chorus of hatreds among races and political factions
The characteristics of today's clerks
He said were the tendency to action
The thirst for immediate results the exclusive preoccupation with the desired end the scorn for argument the excess
the hatred the fixed ideas
quote
They betrayed their duty, which is precisely to set up a corporation whose soul cult is
That of justice and of truth instead he wrote
The intellectuals of his day embraced quote
The cult of the strong state and the military spirit
The logical end
He wrote of the integral realism professed by humanity today
Is the organized slaughter of nations or classes? This is an amazing passage get this I
Can well imagine this is the mid 1920s and published in the late 1920s
I can well imagine a future war
When a nation would decide not to look after the enemy wounded I
Can imagine them priding themselves on getting free from stupid humanitarianism
The book is prophetic
It's an amazing prophecy of precisely what happened in World War two when the systematic neglect of prisoners
By the Nazis was a characteristic feature of the war on the Eastern Front now
Why am I telling you all this?
Because the intellectuals of our time have also committed treason
Now superficially
There's a difference
The intellectuals of the 1920s lent to the right
Many endorsed fascism while today's intellectuals generally lean to the left, but in practice
It makes very little if any difference
because the harm is done as
Soon as a professor
Takes it upon himself or herself
To be a political activist
It's that moment when the line is crossed
From this and shaft
From scholarship or science to politic to politics. That is the fatal moment
As he was writing the treason of the intellectuals German professors were already
well on the way to providing
Justifications for the anti-Semitism that would be the foundation of Hitler's Third Reich
in our time
American professors have become apologists for the anti-Semitism and
terrorism of Hamas and
I mean it very seriously when I say
that the fate of the great German universities of
Heidelberg of Tumigen of Marburg
their fate in the 1930s and 1940s is
A terrible warning to the elite universities of the United States
How bad you may say are our established universities, let me tell you
According to the foundation for individual rights and expression the number of campus de-platforming attempts
Soared to a record high last year. There were
137 up from 81 in
2022
Let's look at the latest heterodox academy report
In 2022, which is the most recent data we have
59% of students
Reported be reluctant to discuss at least one of five
controversial topics they were asked about
62% of students said that was because quote other students would make critical comments with each other after class
63% of students. This is in universities across the country
Agreed that the climate on their campus
Prevented people from saying things they believe because the because others might find these views offensive
Now what is remarkable is that when you look and I have looked at the data for individual universities?
There is scarcely any real difference
Chicago is more or less the same as
Harvard which comes bottom of the fire rankings for free speech
It turns out that we have a nationwide problem. It isn't just Harvard and
it cannot possibly be healthy for our Republic if
60% of students in universities across the country feel they cannot speak their minds in class
Let's talk about the illiberalism of the liberals
The Charlie Institute, which is that North Dakota State asked a series of fascinating questions
And I want to share them with you because I think the results will stun you
Question and this was a survey again of students in four-year programs
Across the country a large sample
If many students disagree with the views of someone who has been invited to speak on campus
Should the university withdraw the invitation?
Liberal and liberal leaning students said yes in 39% of cases
Conservatives were on 17%
Question if a required reading for a college class
Includes content that makes students feel uncomfortable. Should that reading be dropped as a requirement?
Liberal and liberal leaning students 42% said yes
Now get this
question
If a professor says something that students find offensive should that professor be reported to the university
85% of liberal and liberal leaning students said yes
Question if a student says something that students find offensive should that student be reported to the university
76% of self-described liberal and liberal leaning students said yes
In these conditions, of course education becomes indoctrination
Question have the classes and other academic activities you've participated in during the college year changed your view of
the United States
7% of liberal and liberal leaning students said it had made their views more positive
55% more negative
Amongst the conservative and conservative leaning students 18% said it had made their views more positive
But 32% a third said the experience had made their views of the United States more negative
Do you understand why we're building a new university yet?
How do we explain this what's the reason?
Why has this
quasi-totalitarian atmosphere
Spread so rapidly through American higher education and beyond because of course it spreads
downwards into K through 12 and outwards into corporate America. I think
John Hates my good friend and Greg Lukianoff my good friend
Came up with a plausible sounding answer in a book that some of you will know the coddling of the American mind
And their answer was essentially that parenting had produced a series of erroneous
assumptions about the nature of life and
Now Jonathan has published a new book in which he explains
the epidemic of mental ill health amongst young Americans
By blaming cell phones and social media. I
Respect these
Arguments, but I don't think those are the right explanations for what has gone wrong. I
Think there are two reasons
The first is the extraordinary and worsening political skew
amongst
academics amongst the professors and the second which is just as bad is the tendency of university leaders and
administrators to appease or even encourage the new red guards in a kind of parody
version of Mao's cultural revolution
Now it's often said that
Professors are always left-wing like it's just the way things are really was that the problem in 1920s Europe?
Was that the problem in 1930s Germany? No, there's no pre-ordained
Law that says professors are always liberal
Nor is it the case that it's a steady state
There's an article from 2005 by Rothman Lichter and Nebbit, which shows that in 1984
Significant date in this context perhaps
39% of the American professoriate on average described itself as left
By 1999 that had risen to 72%
And our for today, it's basically 95%
So this is not a steady state
There has been a pronounced
Swing to the left in academia
Mitchell Langbert did an amazing sample of the politics of nearly
9,000 tenure-track PhD holding professors
From 51 of the 66 top ranked colleges in the US News and World Report of 2017
and he had Dave was able to find data on
A pretty substantial proportion 60% for political registration and that allowed him to calculate
some interesting statistics
39% of the colleges in his sample were Republican free. They had no registered Republicans amongst the professors
78% of departments in his sample either had zero Republicans or so few as to make almost no difference
And the ratios are great
So the mean Democratic to Republican ratio amongst professors in the sample was 10.4 to 1
But that was skewed by the inclusion of the two military colleges at West Point and Annapolis
Which are the only institutions in America which have a rough political balance in their faculty
So if you take them out
You discover that the real ratio is actually 13 to 1 in my subject history
17.4 to 1
in English literature
48 to 1
And in anthropology you can't calculate it because you can't have a ratio of something to zero
But you say Neil you pessimistic Scotsman
The tide is turning it's turning because
Two presidents of eminent colleges have resigned
Liz McGill at Penn and Claudine Gay at Harvard and so we must have passed peak woke
The pendulum that people love to tell me about have you been told about the pendulum I'd love to see this pendulum
It must be a very big clock
Because this pendulum been swinging for as long as I can remember. Oh, it's about to swing the other way really
So let me read some headlines from the Harvard Crimson
Since Claudine Gay
Was forced to resign not just for her complete mishandling of the events that followed October the 7th
But also because of her serial plagiarism which included even plagiarizing the acknowledgments in one of her publications
Remarkable feet by any standards
They're January 3rd in
Gays fall a McCarthyist tragedy
January 3rd again
Gays resignation is not a win against anti-semitism
January the 4th rebuffing calls to resign penny Pritzker 81 will stay in top Harvard Corporation posts
January the 5th ex-Harvard president Claudine Gay acknowledges mistakes calls critics demagogues
Pendulum is really swinging back isn't it January the 18th Harvard alumni split over Claudine Gay's resignation amid
controversy
February the 3rd Zuckerberg-Ackman backed Harvard Overseer candidates fail to qualify for ballot
February the 7th, this is my favorite
Plagiarism is the rights newest weapon Harvard must disarm it
You can't make this stuff up. This is not Babylon B. This is the Harvard Crimson
February the 7th same day
Investing in trans inclusion isn't a choice. It's Harvard's imperative February the 11th
Pro-Palestine groups rally demand Harvard divest ties to Israel
and remember back on December the 10th more than
700 faculty members signed a letter to the Harvard Corporation
urging them to resist calls from outside forces to remove Claudine Gay from her post if
You believe the pendulum has begun to swing in the other direction
I have copies of the Harvard Crimson to sell you
Now here is why the pendulum can't possibly swing at these established institutions
Because if you think the professors of my generation are
politically
doctrinaire
Let me introduce to you to their successors
My good friend Eric Kauffman who recently moved to the University of Buckingham asked people at US universities
If they agreed with this proposition
quote
My fear of losing my job or reputation due to something I said or posted online is a
Justified price to pay to protect historically disadvantaged groups. I don't mind being cancelled
If it helps the marginalized
Well, you won't be surprised to hear that of my age group
60 plus 15 percent agreed with that statement
In their fifties twenty percent agreed get into the age group of the forties a third agreed
Two-fifths of people in their thirties agreed
45% of those in their twenties and more than half of people questioned aged between 18 and 25
So the future of academia is anything but a swing rightward of the pendulum
Kauffman our social science and humanities staff and PhDs if they would support one or more campaigns to oust dissenting academics
Whether they criticize DEI non-traditional parenting unrestricted immigration or said something nice about empires, which I'm afraid I have done
24% of US faculty and
20% of Canadian faculty would have supported at least one of those dismissal campaigns
But the proportion rises to 49% of US and Canadian PhD students
20% of US academics openly admitted to
discrimination against right-leaning academics grants applications and
12% admitted to discriminating against right-leaning paper submissions or promotion applications
But when you turn to PhDs
24% openly admit to discriminating against right-leaning paper submissions and fully a third to
discriminating against right-leaning grant bids
The politicization is quite overt and it is going to get worse
Because the institutions continue to hire to the left of the tenured faculty
The cultural revolution of our time the totalitarian regimes on our campuses are not about to go away
What can we do
The only possible answer in the face of what I've described to you must be to found new institutions
as
Thomas Jefferson did with the University of Virginia as William Rainey Harper did with the University of Chicago as
We are doing with the University of Austin
It was in this very house that we announced
that we were doing it and
It's just two years ago
and some of you may remember
Derision the opprobrium the abuse that rained down upon us from a hostile establishment
But we are going to do this and we have to do this
We must do this
We're going to solve
The five core problems of
University governance that I believe explain why all the universities have gone down the same
totalitarian brain
First we're going to address the failing pseudo corporate structure of governance that allows
Infectual or negligent trustees and
Overmighty politically active
presidents
That's not an option here
We're going to address the fact that in other universities. There is no judicial branch of government and therefore no due process
We will be the first university with a real Constitution and
Real due process because our Constitution will be upheld by the equivalent of a Supreme Court
We through our Constitution will make it impossible
To politicize the work of the University of Austin. It will be unconstitutional
For the University to take
Exificio political positions. It will be wrong and a
Sackable offense for professors to abuse their power to indoctrinate students
We will uphold
Students basic rights of free expression and free association, which everywhere else in America are being violated
And I know we will succeed and you know why I know
Because of the mood in this room and
the mood I experienced today in the Scarborough building and
The mood last night when Barry Weiss was talking to Roland Frat two of my heroes
The mood contrasted so amazingly with the atmosphere. I had encountered earlier this week
At one of the most established and venerable universities where I had been invited to lecture
My week was like starting in East Berlin
circa 1970 and arriving in a completely different
downtown
Free society with people kindred spirits who know
That freedom the individual freedom is the city qua non for the pursuit of truth
This is why we won't fail
This is why we must succeed
This has been an amazing the uplifting two days for me just as the earlier part of my week made me feel physically sick. I
Kept expecting the Stasi to burst into my bedroom and take me off
A hundred
Intrepid young people
Some of whom are here tonight are going to be in the founding class. I guess it'll be the class of 2028
And this is going to have bragging rights like nothing else that this generation can possibly achieve
We are in the midst of hiring and I know how much work
My colleagues are putting into this the world-class faculty to teach them and to teach them
So the highest possible
pedagogical standard
One dirty little secret of the Ivy League is that most of the teaching sucks
But I know because I hear what people say about Patrick Gray, I know that we are going to set a new standard
for excellence in the classroom
In our classrooms, there'll be no checking
Videos on tiktok because I certainly won't have any devices
In our classrooms, I will have a Chatham house rule
You can't leave the classroom and start attributing things that were said to any individual by name
What said in the classroom will stay in the classroom
In our classrooms people will be free to say whatever comes to mind however stupid
I
Specialized in saying stupid and offensive things as an undergraduate at Oxford
It was how I learned
Got so bad that one of my tutors once said
Neil have you considered the career in the police?
And it's very lucky that I didn't go into the police actually for the criminals of England
And this is just
This is just the beginning
This is just
the early stage
We're closing in I think I can say on our target for our first round of
fundraising
250 million dollars
closing in on that target now and
More and more donors are seeing that we're doing this and as they see that we're doing this
the support will grow and
As it grows so will the University of Austin
With your help and here I dress not the students
But the potential donors in the room we can keep on building not only our cool campus
And it is very very cool. I have to say it's way cooler than certain Ivy League institutions. I recently visited
Not only can we build that campus and make it a really extraordinary place with an extraordinary library
But we can also build like this is very important and online presence
So that our content
Can reach not only the lucky 100
But millions and millions of people less fortunate around the world
people like
my wife's family
Insomalia I
Dream of a day when University of Austin content can be accessed even there in the Horn of Africa
Well, we can build a brand where free ideas are available around the world and that is possible. I
Can remember a rather fraught conversation with Elon Musk about how quickly we could scale
You ATX come to think of it with Starlink
We can make this the biggest university on earth and our Mars campus is something
We'll talk about later Elon
So let me conclude
We have lived through a
Second treason of the intellectuals a
Second great betrayal of the vocation of intellectuals to pursue truth and not to engage in politics
And it doesn't matter that this time. It's a left-wing
Politicization and not a right-wing one the net result is uncadly similar
What Bender said was that our mission should be the pursuit of
Transcendental truth and
We've said all along that that's what we're about the fearless pursuit of truth
And what I've come to realize ladies and gentlemen is how high the stakes are
Because if we do not succeed
The alternative is
To allow Western civilization and the world
To repeat the hideous mistakes of the mid 20th century
Thank you very much indeed
So
Actually, we don't really do lectures, but I was sort of told to go give a speech
What we really like is the Socratic method, which means now you get to ask me difficult questions and
Disagree with me and that's how we roll
You and Johanna have been in a debate for a while where I
Say that you want to be careful that you don't create the mirror opposite to the
Exclusion from the left and that you need to try to ensure that you have the pursuit of what you said where anybody can make a mistake
Say whatever they say, but
When I listen to your data, then I wonder if I was wrong where I keep pushing for that and maybe what you do need to do is bring
Strengthen I'm a centrist, but maybe what you need is more right wing people to counteract the left
Like so, how do you decide between?
Let truth be what you quest for that really create an environment where you're not trying to tilt the balance to produce
Ideologically conservative or right wing people, but just people that are critical thinkers
Versus the very reality just laid out where given the facts don't you need more academics that are gonna more people that are gonna then
Be able to counterweight what's happening?
Well, thank thanks for that question. I've been asked it many times
There are there are those who subscribe to a Sullivan's law that unless an institution is explicitly made conservative it will inevitably become
Progressive I don't believe that's true
And I've in fact, I think it's quite obviously untrue
that a university that pursues truth and
Clarifies that academia is not a political mission
Will attract the best scholars and
some of them will be conservatives and
some of them will be
Socialists and some of them will be liberals and some of them won't have any politics because they just do
physics
And that's how it should be
The Oxford of when I was an undergraduate
Was characterized by incredible diversity of thought
There were high Tories and
There were outright communists
One of my best friends as a young historian was Eric Hobbs bomb who was a card-carrying communist
about
Politics we disagreed entirely
But I respected him as a scholar and the author of great works of of 19th and 20th century history
So let's focus in our recruitment not on politics. Let's not even ask
Let's just make it clear
What the rules are?
Max Weber got this very right in an extraordinary
Dewey of lectures that he did in the time of the First World War
Politics is a vacation science is a vacation and he said these are separate
And when you enter the lecture hall or the classroom, you need to leave your politics
at the entrance
To the point that it shouldn't be possible for the students to know what your politics is. I
Think if we approach it in that spirit
And then we'll end up with intellectual diversity
It would I think be a great mistake for us to say to ourselves, let's let's lean to the right
To correct for that leaning to the left. There are others doing this
And I don't think it should be our approach, but thank you for asking
I'm always curious because you have an expansive view of not just us history, but global history
What elements that you see today have occurred in the past that sort of draw inspiration and strength for you and this journey and all of us and
What world events on the horizon tanks on the horizon?
Either have parallels of the past or may help us on this journey
Let me offer you two thoughts
The first is that
universities have the capacity
to
regenerate themselves
Oxford and Cambridge and you are a Cambridge man. I am an Oxford man went through periods of tour poor
18th century Oxford was so dead intellectually that Edward Gibbons said the years
He spent there were the most profitless of his life and he went on to be the greatest historian of the 18th century
so I think if we build this and
model academic freedom and model meritocracy and show how academic governance can work and how you can have academic freedom without the
abusers of tenure
slowly, it'll be glacial, but slowly
Harvard even Harvard will say to itself if we don't do something
Along these lines the smartest students are going to go there and the smartest
Future professors are going to go there and we will start to win not just in a fight for donors
But in all important fight for brains. I
Think we're already winning I can tell I
Can tell every single one of you every single student I've spoken to tonight has impressed me
by their intellectual sharpness and
By the obvious appetite they have to learn so if we build it eventually I'll be dead. I'll be dead
I'm not gonna be alive when Harvard fixes itself and
Gibbon didn't live to see Oxford fix itself, but we will bring a change
To higher education across the country. I'm confident of that, but it'll be glacial
The second thing I would say is that in the context of Cold War 2 which I believe we've been in for about five years
When our adversaries are becoming increasingly organized
When the People's Republic of China cooperates with the Russian Federation and cooperates with the Iranian Republic and
Corporates with North Korea. There is an axis of ill will far more real than the imagined axis of evil of 2002
and with every passing month this coordination becomes
More effective in that context
What we are doing is not just
Important for the pursuit of truth and the advance of science and literature and philosophy. It's important for national security
Because if we do not produce people
Who understand liberty and who can think freely?
We'll lose Cold War 2
One thing about the universe is
the established institutions
When the Cold War came the first time
They did their piece
They played a crucial role Joe alluded to this earlier in
Ensuring the national security of the United States
So I think the second great trend I see is that we are in the second Cold War
And we all have to recognize
That just because we won the first one there's no guarantee that we win the second
Especially if a totalitarian ideology has filtered into our
Educational system persuading young Americans that the United States was founded on white supremacy and it doesn't really matter if it goes down
Or persuading young Americans that in order to achieve
Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions liberty and democracy should be set aside. These ideas are current
In many ways the other side's game plan for Cold War 2 is a great deal more successful so far
In penetrating our society with their ideas
And so that is another motivation for me I don't have time
I don't know the years to wait for Harvard to fix itself or Stanford to fix itself and nor does the United States have time
We need to start producing a self-confident elite that believes in freedom and believes in this country
Because we don't have 20 years
The decisive battles may happen this decade
You can see why I chose to stand in front in front of a simulated apocalyptic landscape a
Lot of people
Put my generation down and are really pessimistic about it
But I'm seeing actually a lot of good signs and I'm kind of not even just this room
But hopeful for my generation you see the tick-tocks of people saying this work-a-day culture is just not
Right. It's not edifying and we need to move away from it and go back to the family
I mean you have sex workers on whatever podcast saying I want a family. That's the most beautiful thing you can have and yes
There there's this they have two opposing things that are happening in their minds
But they're they're seeing what is edifying and they're they they know it's good
So I wonder do you see that in our generation? I do I
think
That what is often described as an epidemic of mental ill health is actually something more
Profound than that
It's a recognition
that the status quo is
spiritually bankrupt
This is something my wife has written about recently and I find it very powerful I
Think your generation
Hates
The culture in the classrooms of the established universities. I don't think they enjoy self-censorship. Does anybody?
my impression is that
The students at the major university. I visited earlier this week. We're not having a great time
to put it mildly
So I think your generation is thirsting for just this
Just what we're building
When we were starting out, I remember saying to pan out. Hey, we should do some market testing
like just in case
We build it and nobody shows up
He kind of awkward and
So we did the forbidden courses Barry's brilliant description of our our summer school
And I remember thinking
Maybe no one will show up for that
Instead we were like inundated with inquiries and those
First classes which we had to hold in Dallas because we had no premises
Convinced me that it was going to be okay. It convinced me because the first class I did that I did a
Course a short course on the difference between free and unfree societies and the readings were just primary sources about what?
It's lived to what it's like to live in a totality and regime
It's like this is what it was like to be in Hitler's Germany. This is what it was like to be in Stalin's Soviet Union
Here's an account of being Mao's China. Here's Iran under the Ayatollah's
It was a straightforward course and the content was quite
harrowing and
In the course of the first day
I could see the students who were all in existing undergraduate programs from all over the country and sometimes from abroad
If they had this look about
Is this real can we actually I?
Mean we can just say say these things and he's not gonna
Mind in fact, he's encouraging us and I don't know if you're Beethoven fans, but in Fidelio the prisoners are let out
It's the most moving thing in in in all of opera really the prisoners are let out and they sing this extraordinary
Chorus about what it's like to be
in the free air
And it was just like that
That was when I knew your generation was going to be okay
Because actually this was what they had been thirsting for
thirsting for free uninhibited debate and the right to take risks
Because I remember when you're an undergraduate
When you're answering a question is risky because you really don't know and you've just done the reading and some of what was kind of difficult and
Professors of a way of asking weird questions, and so you're like here goes I
Remember people used to say I don't know if this is what you're looking for
At Harvard this is what they would say. I don't know professor if this is what you're looking for
I'm not looking for anything except what you think
So it's going to be fine your generation is gonna be fine a good thing is
You're going to be one of the leaders of your generation
That's the key
The question I have for you is we talk about this contraction of academic freedom
And I wonder if I'm I want to ask you if there is a discreet moment that you can actually point to
Where you spotted the canary in the coal mine that just sort of tick your alarms. What a good question
I'm glad you asked. Yes. I remember exactly when it was it was 10 years ago
My wife for those of you who don't know a yarn her see Ali
I think a much more interesting person than me who's stood up for women's rights
Like a real feminist who really is prepared to put her life on the line to speak up for women's rights
So she had been invited to give the commencement address at Brandeis University
And we were like nice
I mean do it so she accepted and then
Like a week before the event
They publicly disinvited her
Without warning that was public announcement disinvitation of I on her see Ali and
The moment the epiphany for me came
When I went and I looked at the petition that had been sent to the president of Brandeis
And I looked at the list of all the faculty members who'd signed that petition calling for my wife
To be disinvited accusing her of Islamophobia
And I listed the name I have kept it
Because I'm from Glasgow
And I don't forgive that kind of thing
The professor of queer studies
Who had discovered some inexplicable kinship with the Islamists the Islamists and all the others it was a curious
alliance of people
Who had decided that my wife should not be
Invited but should be disinvited and publicly humiliated that was when I realized that there was a very
unholy alliance forming between
The radical left we hadn't let learnt to call them woke then
Islamists and others and
It suddenly hit me that I hadn't really noticed but this had been going on everywhere even at Harvard
So it was ten years ago
And the worst thing about the last ten years is that for nearly all that time
I couldn't make people see if they weren't in the Academy
What was going on I?
Couldn't make them see they would just listen to me. Oh, yeah, Neil. Sure
And the strangest thing that I could never have predicted
Was that the events of October the 7th terrorist attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad on Israeli civilians
Would finally cause the scales to fall from the eyes of so many of my friends outside the Academy
Who had been ignoring our warnings for so long?
So it's taken ten years, but that was for me the beginning
And I hope very much that what we're doing now
What we're doing this weekend what we're gonna do as we build this university is
It's the cure
It's the solution
It's the beginning of a successful
Institutional counter because as I said there ain't no pendulum
What there is in American history is a pattern of renewal through founding
This country itself is a start-up once
The start-up that produces the United States
And that's why we consciously based our Constitution on the Constitution of the United States the separation of powers idea the idea that you
Need a judicial branch just came from the founding fathers
I've been playing at James Madison
But with a very strong sense that this is the American solution
You don't just wait for the pendulum to do it for you
You have to do it yourselves and what is exciting and I want to I
Want to thank you all
As a relatively recently minted American
For the fact that you're up for this
Because you could never do this in England
You could never do this in Germany we have a German
Potential student here tonight constant where I can do this in Germany, right?
Exactly, that's why you're here only in America ladies and gentlemen
Can you start a new university and go from we're doing this to admitting students in a two-year time frame and
and the more the haters hate
Stronger we get that's what I love about America. So ladies and gentlemen, I've probably talked too long
But I'm passionate about what we're doing. It's the most exciting project of my life
Aside from my aside from my children
And I have two who can come here by the way, I mean, I am selfishly building it for them
It's kind of positive externality that you get to come to
But I can't tell you how thrilled I am by what we're doing
How optimistic I am and I'm not normally I'm not famous for my optimism
How optimistic I am that we're going to succeed and I'm absolutely certain I am that the first class of a hundred
Are going to just have the ultimate
Bragging rights for their lives. This will be the thing that people will hate you for and envy you for
It's going to be it's going to be a killer at dinner parties
You can just imagine it going around the table where did you go? I went to Walksford
I went to Harvard
And where did you go?
Well, I I was one of the founding scholars at the University of Austin
Silence
Just people just
Jaws hit the table
That's what it's going to be like. That that's what's so exciting
Ladies and gentlemen, we've we've got drink
We've got food
We've got arguments to have because we're we're here to disagree. Remember. We're not here to have any kind of conformist line
Thank you for listening. Here's to us
You
