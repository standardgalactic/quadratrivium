Processing Overview for code.talks (ehem. Developer Conference)
============================
Checking code.talks (ehem. Developer Conference)/code.talks 2019 - Create stunning 3D web experiences with Babylon.js.txt
1. **WebXR Support for AR**: BabylonJS supports WebXR for augmented reality experiences on the web, allowing users to interact with 3D content using their fingers instead of controllers.

2. **BabylonJS for 2D/2.5D**: While BabylonJS is great for 2D.5D development due to its ability to handle layers and depth, it's best suited for full 3D applications. However, there's also a 2D version of BabylonJS if needed.

3. **Internet Explorer Support**: BabylonJS still supports Internet Explorer, which is important for backward compatibility and handling bugs in legacy browsers.

4. **Importing Models and Materials**: BabylonJS can import models from various software (like 3DS Max, Maya, Unity, Blender) into the GLTF format, which is supported by BabylonJS. The team is working towards making all imports go through GLTF to streamline the process.

5. **Accessibility for Designers**: BabylonJS is accessible for designers, especially with tools like the sandbox, where users can drag and drop models and use an inspector to edit them visually. There's also a viewer tool that can be embedded into web pages for displaying 3D objects and controls.

6. **Streaming 3D Geometry**: It is possible to stream 3D geometry between a server and client, enabling open-world level experiences. BabylonJS handles the client side, but the streaming process needs to ensure compatibility with BabylonJS on the backend.

7. **Lunch Break**: A reminder that there's going to be lunch during the break, so attendees should feel free to take a break and refuel.

Remember, for any further questions or clarifications, you can approach the speaker after the break.
