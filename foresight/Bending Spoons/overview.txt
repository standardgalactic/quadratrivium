1. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun operating and is producing vast amounts of infrared data about the deep universe. AI will play a significant role in analyzing this data due to its ability to process and interpret large datasets much more efficiently than human grad students.

2. AI has already been successfully used in astronomy for tasks such as identifying stars within galaxies, detecting anomalies, and discovering new phenomena. Its use is expected to become nearly ubiquitous among astrophysicists within the next decade.

3. The combination of AI with astronomical research allows scientists to explore the cosmos at a level of detail and scale that was previously unimaginable, enabling breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.

4. Future projects will undoubtedly continue to leverage AI to extract meaningful insights from the data collected by instruments like the JWST, pushing the boundaries of what we can learn about the cosmos.
