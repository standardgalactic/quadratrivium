Last night, Trump held a rally in Kentucky
to support Kentucky Governor and Guy trying to get you
to invest in his CBD energy drink.
Matt Bevin.
Bevin is up for the election today,
and he needs all the help he can get.
In a poll earlier this year,
he was the least popular governor in the United States.
Kentucky hasn't had a leader this unpopular
since Governor Jonathan Fourhead vestigial twin von
horse fondler.
At the rally,
Trump leaned into Bevin's unpopularity.
Now he is difficult.
I have to say, you know,
maybe it cost him the election, but it's okay.
Here, look.
He's such a pain.
But isn't that really what you wanted,
Governor?
I believe it.
That's what you want.
He's such a pain in the ass,
but that's what you want.
You know things you don't like.
Don't you love them?
But pain in the ass that Trump still wants you to vote for.
Could he be talking about himself, yes?
Well, check out his new ad campaign.
Trump to change Washington.
And sometimes when the lifeguard wants everyone out of the pool,
he takes a dump right in the deep end.
He's no Mr. Hygiene,
but sometimes it takes a pool pooper to get the job done.
Vote deep and turd 2020.
Keep on swimming.
But deep and turd.
Come on in, the water's brown.
But reminding you how much you don't like him
is just half of Trump's reelection strategy.
The other half is making the Democrats seem even worse.
The radical Democrats are going totally insane.
They want to obliterate the rule of law,
drive out faith from the public square,
silence you online,
confiscate your guns,
indoctrinate your children,
destroy anyone who holds traditional American values,
erase our traditions, our culture,
our history, and our heroes.
They want to subjugate you and break you to their will.
They want to bake a bald eagle into an apple pie,
replace football with rap music.
They want to get these radical Democrats
want to cast straight truck nuts
and make your dog a Muslim.
And on the 4th of July,
they're going to force all of Mount Rushmore
to gay marry each other.
No, no.
It's going to happen.
It's what they want.
Eggs into it.
Oh, wow.
Trump also went off on the media complaining
that they didn't give him enough credit
to trade the killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
They can take what we did two weeks ago
with the number one terrorist in the world
and they make it look as bad as possible.
In fact, I love dogs,
but they gave the dog full credit.
They didn't give me any credit.
The only one who gave that dog any credit was you.
You're the one who actually tweeted a Photoshop
of you awarding the dog a medal.
Okay, listen.
Look.
If you really wanted the credit,
maybe you should have tweeted this photo.
Okay.
Thank you, Conan.
Conan, right?
At one point,
Trump congratulated a nominee
for Kentucky Attorney General
and got a little distracted by his own words.
Thank you, Daniel.
A star is born.
A star is born.
Can you ever see that movie? A star is born.
I love a star is born.
I'm off the deep end.
Just read the transcript.
My favorite beef is ground.
I know they're hiding.
Dirt on Joe Biden.
We're close to impeachment now.
We're close.
It's the final shot of that movie.
It's the final shot of that movie.
It's the final shot.
Come on, stand at the top.
As you can see in that footage,
many Trump supporters were wearing T-shirts
T-shirts last night that said, read the transcript.
We did read the transcripts.
That's where we learned about Trump pressuring Ukraine.
This is like if Jeffrey Dahmer got arrested
while wearing a T-shirt that said, check the fridge.
We've got a great show for you tonight.
Elizabeth Banks is here, but when we return,
be quiet, join us.
