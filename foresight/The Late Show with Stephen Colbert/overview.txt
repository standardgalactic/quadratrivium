Checking The Late Show with Stephen Colbert/＂Read The Transcript＂ Is Trump's Latest Rallying Cry.txt
 Trump held a rally in Kentucky to support Matt Bevin, the state's unpopular governor who is up for reelection. At the rally, Trump acknowledged Bevin's unpopularity by joking that perhaps it cost him the election but went on to praise Bevin as a "pain in the ass" precisely because he's enacting policies that align with Trump's agenda. Trump also criticized the media for not giving him enough credit for taking out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, even though he claims to love dogs and was upset that the dog received all the praise.

Trump's reelection strategy seems to be a mix of highlighting his own achievements and policies while painting the Democrats as radical and extreme, aiming to create a dichotomy between their vision for America and traditional American values. He exaggerated the Democrats' positions on various issues, including gun control, LGBTQ rights, and cultural change, to portray them as a threat to traditional American values.

During the rally, Trump also seemed to get distracted by his own speech, referencing the movie "A Star Is Born" before transitioning into a discussion about the impeachment inquiry. The crowd at the rally wore T-shirts that read "Read the Transcript," which ironically points to the evidence that led to the impeachment inquiry based on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals, including Joe Biden.

The show concluded with a mention of Elizabeth Banks's appearance and a humorous reference to a religious singing act from "Acts 2" in the Bible, indicating a lighter note to end the segment.
