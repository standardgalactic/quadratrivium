WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
As with any 3D application, the interface and navigating that interface is one of the

00:12.960 --> 00:16.640
most important things to grasp when starting out with Blender.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.000
The interface in Blender is comprised of several different elements.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.040
Starting from the left to right, on the left side we have the toolbar, and this toolbar

00:24.040 --> 00:28.600
contains a multitude of tools that allow you to work directly with your 3D model.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.120
We'll start with some of these when we're in the modeling section, when we actually

00:32.120 --> 00:35.200
start looking at manipulating our objects.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.720
Right here in the center, we have the 3D viewport.

00:37.720 --> 00:42.440
The viewport is your view into the 3D world, and is where you will spend most of your time

00:42.440 --> 00:44.920
working directly with your objects.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.560
The viewport allows you to manipulate all the different objects within your scene, including

00:48.560 --> 00:52.560
the camera, the mesh, and the lights.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.240
Moving over to the top right, we have the Outliner.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.120
The Outliner is a display of all the different objects within your scene.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.080
It allows you to see what's connected to what, select those objects, and manipulate them

01:03.080 --> 01:04.600
in other ways.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.800
Although you won't use this a lot starting out probably, it is very essential when you

01:07.800 --> 01:12.560
start working with large scenes and you'll quickly begin to see how valuable it can be.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.740
Right below it, you can find the Properties panel.

01:14.740 --> 01:19.820
The Properties panel has a series of different properties along the header here, which all

01:19.820 --> 01:23.200
contain different settings relating to your scene.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.640
The default one are the Render properties that allow you to change things like image

01:27.640 --> 01:31.480
size, output formats, and whatnot.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.560
We'll explore a few of these here in this Getting Started series, here in a little while.

01:35.560 --> 01:40.160
For the time being though, it's a good thing to just explore and see what's what.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.220
Next, going back over to the bottom, we have the Timeline.

01:44.220 --> 01:50.480
The Timeline here is used during animation, and allows you to move your view through time.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.300
Now by default, you're not going to notice anything changing here, except for this number

01:54.300 --> 01:57.080
here, which refers to the frame number.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.360
The frame number is your number of frames per second, and we'll cover this more in the

02:01.360 --> 02:02.840
Intro to Animation.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.520
For the time being, let's go ahead and move on to Navigation.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.040
Navigation is one of the most essential things, as it's what allows you to move around your

02:12.040 --> 02:14.040
3D world.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.440
Since we're working with a full 3D object that allows us to manipulate it from every

02:19.440 --> 02:24.320
side and angle, it's important to be able to move around naturally.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.720
Now with your mouse over the 3D viewport, you can move around using a combination of

02:28.720 --> 02:31.080
hotkeys and the middle mouse button.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.960
If you just click your middle mouse button, you're able to rotate your view around or

02:34.960 --> 02:38.600
orbit your view around your model.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.680
This is good for viewing at any angle.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.620
However, it's also important to be able to pan your view, or move it from side to side

02:45.620 --> 02:51.620
and up and down, which you can do by holding SHIFT and middle click and dragging.

02:51.620 --> 02:56.620
You can also zoom your view by using the scroll wheel on your mouse, or the plus and minus

02:56.620 --> 02:59.980
keys on your keypad to zoom in and out.

02:59.980 --> 03:04.880
Obviously this is essential for viewing models closer, or getting real up close to details

03:04.880 --> 03:08.340
or far away to view an entire scene.

03:08.340 --> 03:12.800
Next there's even more, and it's necessary to be able to view your model from direct

03:12.800 --> 03:17.480
angles, such as the top, the front, the back, the side, etc.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.000
And this can be done by the keypad on your keyboard.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.040
Now do keep in mind that this is not the same as the top numbers 1 through 0 on your keyboard

03:25.040 --> 03:26.040
along the top.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.520
They are very different within Blender without changing a few settings.

03:29.520 --> 03:36.140
So if you do not have a keypad on your laptop, you can use the function keys and the JKL

03:36.140 --> 03:41.280
and those keys to compensate for your number pad, or you'll find a setting within the user

03:41.280 --> 03:44.080
preferences to emulate the number pad.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.440
For the time being, if you can use a number pad, I highly encourage it.

03:48.440 --> 03:53.480
This allows you to change directly to your individual views.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.080
The three most commonly used are top, front, and side.

03:57.080 --> 04:03.480
You can switch to top view by hitting 7 on your number pad, front by 1, side view by

04:03.480 --> 04:08.880
hitting 3, and then you can go to the opposite of each of those by holding down CTRL and

04:08.880 --> 04:18.760
hitting 7, 1 for back, 3 for side, or the left side, and of course the top was the bottom.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.080
You can also toggle between perspective and orthographic mode, orthographic being that

04:23.080 --> 04:27.480
there is no perspective applied to the viewport by hitting 5 on your number pad to toggle

04:27.480 --> 04:28.920
between the two.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.440
You'll normally use orthographic view while modeling directly from a reference and then

04:33.440 --> 04:38.880
perspective mode to check that you have not overcompensated anything and that everything

04:38.880 --> 04:43.080
is correct when viewed with perspective to make sure that everything is as it should

04:43.080 --> 04:44.880
be in the real world.

04:44.880 --> 04:51.520
Next, you can also use the 4, 6, and 8 on your keypad to rotate at increments around

04:51.520 --> 04:58.080
your model, and this can be helpful for getting a more direct, exact view to your model.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.880
And lastly on the number pad, you can use 0 to switch to your camera view.

05:02.880 --> 05:07.140
As you can see in the 3D view here, we have a camera object that allows us to see what's

05:07.140 --> 05:13.040
going on, and this acts just like a real world camera in that it captures the view, and so

05:13.040 --> 05:19.800
anytime you want to create an image or render an image out into a JPEG, PNG, or another

05:19.800 --> 05:25.840
image format, you use the camera to display what you want to view.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.440
And so by hitting 0 on the number pad, you can see that, and that will allow you to save

05:30.440 --> 05:31.960
out that image.

05:31.960 --> 05:37.120
Now we will cover that more directly in one of the later sections in rendering, but for

05:37.120 --> 05:42.160
the time being, go ahead and practice navigating around your model until you can navigate very,

05:42.160 --> 05:49.200
very naturally to any angle you want to zoom in and out, pan around, orbit, you name it.
