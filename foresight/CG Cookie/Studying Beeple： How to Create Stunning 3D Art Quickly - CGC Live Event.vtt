00:00.000 --> 00:13.360
Hello, hello, everybody. Welcome to the weekly Blender Oriented CG Cookie Stream. Today is

00:13.360 --> 00:18.400
a free stream. We usually reserve those for citizen members, but try to do a free one

00:18.400 --> 00:24.800
occasionally. And this one also being the first genre of artist study, as I'm calling

00:25.120 --> 00:29.840
it, figured it would be a good thing to make free, and so that is available to anyone and

00:29.840 --> 00:39.600
everyone. Yeah, so welcome to this artist study on the artist name as Beeple. I have been super

00:40.240 --> 00:46.880
excited about this. I think has the record for the furthest out scheduling of a live stream. It's

00:46.880 --> 00:54.640
been it's been available. Oh no, I have an echo. That's not good. Oh, I'm sorry. My

00:54.640 --> 00:59.920
bad. So I was playing the stream as well, my fault. Hopefully that's that's solved now.

01:00.800 --> 01:07.040
Let me know in the chat if that's solved. That was my fault. But yeah, so I had I had the idea

01:07.040 --> 01:15.200
months ago and reached out to Beeple to ask if I could use his artwork and on the stream and he

01:15.200 --> 01:21.520
very kindly generously said yes. Okay, cool. It's glad to see that's fixed. Awesome. And so

01:22.080 --> 01:26.960
thank you Beeple. If you ever see this, I appreciate you letting us do this huge fan,

01:26.960 --> 01:32.880
which will be definitively proven by the end of this by the end of this stream. But

01:33.760 --> 01:39.680
yeah, so Beeple, let's let's let's talk about why we're going to be learning about Beeple.

01:41.440 --> 01:47.600
Beeple is Mike Winkleman. And here's a stat sheet of source of sorts. He's an American digital

01:47.600 --> 01:55.840
artist and designer. He specializes in abstract art, VJ loops, which, you know, like music that

01:55.840 --> 02:02.320
has visual aids kind of that, you know, loop, and that's kind of VJ loops. I'm not, I haven't

02:02.320 --> 02:06.800
ever done those, but didn't know if anyone else needed that explained. Concert graphics, I've

02:06.800 --> 02:12.720
heard him say in a, in a presentation that he's done concert graphics for Katy Perry, and one of

02:13.040 --> 02:18.880
one of her tours, he's done album art for Imagine Dragons. So you've maybe even seen

02:18.880 --> 02:25.200
some of his art before. He also does these things called every days, which is one of his

02:25.200 --> 02:32.480
maybe biggest claims to fame in that for over 10 years now, he's done a daily image from start to

02:32.480 --> 02:37.920
finish. Every single day, he's not missed a single day. I've heard him say that even on the day that

02:37.920 --> 02:44.240
his, his child was born, he managed to do an every day. And so that means like, we'll look at the

02:44.240 --> 02:51.920
math, but he has thousands, nearly 4,000 images in his portfolio on top. In addition to everything

02:51.920 --> 02:57.040
he does professionally, which I couldn't find a ton of information aside from the Katy Perry and

02:57.040 --> 03:02.000
Imagine Dragons stuff, just because I couldn't find like a LinkedIn or, or a traditional resume, but

03:02.880 --> 03:07.840
he, he's a very successful artist and his every day is alone. That's what we're going to be focusing

03:07.840 --> 03:14.720
on primarily today. And I think we can glean a lot of information out of those. But, you know,

03:14.720 --> 03:21.200
as far as tools, he uses Cinema 4D and Octane primarily. And, you know, that's just kind of a

03:21.200 --> 03:27.760
stat. We're a blender crowd here. And so at this point in 2018, you know, it's not terribly, you

03:27.760 --> 03:33.120
know, significant, which software is used software is advancing so much. And we all know how powerful

03:33.120 --> 03:39.440
Blender is. All of these things can can, can be all these techniques that we study about people

03:39.440 --> 03:47.520
can be achieved in probably whatever software you choose. A quick question from William,

03:47.520 --> 03:52.640
did his computer ever break? I don't know, he's got to have the highest end workhorse computer

03:52.640 --> 03:59.200
given how how he renders like really intense things like a lot of reflections and caustics. So

03:59.200 --> 04:02.880
he's got to have a really good computer. Who knows if it's broken. I mean, that would not be

04:03.920 --> 04:08.560
not be surprising at all if it has, but I don't know. I did. I tried to be very quick with my

04:08.560 --> 04:14.080
communication. I feel like he's a big deal. I didn't want to, you know, badger him with with

04:14.080 --> 04:20.480
requests. So anyway, so he's very proficient at modeling, shading, lighting, compositing,

04:20.480 --> 04:27.680
procedural animation, basically everything in the 3D pipeline, composition at an artistic sense.

04:27.760 --> 04:33.120
And I put voice. That's just that's how I describe someone who uses their art to speak,

04:33.120 --> 04:38.480
to convey an idea. He's very good at that. And I feel like that's necessary to put in the stat sheet

04:38.480 --> 04:45.520
because so often 3D artists lack a voice, you know, often it's just the the art of recreating

04:45.520 --> 04:49.600
something. It's it's not so much conveying something or expressing something from from

04:49.600 --> 04:54.800
yourself. And so he's very good at that as well. And his portfolio is massive. As I've talked about

04:54.800 --> 05:00.320
his every day's alone means he has about 4000 images. It's huge and not just not just images

05:00.320 --> 05:04.720
like like I probably have 4000. I don't know if that many like work in progress, you know,

05:04.720 --> 05:09.360
like halfway done models or here's today's progress compared to tomorrows and whatever.

05:09.360 --> 05:16.640
These are like start to finish in like like pieces of art basically. So he has it's massive.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.440
As far as I know, he works alone. He's I mean, especially with his every day is like that's

05:21.440 --> 05:27.440
just him. And he's an absolute powerhouse in that sense. So whatever, you know, this is a resume,

05:27.440 --> 05:33.840
like, let's actually look at some of his work at this point. And yeah, okay, so being a free stream,

05:33.840 --> 05:40.480
if this is your first time here, or if you're a member of CD Cookie, this is this this environment,

05:40.480 --> 05:46.000
this format is great for asking questions and getting pretty much immediate feedback. So if you

05:46.000 --> 05:52.480
can, we got a fairly primitive system in the chat. If you could like add a prefix of like question,

05:52.480 --> 05:58.480
like the word question in all caps, or a Q or something to let me know that it's a question,

05:58.480 --> 06:02.080
because otherwise I'm just looking for a question mark and I can get confusing. But

06:03.920 --> 06:07.360
anyway, yeah, so that's how you can ask questions. I'm going to try and keep an eye on that so we

06:07.360 --> 06:12.720
can interact and stuff. But the first thing I want to do is just let his work speak a little bit.

06:13.680 --> 06:19.760
And we'll go over to his website, just people crap.com. He's got a pretty

06:21.040 --> 06:26.720
interesting personality. I love, I love how expressive he is and blunt about things. But

06:26.720 --> 06:31.040
you'll probably see that if you start following him, which I highly recommend. So here we can see

06:31.040 --> 06:36.640
like he's got, he's got these films, he's got VJ clips, and then every day's and resources and

06:36.640 --> 06:42.880
things like that. But the first thing I ever saw about people that I knew was his work was this

06:42.880 --> 06:48.720
zero day short. So I'm going to play a little bit of that and, and let do that do some talking.

06:49.760 --> 06:55.120
Again, it is the first thing I ever heard or saw from him. So let's just take a moment and watch a

06:55.120 --> 07:02.480
bit of that. For the past few months now, the nation's top military, intelligence, and law enforcement

07:02.480 --> 07:07.040
officials have been warning Congress and the country about a common cyber attack.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.400
Another weapon added to the arsenal and cyber warfare.

07:11.360 --> 07:18.880
We have entered into a new phase of conflict in which we use a cyber weapon to create physical

07:18.880 --> 07:23.840
destruction. A battle is waging across the internet.

07:23.840 --> 07:32.720
One hundred and forty cyber attacks on U.S. companies.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.200
Thirty million lines of code.

07:39.680 --> 07:52.080
Because it's U.S. considers it an act of war. Well, the messages don't mess with us.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.120
But what struck me is the fact that he was a single artist and he, the quality of modeling,

08:05.680 --> 08:11.840
quality of texturing, shading, lighting, compositing, composition, and animation on top of

08:11.840 --> 08:16.640
all that, that he's doing that as a single artist. Obviously, like it was a staff pick on Vimeo.

08:17.600 --> 08:23.520
He's got a few staff picks. So super impressive work. And that hooked me on him. And I started

08:23.520 --> 08:28.560
looking him up and then got onto his everyday work. But before we get into there, you know,

08:28.560 --> 08:34.080
like check out some of his like VJ clips. I find them mesmerizing. If we, if we go look at those

08:34.080 --> 08:40.240
real quick, I just also on top of being like static images, which is what his every days are,

08:40.240 --> 08:45.280
like he still does animation on top of that. And being a generous guy like these are creative

08:45.280 --> 08:49.360
commons. He says you can use them for anything commercial or non-commercial if you happen to

08:49.360 --> 08:54.960
be a VJ. But just for visuals and knowing if you've been doing 3D much, like, you know that

08:54.960 --> 09:00.000
animation kind of separates men from the boys in a way. And so to see some of these

09:05.040 --> 09:10.000
videos, just to be honest with you, he's one of my favorite kind of people.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, he's good.

09:17.280 --> 09:25.360
Also, he's gonna go on and on. And you've also seen his name's Midge on Twitter. He started

09:25.360 --> 09:30.400
doing some similar things with Blender, like these looping abstract animations. And no doubt

09:30.400 --> 09:36.800
he's been inspired by people. But yeah, just trying to give you a feel for like what quality

09:36.800 --> 09:44.000
of work people does before we get into the meat and potatoes of his every days. But yeah, check

09:44.000 --> 09:50.880
this stuff out. It's super cool. And now let's get to the everyday aspect of it. So on his everyday

09:50.880 --> 09:57.840
page, you can see he's got a consecutive day counter 3,990 consecutive days of making an image

09:58.800 --> 10:05.840
from start to finish. And before we dive into those, let's go back to the presentation. I can't

10:05.840 --> 10:11.760
really try to remember the order of this stuff. Okay, yeah, so why are we going to study people?

10:11.760 --> 10:16.080
Hopefully some of that's clear now with the introductory video that I showed you and an

10:16.080 --> 10:23.120
idea of his work. But hello, Joaquin, I see you in there. The audio of the webpage is much

10:23.200 --> 10:27.840
louder than the mic. So we can't hear you talking. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Let me turn that down.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.760
I shouldn't be playing anything more with sound, but I apologize for that. I don't think I said

10:33.760 --> 10:39.920
anything terribly important during the music. But yeah, okay, I'll turn that I'll turn that down

10:40.960 --> 10:47.360
since it was recommended. So all right. Yeah, so a few reasons why I want to study people,

10:47.360 --> 10:51.280
why he's had such an impact on me and why I want to convey that to you guys as well,

10:51.280 --> 10:59.600
is to appreciate abstract 3d art. I have my entire career I've never appreciated abstract or modern

10:59.600 --> 11:07.040
art in a sense. Because the way that I've been thinking about it is often I feel like when I

11:07.040 --> 11:11.840
was in New York looking at Jackson Pollock's whatever it is where he likes, you know, splattered

11:11.840 --> 11:17.040
paint all over the wall, like it was very difficult. I actually got very angry sitting in that room

11:17.120 --> 11:21.760
looking at that painting with all these people gathered around. And, you know, there is such

11:21.760 --> 11:28.800
an honor about this piece. And it made me angry because, you know, it almost came at the expense

11:28.800 --> 11:34.320
of being like technically proficient, right? Because my three year old can splatter paint on

11:34.320 --> 11:39.040
a wall, like there's not a lot of arguably from my perspective, not a lot of technique behind that,

11:39.040 --> 11:43.840
even though it's it's clearly an expression of the artist, it's like only expression without

11:43.840 --> 11:48.960
technical proficiency. And so because of that, and being a 3d artist, I think maybe you guys,

11:48.960 --> 11:54.480
if you are as well, you can relate that everything in 3d is so complex, right, from modeling to

11:54.480 --> 11:59.440
texturing, dealing with UVs, getting into shader node networks, creating procedurals,

12:00.240 --> 12:05.120
generating animation, rigging, all these keyframes that you have to add, there's nothing simple

12:05.120 --> 12:11.200
about computer graphics. So when that is my primary medium, it makes me a harsh critic of,

12:11.760 --> 12:16.960
um, yeah, shots fire, it does make me a harsh critic of things that don't look like they take

12:16.960 --> 12:22.400
technical proficiency, require technical proficiency. So whether it's short sided, it probably is,

12:22.400 --> 12:27.280
I'm not, I'm not objectively the truth on this by any means, but I've never appreciated abstract

12:27.280 --> 12:34.160
art. And then I discovered people and discovered how he is, you'll clearly see so proficient as a

12:34.160 --> 12:40.720
3d artist, but also a gifted abstract artist that seeing the two of them combined drastically

12:40.720 --> 12:47.360
changed my opinion of abstract art. And to my, and also my perception of being around 3d art and

12:47.360 --> 12:54.000
forums and, and, and online places that showcase 3d art, there's not a as much abstract stuff

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
happening as there is, like character art, or vehicle modeling, like realism, mainly realism

13:00.000 --> 13:05.440
and stylistic, you know, cartoony type renders, that's, that's everywhere. And those are great,

13:05.440 --> 13:10.480
but it also lended to me maybe not appreciating abstract, because you don't quite see it that

13:10.480 --> 13:17.120
often. So hopefully, if that's, if I'm gauging this room as well, maybe some of you share those

13:17.120 --> 13:23.840
opinions. And there's a lot of techniques. So yeah, okay, already have a fan of Nathan. And,

13:23.840 --> 13:28.240
and yeah, I use that as an example. Again, I'm not the truth on that. That's just always been my

13:28.240 --> 13:34.400
opinion. And maybe people transforming me, I can look back at Pollock and have more appreciation

13:34.480 --> 13:42.880
for that. And, and modern art in general. You have possibly emphasized the word wrong, sure,

13:42.880 --> 13:50.640
like modern art, abstract art, my apologies. Maybe I'm at whatever, like, hopefully you get

13:50.640 --> 13:54.560
an idea of what I'm talking about. And you will throughout the presentation. But I would love

13:54.560 --> 14:00.720
for you guys to, for people to inflame an appreciation for abstract art if you don't

14:00.720 --> 14:08.400
already have one. And then, all right, so from the technical standpoint, as 3d artists, I want you

14:08.400 --> 14:16.720
to take away a learning of how complex, high quality, visually impressive 3d art can be

14:16.720 --> 14:22.640
accomplished quickly and efficiently. That's what's important here. Being everyday pieces,

14:22.640 --> 14:27.520
he is accomplishing this stuff. I think I've heard him say within an hour to three, four hours,

14:27.520 --> 14:33.360
like a fairly short amount of time given how impactful the work is, and he's doing it every

14:33.360 --> 14:39.520
day in addition to like professional things. So that means if we can dial into what he's doing,

14:39.520 --> 14:45.040
tap into it and glean stuff from it, then our workflows can adopt some of those techniques,

14:45.040 --> 14:50.000
and we can hopefully work quickly and more efficiently, while also producing more visually

14:50.000 --> 14:56.400
impressive things. And with that in the similar vein, I hope that we can be challenged and

14:56.400 --> 15:01.040
inspired by what is possible, because as we get into his work, as you're aware of how many

15:01.040 --> 15:05.840
individual images he has, and you'll see in coming up like the quality of those images,

15:07.520 --> 15:12.480
you might, you might question like how is this possible that he has done this, you know, like

15:12.480 --> 15:16.400
he's super human or something. He's a crazy gifted artist or something like that. We've had

15:16.400 --> 15:22.240
people mentioning in the chat like are asking like did he really not miss a day? Like is this

15:22.240 --> 15:27.840
consecutive? Is that legit? And yes it is, but it means we should be inspired by it,

15:28.560 --> 15:34.640
by what is possible, because we have to admit like he is a human just like us. And so that's why

15:34.640 --> 15:40.240
we should be motivated, challenged and motivated, inspired to adopt some of his techniques.

15:42.560 --> 15:49.840
All right, so I did not mean to flare up any kind of modern art debate or anything,

15:49.840 --> 15:56.480
but I don't know have fun with that, I guess, if you want. All right, so next how to study people

15:57.520 --> 16:00.880
that I tried to come up with some categories that would hopefully make this a little more

16:00.880 --> 16:08.560
organized and digestible for you. And one of them being the, or I've got five, so the amount of detail

16:08.560 --> 16:15.600
to me that's kind of like an entry fee into 3D graphics like impressive quality. If you

16:16.320 --> 16:20.800
end up below that threshold and you don't have enough detail, the whole thing kind of falls apart

16:20.800 --> 16:25.600
and I don't even want to take it to your show kind of a way. That's what amount of detail is and it's

16:25.600 --> 16:31.920
it can be surprisingly difficult to achieve that detail. It always has been in my book, my experience.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.800
And so that's one way we're going to look at him, the amount of detail he's able to achieve

16:37.520 --> 16:44.800
again in a short time, the use of repetition. So he does this very intelligently and I taught

16:45.440 --> 16:52.720
a, I think it was a short course about creating these mailboxes and it kind of hit on that idea

16:52.720 --> 17:00.000
about if you can repeat things as long as you're smart about it and you alter it slightly in a way

17:00.000 --> 17:05.760
to like create a more visually complex image while not ruining it with repetition that breaks the

17:05.760 --> 17:11.520
illusion. So anyway, Beeple is a great example of using repetition and it not breaking down the

17:11.520 --> 17:17.040
image negatively at all. Also, we're going to look at the mastery of his shading, lighting and

17:17.040 --> 17:24.160
treatment. Initially, I use the word compositing, but my hunch is that he's not compositing in the

17:24.160 --> 17:29.360
sense of breaking an image into multiple passes and then combining it in a compositor. I feel like

17:30.000 --> 17:36.160
he could, he's probably getting it 75 to 90% all the way there in the 3D render and then doing

17:36.160 --> 17:41.920
treatment on top of that, adding lens flares and altering color tones and things like that.

17:41.920 --> 17:47.040
That would be my guess. So I swapped out the word for treatment or swapped out composing for

17:47.040 --> 17:52.480
treatment, but those, those three things are like the, in my opinion, like the trifecta of

17:52.480 --> 17:59.760
polishing an image and while it may seem less important than what is done in 3D, a lot can happen

17:59.760 --> 18:05.840
in that, in that stage of the three shading, lighting and treatment in that they all like

18:05.840 --> 18:14.560
is the marriage and kind of they inform each other. All right, so then we have abstract elements.

18:14.560 --> 18:21.680
So he, being an abstract artist, we talked about that already and I find it intriguing how he,

18:22.800 --> 18:27.120
how he does that. And we're going to look at that and how he, how the abstract elements,

18:27.360 --> 18:33.360
they just have this hypnotizing effect on me more so than any other, any other artists I've seen,

18:33.360 --> 18:38.800
especially in recent years. And so I'm fascinated by that. You can, you can just get a lot out of

18:38.800 --> 18:43.440
these abstract concepts and stuff. So we're going to talk about that. And then finally,

18:43.440 --> 18:50.160
the unique styles. I've not seen many people break their own conventions and be able to

18:50.880 --> 18:56.880
nail certain styles or a variety of styles and not just repeat themselves over and over and over

18:56.880 --> 19:02.480
again. In that way, we're going to, we're going to look at that and consider how he, how he changes

19:02.480 --> 19:08.480
up the styles. Okay, so we're going to look at it, we're going to look at several images, several

19:08.480 --> 19:13.360
is an understatement. We're going to look at a lot of his artwork because again, we have 4,000

19:13.360 --> 19:18.800
images to choose from. It was actually very difficult for me to limit it to just a few and

19:20.640 --> 19:29.840
okay, question from William. Let's see. Let's see. I don't see a question, William. Oh, is it possible

19:29.840 --> 19:36.880
to make non abstract art fast? Yes, William. Let's see, that was your question right here.

19:37.680 --> 19:42.960
Yes, we absolutely, one of his styles, one of people's styles is he does achieve photo realism

19:44.480 --> 19:49.280
in my opinion, like he achieves that in some of his every days, probably a lot of his every days.

19:49.280 --> 19:54.160
And he actually, one of the interesting things about his abstract stuff, a lot of it is that

19:54.720 --> 20:01.520
it will, he'll like plop a glowing sphere in the middle of like a photo realistic scene. There's,

20:01.520 --> 20:07.360
there's very believable reflections and refractions going on and lighting, but then he just throws

20:07.360 --> 20:11.840
the sphere in the middle of the image. And all of a sudden, they're like the level of interest

20:11.840 --> 20:17.440
just like shoots up and it's such a simple thing. And so I consider that abstract, but it's in a

20:17.440 --> 20:24.160
very believable and I use believable because, you know, his stuff like, you know, there isn't

20:24.160 --> 20:28.880
necessarily a world that looks like his or rocks don't curve like his. So in that way,

20:28.880 --> 20:32.880
it's not a photo, but everything about it, besides that the shading quality, the lighting,

20:32.880 --> 20:37.520
the rendering all looks photo real. So yes, you can totally do photo real and people as someone

20:37.520 --> 20:42.080
to study how to do that quickly. And the last thing, remember, look through all of this through

20:42.080 --> 20:47.920
the lenses of he does this every day in a few hours, right? Just consider that.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.720
If you're like me and it takes a week to model like a single character,

20:53.440 --> 20:58.480
this guy's doing a much more impressive work, in my opinion, in just a few hours. So

20:59.120 --> 21:03.520
let's start work looking through. Well, actually, I have them in the presentation.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.520
All right, let's start in category number one, the amount of detail.

21:08.240 --> 21:14.160
Um, the way I've described this earlier as kind of the entry fee to being taken seriously as a

21:14.160 --> 21:19.920
3D artist, especially if you want to be like a believable 3D artist. And that is detailed, the

21:20.800 --> 21:25.520
the level of the level and complexity of things happening visually in the scene. And

21:26.240 --> 21:31.200
another way that I think of it is like, it makes me, it makes me feel that if I zoomed

21:31.200 --> 21:35.920
in further to the image, there would be more information there. Even though that might not

21:36.480 --> 21:42.320
be true, he's creating the illusion that there is more there. And, and as an artist myself,

21:42.320 --> 21:48.640
I've often run into the limits of that and realizing like, Oh no, my texture, my textile

21:48.640 --> 21:55.360
density of like a texture resolution of like 4k pixels, 4096 by 4096, it kind of breaks down after

21:55.360 --> 22:01.600
a certain place. And that limits me. And so in that ways, I've felt the limitations of detail.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.880
And even though I consider it like an entry fee, it can be harder to achieve than you think.

22:06.880 --> 22:12.480
And he always gets this, he always nails the detail. I mean, in several ways, like he does it

22:12.480 --> 22:17.600
in models, he does it in texturing, he does it in lighting. And lighting isn't terribly

22:18.400 --> 22:22.960
relevant in this particular image, but we will have some coming up. But like, look at the model

22:22.960 --> 22:28.080
quality, the geometric quality of detail, we have like big cubes with these kind of greeble

22:28.080 --> 22:33.040
effects, whether that's a texture, whether it's a displacement, something, a lot of detail in the

22:33.040 --> 22:38.080
bigger shapes. But then we have tons of these little rectangular shapes scattered throughout,

22:38.080 --> 22:45.840
some of them reach like spec level of scale. And so that gives me the impression. And it's very

22:45.840 --> 22:49.840
impressionistic, right? Like the more we study this, the more we break it down, we can see

22:49.840 --> 22:55.200
how he does it. But like when I first see it, my initial reaction is like, I blow right past the

22:55.200 --> 23:00.240
detail problem, like this is detailed enough, I go right past it, and I continue enjoying the image

23:00.240 --> 23:04.240
compared to if you don't have enough detail, if your texture breaks down, and we see the

23:04.240 --> 23:09.920
pixelation, or if your geometry has like, you know, rigid edges from not being subdivided enough,

23:10.720 --> 23:14.480
that will break down the image and can ruin the experience can at least threaten the

23:14.480 --> 23:19.440
experience of looking at the image. And so in this way, like he nails it, he's got so much detail

23:19.440 --> 23:26.080
going on. These like pipes and whatever it is, scaffolding, like random stuff, like it's very,

23:26.080 --> 23:33.840
very fine. And that suggests to me that I can zoom way in and see a lot more. But anyway, so that's

23:33.840 --> 23:42.080
the first image to illustrate like detail quality. This one here, this one is less on the model and

23:42.080 --> 23:48.880
more on like a lighting, wait, wait, it's actually less on texturing detail and more on the concert

23:48.880 --> 23:54.480
of lighting and modeling. So with the lighting sense, how he gets detail out of lighting is he's

23:54.480 --> 24:03.840
got let's count 123 times 12345678, he's got 24. That's three times eight, right? Yeah, 24 individual

24:03.840 --> 24:09.040
light bulbs fluorescent light bulbs in these x shapes. And so that illuminates plenty of light.

24:09.040 --> 24:14.480
But what's cool about it is in the in the walls over here, it adds a lot of light sources that

24:14.480 --> 24:20.080
can be reflected. So there's a lot of opportunity for reflection to be caught on on the surfaces.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.520
Now that the models on the sides are are fairly detailed, you know, we have trim and and like

24:25.520 --> 24:29.920
they look like some sort of cathedral doors, you know, that kind of style. But the material,

24:29.920 --> 24:36.960
if you really look at it, it looks like a very standard baseline, reflective glossy shader,

24:36.960 --> 24:42.400
right? There doesn't look like any kind of grime breakup. But it doesn't need that because the

24:42.400 --> 24:47.520
lighting when it's reflected in here, along with a geometry or across the surface of this

24:47.520 --> 24:52.640
level of geometry, there's just a lot happening. It's creating that level of detail where we don't

24:52.640 --> 24:58.000
question that we we just believe it and we're in into the image enjoying it. There is some texture

24:58.000 --> 25:05.760
detail which he always manages to do, putting like a a grimy or some level of tileable texture on the

25:05.760 --> 25:10.000
floor that breaks up the reflections really nice. And this is no exception, we see it in there.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.400
But besides the floor, there looks like very little texture information and all the detail

25:14.400 --> 25:20.720
is achieved with lighting and geometry. Sorry, let me see if I've been missing any,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.440
I haven't been missing some questions. Let's see here.

25:26.240 --> 25:32.080
Beeple is 2d only. Correct, this does not involve any 3d at all. Oh, no, he's he's only

25:32.080 --> 25:38.480
he's only 3d for the most part. Aside from some early years in his every days, like he's

25:38.480 --> 25:44.160
pretty much exclusively 3d. But that's probably been answered at this point.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.720
Let me look for a couple more questions.

25:53.520 --> 26:00.560
Let's see from char. Is that who was asking the question? No, sorry, I just saw a question.

26:00.720 --> 26:08.800
Okay, so from Joaquin, he uses a lot of kit bashing in libraries for complex models.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.840
That's not a question either.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.800
Question, Beeple creates an entire work of art every day, or just hits the drawing board every day.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.640
It's an entire work of art according to him start to finish, he creates it. That doesn't mean that

26:24.640 --> 26:28.720
he doesn't have like a library of models that he sources or textures and things like that.

26:28.720 --> 26:34.720
But like, he starts with a blank scene and then creates something new every day.

26:37.520 --> 26:41.200
Question, is there anyone else that has done every day's or is Beeple the only brave one?

26:42.160 --> 26:46.880
I don't know of anyone that's done every day's anywhere close to 10 years.

26:47.520 --> 26:51.680
That is nuts if you think about it. Like, imagine what happens in a week and how many

26:51.680 --> 26:56.400
things get in the way of your art and what you want to do in a week. I mean, I have a kid now.

26:56.480 --> 27:03.680
And so does Beeple. My kids like eliminate a lot of free time and at least zap the strength,

27:03.680 --> 27:08.880
the mental strength to like want to stay up an extra hour in the middle of the night to be able

27:08.880 --> 27:13.680
to do a piece of work or something. So it's crazy that he did it for 10 years, that he's done it

27:13.680 --> 27:22.080
and he's still going. He's almost done with his 11th year. Let's see. How can that image be done

27:22.080 --> 27:26.240
in one day? That's not possible, right? Like, that's that that's what that's the initial

27:26.240 --> 27:32.080
impression like this crazy how he's been doing this. All right, question, will you be breaking

27:32.080 --> 27:39.040
down his approach to texturing Photoshop the way he achieves photorealism? No. I mean, I'm gonna

27:39.040 --> 27:43.440
touch on some of those subjects. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like, yet, I'm in this stream,

27:43.440 --> 27:49.520
I'm not going to like show you how how I would go about it. I do want to if this, you know,

27:49.520 --> 27:55.600
people like this stream and like this stuff, I do want to do a stream where I try to mimic some

27:55.600 --> 28:00.640
of his techniques and create an image in like a two hour span, something, you know, that incorporates

28:00.640 --> 28:04.240
all these techniques. I do want to do that. It's not going to be today. Today is just strictly

28:05.120 --> 28:12.720
looking at his work and analyzing it. But I don't know how much he goes into Photoshop. I think he

28:12.720 --> 28:19.280
uses. Well, it doesn't matter, I guess he does in some program he image editing, he does like,

28:20.640 --> 28:29.280
he must do some like tonal changes in the color, add some noise, change, add like,

28:29.280 --> 28:34.400
you know, vignettes or something like that. I imagine so anyway. Sorry, there's kind of a

28:34.400 --> 28:39.600
lot of questions. Hopefully I'm caught up. All right, cool. I think I'm caught up.

28:40.560 --> 28:45.600
I think I'm caught up for the most part. Okay, cool. So let's get back into the detail. I've got

28:45.600 --> 28:51.440
at least another image. Okay, yeah, this is what I thought was so interesting is is like him using

28:51.440 --> 28:58.560
lighting to detail the scene. Like for me, I always think of geometry prime primarily like make your

28:58.560 --> 29:04.480
model complex. That's how you achieve detail. And then the next layer is like make your textures

29:05.360 --> 29:10.160
complex. And then if you get those two, you know, lighting will be easy and all this stuff.

29:10.160 --> 29:16.240
But like in this image, for example, all the geometry probably has very little shading

29:16.240 --> 29:22.560
information. It's not really even that complex. The the most detailed thing in the scene is is

29:22.560 --> 29:29.440
lights like all these glowing bits in the windows, the lamps, he's got a variety of colors, small,

29:29.440 --> 29:34.880
big, you know, you name it, there's there's a ton of lighting sources of light sources in this scene.

29:34.880 --> 29:41.280
And so as the backdrop, like that really details the scene, it feels like a night scape of a city,

29:41.280 --> 29:47.760
it feels it just it achieves that threshold, in my opinion, of of like a believable detail level.

29:47.760 --> 29:52.240
And then on the right side, as if you weren't convinced by this, on the right side, he's got

29:52.240 --> 29:58.080
kind of a framework building or framework structure. And there is a lot a decent amount of

29:58.160 --> 30:03.920
detail in that geometry. But he's got a glowing red light, maybe potentially a couple different

30:03.920 --> 30:10.800
lights, this blue one, perhaps, inside that structure. And so he gets these these volumetric

30:10.800 --> 30:15.600
rays that are broken up a lot by that geometry. So the volumetric rays have a lot of detail.

30:16.480 --> 30:21.040
The fact that the light is internal to the structure, it highlights some areas that like

30:21.040 --> 30:26.080
illuminate some faces. And then there's a contrast dark shadows on the other side. So there's just

30:26.080 --> 30:30.800
a lot happening in the image because of the way he sets up the lights and the geometry.

30:30.800 --> 30:35.840
And there's not really much texture or shader work that needs to be done as far as the structures.

30:35.840 --> 30:41.840
But again, you know, he's always diligent to put a highly detailed texture on the ground plane.

30:42.400 --> 30:49.120
And, and yeah, all all this to illustrate just the quality of detail that entrance fee into,

30:49.120 --> 30:53.760
I believe this as a 3d artist, especially, like you've sold me on the detail. And

30:54.720 --> 30:56.800
let's see another question

30:59.680 --> 31:06.160
from Wilco Wilbrink. Do you think he reuses older models to speed up his every days? I do,

31:06.160 --> 31:11.600
I think for sure. If he's been doing, if he's been doing these for 4000 4000 days, like,

31:13.520 --> 31:18.480
you know, character models, for example, like, why would you need to build a character from scratch,

31:18.560 --> 31:23.920
like just save him and reuse him and make composable, like store that. And then you see

31:23.920 --> 31:28.400
that evidence of that when he has characters involved in his artwork. But I think like,

31:28.400 --> 31:34.000
I mean, think about he does cityscapes. So like types of buildings, fire escapes, lamp posts,

31:34.000 --> 31:39.040
like why in the world would you do that multiple times? He's probably got a massive library of

31:39.040 --> 31:44.480
models that he's either built, potentially he's bought. There's enough evidence in his modeling

31:45.200 --> 31:48.800
that if he buys his models, you know, buys a bunch of models, like, I don't hold that against him,

31:48.800 --> 31:55.120
like he's clearly a talented modeler. But yeah, at this point, like he should have a huge library

31:55.120 --> 32:00.000
of models that he reuses. And that's something I want you to take away. Like, that's not a knock

32:00.000 --> 32:06.880
against against him or anyone who reuses stuff. I think there is this kind of misconception that

32:07.760 --> 32:12.400
and I can sense it. I've been there too, like, if I want, if I want to give like the proper

32:12.400 --> 32:16.800
devotion to a character, I've always got to start from scratch, like sculpt him from a ball,

32:17.520 --> 32:22.800
always model the ear again, always model the hand, the nose, like always model these pieces

32:22.800 --> 32:27.200
individually. And that's just silly, right? It's not efficient. Once you've done it once,

32:27.200 --> 32:33.200
you have the chops. Once you've done it once, twice, whatever, you have chops, and reusing

32:33.200 --> 32:38.080
those pieces, nothing wrong with it whatsoever. It's actually very smart. It's what enables,

32:38.080 --> 32:44.160
it's one of the things that enables him to make such complex, impressive imagery as often as he

32:44.160 --> 32:50.880
does. So this use of repetition, duplicates, we just talked about this, they're rampant, right?

32:50.880 --> 32:57.600
They're all through his images. But they don't break down the image he's uses and very intelligently.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.720
And so I, for, I guess, fun, like in the presentation, can you spot the repeats, right? So this,

33:02.720 --> 33:07.360
this little bracket piece, which I think I took from right there, clearly they're being duplicated

33:07.440 --> 33:13.200
around this, this radial shape around the lip. But if you keep looking, they're also duplicated

33:13.200 --> 33:20.080
inside the cylinder, all the way down. Okay, so these, these look like the exact same piece,

33:20.080 --> 33:25.280
if I'm not mistaken. And so there's an element of duplication. But there's an art in hiding the

33:25.280 --> 33:31.360
repetition. And I think in this particular image, these outer brackets are illuminated by a bright

33:31.360 --> 33:38.000
white light. And so the color looks more white. And, and when you look a little closer, inside,

33:38.000 --> 33:44.080
these are darker, and they are much darker gray. And to me, that didn't read in immediately as a,

33:44.080 --> 33:50.800
as a repeat. But there's a slight context shift that hides it pretty well. And, and once you

33:50.800 --> 33:54.960
study it, obviously, you break it down, you can see these things. But the point being that the

33:54.960 --> 33:59.280
most important thing is the initial impression. And I did not, these, these repeated pieces did

33:59.280 --> 34:04.480
not break down the image for me. And hopefully they didn't for you either. But yeah, so the art

34:04.480 --> 34:11.600
of hiding repetition, slight alterations, applying in different contexts, so that's the lighting in

34:11.600 --> 34:17.440
this example, repeat deflectors, that's not necessarily relevant in this particular image,

34:17.440 --> 34:22.960
but in, in, in subsequent images, it will be in enough variety. So that's another thing I wanted

34:22.960 --> 34:30.160
to talk about. So if you have, let's say he approached this scene with like, with four or five

34:30.160 --> 34:34.720
different kind of pieces that he repeated around, I think that that you can get away with four or

34:34.720 --> 34:39.760
five individual pieces that you duplicate. So we have the brackets, we've got just a generic cylinder

34:39.760 --> 34:45.840
shape, we've got these kind of scaffolding this, this radial scaffolding all the way around the edge,

34:45.840 --> 34:51.040
we have these little, I don't know, rivets or small holes, like, these are various pieces that

34:51.120 --> 34:55.360
he's duplicating around, including the secondary part of the bracket, like this piece that attaches

34:55.360 --> 35:01.520
to the outer hull. That is a unique piece that I don't necessarily see duplicated. But when you

35:01.520 --> 35:07.360
have enough variety, it hides the repetition pretty well. If he only had two pieces and he

35:07.360 --> 35:11.840
duplicated everything around those two pieces all the way around, that would probably be much more

35:11.840 --> 35:16.880
noticeable. But he doesn't do that. He does it very intelligently. He has enough variety. And

35:17.760 --> 35:26.400
let's see the next one. I love this image. But obviously, it doesn't take you long to realize

35:26.400 --> 35:31.760
that this is a duplicate piece of geometry, like the array modifier that's just extruded,

35:31.760 --> 35:37.600
that it's duplicated all the way down the hallway, and then twisted, right? So the twist

35:38.240 --> 35:42.960
adds some visual interest. It breaks up the monotony of the repetition. That's kind of that

35:43.680 --> 35:50.000
slight alteration idea. Also, these repeat deflectors. I think this is a really crucial

35:50.000 --> 36:00.400
part of his repetitious workflow. And these to me are unique objects that drastically can change,

36:00.960 --> 36:07.120
can like throw a kink in your recognition of the repetition. And the lights in here in particular

36:07.120 --> 36:12.480
are doing that for this scene. He's got just two lights off kilter from each other, right?

36:12.560 --> 36:18.400
They're offset. And so what that serves to do, they're facing towards us, and all the repeats

36:18.400 --> 36:25.120
going backward can fade into black, basically, right? So like, those are unique. That's a unique

36:25.120 --> 36:31.200
context going back behind the lights. And now going forward, all of these duplicates are illuminated

36:31.200 --> 36:36.640
in slightly unique ways. Number one, because the whole corridor is twisted. And number two,

36:36.640 --> 36:43.280
the lights are offset from each other. And so one light is illuminating certain aspects of the

36:43.280 --> 36:49.280
left side. And then the upper light is illuminating certain aspects of the other. And that creates

36:49.280 --> 36:55.200
enough difference, enough variety, even using the exact same geometry. And if we break it down,

36:55.200 --> 37:01.200
just how exact the geometry is, you know, he's duplicating, he's mirroring from top to bottom,

37:01.200 --> 37:06.160
right? So starting about here, and over to the middle, like this cross section,

37:06.160 --> 37:11.600
this little L shape, he's mirroring it vertically and horizontally. So he's done,

37:11.600 --> 37:16.800
even though it looks super complex, he's not done that much modeling. And it starts to make

37:16.800 --> 37:22.000
sense like how he was able to do this in a couple hours. And then the repeat the repeat deflector

37:22.000 --> 37:27.520
idea, it's not hard to throw a lamp in there, right? Like that's much easier to throw a lamp,

37:27.520 --> 37:33.440
offset them, and then you get a variety of reflective quality. It's much easier to do that

37:33.440 --> 37:41.360
than try and model more. And and so in that way, I find that repeat deflector idea really powerful

37:41.360 --> 37:47.840
for breaking up the repetition and just making this a complex, pleasing image that you can lose

37:47.840 --> 37:58.080
yourself to, and not check out because of the repetition. Let's see. Any other questions that

37:58.080 --> 38:05.600
I'm missing from William is octane particularly fast, I've never used octane, I've heard it compared

38:05.600 --> 38:15.040
to cycles pretty well. So in my general understanding, they, they do, they're very similar render

38:15.040 --> 38:20.000
engines, that's not to say that octane is fast. I mean, think about it, like if he spends two to,

38:20.000 --> 38:25.200
okay, maybe I should also say, I don't imagine that he's doing the render time within that two

38:25.200 --> 38:32.480
to four hours, right? I would say that he's creating the whole 3d scene, it within two to four hours,

38:32.480 --> 38:38.560
and then rendering overnight, right? Because he renders them fairly big, they're very clean

38:38.560 --> 38:44.560
renders, especially when he gets into the caustic stuff, that that does not render quickly. And so

38:45.280 --> 38:48.720
I believe that he renders overnight or whatever, and I don't count that against him,

38:48.720 --> 38:53.520
you know, like how, by how quickly he's creating the imagery. But I mean, cycles would be able

38:53.520 --> 38:58.240
to render this overnight, no problem. And whether octane can do it super fast, he also might have

38:58.240 --> 39:02.640
a GPU, I think I've heard him say he has a GPU, which enables him to render faster, certainly

39:02.640 --> 39:09.200
than me, only on CPU, for example. But I don't know, I would challenge you to fight the urge to

39:09.200 --> 39:17.360
focus on the tools. Again, it's 2018, Blender has a good reputation of a quality software, like,

39:18.000 --> 39:22.320
I really just don't, I don't even, I don't think people would say it's without a doubt the tools,

39:22.320 --> 39:26.960
right? I don't think he would give the credit to that. In fact, I feel like I've heard him say that

39:26.960 --> 39:32.480
in a, in a pre one of his presentations, but I don't think the tools are not important here,

39:32.480 --> 39:38.240
that's not the main thing, it's more his technique, you know, like all all all render engines at this

39:38.240 --> 39:46.320
point have nice glossy reflections and GI based lighting and volumetrics and stuff like that.

39:46.320 --> 39:55.120
So the tools are not what's important here, it is absolutely the technique. Next. Okay, this is,

39:55.120 --> 40:00.400
I think this is the last repetitious one. Okay, so this little capsule with the human inside of it,

40:01.120 --> 40:06.640
to me that if you just isolate the capsule by itself, that's, I can imagine that taking like

40:06.640 --> 40:13.120
an hour, hour and a half to create like to model the this human character he uses in multiple

40:13.120 --> 40:18.720
images, we'll see another one where he uses the human this human like musculature anatomy model.

40:19.360 --> 40:23.920
So he reuses that he throws that inside of it, and then duplicates the entire thing

40:24.720 --> 40:29.440
across the scene. So we have three main duplicates. But then we also see a few in the background.

40:29.840 --> 40:37.760
But he rotates the duplicates, right, so we so we can assume that as he models around the object,

40:37.760 --> 40:43.440
he's, he's varying the model quality, so that when he rotates it, it could arguably be a different

40:43.440 --> 40:48.480
capsule or something, at least unique enough so that it doesn't look like a 100% duplicate.

40:49.040 --> 40:53.040
You can see that the lighting is a little different on the bottom side here, compared

40:53.040 --> 40:58.240
to over here, that implies that he it's different, you know, based on where in the circle, like the

40:58.240 --> 41:04.880
details at. That's an effective way to duplicate, rotate and get more, more bang for your buck.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.040
And surprisingly, the more I studied this, I was like, Oh, wait, he didn't even change the pose of

41:11.040 --> 41:16.720
the character, like they're all in the exact same pose. Whereas he's clearly has that guy rigged,

41:16.720 --> 41:20.800
I would have assumed he like moved the characters arms a little bit made him a little unique.

41:20.800 --> 41:25.280
But I don't think he did. So maybe he's just running out of time. It didn't even affect me,

41:25.280 --> 41:31.440
I had to study the image to realize that. So in that way, like he's succeeding in hiding the

41:31.440 --> 41:35.840
repetition, the difference in lighting, right? So you can break up repetition that way, he's

41:35.840 --> 41:42.080
got a strong key light from the left side, we can see from the blue glow. And then a more subtle

41:42.080 --> 41:47.840
light on the right side down here, another different color blue. But but but then he has

41:47.840 --> 41:53.200
probably just a plane on the top and bottom that serves it with this texture to break it up. And

41:53.200 --> 41:58.560
when you break it down, like I hope you're getting that it is it's doable, right? It is doable in

41:58.560 --> 42:07.040
that amount of time. He's only human. So he's just very, very good at at 3d production, very good,

42:07.040 --> 42:13.360
very talented at that. But he's not able to do what would take someone 10 hours in two,

42:14.080 --> 42:20.000
you know, just just like doing the exact same workflow. He's just working super cleverly.

42:20.080 --> 42:24.720
And in a way that hopefully motivates you inspires you to to adopt some of these techniques.

42:26.880 --> 42:31.440
Question, when do you when you zoom in, you see grain, do you think it's because of the

42:31.440 --> 42:36.240
insufficient amount of samples? Or is it a deliberate use of grain? That's a good question

42:36.240 --> 42:42.080
that I've wondered myself because there is often grain. And and we'll see a little bit later that

42:42.080 --> 42:48.240
he also does photography. And if I recall, there's generally grain in the photography too. So there's

42:48.240 --> 42:54.960
a stylistic reason for grain. But also we know as 3d artists, there is a practical reason for

42:54.960 --> 43:01.520
grain, not having enough samples. And in this case, we see grain, particularly in the volumetrics.

43:01.520 --> 43:08.320
So maybe that had some grain. But like, it's also it's very clear in the the ground and the ceiling.

43:09.360 --> 43:16.960
So like, it could serve as like, what am I trying to say, dust particles in the in the volumetrics.

43:16.960 --> 43:22.400
So I think it's probably a mixture of both. It's probably some render sample limitations.

43:22.400 --> 43:27.920
And as well as a stylistic thing, because you do see grain a lot in his images. And

43:29.600 --> 43:33.440
and they don't ruin it. You know, it's another way that they don't taint the image, I don't look at

43:33.440 --> 43:36.880
it and be like, ooh, you should have added more samples. No, it's not that way at all.

43:37.600 --> 43:44.960
I think Omar, I think you're, I think you're poking fun at me.

43:47.680 --> 43:51.600
But we'll see any other questions I'm missing.

43:53.840 --> 44:00.400
Okay, so from Khalil, it's great images, but it seems he copied ideas from science fiction movies.

44:00.400 --> 44:05.040
There's absolutely a science fiction theme running. But keep in mind, we've looked at like

44:05.040 --> 44:12.080
four or five images out of 4000, you're going to see a lot more coming up. He's he's he is not guilty of

44:12.880 --> 44:17.840
of staying in his box. He he does a lot of things. So just just hold on a second,

44:17.840 --> 44:22.560
you'll see a lot more. Not to say that he absolutely probably is inspired by science fiction movies,

44:22.560 --> 44:29.840
but he's also inspired by 70s era stuff, 80s, 90s kind of things. Just just hold on a second.

44:29.840 --> 44:35.600
I like renders where I like renders that are photorealistic, except without noise or lens

44:35.600 --> 44:44.080
imperfections. Okay, so then you might not like that about people like he he utilizes lens imperfections

44:44.080 --> 44:51.440
and lens flares and obviously noise. I like that stuff. I think it does come down to a

44:51.440 --> 44:57.040
preference. I like seeing that in photographs that I take, I like seeing that in my renders.

44:57.040 --> 45:03.360
I just think it it's a subjective thing. But I think clean renders are often boring, personally,

45:03.360 --> 45:08.240
but this just comes to a personal thing. But I like the way people handle it. But I understand

45:08.240 --> 45:16.160
people not liking it. Alright, so that's it for repetition. Now the mastery of shading and lighting

45:16.160 --> 45:23.600
and treatment. The benefits of this is that you can require you can get more out of your models

45:23.600 --> 45:31.840
than you might think, right? There's less pressure on the models to be to carry the mantle of detail

45:31.840 --> 45:37.680
or carry the mantle of visual impressiveness. And in this artwork, in my opinion, is a great example

45:39.680 --> 45:45.760
of if you really look at it, the model is probably three or four different types of like

45:45.840 --> 45:53.840
cathedral tower shapes that is duplicated around and around to create this this castle, you know,

45:53.840 --> 45:58.320
like there's a I forget the name of it, there's a famous place I think in Europe that that has a

45:58.320 --> 46:03.200
castle like like structure on a rock and the tide comes up and then you can't get to it and the tide

46:03.200 --> 46:07.200
goes down and you can walk to it. Anyway, I forgot what it's called. If anyone knows, let me know.

46:07.200 --> 46:14.400
But anyway, like he's created whoops, he's created this shape by probably duplicating from what I

46:14.400 --> 46:19.680
can see, like if you look, there are duplicates, that's that's a duplicate of this one. This cathedral

46:19.680 --> 46:26.480
shape is let's see if we can find another duplicate of that. Man, like yeah, I think he's just

46:26.480 --> 46:31.920
duplicate them smaller in here. Here's another okay, yeah, you see the the spire with the round ball,

46:31.920 --> 46:37.440
here's a spire with the round ball. Anyway, they are just repeats, but they don't even have that

46:37.440 --> 46:42.240
much texture information, if any at all, it looks like a gray model, if you really look closely at

46:42.240 --> 46:46.880
it. And then he duplicated that entire castle structure threw it in the background, rotated it

46:46.880 --> 46:53.200
so that we have, you know, this lone spire or lone tower on the opposite side as it is over here.

46:53.200 --> 46:58.560
So he's got a lot of geometric information quickly. And then how he breaks it up and makes it makes

46:58.560 --> 47:03.360
it appealing to look at is the the shading and lighting treatment. So look at the the water

47:03.360 --> 47:08.720
ripples, right? This is something he uses a lot. Add a plane with some water ripples and some reflection

47:08.720 --> 47:13.520
and you get a ton of visual interest on the bottom side of your image, right? And that's all it is,

47:13.520 --> 47:20.320
it's super simple. The terrain looks like maybe some texture that he he probably reuses that he

47:20.320 --> 47:27.120
does a lot of terrain. But there's little to no texture information on there. Within the castle

47:27.120 --> 47:32.000
structure, there's a lot of lights placed that are illuminating both from below, like you can see

47:32.000 --> 47:36.640
it illuminating up the side of the of the buildings. And the variety in the lighting

47:37.600 --> 47:42.800
makes that model much more than it probably is, you know, there's, you're getting a lot

47:42.800 --> 47:49.680
more out of those models. So so yeah, things to look at in this vein are like the fog, he uses

47:49.680 --> 47:57.200
that a lot atmospheric fog that creates a depth to the image. And then these other ones don't really,

47:57.200 --> 48:02.480
well reflections in general, in addition to just being water ripples, you'll see him use reflections

48:02.480 --> 48:10.080
a lot, just to multiply the level of detail. And let's see, let's go to the next one.

48:12.080 --> 48:16.560
Question from Omar, do you think that people style is an example of composition triumphs

48:16.560 --> 48:24.960
overall? You know, I, I was trying to think of how to address that specifically, the whole

48:24.960 --> 48:29.760
compositional aspect. So he we know he does photography, well, we can see that on his website.

48:29.760 --> 48:34.640
So he's got compositional understanding through photography. And in the every days he's talked

48:34.640 --> 48:40.480
about like his his goal with them is to improve as an artist and to learn new things and literally

48:40.480 --> 48:47.280
practice making perfect and shown to the world for everyone to see. And so he's said that he wants

48:47.280 --> 48:52.720
to work on like certain years, you know, he'll want to improve specific aspects of his workflow.

48:52.720 --> 48:59.040
And I know composition is, I'm just not as composition to me is still more of an ethereal

48:59.120 --> 49:06.400
concept. So I don't, I know enough to, to know when I enjoy a composition, I don't know enough to

49:06.400 --> 49:11.920
like break it down specifically. So that said, I do think given how long people has been working on

49:11.920 --> 49:20.720
this, working on his skills, he is a compositional, a compositional, a significant compositional

49:20.720 --> 49:26.080
artist, and you can look to him for inspiration and for valid approaches to composition. I just

49:26.080 --> 49:29.280
don't know how to break it down. And that's a little on me. I'm trying to learn more about

49:29.280 --> 49:41.600
composition, but it's not my strong suit. Let's see. Hello, Jeff, don't be afraid to use Photoshop.

49:41.600 --> 49:47.680
Yeah, amen. Amen to that. And the treatment aspect, super important and super, super useful.

49:48.640 --> 49:55.040
Okay, so yeah, we have from from Thibault Burton, great composition to basic shapes,

49:55.040 --> 49:59.840
triangles, mostly rules of third. Yeah. So you might probably know more about composition than me.

50:02.160 --> 50:07.360
Could you study Ray Renante Martinez? Yeah. That's another thing I want to maybe suggest

50:07.360 --> 50:12.720
at the end. If anyone else has suggestions for artists to study in later streams. Yeah,

50:12.800 --> 50:18.640
I'm open to those suggestions. How did he do the rainbow flair? I think Oh, right here is what I

50:18.640 --> 50:23.040
think you're talking about. Well, if it were me, I don't know exactly how he did it. But if it were

50:23.040 --> 50:30.720
me, you can you can Google search lens flares, right? Well, let's let's do better than Google search.

50:30.720 --> 50:39.920
Let's create search dot creative commons dot org. So this is where I like to find, especially

50:39.920 --> 50:48.480
flicker I find has gives the most results. But let's look up lens flare. And since these are CC

50:48.480 --> 50:55.920
copyright, I'm sorry, I'm creative commons, like you can use this for for basically anything. But

50:55.920 --> 51:02.800
usually you'll find lens flares taken with a black background. Let me let me change the

51:02.800 --> 51:08.080
wording maybe it's going to be hard to extract it out of here. But like so if you could extract it,

51:08.080 --> 51:14.320
let's say that's where your rainbow flair is coming from. I've done this a lot. So I forget

51:14.320 --> 51:27.440
where what what search terms I use specifically, let me try a different one. Well, this example

51:27.440 --> 51:35.440
kind of failed. But that's weird. I've done this many times where yeah, I'm not sure why I'm not

51:35.440 --> 51:41.280
finding them. Maybe I had to search somewhere else. Let's try one more. And then we'll get off of this.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.640
No, it's yeah, it's not it picks a day. Yeah, that's it.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.320
Let's just try flair.

51:54.800 --> 51:56.400
Oh, lens flare alpha, that's a good one.

51:56.400 --> 52:02.960
Or internet's kind of struggling.

52:05.680 --> 52:12.400
Well, I'm sorry I did not I'm gonna I'm gonna go on but unfortunately. Okay, there we go.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.680
Ah, man, I'm coming up. Okay, here's an example. This is not specifically the rainbow color that

52:21.680 --> 52:29.040
you're talking about. But this is an is an image that can be added with the ad operation over top

52:29.040 --> 52:34.160
of an image over top of your render. And you've got, you know, the lens effects and you can dial

52:34.160 --> 52:39.040
in how much you want. This is another one. It's maybe not super high quality. But here's another

52:39.040 --> 52:43.520
kind of poor quality one. This is how you go about it. It is how I would go about it in the

52:43.520 --> 52:48.800
case of people. And he uses them pretty subtly. But I think it's just an image that he pastes over

52:48.880 --> 52:53.920
top of this image, right, and does it as an addition kind of thing. It doesn't need to be

52:53.920 --> 53:00.160
super complex, you know, like he's not getting actual lens flares in the render camera. But yeah,

53:00.160 --> 53:06.320
that's kind of how he does it. I'm certain. I'm fairly certain. Does people have any image that

53:06.320 --> 53:10.480
took him a week to make if they're only days work? Imagine if he puts more time? Well, yeah,

53:10.480 --> 53:14.240
that's a good point because he does professional work too. Obviously, he's doing work for

53:14.800 --> 53:20.240
like, you know, Katy Perry's concert visuals. So he's probably not doing that in a day. He's

53:20.240 --> 53:24.720
probably spending weeks on that stuff. And the short film I showed you, I imagine that took a

53:24.720 --> 53:31.360
while, not just a day. But yeah, we're even though we're just studying on the on the every

53:31.360 --> 53:36.320
day is like that's kind of what I want you to get out of it that what is possible in an every day

53:36.320 --> 53:46.480
scenario. Just type JJ Abrams, that's pretty funny. Yeah, good call. Okay, cool. All right,

53:46.480 --> 53:53.040
so we're back on the the mastery of shading, lighting and treatment. Back to this image. Okay,

53:53.040 --> 53:58.720
yeah, so the geometry in this image registers to me as nothing to write home about. It's not

53:59.520 --> 54:04.800
super detailed. It's all very harsh edged, right? It doesn't look like anything is is modeled for

54:04.800 --> 54:10.000
smooth like like a subdivision surface modifier. But there's enough detail to register as buildings

54:10.000 --> 54:17.440
and it also helps that most of the buildings were looking at at almost parallel angles. So it kind of,

54:18.000 --> 54:22.880
you know, if the buildings were like this, you can see the detail more bluntly. But if you if you

54:22.880 --> 54:28.160
rotate like this, the detail kind of compounds on top of each other, all that to say it's making

54:28.160 --> 54:33.600
it look more complex than maybe I think it is. And then on top of that, look at the amount of

54:33.600 --> 54:37.840
light sources that are in the scene. We've got something pink coming from somewhere. I don't

54:37.840 --> 54:43.280
really know, maybe maybe there's a sign, you know, the logic is a sign above this this the screen,

54:44.080 --> 54:49.280
the frame, that's like casting this pink light. We've got light coming from inside a window,

54:49.280 --> 54:55.040
that makes that makes sense. We've got another pink light on the back, back wall, which is very

54:55.040 --> 54:59.920
simple. So it kind of illustrates like how simple the geometry is, a green light somewhere in there,

54:59.920 --> 55:07.120
purple light. So all of these different lights make for a much more interesting unique image. And

55:07.120 --> 55:12.720
that is him, I would guess like playing with light and just showcasing like how powerful it is,

55:12.720 --> 55:17.200
and how when you don't have to spend so much time on the model, it's going to be easier to let the

55:17.200 --> 55:24.160
light do a lot of this visually interesting work. Again, like always, there's a grunge texture,

55:24.160 --> 55:28.240
there's some sort of high resolution texture on the ground that breaks stuff up. You know,

55:28.240 --> 55:33.040
he's got a rock model that he just threw in there, duplicated it rotated around probably scaled.

55:33.040 --> 55:37.280
Maybe you did that procedurally, like we could do that with particles and just stick it to a surface.

55:38.480 --> 55:44.560
And let's see anything else in here. There's not really volume metrics, he typically does have

55:44.560 --> 55:50.400
like a glow around his light sources. And that really does help to sell this super bright

55:50.400 --> 55:56.800
impression of the lights. And I imagine that that is a post process, it's part of the treatment

55:56.800 --> 56:02.400
that he adds that. Let's go on to the next one. This one to me is just a straight up

56:03.280 --> 56:08.800
architectural visualization image, where all the geometry is very, very simple,

56:09.520 --> 56:14.880
you know, primitive, very simple. There's a even a simple texture, a tileable, you know,

56:14.880 --> 56:21.280
wood like texture, maybe a concrete sort of texture, but very, very short work he's made of

56:21.280 --> 56:26.160
the modeling and of the texture work. But it's the lighting and it's the quality of the global

56:26.160 --> 56:32.960
illumination that illuminates this entire space. That makes things interesting, right? So he doesn't

56:32.960 --> 56:39.040
just leave the corner of the room here as a big square, he like throws in some angled structural

56:39.040 --> 56:43.120
bits, right? And all of a sudden we've got interesting shadows happening. And how simple

56:43.120 --> 56:49.920
is it just to duplicate these pieces around. And then the balls of glass, the glass orbs,

56:49.920 --> 56:54.640
like there, that's one of an abstract element that's just there to, I think add visual interest,

56:54.640 --> 57:00.240
I don't know, there might be a meaning behind it. But what that is cool for is it takes everything

57:00.240 --> 57:06.080
behind it and distorts it in a unique way, and then displays it to you on the other side.

57:06.080 --> 57:11.520
And so that adds visual interest, adds levels of detail. And because of the shading and lighting,

57:11.520 --> 57:18.640
especially this image just shines metaphorically and literally. So this is a really cool image,

57:18.640 --> 57:23.440
I think it's photo real, in my opinion. So whoever was asking it, like doing photo real images

57:23.440 --> 57:32.080
quickly as well. And let's see, so this is the last one I believe on material and lighting.

57:33.600 --> 57:39.600
What my face is drawn to my face, my eyes are drawn to being a 3d artist is the quality of

57:39.600 --> 57:47.840
the reflections on the floor. I love a good grunge breakup of reflections, it just makes

57:47.840 --> 57:53.840
all the colors dance and vary themselves in really unique ways. It's very tangible, right?

57:53.840 --> 57:59.120
Like I can feel in my with my fingertips, like what the grime is like on the ground. I don't

57:59.120 --> 58:04.480
know, I just love the quality of that texture. And it's quite simple to add. You know, you can find

58:04.480 --> 58:08.960
grunge and grime textures on the internet very simply. Now that's pretty much all it is. It's

58:08.960 --> 58:15.040
just a plane and he's he's he's procedurally adding, I assume procedurally like these the

58:15.040 --> 58:19.040
wireframe on the on the ground plane, like we know how we can do that with the wire modifier.

58:20.480 --> 58:25.200
And so if you think about it, the only complex thing in the image is happening

58:25.200 --> 58:30.880
right here in the middle. So he's got some sort of fracture modifier that that blender, you know,

58:30.880 --> 58:36.320
the blender's equivalent sort of thing that has broken the big simple sphere and like makes all

58:36.320 --> 58:41.200
these shards of geometry that he's also scattered on the ground a little bit. And I think he's probably

58:41.200 --> 58:47.680
added a material like we can see evidence here of various colors just glowing, emitting off of

58:47.680 --> 58:54.800
the various shards. And that creates this very rainbowy, like prism type appearance. And that's

58:54.800 --> 58:59.680
where all the details happening and he and he gets extra mileage by the reflection on the ground.

59:00.640 --> 59:05.520
You know, like reflection, the idea of mirroring the detail that's already in the scene. And so

59:05.520 --> 59:10.480
tons of visual candy happening right in the middle of the image. But then if you think about it and

59:10.480 --> 59:16.480
look outside, the ground plane, very simple, it's not hard to do this wireframe business, you know,

59:17.040 --> 59:21.200
it's not time consuming rather. And then a very simple terrain in the background.

59:22.080 --> 59:29.280
The majority of this sphere is just a simple sphere, a sky texture. And all of that, I think,

59:29.280 --> 59:36.240
makes you focus into the image into the center of the image with these two people. And, and just in

59:36.320 --> 59:42.720
the compositional sense, like draws you into where most things are happening. But it also makes it,

59:42.720 --> 59:46.960
when you realize how simple the rest of the scene is, it kind of makes sense how it's achievable

59:46.960 --> 59:53.920
within a few hours. So anyway, I really want to showcase and point to the fact that he is a master

59:53.920 --> 59:59.840
of these technical skills, shading, lighting, treatment. He's a very good modeler too. He's

59:59.840 --> 01:00:07.200
doing simulation, breaking, you know, fracturing this object. He is not, he is not shirking any

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.320
technical skills in order to create this imagery. He's just, he's a master at it. And therefore,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.960
he knows how to, how to milk everything that the skills can give you. And he, he milks it and he

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.040
gets the most out of it. And in a short amount of time too. So really, really powerful use of,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.880
of shading, lighting and treatment. See if I'm missing any questions.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.960
Here we go. Could we make something at CG Cookie to spend a week doing a Beeple challenge?

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:42.160
L a Beeple contest, that would be awesome. That'd be fun. I, I, if I'm, if I'm honest, I would love

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.800
to see some more abstract things being posted to the gallery. Not that there aren't examples. There's

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.280
some really good examples of that already from an artist that I'm blanking on the name, but who

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.960
does it in Blender. But yeah, that'd be cool to see more of this for sure. A contest specifically,

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.240
you know, we've, that, that word always gets thrown around with us. And we do have a contest

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.280
format on our website. But the big problem is just trying to get somebody to run it. Like we've

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.520
got so many, so many balls that we're juggling right now that contest is just not able to fit

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.320
in our, in our priority list. But that would be sweet to do a Beeple challenge. Maybe we can start

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.080
a thread in the forum and just, you know, do it casually or something. Let me see if I'm missing

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.440
any other questions. Question, do you think it's basic emission on those poles or something more

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.240
complex shading? I think you're talking about this image here. You know, I'll bet I would

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.240
bet it's either a cylinder or a plane. The reason, actually, I'll bet it's a cylinder because a cylinder

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.400
will still render when it's glowing like that. It'll, I think he, let me, let me back up and

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.600
calm down. I think it's a cylinder for practical reasons because a cylinder will emit light in

01:01:51.600 --> 01:02:00.320
all directions, you know, in a vertically all directions horizontally. But when you, when you

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.920
render it, it looks just like planes, right? And I would guess that that's the appearance he wanted,

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.920
just these simplistic 2d planes. But for practical reasons, like, you know, if you think of adding

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:18.640
an area light, just a plane, there's a harsh line that happens where the backside and the front side

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.480
illuminate, but right on the edge, it doesn't illuminate. So that's what makes me think he's

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:30.080
probably doing a cylinder. That would just make the most sense to me. All right. So yeah, mastery

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:37.200
of shading and lighting and treatment. The abstract elements, I love this part. This is,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:45.440
this is a very mesmerizing part of his artistry, in my opinion. And why it's so unique to me and

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:52.960
new to me is my history is kind of in realism, especially like make it match reality, be a

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:59.120
little creative in that, but mostly limit yourself to what is possible in reality. Whereas like this,

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.360
this image right here, I love the idea of like ignore reason and just make something glow. That's

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:14.160
kind of how I summarize it when I look from a like a practical like recreative part of it myself,

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.600
like as artists myself, like just make stuff glow, right? So we have these bars just seemingly

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.000
randomly like intersecting our character. But if we break it down before we get to those bars,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.800
those glowing bars, like we have that character that we've already seen before, he's kind of kneeling,

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:37.360
he has high resolution textures, sure. But you know, as a character, he's probably not the most

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.560
impressive character example that we've ever seen. You know, we can imagine creating it's a body with

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:51.360
with a muscular anatomical texture on top of it. But my guess is he also knows that. And so he lights

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.960
it very interestingly. He leaves more to the imagination. He's not he's not got a key light

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.640
above and then a a world environment that's just lighting up the entire texture, there's,

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.160
there's a contrast from between the light and shadow that's that's hides enough of the character.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.040
I guess that's my roundabout way of saying that the character is not the most interesting part

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.280
of the image. And, and so you have the character, he's kind of kneeling, there's a reflective surface,

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.160
there's a light above. But then all of a sudden you throw those bars in. And this thing becomes

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.800
something very interesting very quickly. The reflections all of a sudden have these beautiful

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:35.040
gradients to deal with. The glows that he added in treatment, like there's it's like it goes from

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.880
purple to a greenish to a red to back to purple, like it seems like there's always a gradient

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.560
thing that should have been another bullet point is his use of gradients is so widespread. That's

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.920
a very important thing to consider. Even his glowy bits like right here, like there's a gradient,

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.000
there's a variety in color among them. And anyway, to me, this is this, I love this image because

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.840
it just represents like, throw something glowy in there. The fact that primitive shapes can be

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:11.520
fascinating, right? So we have these randomly random prisms, not prisms, pyramids, right there,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.880
just laying on the ground. You know, let's give it some meaning, let's say that it is, it mimics

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.760
this character's like, like shape as he's kneeling and like, you know, holding his temple and stuff.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.200
It does kind of mimic that shape. So maybe there's some meaning there. But also, it just serves to

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.120
make the image a little more interesting. It gives something to break up the reflection.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.160
And to give some play off of off of these bars even more. So

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.080
and this is another example where less can be more, in my opinion, like there's not that much

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:50.320
happening in the scene. And but still, we get a lot of visual interesting things to to feast our

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.520
eyes upon. And so I think this primitive this abstract element just throwing the rays in there,

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.480
it makes us think like, like, when it's abstract, we've never seen this before. It's like, oh,

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.720
that's different. Like, I'm intrigued already, like, look at it, it's just like intersecting

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:11.280
is his thighs and stuff, it just makes you think way more than, I guess, I think it can make you

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.400
think way more than non abstract things, just realism and stuff like that. So let's look at

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.320
some more he uses this technique a lot. Well, in general, this whole image is kind of abstract.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.600
And and just think of if we break it down how it can be created, you've got a cylindrical structure

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:34.960
that's creating this whole. And then procedurally, you can create a texture that that does these

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:43.760
jut out spike like things. And so you can generate those spikes procedurally, geometrically, but you

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:51.920
can also create the the rings, right, and various intensities going down the length of the cylinder.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.080
And so, like, that would be very easy to create if you if you are aware of like, well, in blender's

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.880
context, like what you can do procedurally, how to enable, you know, displacement and stuff like

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.880
that. And so that's really not that difficult. It's very interesting to look at, especially I like

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:16.080
how his his his his rings tend to glow a little more at the ends of the rings. So it has this like

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:24.160
five, what do you call it, fiberglass? Is that what it is? No, optical crap, like fios fiber optics,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.120
there we go, like that kind of appearance to it. And then the coolest thing about the image to me

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.640
is how he throws in these fears. Are they are they clear and refractive? I don't know. Or are

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.520
they just like chrome spheres? My guess would be chrome, because that would be easier to render.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.560
But he populates them, he scatters them throughout the image, he off centers the composition of the

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.800
tube. So it's in the, you know, bottom right corner, bottom right third. And, and it's just

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.120
interesting to look at, right, like this could, I think to me, this is one of the ones that clicked

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.160
with me. After I broke it down, like, yeah, this can absolutely be done in that amount of time.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.880
And yay, yay for us, like we can learn from him. And he's so learned from his, his workflow. So

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.960
that's another example of abstract element. This one to me is another example of just throwing

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.400
something in the scene that glows. The whole surrounding scene is actually quite detailed,

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.920
the rock quality, both geometrically shading texture wise, like all of it beautiful.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:36.080
I would guess that he did not, he did not sculpt this or create or model it within the time frame.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:42.560
It's probably part of his library, just given how detailed it is. And so you throw that in there,

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:50.480
you create the landscape, throw your people, you pose them. And, and what I find myself doing once

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:56.400
he throws, once he puts that column of light down the center is like, I find myself being drawn

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.040
into the image the way that the people are drawn to that same column in the image, right? They're

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.280
just, they look like zombies being herded into this bizarre column of light. And I find myself

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.040
doing that as well. And, and I just would never think of doing that in my own workflow up until

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.040
seeing people's work. Like I, I don't know, it would be much more boring if it was just,

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.240
if there's nothing to look at that column of light wasn't so, you know, moth to the flame

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.440
sort of thing. So I don't know, it's really challenged me to realize, throw like, just experiment,

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.440
like, get some practice throwing shapes into your scene, making them glow, because the glowing is

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:41.440
important because it adds shadows to the scene, it adds reflections to the scene. Generally,

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.560
very high contrast things, high potential for high contrast, visual interest.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.400
Very powerful thing. I actually really want to start just playing with this create a scene,

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.000
throw some shapes in there. And, and I mean, I can't remember the name of this particular image,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.320
but there was a purpose like the column of light represented something. So there was a meaning to

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:10.400
the column of light. It's not quite as simple as just throw shapes in there. But anyway, the next

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:17.120
one. So this one's pretty cool, in my opinion, because it's extreme simplicity, right? Like,

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.040
you have the character that at this point we've seen enough characters. Sorry, I've probably

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.880
been missing some questions. I'm going to get to those after this. But the simplicity of this image,

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.080
the only complexity is the character. Now, did he spend the whole two hours doing the character?

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.640
I don't know, I would guess not. He probably has that library. He threw him in there posed it. So

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.880
it looks like he's being like abducted by an alien kind of thing. The geometry around it,

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:47.200
super simple, not even reflections involved. But then you have this rainbow light around

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.520
surrounding the character. And I mean, you know, it certainly did not take him that long. I mean,

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.640
now that we've spent so much time in his artwork, we can we're starting to break it down as to how

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.920
this is achievable, given a mastery of these skills. But, but what's cool about this is if

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:16.000
we look up if we just type in Imagine Dragons, like, it became apparently their album cover or

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
they saw that image because it is part of his everyday's. And they decided they assume they

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.680
asked him and hopefully paid him to use that as part of their their imagery like their their album

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.120
art. How cool is that, you know, just a couple hours and a powerful image later, you know,

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.080
you've got connections like that, you've got success of that caliber. And yeah, this is an

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.760
example of how less can be more. You know, maybe I wouldn't look at this image and think how detailed

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.320
is that, except for the character, the character does have enough geometric detail that that reads

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:57.760
registers to me as a detailed character. But everything else is just very intentionally simple.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:04.000
And yeah, I think that's all for the abstract. Maybe there's one more. But okay, yeah, so the

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.640
procedural generation idea, like, when you look at this image, hopefully, if you've got experience

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:15.840
with Blender, you know that this can be created fairly simply with with modifiers in Blender,

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:22.000
and, you know, wire modifiers from an icosphere. And, yeah, I don't know, I don't want to break

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.720
it down and get too nerdy. But like this kind of shape, we've all probably been there, where we

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.600
play around with the modifiers and see what we can get. And even that, you know, I've never

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.320
thought of it as like a something to showcase. But like, he was probably playing with that stuff,

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.760
too, learning it himself, and realized he could turn into a pretty beautiful image, you know,

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.320
like I can absolutely imagine this being hung in someone's home, you know, like that's kind of

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.800
how I see all of his images, like these could be printed and hung in someone's home.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.760
That it's that level of artistry and quality visual. But I love how this has just a single

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:03.440
light source, seemingly like in the upper right corner, very stark shadows, huge gradient across

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:09.280
the entire image. Just, you know, using the mastery of his lighting abilities, it's all of

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:16.560
it together creates these things. All right, so finally, the last real category that I'm looking

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:22.640
at with him is unique styles. And so we've talked a little bit about, okay, before I get into that,

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.240
let me let me answer some questions. I've kind of neglected the chat. Let's see here.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.800
Question, do you think that it would be would add a nice little punch to his renders if he

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.440
sub deed the stuff after apologizing versus bullying and everything? I may be wrong, but

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.440
there's a lot of sharp edges that don't reflect light. Yes. I am. So obviously, when you do

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.640
subdivision surface, things get a lot harder. Things take a lot more time consuming because you

01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.920
have to, in a general sense, you have to be more mindful about your topology. But I would guess

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:11.600
and okay, so let me go back. Let me go back for a second and show you it was the repetition, I

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:21.760
believe. Let's go. Okay, this one. So this he maybe he used the bevel modifier, or maybe he

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.360
modeled with subdivision surface. But like these this image, particularly all these models do have

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:33.600
like edge, edge illumination, like reflectivity. So it looks like they've been beveled at least.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.080
And in this image, like it registers that way, it seems like maybe modeling is what he was focusing

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:44.240
on primarily. So it's not that he doesn't do it, but he chooses not to. And sharp edges, I think,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:50.400
given how how often he's making images, he's probably decided that he likes it. It's not an

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:57.120
oversight, but he likes the sharper edges. We are obviously seen here that he doesn't. He can do it.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.840
What am I trying to say? He can do beveled edges in that appearance. But

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:11.040
I don't know, I'm also a very big fan of his if you can't tell. So I don't think he makes mistakes or

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.640
oversights, you know, at this point in his in his mastery of these skills, I think everything's

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.480
pretty intentional. That would be that's what I at least air on the side of. All right, so let me go

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.960
back to the questions. Oh, but you did say like it adds a nice little punch and I would agree, like

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.000
I'm a model or primarily like that's that's what I do most of the time. And I like to see the bevels

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.760
sharp edges can sometimes, you know, ruin that for me. But and so I agree it could, especially in

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.360
that image we just looked at it does add a nice little punch. Can the same techniques be applied

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:52.720
to non abstract art? Yes, I think so. Like this, this is an example, William, of his realism,

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:59.680
he's able to achieve photo realism. This, this reminds me of even a little bit that the poster

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.360
ready player one, which this image was around a pretty certain long before that poster came out.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.000
But so maybe this was inspiration for the poster. But this to me, there's no abstract,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.680
there's very little abstract, if any abstract nature to this, it's pure photo realism. But we

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:22.400
see his his ability to use repetition, to use the power of light sources, and quality shading,

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.800
you know, the volumetrics up at the top, just makes it feel like a hazy kind of back

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.920
alleyway feel to this. So yeah, these techniques could totally be used for

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.880
non abstract things. And, and yeah, so this, this last category is going to showcase like,

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.000
just a piece of the, the different styles he's able to achieve outside of abstract. But

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:52.720
so first we have realism. And then next, we've got this looks straight out of like 2001, a space

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:59.760
odyssey back to ever, you know, mentioned that he, he seems to be inspired by, by sci fi, you know,

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.600
aesthetic. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, but, but the way he treats this image, the treatment

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.760
and the glow of the lights and the, for some reason, the very or the rich saturated orange red of

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:18.000
these, these lines, you know, whatever they are, that's one of those abstract elements, these sinews

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.600
kind of running down, down the rays running down this, this tube, something about that feels very

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:31.040
70s to me and the grain in the image as well. So he achieves that, that distinguished aesthetic.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:37.680
He also has this image, which, you know, to me looks like an 80s album cover, right, like,

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:43.760
there's very little shading information. It's almost like it's very graphical, basically, and

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.080
not a lot of shading, lighting, any of that stuff, but it looks more of an exercise in procedural

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:56.400
generation of geometry. But his use of color here is very intentional and very artistic. He's also

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.280
mentioned that he's been trying to learn color, like along the way and improve his color skills.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.800
And this to me is a great example of it, but it's different, right? Like who would have thought

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.760
these two artists were the same, you know, or the same artist between these three images.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.760
So he's really pushing at his box. He's breaking his conventions, breaking what he maybe is comfortable

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:22.400
with. I know I would not be comfortable if someone told me, hey, can you create this image? I have

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.000
to really think about it compared to if someone said, hey, can you create this image? I'd be like,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
okay, I know how I'd go about it. And so he's got this 80s album cover style. And this is one of

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.960
my favorites, 90s trapper keeper graphical. And if you don't know what I mean by trapper keeper,

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.080
let's look that up real quick. These were all the rage when I was in like elementary school.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.360
Well, apparently they're still around as a brand. But what I always think of is this kind of stuff.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.400
Right. So like these primitive 3d renders with with bright neon colored lights and

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.720
you just funny shapes. This is another example of it's like they just realized how to render

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.880
3d stuff and they were they're trying to do it. Although that might be a painting, actually.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.400
Yeah, it's probably not a 3d render. But so this kind of style, this aesthetic,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.440
I think he achieves here. And he does it several times. Like,

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.600
this is a theme that he kind of revisits his style, very unique. And it's not it's not

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.720
something to be taken lightly. Like changing a style is changing a lot about how you see stuff.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.720
I mean, if you go if we go look at my portfolio, it looks like the same artist did this, you know,

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.480
and, and I don't know, I just really respect the fact that he can break those conventions,

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.320
get out of his comfort zone, and create different things. Before I go on to the next,

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.200
next styles, let me catch back up on the questions.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.520
From Nathan, in your opinion, does the fact that people use cinema 40 have a strong impact on

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.880
the visual style of his art? Can we achieve similar things with cycles? C 40 octane seems

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.440
to have a certain look to it. But that was just a service level observation of my own. All right,

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:05.040
so my opinion, my professional opinion is that no, again, I've talked about this earlier, but like,

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:11.360
the tools are not the thing to focus on at all. It's a gut reaction. And I understand that that

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.480
like, Oh, his tools must be the reason he's able to do this. But it's definitely I would say,

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.160
it's definitely not. It's his, it's his understanding of the tools that enables him to do this.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.240
If he was proficient with cycles, he'd be able to create the same thing, I guarantee that.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:34.720
Or three studio max and whatever, you know, you name it, like, there was a time when technology

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:40.640
was a little more varied. And, and I remember like using engines, render engines that sucked

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.800
compared to render engines that were good, but they're all good now, they're all good. So it's

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:53.440
not about the tools. I personally have used mental ray, vray, Maya software, blender render, cycles,

01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.160
yeah, for Ray. Are there any others that I I mean, PBR stuff like unity's engine,

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:08.640
sketch fab's engine, like we're at the point in time where all of these do very similarly,

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:13.280
you know, I mean, okay, the PBR is not like comparable to cycles exactly. But

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.400
all the traditional offline renderers, they can do the same thing, I've used them and I've done

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.280
the same thing in different engines, all that to say, don't focus on the tools, you're missing

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:33.280
out if you think the tools are the reason he's able to do this stuff. I love the glowy stuff,

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.560
I agree, man, I, I just get lost in it. And I love it. And that's partly subjective, I'm sure, but

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.720
there's some fun glowy stuff. Technically, they're tetrahedrons. Oh, I'm sorry, maybe you're talking

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:58.000
about the pyramid. But thank you for the clarification. Wow, this is PG 13. Yeah, it's about to get

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.480
close to rated r towards the end. Let me see if I miss anything else. Okay.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:13.040
Oh, yeah, a lot of the images you've chosen for today could be on on a Pink Floyd album cover.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.960
That's pretty awesome. Yeah, he's, he's, and obviously, like, he's got that aesthetic, he

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.400
does most of his renders in like a taller format, not the widescreen, you know, cinematic format.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:28.080
So I think he probably, and given his connection with like VJ stuff, like he's got a connection to

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.960
music. So he's got to be influenced by that stuff. But yeah, I mean, we've seen Imagine Dragons use

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:41.360
his stuff for their album covers. So definitely got got a an album cover aesthetic to him.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.800
Pink Floyd is a pretty big rock band. So check them out if you haven't heard of them before.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.960
All right, maybe I'm caught up.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:04.160
Sorry, I kind of let the questions get. Wow, you guys are talking. I love it. Okay, cool.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.160
Excellent. All right, so back to the styles we've got we've covered 90s Trapper Keeper graphical.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:18.640
Next, we have basically vector art, right? So he's, he's even out of his, he's kind of like

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.520
crisscrossing software, you know, you usually do this kind of thing with, what is it, Illustrator or

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.160
like Inkscape, if you're on Linux, where it's like gradients and shapes, right? There's very little,

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.120
almost no lighting information, we can tell that this big shape is a sphere that's reflecting

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.320
the other shapes just because the subtle reflection that we can see in there.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.680
And all this ball too, but besides that, there's very little information. And so,

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.680
you know, he's getting into, into the abstract graphical world by using 3D and octane. Like,

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.720
I love to see him break out of the conventions of even the software and what they're designed for,

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.480
and like making something completely unique. It's, yeah, it's not something to take,

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.560
to take lightly to experiment in these different styles, using the same tools.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:08.880
And then this one to me, like go, we have several abstract categories, at least the way I had to

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.000
find it. This to me is like an abstract portrait. It almost looks like a photograph, like this was a

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.480
display or a gallery piece in a museum or something. And he took, he took a black and white photo of

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.280
it, but like, you know, it's centrally framed. The composition is very central. It's this,

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.880
it's this, you know, there's a theme of square shapes all around everything's square and blocky.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.120
But he's just very good at that. And right up his wheelhouse with the sharp, sharp

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.120
shadows coming from a key light in the upper left corner, and then procedurally generated

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:51.840
geometry. So in this way, you know, it looks to me like an abstract photo or portrait. He's also got

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.800
a painterly, this painterly image. I mean, it registers to me like a painting, like an oil

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:07.360
painting or something. There's no reflectivity. But it's like, the way he achieved that style to

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.960
me is just fascinating. But yeah, this again, looks like something that could be hung in a home.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.080
Like I think I could get my wife to buy this and hang in our house at thinking it's a painting and

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:23.680
not a 3d render. So yeah, I mean, at this point, I'm just trying to I'm illustrating how many

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.840
different varieties of style he had, he's able to achieve. And I mean, this is just a scratching

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.760
the surface, right? Like, we've got 4000 images that we can choose from from him. So this is abstract

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.360
painterly, abstract realism. This is one of my favorite things about him that draws me into him,

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.760
where all of the technical proficiency of realism is there, right? The reflections

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.520
read very, very realistic. The glass refraction reads very realistically. It looks like studio

01:25:53.520 --> 01:26:00.160
lighting. So everything about the technical part of this feels real. But then this this weird

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:08.480
glass blown sphere shape is something I've never seen before. And so like it transports me into this

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:15.280
this fake world that feels real, you know, like he's able to do that so well. And and he's just,

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.480
you know, it's his mastery of those skills and that understanding of computer graphics and

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:26.320
realistic rendering that frees him up to create these abstract things to put a twist on it and

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:34.160
or a swirl to be literal. So I like this abstract realism, where it's like a shape that I've never

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.760
seen before, or it's a it's a light beam that I've never seen before. But everything else around

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:45.920
it feels tangible and feels real. And then finally, abstract character, you know, we've seen his

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:52.240
character work a lot in throughout the images. And you know, as a 3d modelers, we all can probably

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.320
look at this and think, Oh, yeah, that's just a head model, right? Like those are dime a dozen,

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.160
you can find them anywhere, we can see, you know, the the the what do you call them eyelash geometry

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.160
that that kind of serves as these little cards, we can see those in there, we can see the the

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.560
mouth cavity inside, you know, the transparent glass. But he takes something simple to me.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:20.480
And he creates this, this refractive, what's the word dispersed, like dispersion, you know,

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:27.360
refractive dispersion, and makes the transparency have a rainbow color going on, he's, he's broken

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.480
up the reflections and refractions with with the grunge texture, we can see evidence of that.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.240
And he's even like put some internal geometry in there, aside from from the eyes and the the

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.640
mouth cavity and teeth, there's like some sort of ball back here. It looks like he's almost

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:49.040
duplicated the the scalp and like pushed it into the head. And I mean, the only reason I can think

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.320
of is to make it more visually interesting to give more things more geometry for the refraction.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.600
And, and like that's me breaking it down. But what every single one of these images has is when

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.800
you take a step back, and you just look at it, your eyes have so much to enjoy, and your mind

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.640
does too, like it challenges your perception. And in that way, it keeps me coming back and back

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.920
and back, obviously, has led to success for him. And this is just a couple hours, you know, like

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.520
it's it's a couple hours every day for 10 years. And he's able to do this kind of art. So really,

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:30.320
really wide variety of style. I really challenge you to look through his library as much as you

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.120
can, you'll probably lose a couple hours to doing that, if you're like me. But, and this is again

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.640
scratching the surface, like we've only in total looked at what, like 30 images out of 4000. So

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.560
pretty crazy. But the takeaways, let me look if I've got any more. Yeah, so chromatic aberration

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.280
that might let me see if that was part of the image, there might be a little chromatic aberration,

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.760
there's definitely some of his renders that have it. I don't know about this one. That poor guy

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:03.040
looks like he has a brain tumor. Yeah, maybe that maybe the name of the art has something to do with

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:12.480
that. But yeah, okay, so that yeah, you get it Catherine. This is good. It's very, it looks real,

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:19.120
but WTF, what is it, right? Like, that's how I how he draws me in. And it's, it's fascinating,

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:26.480
and it's expanded my, like, appreciation and appetite for like, things that challenge me

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:33.360
visually. So pretty sweet. Here's a question from Omar has people said he knows a bit of coding,

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.000
it seems some of his stuff could be mathematically generated. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know that

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.880
he's ever, I've seen any evidence that he does, like, code based, you know, 3d stuff and art

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:53.760
generation, geometry generation. But like, it seems very likely given how expansive his tool set is.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:04.080
Is painterly a software? No, painterly to me is, yeah, as a style, someone else already said it.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.440
It's just like an adjective for what looks like a painting.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:19.200
Cool. All right, so let's talk about the takeaways. So we've seen a lot of artwork, and a lot of me

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:26.480
probably coming across as like a big fan and in bias. And I don't, I don't, I don't deny that he's

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.080
one of my he's probably my top artist and has been for for a while. He's been the first to really

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.000
challenge my perception of art in in years. So I'm a big fan of his, we've seen a lot of his art,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.080
talked a lot about what makes it great. And in my opinion, but what what I want you to take away,

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.000
what I want you to hopefully take away is the possibilities, the infinite possibilities in

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.360
the abstract, okay, at least an appreciation for the abstract. But like what it represents to me,

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.600
someone who's kind of grown bored with with the stuff I've like, taught or created up to this

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:06.160
point, you know, character after character after character, cartoon creature after cartoon creature,

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.320
shader after shader after shader, all this stuff, you know, that I just repeat and I stick inside

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:19.120
my box, but abstract cracks open this wide world of of new things, new ways to use my abilities,

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:25.360
new ways to use your abilities, how to improve my abilities. And also how to like a new route for

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.920
expressing myself. That's one thing that's that's been growing in me, like how to say something

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.680
that I want to say with my art, not just recreate a lightsaber, you know, not not just do that kind

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.320
of stuff. So there are infinite possibilities in the abstract, I hope you kind of get some of that.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:47.360
The fact that he is a master people is a master at these technical skills. So his his abstract,

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:54.000
I don't mean to go back to the debate, but where I maybe mistakenly can see abstract art as

01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:03.200
as a shirking of the technical, technical skill, in favor of like expression or experimentation,

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:10.000
like he is a master at technical and he's a master at abstract. Oh, but yeah, so the rest of that

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.400
quote, like, or the rest of that point, the mass, your ability to master the technical skills is

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:20.560
what will liberate the artist. I think that's what I get out of people is, and I'll talk about more

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:27.840
why in just a minute. But I believe it requires him to be a master in order to convey these abstract

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:34.960
visual pieces, not the other way around. So also he's a there's no better there's no better example

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:40.720
than practice makes perfect. We can see he's been doing it been added for 10 years, insane.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:48.800
And he said like he's posting this, that he's doing it intentionally to to practice and to get

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:53.200
better and by posting it on the internet. And he's being held accountable for that, you know,

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.280
really, really impressive dedication to it. And finally, remember that people is human. So

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.880
if in theory, if he can do it, so can you so can I. More realistically, like I'm not really

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:11.840
planning on doing this for 10 years, like not many people will. But if I can just glean a few

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.920
nuggets here and there, apply it to my workflow, take that challenge and it takes me further down

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.840
the road. Knowing that he's human, that's what can motivate me to do that kind of stuff. Certainly

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:31.680
how my my mind works. Is there anything else? Well, okay, I did want to show you about the

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.920
fact that he is human and practice makes perfect to illustrate this, you can go to his website,

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:41.760
look at his every days. And he's posted all of them, I believe. And he's he's got them in archives,

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.600
right? So you can go down to year one rounds are years as far as I can tell. So round one,

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.640
he was just focusing on drawing round two, he started to learn cinema 4D. Well, okay, so let's

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.000
just let's just spend some time in there real quick. Yeah, let's look at some of these.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:06.320
Some of these images, some of these drawings. Now, he's very expressive. So he's, you know,

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:12.880
he's got, he's got things to say. And they could be a little PG 13 radar, just be aware of that.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:20.640
But like, from a technical standpoint, like, if I'm honest, it's not like in incredibly

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.520
impressive work, right? He looks like a younger artist learning things. So that's his drawings.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:32.880
If we go back to his first years in cinema 4D, look at some of this stuff. Yes, this should

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:39.600
make you feel so much better. Like this is where we all started, right? Like I didn't really do

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.800
stuff like this, he's that's already a little more advanced tectonic turds is the name of this one.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:50.160
But like, look at this kind of stuff, he's probably figuring out what lens flares are all

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.120
about. Like this simple character, like, thank goodness, this artist started out this way,

01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.720
and he's posted it on the internet, like we can see it explicitly his progression of skill. That's

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.200
what I'm trying to show you. If you go through these, you'll see round three, that was another

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:13.680
Cinema 4D, I think seven out of 11 are all 3D based. And, you know, like we can continue to see

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.080
his work and his progression, how he gets better and better and better, not only in the quality of

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:25.200
his 3D, but also like, I think what he's expressing, you see a maturity and an advancement of, of like

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:31.760
composition of the voice that I was talking about. So anyway, spend some time there if you don't

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.120
believe that he is human, and that you couldn't do this stuff too. It's all documented right here

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:42.880
in his archives. And eventually, you see him start just, he's just excels every single year,

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:50.320
and learns, learns enough to become a just insane, insanely talented artist, gifted artist, sorry,

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.720
talented, is a questionable term. Alright, now the last thing I want to end with is, when he

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:06.080
finished his 10 day, his 10 years in a row, he, he posted this, this image like a, like a, a typographic

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:12.960
image to commemorate his 10 years. And I want to end with that, it is a little rated R. So,

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.240
out of respect for social constructs and what, what we, at this point in time have decided

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.320
as appropriate language, I'm going to censor it, even though that could, I feel like as a disservice

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.280
to the actual thing, to his message, but I'm going to censor it. But you remember this, this is,

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.680
there's been no better challenge in my opinion than what he says here after 10 years of doing this

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:41.680
stuff. So remember it, read it to yourself, uncensored, exactly how it is, but so I'm going

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.040
to read it right now, forget checking Facebook again, forget that picture you just saw on Instagram,

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.680
forget worrying about how many people liked your last post, forget the news, forget that person

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:56.400
you really should email back, forget yourself doubt, forget whatever happened yesterday,

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.480
forget starting tomorrow, forget, will people like this, forget, will this be good enough,

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:11.200
forget all of your excuses, sit down and do work. That, that should motivate the hell out of you,

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.640
okay? And it does me, and I want to leave it with that, that commemorates his 10 years, no

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:22.960
better authority to say that in him. No one who has documented a harder worker than Beeple,

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:30.560
than Mike Beeple, Winkleman, wow, I almost forgot his name, how embarrassing. So yeah,

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:37.440
that is Beeple, that is an artist study, I hope you got some things out of that, and hope you

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.600
liked it. So that's going to be all for today, I don't see any other questions. I feel one with

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.080
that quote, that is amazing. So yeah, if there is any other questions from Glenn Johnson, do you

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:59.520
have any of your own artwork inspired by Beeple Kent? Okay, there's one image, let me see if I

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:07.840
can find it. It's really bad though, like I mean, it's hardly an inspiration, let me see, let me see

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:19.920
where it's at. Um, is it right here? It was a, no, no, no, I'm sorry, it was not this course, it was

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:27.280
Art of Sculpting. Sorry, I'm almost there, this one. So this feature image right here,

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.840
um, all it did, I think I was, I just seen Beeple's work and his use of like harsh pink lighting,

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.080
basically harsh saturated lighting I've always shied away from. So when I was playing with

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.720
the new feature image, I took that from him, you know, I was inspired by that. That's it,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:51.200
right? So that's not much at all, but I really do want to, at some point, do a stream where I try

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:58.240
to mimic his workflows, I try to apply what I feel like I've learned from analyzing his art,

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.880
and try to create some abstract image within like a two hour timeframe. So I do want to do that.

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:11.760
We'll see when it actually happens, but anyway. Yeah, so that is going to be the stream for today.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.640
What's up next for you Kent? Let's see, this month I'm focusing on doing, like,

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.960
uh, I'm doing a stream each week and next week is going to be a, what is it, a stream about

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.080
freelancing. We're going to have a discussion with Lampell and Wayne Dixon about freelancing

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:35.040
tips and sharing about our experience freelancing and what we've learned about it. We're going to do

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.080
a couple of other things that I'm going to publish really soon. I've got it all planned,

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.880
I just need to publish it officially to our calendar. But um, yeah, that's what I'm working

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.600
on. I'm trying to figure out what class to do next, and there's a lot of good, um, exciting

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.800
ideas for that kind of stuff. But I've kept you long enough about an hour and 40 minutes. So I'm

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.520
going to, I'm going to sign off for today. I'm glad to hear that someone thought it was amazing,

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:05.440

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:09.600

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:16.000
