0	12960	As with any 3D application, the interface and navigating that interface is one of the
12960	16640	most important things to grasp when starting out with Blender.
16640	20000	The interface in Blender is comprised of several different elements.
20000	24040	Starting from the left to right, on the left side we have the toolbar, and this toolbar
24040	28600	contains a multitude of tools that allow you to work directly with your 3D model.
28600	32120	We'll start with some of these when we're in the modeling section, when we actually
32120	35200	start looking at manipulating our objects.
35200	37720	Right here in the center, we have the 3D viewport.
37720	42440	The viewport is your view into the 3D world, and is where you will spend most of your time
42440	44920	working directly with your objects.
44920	48560	The viewport allows you to manipulate all the different objects within your scene, including
48560	52560	the camera, the mesh, and the lights.
52560	55240	Moving over to the top right, we have the Outliner.
55240	59120	The Outliner is a display of all the different objects within your scene.
59120	63080	It allows you to see what's connected to what, select those objects, and manipulate them
63080	64600	in other ways.
64600	67800	Although you won't use this a lot starting out probably, it is very essential when you
67800	72560	start working with large scenes and you'll quickly begin to see how valuable it can be.
72560	74740	Right below it, you can find the Properties panel.
74740	79820	The Properties panel has a series of different properties along the header here, which all
79820	83200	contain different settings relating to your scene.
83200	87640	The default one are the Render properties that allow you to change things like image
87640	91480	size, output formats, and whatnot.
91480	95560	We'll explore a few of these here in this Getting Started series, here in a little while.
95560	100160	For the time being though, it's a good thing to just explore and see what's what.
100160	104220	Next, going back over to the bottom, we have the Timeline.
104220	110480	The Timeline here is used during animation, and allows you to move your view through time.
110480	114300	Now by default, you're not going to notice anything changing here, except for this number
114300	117080	here, which refers to the frame number.
117080	121360	The frame number is your number of frames per second, and we'll cover this more in the
121360	122840	Intro to Animation.
122840	127520	For the time being, let's go ahead and move on to Navigation.
127520	132040	Navigation is one of the most essential things, as it's what allows you to move around your
132040	134040	3D world.
134040	139440	Since we're working with a full 3D object that allows us to manipulate it from every
139440	144320	side and angle, it's important to be able to move around naturally.
144320	148720	Now with your mouse over the 3D viewport, you can move around using a combination of
148720	151080	hotkeys and the middle mouse button.
151080	154960	If you just click your middle mouse button, you're able to rotate your view around or
154960	158600	orbit your view around your model.
158600	160680	This is good for viewing at any angle.
160680	165620	However, it's also important to be able to pan your view, or move it from side to side
165620	171620	and up and down, which you can do by holding SHIFT and middle click and dragging.
171620	176620	You can also zoom your view by using the scroll wheel on your mouse, or the plus and minus
176620	179980	keys on your keypad to zoom in and out.
179980	184880	Obviously this is essential for viewing models closer, or getting real up close to details
184880	188340	or far away to view an entire scene.
188340	192800	Next there's even more, and it's necessary to be able to view your model from direct
192800	197480	angles, such as the top, the front, the back, the side, etc.
197480	200000	And this can be done by the keypad on your keyboard.
200000	205040	Now do keep in mind that this is not the same as the top numbers 1 through 0 on your keyboard
205040	206040	along the top.
206040	209520	They are very different within Blender without changing a few settings.
209520	216140	So if you do not have a keypad on your laptop, you can use the function keys and the JKL
216140	221280	and those keys to compensate for your number pad, or you'll find a setting within the user
221280	224080	preferences to emulate the number pad.
224080	228440	For the time being, if you can use a number pad, I highly encourage it.
228440	233480	This allows you to change directly to your individual views.
233480	237080	The three most commonly used are top, front, and side.
237080	243480	You can switch to top view by hitting 7 on your number pad, front by 1, side view by
243480	248880	hitting 3, and then you can go to the opposite of each of those by holding down CTRL and
248880	258760	hitting 7, 1 for back, 3 for side, or the left side, and of course the top was the bottom.
258760	263080	You can also toggle between perspective and orthographic mode, orthographic being that
263080	267480	there is no perspective applied to the viewport by hitting 5 on your number pad to toggle
267480	268920	between the two.
268920	273440	You'll normally use orthographic view while modeling directly from a reference and then
273440	278880	perspective mode to check that you have not overcompensated anything and that everything
278880	283080	is correct when viewed with perspective to make sure that everything is as it should
283080	284880	be in the real world.
284880	291520	Next, you can also use the 4, 6, and 8 on your keypad to rotate at increments around
291520	298080	your model, and this can be helpful for getting a more direct, exact view to your model.
298080	302880	And lastly on the number pad, you can use 0 to switch to your camera view.
302880	307140	As you can see in the 3D view here, we have a camera object that allows us to see what's
307140	313040	going on, and this acts just like a real world camera in that it captures the view, and so
313040	319800	anytime you want to create an image or render an image out into a JPEG, PNG, or another
319800	325840	image format, you use the camera to display what you want to view.
325840	330440	And so by hitting 0 on the number pad, you can see that, and that will allow you to save
330440	331960	out that image.
331960	337120	Now we will cover that more directly in one of the later sections in rendering, but for
337120	342160	the time being, go ahead and practice navigating around your model until you can navigate very,
342160	349200	very naturally to any angle you want to zoom in and out, pan around, orbit, you name it.
