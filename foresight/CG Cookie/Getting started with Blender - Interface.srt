1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
As with any 3D application, the interface and navigating that interface is one of the

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
most important things to grasp when starting out with Blender.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
The interface in Blender is comprised of several different elements.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,040
Starting from the left to right, on the left side we have the toolbar, and this toolbar

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,600
contains a multitude of tools that allow you to work directly with your 3D model.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,120
We'll start with some of these when we're in the modeling section, when we actually

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,200
start looking at manipulating our objects.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,720
Right here in the center, we have the 3D viewport.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,440
The viewport is your view into the 3D world, and is where you will spend most of your time

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,920
working directly with your objects.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,560
The viewport allows you to manipulate all the different objects within your scene, including

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,560
the camera, the mesh, and the lights.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,240
Moving over to the top right, we have the Outliner.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,120
The Outliner is a display of all the different objects within your scene.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,080
It allows you to see what's connected to what, select those objects, and manipulate them

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,600
in other ways.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Although you won't use this a lot starting out probably, it is very essential when you

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,560
start working with large scenes and you'll quickly begin to see how valuable it can be.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,740
Right below it, you can find the Properties panel.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,820
The Properties panel has a series of different properties along the header here, which all

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,200
contain different settings relating to your scene.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,640
The default one are the Render properties that allow you to change things like image

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,480
size, output formats, and whatnot.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,560
We'll explore a few of these here in this Getting Started series, here in a little while.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,160
For the time being though, it's a good thing to just explore and see what's what.

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,220
Next, going back over to the bottom, we have the Timeline.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,480
The Timeline here is used during animation, and allows you to move your view through time.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,300
Now by default, you're not going to notice anything changing here, except for this number

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,080
here, which refers to the frame number.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,360
The frame number is your number of frames per second, and we'll cover this more in the

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Intro to Animation.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,520
For the time being, let's go ahead and move on to Navigation.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,040
Navigation is one of the most essential things, as it's what allows you to move around your

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
3D world.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,440
Since we're working with a full 3D object that allows us to manipulate it from every

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,320
side and angle, it's important to be able to move around naturally.

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Now with your mouse over the 3D viewport, you can move around using a combination of

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,080
hotkeys and the middle mouse button.

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,960
If you just click your middle mouse button, you're able to rotate your view around or

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,600
orbit your view around your model.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,680
This is good for viewing at any angle.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,620
However, it's also important to be able to pan your view, or move it from side to side

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,620
and up and down, which you can do by holding SHIFT and middle click and dragging.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,620
You can also zoom your view by using the scroll wheel on your mouse, or the plus and minus

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,980
keys on your keypad to zoom in and out.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,880
Obviously this is essential for viewing models closer, or getting real up close to details

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,340
or far away to view an entire scene.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,800
Next there's even more, and it's necessary to be able to view your model from direct

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,480
angles, such as the top, the front, the back, the side, etc.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,000
And this can be done by the keypad on your keyboard.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,040
Now do keep in mind that this is not the same as the top numbers 1 through 0 on your keyboard

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
along the top.

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,520
They are very different within Blender without changing a few settings.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,140
So if you do not have a keypad on your laptop, you can use the function keys and the JKL

55
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,280
and those keys to compensate for your number pad, or you'll find a setting within the user

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
preferences to emulate the number pad.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,440
For the time being, if you can use a number pad, I highly encourage it.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,480
This allows you to change directly to your individual views.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,080
The three most commonly used are top, front, and side.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,480
You can switch to top view by hitting 7 on your number pad, front by 1, side view by

61
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,880
hitting 3, and then you can go to the opposite of each of those by holding down CTRL and

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:18,760
hitting 7, 1 for back, 3 for side, or the left side, and of course the top was the bottom.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,080
You can also toggle between perspective and orthographic mode, orthographic being that

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,480
there is no perspective applied to the viewport by hitting 5 on your number pad to toggle

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
between the two.

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,440
You'll normally use orthographic view while modeling directly from a reference and then

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,880
perspective mode to check that you have not overcompensated anything and that everything

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,080
is correct when viewed with perspective to make sure that everything is as it should

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
be in the real world.

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,520
Next, you can also use the 4, 6, and 8 on your keypad to rotate at increments around

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,080
your model, and this can be helpful for getting a more direct, exact view to your model.

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
And lastly on the number pad, you can use 0 to switch to your camera view.

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,140
As you can see in the 3D view here, we have a camera object that allows us to see what's

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,040
going on, and this acts just like a real world camera in that it captures the view, and so

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,800
anytime you want to create an image or render an image out into a JPEG, PNG, or another

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,840
image format, you use the camera to display what you want to view.

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,440
And so by hitting 0 on the number pad, you can see that, and that will allow you to save

78
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
out that image.

79
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,120
Now we will cover that more directly in one of the later sections in rendering, but for

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
the time being, go ahead and practice navigating around your model until you can navigate very,

81
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,200
very naturally to any angle you want to zoom in and out, pan around, orbit, you name it.
