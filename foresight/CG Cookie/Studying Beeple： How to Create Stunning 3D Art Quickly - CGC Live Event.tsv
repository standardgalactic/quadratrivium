0	13360	Hello, hello, everybody. Welcome to the weekly Blender Oriented CG Cookie Stream. Today is
13360	18400	a free stream. We usually reserve those for citizen members, but try to do a free one
18400	24800	occasionally. And this one also being the first genre of artist study, as I'm calling
25120	29840	it, figured it would be a good thing to make free, and so that is available to anyone and
29840	39600	everyone. Yeah, so welcome to this artist study on the artist name as Beeple. I have been super
40240	46880	excited about this. I think has the record for the furthest out scheduling of a live stream. It's
46880	54640	been it's been available. Oh no, I have an echo. That's not good. Oh, I'm sorry. My
54640	59920	bad. So I was playing the stream as well, my fault. Hopefully that's that's solved now.
60800	67040	Let me know in the chat if that's solved. That was my fault. But yeah, so I had I had the idea
67040	75200	months ago and reached out to Beeple to ask if I could use his artwork and on the stream and he
75200	81520	very kindly generously said yes. Okay, cool. It's glad to see that's fixed. Awesome. And so
82080	86960	thank you Beeple. If you ever see this, I appreciate you letting us do this huge fan,
86960	92880	which will be definitively proven by the end of this by the end of this stream. But
93760	99680	yeah, so Beeple, let's let's let's talk about why we're going to be learning about Beeple.
101440	107600	Beeple is Mike Winkleman. And here's a stat sheet of source of sorts. He's an American digital
107600	115840	artist and designer. He specializes in abstract art, VJ loops, which, you know, like music that
115840	122320	has visual aids kind of that, you know, loop, and that's kind of VJ loops. I'm not, I haven't
122320	126800	ever done those, but didn't know if anyone else needed that explained. Concert graphics, I've
126800	132720	heard him say in a, in a presentation that he's done concert graphics for Katy Perry, and one of
133040	138880	one of her tours, he's done album art for Imagine Dragons. So you've maybe even seen
138880	145200	some of his art before. He also does these things called every days, which is one of his
145200	152480	maybe biggest claims to fame in that for over 10 years now, he's done a daily image from start to
152480	157920	finish. Every single day, he's not missed a single day. I've heard him say that even on the day that
157920	164240	his, his child was born, he managed to do an every day. And so that means like, we'll look at the
164240	171920	math, but he has thousands, nearly 4,000 images in his portfolio on top. In addition to everything
171920	177040	he does professionally, which I couldn't find a ton of information aside from the Katy Perry and
177040	182000	Imagine Dragons stuff, just because I couldn't find like a LinkedIn or, or a traditional resume, but
182880	187840	he, he's a very successful artist and his every day is alone. That's what we're going to be focusing
187840	194720	on primarily today. And I think we can glean a lot of information out of those. But, you know,
194720	201200	as far as tools, he uses Cinema 4D and Octane primarily. And, you know, that's just kind of a
201200	207760	stat. We're a blender crowd here. And so at this point in 2018, you know, it's not terribly, you
207760	213120	know, significant, which software is used software is advancing so much. And we all know how powerful
213120	219440	Blender is. All of these things can can, can be all these techniques that we study about people
219440	227520	can be achieved in probably whatever software you choose. A quick question from William,
227520	232640	did his computer ever break? I don't know, he's got to have the highest end workhorse computer
232640	239200	given how how he renders like really intense things like a lot of reflections and caustics. So
239200	242880	he's got to have a really good computer. Who knows if it's broken. I mean, that would not be
243920	248560	not be surprising at all if it has, but I don't know. I did. I tried to be very quick with my
248560	254080	communication. I feel like he's a big deal. I didn't want to, you know, badger him with with
254080	260480	requests. So anyway, so he's very proficient at modeling, shading, lighting, compositing,
260480	267680	procedural animation, basically everything in the 3D pipeline, composition at an artistic sense.
267760	273120	And I put voice. That's just that's how I describe someone who uses their art to speak,
273120	278480	to convey an idea. He's very good at that. And I feel like that's necessary to put in the stat sheet
278480	285520	because so often 3D artists lack a voice, you know, often it's just the the art of recreating
285520	289600	something. It's it's not so much conveying something or expressing something from from
289600	294800	yourself. And so he's very good at that as well. And his portfolio is massive. As I've talked about
294800	300320	his every day's alone means he has about 4000 images. It's huge and not just not just images
300320	304720	like like I probably have 4000. I don't know if that many like work in progress, you know,
304720	309360	like halfway done models or here's today's progress compared to tomorrows and whatever.
309360	316640	These are like start to finish in like like pieces of art basically. So he has it's massive.
316640	321440	As far as I know, he works alone. He's I mean, especially with his every day is like that's
321440	327440	just him. And he's an absolute powerhouse in that sense. So whatever, you know, this is a resume,
327440	333840	like, let's actually look at some of his work at this point. And yeah, okay, so being a free stream,
333840	340480	if this is your first time here, or if you're a member of CD Cookie, this is this this environment,
340480	346000	this format is great for asking questions and getting pretty much immediate feedback. So if you
346000	352480	can, we got a fairly primitive system in the chat. If you could like add a prefix of like question,
352480	358480	like the word question in all caps, or a Q or something to let me know that it's a question,
358480	362080	because otherwise I'm just looking for a question mark and I can get confusing. But
363920	367360	anyway, yeah, so that's how you can ask questions. I'm going to try and keep an eye on that so we
367360	372720	can interact and stuff. But the first thing I want to do is just let his work speak a little bit.
373680	379760	And we'll go over to his website, just people crap.com. He's got a pretty
381040	386720	interesting personality. I love, I love how expressive he is and blunt about things. But
386720	391040	you'll probably see that if you start following him, which I highly recommend. So here we can see
391040	396640	like he's got, he's got these films, he's got VJ clips, and then every day's and resources and
396640	402880	things like that. But the first thing I ever saw about people that I knew was his work was this
402880	408720	zero day short. So I'm going to play a little bit of that and, and let do that do some talking.
409760	415120	Again, it is the first thing I ever heard or saw from him. So let's just take a moment and watch a
415120	422480	bit of that. For the past few months now, the nation's top military, intelligence, and law enforcement
422480	427040	officials have been warning Congress and the country about a common cyber attack.
427040	430400	Another weapon added to the arsenal and cyber warfare.
431360	438880	We have entered into a new phase of conflict in which we use a cyber weapon to create physical
438880	443840	destruction. A battle is waging across the internet.
443840	452720	One hundred and forty cyber attacks on U.S. companies.
457200	459200	Thirty million lines of code.
459680	472080	Because it's U.S. considers it an act of war. Well, the messages don't mess with us.
479120	485120	But what struck me is the fact that he was a single artist and he, the quality of modeling,
485680	491840	quality of texturing, shading, lighting, compositing, composition, and animation on top of
491840	496640	all that, that he's doing that as a single artist. Obviously, like it was a staff pick on Vimeo.
497600	503520	He's got a few staff picks. So super impressive work. And that hooked me on him. And I started
503520	508560	looking him up and then got onto his everyday work. But before we get into there, you know,
508560	514080	like check out some of his like VJ clips. I find them mesmerizing. If we, if we go look at those
514080	520240	real quick, I just also on top of being like static images, which is what his every days are,
520240	525280	like he still does animation on top of that. And being a generous guy like these are creative
525280	529360	commons. He says you can use them for anything commercial or non-commercial if you happen to
529360	534960	be a VJ. But just for visuals and knowing if you've been doing 3D much, like, you know that
534960	540000	animation kind of separates men from the boys in a way. And so to see some of these
545040	550000	videos, just to be honest with you, he's one of my favorite kind of people.
553040	554000	Yeah, he's good.
557280	565360	Also, he's gonna go on and on. And you've also seen his name's Midge on Twitter. He started
565360	570400	doing some similar things with Blender, like these looping abstract animations. And no doubt
570400	576800	he's been inspired by people. But yeah, just trying to give you a feel for like what quality
576800	584000	of work people does before we get into the meat and potatoes of his every days. But yeah, check
584000	590880	this stuff out. It's super cool. And now let's get to the everyday aspect of it. So on his everyday
590880	597840	page, you can see he's got a consecutive day counter 3,990 consecutive days of making an image
598800	605840	from start to finish. And before we dive into those, let's go back to the presentation. I can't
605840	611760	really try to remember the order of this stuff. Okay, yeah, so why are we going to study people?
611760	616080	Hopefully some of that's clear now with the introductory video that I showed you and an
616080	623120	idea of his work. But hello, Joaquin, I see you in there. The audio of the webpage is much
623200	627840	louder than the mic. So we can't hear you talking. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Let me turn that down.
629120	633760	I shouldn't be playing anything more with sound, but I apologize for that. I don't think I said
633760	639920	anything terribly important during the music. But yeah, okay, I'll turn that I'll turn that down
640960	647360	since it was recommended. So all right. Yeah, so a few reasons why I want to study people,
647360	651280	why he's had such an impact on me and why I want to convey that to you guys as well,
651280	659600	is to appreciate abstract 3d art. I have my entire career I've never appreciated abstract or modern
659600	667040	art in a sense. Because the way that I've been thinking about it is often I feel like when I
667040	671840	was in New York looking at Jackson Pollock's whatever it is where he likes, you know, splattered
671840	677040	paint all over the wall, like it was very difficult. I actually got very angry sitting in that room
677120	681760	looking at that painting with all these people gathered around. And, you know, there is such
681760	688800	an honor about this piece. And it made me angry because, you know, it almost came at the expense
688800	694320	of being like technically proficient, right? Because my three year old can splatter paint on
694320	699040	a wall, like there's not a lot of arguably from my perspective, not a lot of technique behind that,
699040	703840	even though it's it's clearly an expression of the artist, it's like only expression without
703840	708960	technical proficiency. And so because of that, and being a 3d artist, I think maybe you guys,
708960	714480	if you are as well, you can relate that everything in 3d is so complex, right, from modeling to
714480	719440	texturing, dealing with UVs, getting into shader node networks, creating procedurals,
720240	725120	generating animation, rigging, all these keyframes that you have to add, there's nothing simple
725120	731200	about computer graphics. So when that is my primary medium, it makes me a harsh critic of,
731760	736960	um, yeah, shots fire, it does make me a harsh critic of things that don't look like they take
736960	742400	technical proficiency, require technical proficiency. So whether it's short sided, it probably is,
742400	747280	I'm not, I'm not objectively the truth on this by any means, but I've never appreciated abstract
747280	754160	art. And then I discovered people and discovered how he is, you'll clearly see so proficient as a
754160	760720	3d artist, but also a gifted abstract artist that seeing the two of them combined drastically
760720	767360	changed my opinion of abstract art. And to my, and also my perception of being around 3d art and
767360	774000	forums and, and, and online places that showcase 3d art, there's not a as much abstract stuff
774000	780000	happening as there is, like character art, or vehicle modeling, like realism, mainly realism
780000	785440	and stylistic, you know, cartoony type renders, that's, that's everywhere. And those are great,
785440	790480	but it also lended to me maybe not appreciating abstract, because you don't quite see it that
790480	797120	often. So hopefully, if that's, if I'm gauging this room as well, maybe some of you share those
797120	803840	opinions. And there's a lot of techniques. So yeah, okay, already have a fan of Nathan. And,
803840	808240	and yeah, I use that as an example. Again, I'm not the truth on that. That's just always been my
808240	814400	opinion. And maybe people transforming me, I can look back at Pollock and have more appreciation
814480	822880	for that. And, and modern art in general. You have possibly emphasized the word wrong, sure,
822880	830640	like modern art, abstract art, my apologies. Maybe I'm at whatever, like, hopefully you get
830640	834560	an idea of what I'm talking about. And you will throughout the presentation. But I would love
834560	840720	for you guys to, for people to inflame an appreciation for abstract art if you don't
840720	848400	already have one. And then, all right, so from the technical standpoint, as 3d artists, I want you
848400	856720	to take away a learning of how complex, high quality, visually impressive 3d art can be
856720	862640	accomplished quickly and efficiently. That's what's important here. Being everyday pieces,
862640	867520	he is accomplishing this stuff. I think I've heard him say within an hour to three, four hours,
867520	873360	like a fairly short amount of time given how impactful the work is, and he's doing it every
873360	879520	day in addition to like professional things. So that means if we can dial into what he's doing,
879520	885040	tap into it and glean stuff from it, then our workflows can adopt some of those techniques,
885040	890000	and we can hopefully work quickly and more efficiently, while also producing more visually
890000	896400	impressive things. And with that in the similar vein, I hope that we can be challenged and
896400	901040	inspired by what is possible, because as we get into his work, as you're aware of how many
901040	905840	individual images he has, and you'll see in coming up like the quality of those images,
907520	912480	you might, you might question like how is this possible that he has done this, you know, like
912480	916400	he's super human or something. He's a crazy gifted artist or something like that. We've had
916400	922240	people mentioning in the chat like are asking like did he really not miss a day? Like is this
922240	927840	consecutive? Is that legit? And yes it is, but it means we should be inspired by it,
928560	934640	by what is possible, because we have to admit like he is a human just like us. And so that's why
934640	940240	we should be motivated, challenged and motivated, inspired to adopt some of his techniques.
942560	949840	All right, so I did not mean to flare up any kind of modern art debate or anything,
949840	956480	but I don't know have fun with that, I guess, if you want. All right, so next how to study people
957520	960880	that I tried to come up with some categories that would hopefully make this a little more
960880	968560	organized and digestible for you. And one of them being the, or I've got five, so the amount of detail
968560	975600	to me that's kind of like an entry fee into 3D graphics like impressive quality. If you
976320	980800	end up below that threshold and you don't have enough detail, the whole thing kind of falls apart
980800	985600	and I don't even want to take it to your show kind of a way. That's what amount of detail is and it's
985600	991920	it can be surprisingly difficult to achieve that detail. It always has been in my book, my experience.
992960	996800	And so that's one way we're going to look at him, the amount of detail he's able to achieve
997520	1004800	again in a short time, the use of repetition. So he does this very intelligently and I taught
1005440	1012720	a, I think it was a short course about creating these mailboxes and it kind of hit on that idea
1012720	1020000	about if you can repeat things as long as you're smart about it and you alter it slightly in a way
1020000	1025760	to like create a more visually complex image while not ruining it with repetition that breaks the
1025760	1031520	illusion. So anyway, Beeple is a great example of using repetition and it not breaking down the
1031520	1037040	image negatively at all. Also, we're going to look at the mastery of his shading, lighting and
1037040	1044160	treatment. Initially, I use the word compositing, but my hunch is that he's not compositing in the
1044160	1049360	sense of breaking an image into multiple passes and then combining it in a compositor. I feel like
1050000	1056160	he could, he's probably getting it 75 to 90% all the way there in the 3D render and then doing
1056160	1061920	treatment on top of that, adding lens flares and altering color tones and things like that.
1061920	1067040	That would be my guess. So I swapped out the word for treatment or swapped out composing for
1067040	1072480	treatment, but those, those three things are like the, in my opinion, like the trifecta of
1072480	1079760	polishing an image and while it may seem less important than what is done in 3D, a lot can happen
1079760	1085840	in that, in that stage of the three shading, lighting and treatment in that they all like
1085840	1094560	is the marriage and kind of they inform each other. All right, so then we have abstract elements.
1094560	1101680	So he, being an abstract artist, we talked about that already and I find it intriguing how he,
1102800	1107120	how he does that. And we're going to look at that and how he, how the abstract elements,
1107360	1113360	they just have this hypnotizing effect on me more so than any other, any other artists I've seen,
1113360	1118800	especially in recent years. And so I'm fascinated by that. You can, you can just get a lot out of
1118800	1123440	these abstract concepts and stuff. So we're going to talk about that. And then finally,
1123440	1130160	the unique styles. I've not seen many people break their own conventions and be able to
1130880	1136880	nail certain styles or a variety of styles and not just repeat themselves over and over and over
1136880	1142480	again. In that way, we're going to, we're going to look at that and consider how he, how he changes
1142480	1148480	up the styles. Okay, so we're going to look at it, we're going to look at several images, several
1148480	1153360	is an understatement. We're going to look at a lot of his artwork because again, we have 4,000
1153360	1158800	images to choose from. It was actually very difficult for me to limit it to just a few and
1160640	1169840	okay, question from William. Let's see. Let's see. I don't see a question, William. Oh, is it possible
1169840	1176880	to make non abstract art fast? Yes, William. Let's see, that was your question right here.
1177680	1182960	Yes, we absolutely, one of his styles, one of people's styles is he does achieve photo realism
1184480	1189280	in my opinion, like he achieves that in some of his every days, probably a lot of his every days.
1189280	1194160	And he actually, one of the interesting things about his abstract stuff, a lot of it is that
1194720	1201520	it will, he'll like plop a glowing sphere in the middle of like a photo realistic scene. There's,
1201520	1207360	there's very believable reflections and refractions going on and lighting, but then he just throws
1207360	1211840	the sphere in the middle of the image. And all of a sudden, they're like the level of interest
1211840	1217440	just like shoots up and it's such a simple thing. And so I consider that abstract, but it's in a
1217440	1224160	very believable and I use believable because, you know, his stuff like, you know, there isn't
1224160	1228880	necessarily a world that looks like his or rocks don't curve like his. So in that way,
1228880	1232880	it's not a photo, but everything about it, besides that the shading quality, the lighting,
1232880	1237520	the rendering all looks photo real. So yes, you can totally do photo real and people as someone
1237520	1242080	to study how to do that quickly. And the last thing, remember, look through all of this through
1242080	1247920	the lenses of he does this every day in a few hours, right? Just consider that.
1249120	1252720	If you're like me and it takes a week to model like a single character,
1253440	1258480	this guy's doing a much more impressive work, in my opinion, in just a few hours. So
1259120	1263520	let's start work looking through. Well, actually, I have them in the presentation.
1264080	1267520	All right, let's start in category number one, the amount of detail.
1268240	1274160	Um, the way I've described this earlier as kind of the entry fee to being taken seriously as a
1274160	1279920	3D artist, especially if you want to be like a believable 3D artist. And that is detailed, the
1280800	1285520	the level of the level and complexity of things happening visually in the scene. And
1286240	1291200	another way that I think of it is like, it makes me, it makes me feel that if I zoomed
1291200	1295920	in further to the image, there would be more information there. Even though that might not
1296480	1302320	be true, he's creating the illusion that there is more there. And, and as an artist myself,
1302320	1308640	I've often run into the limits of that and realizing like, Oh no, my texture, my textile
1308640	1315360	density of like a texture resolution of like 4k pixels, 4096 by 4096, it kind of breaks down after
1315360	1321600	a certain place. And that limits me. And so in that ways, I've felt the limitations of detail.
1321600	1326880	And even though I consider it like an entry fee, it can be harder to achieve than you think.
1326880	1332480	And he always gets this, he always nails the detail. I mean, in several ways, like he does it
1332480	1337600	in models, he does it in texturing, he does it in lighting. And lighting isn't terribly
1338400	1342960	relevant in this particular image, but we will have some coming up. But like, look at the model
1342960	1348080	quality, the geometric quality of detail, we have like big cubes with these kind of greeble
1348080	1353040	effects, whether that's a texture, whether it's a displacement, something, a lot of detail in the
1353040	1358080	bigger shapes. But then we have tons of these little rectangular shapes scattered throughout,
1358080	1365840	some of them reach like spec level of scale. And so that gives me the impression. And it's very
1365840	1369840	impressionistic, right? Like the more we study this, the more we break it down, we can see
1369840	1375200	how he does it. But like when I first see it, my initial reaction is like, I blow right past the
1375200	1380240	detail problem, like this is detailed enough, I go right past it, and I continue enjoying the image
1380240	1384240	compared to if you don't have enough detail, if your texture breaks down, and we see the
1384240	1389920	pixelation, or if your geometry has like, you know, rigid edges from not being subdivided enough,
1390720	1394480	that will break down the image and can ruin the experience can at least threaten the
1394480	1399440	experience of looking at the image. And so in this way, like he nails it, he's got so much detail
1399440	1406080	going on. These like pipes and whatever it is, scaffolding, like random stuff, like it's very,
1406080	1413840	very fine. And that suggests to me that I can zoom way in and see a lot more. But anyway, so that's
1413840	1422080	the first image to illustrate like detail quality. This one here, this one is less on the model and
1422080	1428880	more on like a lighting, wait, wait, it's actually less on texturing detail and more on the concert
1428880	1434480	of lighting and modeling. So with the lighting sense, how he gets detail out of lighting is he's
1434480	1443840	got let's count 123 times 12345678, he's got 24. That's three times eight, right? Yeah, 24 individual
1443840	1449040	light bulbs fluorescent light bulbs in these x shapes. And so that illuminates plenty of light.
1449040	1454480	But what's cool about it is in the in the walls over here, it adds a lot of light sources that
1454480	1460080	can be reflected. So there's a lot of opportunity for reflection to be caught on on the surfaces.
1460080	1465520	Now that the models on the sides are are fairly detailed, you know, we have trim and and like
1465520	1469920	they look like some sort of cathedral doors, you know, that kind of style. But the material,
1469920	1476960	if you really look at it, it looks like a very standard baseline, reflective glossy shader,
1476960	1482400	right? There doesn't look like any kind of grime breakup. But it doesn't need that because the
1482400	1487520	lighting when it's reflected in here, along with a geometry or across the surface of this
1487520	1492640	level of geometry, there's just a lot happening. It's creating that level of detail where we don't
1492640	1498000	question that we we just believe it and we're in into the image enjoying it. There is some texture
1498000	1505760	detail which he always manages to do, putting like a a grimy or some level of tileable texture on the
1505760	1510000	floor that breaks up the reflections really nice. And this is no exception, we see it in there.
1510000	1514400	But besides the floor, there looks like very little texture information and all the detail
1514400	1520720	is achieved with lighting and geometry. Sorry, let me see if I've been missing any,
1520720	1523440	I haven't been missing some questions. Let's see here.
1526240	1532080	Beeple is 2d only. Correct, this does not involve any 3d at all. Oh, no, he's he's only
1532080	1538480	he's only 3d for the most part. Aside from some early years in his every days, like he's
1538480	1544160	pretty much exclusively 3d. But that's probably been answered at this point.
1547200	1548720	Let me look for a couple more questions.
1553520	1560560	Let's see from char. Is that who was asking the question? No, sorry, I just saw a question.
1560720	1568800	Okay, so from Joaquin, he uses a lot of kit bashing in libraries for complex models.
1568800	1569840	That's not a question either.
1572880	1578800	Question, Beeple creates an entire work of art every day, or just hits the drawing board every day.
1580560	1584640	It's an entire work of art according to him start to finish, he creates it. That doesn't mean that
1584640	1588720	he doesn't have like a library of models that he sources or textures and things like that.
1588720	1594720	But like, he starts with a blank scene and then creates something new every day.
1597520	1601200	Question, is there anyone else that has done every day's or is Beeple the only brave one?
1602160	1606880	I don't know of anyone that's done every day's anywhere close to 10 years.
1607520	1611680	That is nuts if you think about it. Like, imagine what happens in a week and how many
1611680	1616400	things get in the way of your art and what you want to do in a week. I mean, I have a kid now.
1616480	1623680	And so does Beeple. My kids like eliminate a lot of free time and at least zap the strength,
1623680	1628880	the mental strength to like want to stay up an extra hour in the middle of the night to be able
1628880	1633680	to do a piece of work or something. So it's crazy that he did it for 10 years, that he's done it
1633680	1642080	and he's still going. He's almost done with his 11th year. Let's see. How can that image be done
1642080	1646240	in one day? That's not possible, right? Like, that's that that's what that's the initial
1646240	1652080	impression like this crazy how he's been doing this. All right, question, will you be breaking
1652080	1659040	down his approach to texturing Photoshop the way he achieves photorealism? No. I mean, I'm gonna
1659040	1663440	touch on some of those subjects. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like, yet, I'm in this stream,
1663440	1669520	I'm not going to like show you how how I would go about it. I do want to if this, you know,
1669520	1675600	people like this stream and like this stuff, I do want to do a stream where I try to mimic some
1675600	1680640	of his techniques and create an image in like a two hour span, something, you know, that incorporates
1680640	1684240	all these techniques. I do want to do that. It's not going to be today. Today is just strictly
1685120	1692720	looking at his work and analyzing it. But I don't know how much he goes into Photoshop. I think he
1692720	1699280	uses. Well, it doesn't matter, I guess he does in some program he image editing, he does like,
1700640	1709280	he must do some like tonal changes in the color, add some noise, change, add like,
1709280	1714400	you know, vignettes or something like that. I imagine so anyway. Sorry, there's kind of a
1714400	1719600	lot of questions. Hopefully I'm caught up. All right, cool. I think I'm caught up.
1720560	1725600	I think I'm caught up for the most part. Okay, cool. So let's get back into the detail. I've got
1725600	1731440	at least another image. Okay, yeah, this is what I thought was so interesting is is like him using
1731440	1738560	lighting to detail the scene. Like for me, I always think of geometry prime primarily like make your
1738560	1744480	model complex. That's how you achieve detail. And then the next layer is like make your textures
1745360	1750160	complex. And then if you get those two, you know, lighting will be easy and all this stuff.
1750160	1756240	But like in this image, for example, all the geometry probably has very little shading
1756240	1762560	information. It's not really even that complex. The the most detailed thing in the scene is is
1762560	1769440	lights like all these glowing bits in the windows, the lamps, he's got a variety of colors, small,
1769440	1774880	big, you know, you name it, there's there's a ton of lighting sources of light sources in this scene.
1774880	1781280	And so as the backdrop, like that really details the scene, it feels like a night scape of a city,
1781280	1787760	it feels it just it achieves that threshold, in my opinion, of of like a believable detail level.
1787760	1792240	And then on the right side, as if you weren't convinced by this, on the right side, he's got
1792240	1798080	kind of a framework building or framework structure. And there is a lot a decent amount of
1798160	1803920	detail in that geometry. But he's got a glowing red light, maybe potentially a couple different
1803920	1810800	lights, this blue one, perhaps, inside that structure. And so he gets these these volumetric
1810800	1815600	rays that are broken up a lot by that geometry. So the volumetric rays have a lot of detail.
1816480	1821040	The fact that the light is internal to the structure, it highlights some areas that like
1821040	1826080	illuminate some faces. And then there's a contrast dark shadows on the other side. So there's just
1826080	1830800	a lot happening in the image because of the way he sets up the lights and the geometry.
1830800	1835840	And there's not really much texture or shader work that needs to be done as far as the structures.
1835840	1841840	But again, you know, he's always diligent to put a highly detailed texture on the ground plane.
1842400	1849120	And, and yeah, all all this to illustrate just the quality of detail that entrance fee into,
1849120	1853760	I believe this as a 3d artist, especially, like you've sold me on the detail. And
1854720	1856800	let's see another question
1859680	1866160	from Wilco Wilbrink. Do you think he reuses older models to speed up his every days? I do,
1866160	1871600	I think for sure. If he's been doing, if he's been doing these for 4000 4000 days, like,
1873520	1878480	you know, character models, for example, like, why would you need to build a character from scratch,
1878560	1883920	like just save him and reuse him and make composable, like store that. And then you see
1883920	1888400	that evidence of that when he has characters involved in his artwork. But I think like,
1888400	1894000	I mean, think about he does cityscapes. So like types of buildings, fire escapes, lamp posts,
1894000	1899040	like why in the world would you do that multiple times? He's probably got a massive library of
1899040	1904480	models that he's either built, potentially he's bought. There's enough evidence in his modeling
1905200	1908800	that if he buys his models, you know, buys a bunch of models, like, I don't hold that against him,
1908800	1915120	like he's clearly a talented modeler. But yeah, at this point, like he should have a huge library
1915120	1920000	of models that he reuses. And that's something I want you to take away. Like, that's not a knock
1920000	1926880	against against him or anyone who reuses stuff. I think there is this kind of misconception that
1927760	1932400	and I can sense it. I've been there too, like, if I want, if I want to give like the proper
1932400	1936800	devotion to a character, I've always got to start from scratch, like sculpt him from a ball,
1937520	1942800	always model the ear again, always model the hand, the nose, like always model these pieces
1942800	1947200	individually. And that's just silly, right? It's not efficient. Once you've done it once,
1947200	1953200	you have the chops. Once you've done it once, twice, whatever, you have chops, and reusing
1953200	1958080	those pieces, nothing wrong with it whatsoever. It's actually very smart. It's what enables,
1958080	1964160	it's one of the things that enables him to make such complex, impressive imagery as often as he
1964160	1970880	does. So this use of repetition, duplicates, we just talked about this, they're rampant, right?
1970880	1977600	They're all through his images. But they don't break down the image he's uses and very intelligently.
1977600	1982720	And so I, for, I guess, fun, like in the presentation, can you spot the repeats, right? So this,
1982720	1987360	this little bracket piece, which I think I took from right there, clearly they're being duplicated
1987440	1993200	around this, this radial shape around the lip. But if you keep looking, they're also duplicated
1993200	2000080	inside the cylinder, all the way down. Okay, so these, these look like the exact same piece,
2000080	2005280	if I'm not mistaken. And so there's an element of duplication. But there's an art in hiding the
2005280	2011360	repetition. And I think in this particular image, these outer brackets are illuminated by a bright
2011360	2018000	white light. And so the color looks more white. And, and when you look a little closer, inside,
2018000	2024080	these are darker, and they are much darker gray. And to me, that didn't read in immediately as a,
2024080	2030800	as a repeat. But there's a slight context shift that hides it pretty well. And, and once you
2030800	2034960	study it, obviously, you break it down, you can see these things. But the point being that the
2034960	2039280	most important thing is the initial impression. And I did not, these, these repeated pieces did
2039280	2044480	not break down the image for me. And hopefully they didn't for you either. But yeah, so the art
2044480	2051600	of hiding repetition, slight alterations, applying in different contexts, so that's the lighting in
2051600	2057440	this example, repeat deflectors, that's not necessarily relevant in this particular image,
2057440	2062960	but in, in, in subsequent images, it will be in enough variety. So that's another thing I wanted
2062960	2070160	to talk about. So if you have, let's say he approached this scene with like, with four or five
2070160	2074720	different kind of pieces that he repeated around, I think that that you can get away with four or
2074720	2079760	five individual pieces that you duplicate. So we have the brackets, we've got just a generic cylinder
2079760	2085840	shape, we've got these kind of scaffolding this, this radial scaffolding all the way around the edge,
2085840	2091040	we have these little, I don't know, rivets or small holes, like, these are various pieces that
2091120	2095360	he's duplicating around, including the secondary part of the bracket, like this piece that attaches
2095360	2101520	to the outer hull. That is a unique piece that I don't necessarily see duplicated. But when you
2101520	2107360	have enough variety, it hides the repetition pretty well. If he only had two pieces and he
2107360	2111840	duplicated everything around those two pieces all the way around, that would probably be much more
2111840	2116880	noticeable. But he doesn't do that. He does it very intelligently. He has enough variety. And
2117760	2126400	let's see the next one. I love this image. But obviously, it doesn't take you long to realize
2126400	2131760	that this is a duplicate piece of geometry, like the array modifier that's just extruded,
2131760	2137600	that it's duplicated all the way down the hallway, and then twisted, right? So the twist
2138240	2142960	adds some visual interest. It breaks up the monotony of the repetition. That's kind of that
2143680	2150000	slight alteration idea. Also, these repeat deflectors. I think this is a really crucial
2150000	2160400	part of his repetitious workflow. And these to me are unique objects that drastically can change,
2160960	2167120	can like throw a kink in your recognition of the repetition. And the lights in here in particular
2167120	2172480	are doing that for this scene. He's got just two lights off kilter from each other, right?
2172560	2178400	They're offset. And so what that serves to do, they're facing towards us, and all the repeats
2178400	2185120	going backward can fade into black, basically, right? So like, those are unique. That's a unique
2185120	2191200	context going back behind the lights. And now going forward, all of these duplicates are illuminated
2191200	2196640	in slightly unique ways. Number one, because the whole corridor is twisted. And number two,
2196640	2203280	the lights are offset from each other. And so one light is illuminating certain aspects of the
2203280	2209280	left side. And then the upper light is illuminating certain aspects of the other. And that creates
2209280	2215200	enough difference, enough variety, even using the exact same geometry. And if we break it down,
2215200	2221200	just how exact the geometry is, you know, he's duplicating, he's mirroring from top to bottom,
2221200	2226160	right? So starting about here, and over to the middle, like this cross section,
2226160	2231600	this little L shape, he's mirroring it vertically and horizontally. So he's done,
2231600	2236800	even though it looks super complex, he's not done that much modeling. And it starts to make
2236800	2242000	sense like how he was able to do this in a couple hours. And then the repeat the repeat deflector
2242000	2247520	idea, it's not hard to throw a lamp in there, right? Like that's much easier to throw a lamp,
2247520	2253440	offset them, and then you get a variety of reflective quality. It's much easier to do that
2253440	2261360	than try and model more. And and so in that way, I find that repeat deflector idea really powerful
2261360	2267840	for breaking up the repetition and just making this a complex, pleasing image that you can lose
2267840	2278080	yourself to, and not check out because of the repetition. Let's see. Any other questions that
2278080	2285600	I'm missing from William is octane particularly fast, I've never used octane, I've heard it compared
2285600	2295040	to cycles pretty well. So in my general understanding, they, they do, they're very similar render
2295040	2300000	engines, that's not to say that octane is fast. I mean, think about it, like if he spends two to,
2300000	2305200	okay, maybe I should also say, I don't imagine that he's doing the render time within that two
2305200	2312480	to four hours, right? I would say that he's creating the whole 3d scene, it within two to four hours,
2312480	2318560	and then rendering overnight, right? Because he renders them fairly big, they're very clean
2318560	2324560	renders, especially when he gets into the caustic stuff, that that does not render quickly. And so
2325280	2328720	I believe that he renders overnight or whatever, and I don't count that against him,
2328720	2333520	you know, like how, by how quickly he's creating the imagery. But I mean, cycles would be able
2333520	2338240	to render this overnight, no problem. And whether octane can do it super fast, he also might have
2338240	2342640	a GPU, I think I've heard him say he has a GPU, which enables him to render faster, certainly
2342640	2349200	than me, only on CPU, for example. But I don't know, I would challenge you to fight the urge to
2349200	2357360	focus on the tools. Again, it's 2018, Blender has a good reputation of a quality software, like,
2358000	2362320	I really just don't, I don't even, I don't think people would say it's without a doubt the tools,
2362320	2366960	right? I don't think he would give the credit to that. In fact, I feel like I've heard him say that
2366960	2372480	in a, in a pre one of his presentations, but I don't think the tools are not important here,
2372480	2378240	that's not the main thing, it's more his technique, you know, like all all all render engines at this
2378240	2386320	point have nice glossy reflections and GI based lighting and volumetrics and stuff like that.
2386320	2395120	So the tools are not what's important here, it is absolutely the technique. Next. Okay, this is,
2395120	2400400	I think this is the last repetitious one. Okay, so this little capsule with the human inside of it,
2401120	2406640	to me that if you just isolate the capsule by itself, that's, I can imagine that taking like
2406640	2413120	an hour, hour and a half to create like to model the this human character he uses in multiple
2413120	2418720	images, we'll see another one where he uses the human this human like musculature anatomy model.
2419360	2423920	So he reuses that he throws that inside of it, and then duplicates the entire thing
2424720	2429440	across the scene. So we have three main duplicates. But then we also see a few in the background.
2429840	2437760	But he rotates the duplicates, right, so we so we can assume that as he models around the object,
2437760	2443440	he's, he's varying the model quality, so that when he rotates it, it could arguably be a different
2443440	2448480	capsule or something, at least unique enough so that it doesn't look like a 100% duplicate.
2449040	2453040	You can see that the lighting is a little different on the bottom side here, compared
2453040	2458240	to over here, that implies that he it's different, you know, based on where in the circle, like the
2458240	2464880	details at. That's an effective way to duplicate, rotate and get more, more bang for your buck.
2466000	2471040	And surprisingly, the more I studied this, I was like, Oh, wait, he didn't even change the pose of
2471040	2476720	the character, like they're all in the exact same pose. Whereas he's clearly has that guy rigged,
2476720	2480800	I would have assumed he like moved the characters arms a little bit made him a little unique.
2480800	2485280	But I don't think he did. So maybe he's just running out of time. It didn't even affect me,
2485280	2491440	I had to study the image to realize that. So in that way, like he's succeeding in hiding the
2491440	2495840	repetition, the difference in lighting, right? So you can break up repetition that way, he's
2495840	2502080	got a strong key light from the left side, we can see from the blue glow. And then a more subtle
2502080	2507840	light on the right side down here, another different color blue. But but but then he has
2507840	2513200	probably just a plane on the top and bottom that serves it with this texture to break it up. And
2513200	2518560	when you break it down, like I hope you're getting that it is it's doable, right? It is doable in
2518560	2527040	that amount of time. He's only human. So he's just very, very good at at 3d production, very good,
2527040	2533360	very talented at that. But he's not able to do what would take someone 10 hours in two,
2534080	2540000	you know, just just like doing the exact same workflow. He's just working super cleverly.
2540080	2544720	And in a way that hopefully motivates you inspires you to to adopt some of these techniques.
2546880	2551440	Question, when do you when you zoom in, you see grain, do you think it's because of the
2551440	2556240	insufficient amount of samples? Or is it a deliberate use of grain? That's a good question
2556240	2562080	that I've wondered myself because there is often grain. And and we'll see a little bit later that
2562080	2568240	he also does photography. And if I recall, there's generally grain in the photography too. So there's
2568240	2574960	a stylistic reason for grain. But also we know as 3d artists, there is a practical reason for
2574960	2581520	grain, not having enough samples. And in this case, we see grain, particularly in the volumetrics.
2581520	2588320	So maybe that had some grain. But like, it's also it's very clear in the the ground and the ceiling.
2589360	2596960	So like, it could serve as like, what am I trying to say, dust particles in the in the volumetrics.
2596960	2602400	So I think it's probably a mixture of both. It's probably some render sample limitations.
2602400	2607920	And as well as a stylistic thing, because you do see grain a lot in his images. And
2609600	2613440	and they don't ruin it. You know, it's another way that they don't taint the image, I don't look at
2613440	2616880	it and be like, ooh, you should have added more samples. No, it's not that way at all.
2617600	2624960	I think Omar, I think you're, I think you're poking fun at me.
2627680	2631600	But we'll see any other questions I'm missing.
2633840	2640400	Okay, so from Khalil, it's great images, but it seems he copied ideas from science fiction movies.
2640400	2645040	There's absolutely a science fiction theme running. But keep in mind, we've looked at like
2645040	2652080	four or five images out of 4000, you're going to see a lot more coming up. He's he's he is not guilty of
2652880	2657840	of staying in his box. He he does a lot of things. So just just hold on a second,
2657840	2662560	you'll see a lot more. Not to say that he absolutely probably is inspired by science fiction movies,
2662560	2669840	but he's also inspired by 70s era stuff, 80s, 90s kind of things. Just just hold on a second.
2669840	2675600	I like renders where I like renders that are photorealistic, except without noise or lens
2675600	2684080	imperfections. Okay, so then you might not like that about people like he he utilizes lens imperfections
2684080	2691440	and lens flares and obviously noise. I like that stuff. I think it does come down to a
2691440	2697040	preference. I like seeing that in photographs that I take, I like seeing that in my renders.
2697040	2703360	I just think it it's a subjective thing. But I think clean renders are often boring, personally,
2703360	2708240	but this just comes to a personal thing. But I like the way people handle it. But I understand
2708240	2716160	people not liking it. Alright, so that's it for repetition. Now the mastery of shading and lighting
2716160	2723600	and treatment. The benefits of this is that you can require you can get more out of your models
2723600	2731840	than you might think, right? There's less pressure on the models to be to carry the mantle of detail
2731840	2737680	or carry the mantle of visual impressiveness. And in this artwork, in my opinion, is a great example
2739680	2745760	of if you really look at it, the model is probably three or four different types of like
2745840	2753840	cathedral tower shapes that is duplicated around and around to create this this castle, you know,
2753840	2758320	like there's a I forget the name of it, there's a famous place I think in Europe that that has a
2758320	2763200	castle like like structure on a rock and the tide comes up and then you can't get to it and the tide
2763200	2767200	goes down and you can walk to it. Anyway, I forgot what it's called. If anyone knows, let me know.
2767200	2774400	But anyway, like he's created whoops, he's created this shape by probably duplicating from what I
2774400	2779680	can see, like if you look, there are duplicates, that's that's a duplicate of this one. This cathedral
2779680	2786480	shape is let's see if we can find another duplicate of that. Man, like yeah, I think he's just
2786480	2791920	duplicate them smaller in here. Here's another okay, yeah, you see the the spire with the round ball,
2791920	2797440	here's a spire with the round ball. Anyway, they are just repeats, but they don't even have that
2797440	2802240	much texture information, if any at all, it looks like a gray model, if you really look closely at
2802240	2806880	it. And then he duplicated that entire castle structure threw it in the background, rotated it
2806880	2813200	so that we have, you know, this lone spire or lone tower on the opposite side as it is over here.
2813200	2818560	So he's got a lot of geometric information quickly. And then how he breaks it up and makes it makes
2818560	2823360	it appealing to look at is the the shading and lighting treatment. So look at the the water
2823360	2828720	ripples, right? This is something he uses a lot. Add a plane with some water ripples and some reflection
2828720	2833520	and you get a ton of visual interest on the bottom side of your image, right? And that's all it is,
2833520	2840320	it's super simple. The terrain looks like maybe some texture that he he probably reuses that he
2840320	2847120	does a lot of terrain. But there's little to no texture information on there. Within the castle
2847120	2852000	structure, there's a lot of lights placed that are illuminating both from below, like you can see
2852000	2856640	it illuminating up the side of the of the buildings. And the variety in the lighting
2857600	2862800	makes that model much more than it probably is, you know, there's, you're getting a lot
2862800	2869680	more out of those models. So so yeah, things to look at in this vein are like the fog, he uses
2869680	2877200	that a lot atmospheric fog that creates a depth to the image. And then these other ones don't really,
2877200	2882480	well reflections in general, in addition to just being water ripples, you'll see him use reflections
2882480	2890080	a lot, just to multiply the level of detail. And let's see, let's go to the next one.
2892080	2896560	Question from Omar, do you think that people style is an example of composition triumphs
2896560	2904960	overall? You know, I, I was trying to think of how to address that specifically, the whole
2904960	2909760	compositional aspect. So he we know he does photography, well, we can see that on his website.
2909760	2914640	So he's got compositional understanding through photography. And in the every days he's talked
2914640	2920480	about like his his goal with them is to improve as an artist and to learn new things and literally
2920480	2927280	practice making perfect and shown to the world for everyone to see. And so he's said that he wants
2927280	2932720	to work on like certain years, you know, he'll want to improve specific aspects of his workflow.
2932720	2939040	And I know composition is, I'm just not as composition to me is still more of an ethereal
2939120	2946400	concept. So I don't, I know enough to, to know when I enjoy a composition, I don't know enough to
2946400	2951920	like break it down specifically. So that said, I do think given how long people has been working on
2951920	2960720	this, working on his skills, he is a compositional, a compositional, a significant compositional
2960720	2966080	artist, and you can look to him for inspiration and for valid approaches to composition. I just
2966080	2969280	don't know how to break it down. And that's a little on me. I'm trying to learn more about
2969280	2981600	composition, but it's not my strong suit. Let's see. Hello, Jeff, don't be afraid to use Photoshop.
2981600	2987680	Yeah, amen. Amen to that. And the treatment aspect, super important and super, super useful.
2988640	2995040	Okay, so yeah, we have from from Thibault Burton, great composition to basic shapes,
2995040	2999840	triangles, mostly rules of third. Yeah. So you might probably know more about composition than me.
3002160	3007360	Could you study Ray Renante Martinez? Yeah. That's another thing I want to maybe suggest
3007360	3012720	at the end. If anyone else has suggestions for artists to study in later streams. Yeah,
3012800	3018640	I'm open to those suggestions. How did he do the rainbow flair? I think Oh, right here is what I
3018640	3023040	think you're talking about. Well, if it were me, I don't know exactly how he did it. But if it were
3023040	3030720	me, you can you can Google search lens flares, right? Well, let's let's do better than Google search.
3030720	3039920	Let's create search dot creative commons dot org. So this is where I like to find, especially
3039920	3048480	flicker I find has gives the most results. But let's look up lens flare. And since these are CC
3048480	3055920	copyright, I'm sorry, I'm creative commons, like you can use this for for basically anything. But
3055920	3062800	usually you'll find lens flares taken with a black background. Let me let me change the
3062800	3068080	wording maybe it's going to be hard to extract it out of here. But like so if you could extract it,
3068080	3074320	let's say that's where your rainbow flair is coming from. I've done this a lot. So I forget
3074320	3087440	where what what search terms I use specifically, let me try a different one. Well, this example
3087440	3095440	kind of failed. But that's weird. I've done this many times where yeah, I'm not sure why I'm not
3095440	3101280	finding them. Maybe I had to search somewhere else. Let's try one more. And then we'll get off of this.
3103520	3106640	No, it's yeah, it's not it picks a day. Yeah, that's it.
3109200	3110320	Let's just try flair.
3114800	3116400	Oh, lens flare alpha, that's a good one.
3116400	3122960	Or internet's kind of struggling.
3125680	3132400	Well, I'm sorry I did not I'm gonna I'm gonna go on but unfortunately. Okay, there we go.
3136720	3141680	Ah, man, I'm coming up. Okay, here's an example. This is not specifically the rainbow color that
3141680	3149040	you're talking about. But this is an is an image that can be added with the ad operation over top
3149040	3154160	of an image over top of your render. And you've got, you know, the lens effects and you can dial
3154160	3159040	in how much you want. This is another one. It's maybe not super high quality. But here's another
3159040	3163520	kind of poor quality one. This is how you go about it. It is how I would go about it in the
3163520	3168800	case of people. And he uses them pretty subtly. But I think it's just an image that he pastes over
3168880	3173920	top of this image, right, and does it as an addition kind of thing. It doesn't need to be
3173920	3180160	super complex, you know, like he's not getting actual lens flares in the render camera. But yeah,
3180160	3186320	that's kind of how he does it. I'm certain. I'm fairly certain. Does people have any image that
3186320	3190480	took him a week to make if they're only days work? Imagine if he puts more time? Well, yeah,
3190480	3194240	that's a good point because he does professional work too. Obviously, he's doing work for
3194800	3200240	like, you know, Katy Perry's concert visuals. So he's probably not doing that in a day. He's
3200240	3204720	probably spending weeks on that stuff. And the short film I showed you, I imagine that took a
3204720	3211360	while, not just a day. But yeah, we're even though we're just studying on the on the every
3211360	3216320	day is like that's kind of what I want you to get out of it that what is possible in an every day
3216320	3226480	scenario. Just type JJ Abrams, that's pretty funny. Yeah, good call. Okay, cool. All right,
3226480	3233040	so we're back on the the mastery of shading, lighting and treatment. Back to this image. Okay,
3233040	3238720	yeah, so the geometry in this image registers to me as nothing to write home about. It's not
3239520	3244800	super detailed. It's all very harsh edged, right? It doesn't look like anything is is modeled for
3244800	3250000	smooth like like a subdivision surface modifier. But there's enough detail to register as buildings
3250000	3257440	and it also helps that most of the buildings were looking at at almost parallel angles. So it kind of,
3258000	3262880	you know, if the buildings were like this, you can see the detail more bluntly. But if you if you
3262880	3268160	rotate like this, the detail kind of compounds on top of each other, all that to say it's making
3268160	3273600	it look more complex than maybe I think it is. And then on top of that, look at the amount of
3273600	3277840	light sources that are in the scene. We've got something pink coming from somewhere. I don't
3277840	3283280	really know, maybe maybe there's a sign, you know, the logic is a sign above this this the screen,
3284080	3289280	the frame, that's like casting this pink light. We've got light coming from inside a window,
3289280	3295040	that makes that makes sense. We've got another pink light on the back, back wall, which is very
3295040	3299920	simple. So it kind of illustrates like how simple the geometry is, a green light somewhere in there,
3299920	3307120	purple light. So all of these different lights make for a much more interesting unique image. And
3307120	3312720	that is him, I would guess like playing with light and just showcasing like how powerful it is,
3312720	3317200	and how when you don't have to spend so much time on the model, it's going to be easier to let the
3317200	3324160	light do a lot of this visually interesting work. Again, like always, there's a grunge texture,
3324160	3328240	there's some sort of high resolution texture on the ground that breaks stuff up. You know,
3328240	3333040	he's got a rock model that he just threw in there, duplicated it rotated around probably scaled.
3333040	3337280	Maybe you did that procedurally, like we could do that with particles and just stick it to a surface.
3338480	3344560	And let's see anything else in here. There's not really volume metrics, he typically does have
3344560	3350400	like a glow around his light sources. And that really does help to sell this super bright
3350400	3356800	impression of the lights. And I imagine that that is a post process, it's part of the treatment
3356800	3362400	that he adds that. Let's go on to the next one. This one to me is just a straight up
3363280	3368800	architectural visualization image, where all the geometry is very, very simple,
3369520	3374880	you know, primitive, very simple. There's a even a simple texture, a tileable, you know,
3374880	3381280	wood like texture, maybe a concrete sort of texture, but very, very short work he's made of
3381280	3386160	the modeling and of the texture work. But it's the lighting and it's the quality of the global
3386160	3392960	illumination that illuminates this entire space. That makes things interesting, right? So he doesn't
3392960	3399040	just leave the corner of the room here as a big square, he like throws in some angled structural
3399040	3403120	bits, right? And all of a sudden we've got interesting shadows happening. And how simple
3403120	3409920	is it just to duplicate these pieces around. And then the balls of glass, the glass orbs,
3409920	3414640	like there, that's one of an abstract element that's just there to, I think add visual interest,
3414640	3420240	I don't know, there might be a meaning behind it. But what that is cool for is it takes everything
3420240	3426080	behind it and distorts it in a unique way, and then displays it to you on the other side.
3426080	3431520	And so that adds visual interest, adds levels of detail. And because of the shading and lighting,
3431520	3438640	especially this image just shines metaphorically and literally. So this is a really cool image,
3438640	3443440	I think it's photo real, in my opinion. So whoever was asking it, like doing photo real images
3443440	3452080	quickly as well. And let's see, so this is the last one I believe on material and lighting.
3453600	3459600	What my face is drawn to my face, my eyes are drawn to being a 3d artist is the quality of
3459600	3467840	the reflections on the floor. I love a good grunge breakup of reflections, it just makes
3467840	3473840	all the colors dance and vary themselves in really unique ways. It's very tangible, right?
3473840	3479120	Like I can feel in my with my fingertips, like what the grime is like on the ground. I don't
3479120	3484480	know, I just love the quality of that texture. And it's quite simple to add. You know, you can find
3484480	3488960	grunge and grime textures on the internet very simply. Now that's pretty much all it is. It's
3488960	3495040	just a plane and he's he's he's procedurally adding, I assume procedurally like these the
3495040	3499040	wireframe on the on the ground plane, like we know how we can do that with the wire modifier.
3500480	3505200	And so if you think about it, the only complex thing in the image is happening
3505200	3510880	right here in the middle. So he's got some sort of fracture modifier that that blender, you know,
3510880	3516320	the blender's equivalent sort of thing that has broken the big simple sphere and like makes all
3516320	3521200	these shards of geometry that he's also scattered on the ground a little bit. And I think he's probably
3521200	3527680	added a material like we can see evidence here of various colors just glowing, emitting off of
3527680	3534800	the various shards. And that creates this very rainbowy, like prism type appearance. And that's
3534800	3539680	where all the details happening and he and he gets extra mileage by the reflection on the ground.
3540640	3545520	You know, like reflection, the idea of mirroring the detail that's already in the scene. And so
3545520	3550480	tons of visual candy happening right in the middle of the image. But then if you think about it and
3550480	3556480	look outside, the ground plane, very simple, it's not hard to do this wireframe business, you know,
3557040	3561200	it's not time consuming rather. And then a very simple terrain in the background.
3562080	3569280	The majority of this sphere is just a simple sphere, a sky texture. And all of that, I think,
3569280	3576240	makes you focus into the image into the center of the image with these two people. And, and just in
3576320	3582720	the compositional sense, like draws you into where most things are happening. But it also makes it,
3582720	3586960	when you realize how simple the rest of the scene is, it kind of makes sense how it's achievable
3586960	3593920	within a few hours. So anyway, I really want to showcase and point to the fact that he is a master
3593920	3599840	of these technical skills, shading, lighting, treatment. He's a very good modeler too. He's
3599840	3607200	doing simulation, breaking, you know, fracturing this object. He is not, he is not shirking any
3607200	3612320	technical skills in order to create this imagery. He's just, he's a master at it. And therefore,
3612320	3618960	he knows how to, how to milk everything that the skills can give you. And he, he milks it and he
3618960	3625040	gets the most out of it. And in a short amount of time too. So really, really powerful use of,
3625360	3628880	of shading, lighting and treatment. See if I'm missing any questions.
3630800	3636960	Here we go. Could we make something at CG Cookie to spend a week doing a Beeple challenge?
3636960	3642160	L a Beeple contest, that would be awesome. That'd be fun. I, I, if I'm, if I'm honest, I would love
3642160	3646800	to see some more abstract things being posted to the gallery. Not that there aren't examples. There's
3646800	3651280	some really good examples of that already from an artist that I'm blanking on the name, but who
3651280	3656960	does it in Blender. But yeah, that'd be cool to see more of this for sure. A contest specifically,
3656960	3662240	you know, we've, that, that word always gets thrown around with us. And we do have a contest
3662240	3667280	format on our website. But the big problem is just trying to get somebody to run it. Like we've
3667280	3673520	got so many, so many balls that we're juggling right now that contest is just not able to fit
3674320	3678320	in our, in our priority list. But that would be sweet to do a Beeple challenge. Maybe we can start
3678320	3684080	a thread in the forum and just, you know, do it casually or something. Let me see if I'm missing
3684080	3691440	any other questions. Question, do you think it's basic emission on those poles or something more
3691440	3696240	complex shading? I think you're talking about this image here. You know, I'll bet I would
3696240	3702240	bet it's either a cylinder or a plane. The reason, actually, I'll bet it's a cylinder because a cylinder
3702240	3706400	will still render when it's glowing like that. It'll, I think he, let me, let me back up and
3706400	3711600	calm down. I think it's a cylinder for practical reasons because a cylinder will emit light in
3711600	3720320	all directions, you know, in a vertically all directions horizontally. But when you, when you
3720320	3725920	render it, it looks just like planes, right? And I would guess that that's the appearance he wanted,
3725920	3731920	just these simplistic 2d planes. But for practical reasons, like, you know, if you think of adding
3731920	3738640	an area light, just a plane, there's a harsh line that happens where the backside and the front side
3738640	3742480	illuminate, but right on the edge, it doesn't illuminate. So that's what makes me think he's
3742480	3750080	probably doing a cylinder. That would just make the most sense to me. All right. So yeah, mastery
3750080	3757200	of shading and lighting and treatment. The abstract elements, I love this part. This is,
3757840	3765440	this is a very mesmerizing part of his artistry, in my opinion. And why it's so unique to me and
3765440	3772960	new to me is my history is kind of in realism, especially like make it match reality, be a
3772960	3779120	little creative in that, but mostly limit yourself to what is possible in reality. Whereas like this,
3779840	3785360	this image right here, I love the idea of like ignore reason and just make something glow. That's
3785360	3794160	kind of how I summarize it when I look from a like a practical like recreative part of it myself,
3794160	3799600	like as artists myself, like just make stuff glow, right? So we have these bars just seemingly
3800560	3806000	randomly like intersecting our character. But if we break it down before we get to those bars,
3806000	3810800	those glowing bars, like we have that character that we've already seen before, he's kind of kneeling,
3810800	3817360	he has high resolution textures, sure. But you know, as a character, he's probably not the most
3817360	3822560	impressive character example that we've ever seen. You know, we can imagine creating it's a body with
3822560	3831360	with a muscular anatomical texture on top of it. But my guess is he also knows that. And so he lights
3831360	3836960	it very interestingly. He leaves more to the imagination. He's not he's not got a key light
3836960	3842640	above and then a a world environment that's just lighting up the entire texture, there's,
3842640	3848160	there's a contrast from between the light and shadow that's that's hides enough of the character.
3849360	3853040	I guess that's my roundabout way of saying that the character is not the most interesting part
3853040	3859280	of the image. And, and so you have the character, he's kind of kneeling, there's a reflective surface,
3859280	3864160	there's a light above. But then all of a sudden you throw those bars in. And this thing becomes
3864160	3868800	something very interesting very quickly. The reflections all of a sudden have these beautiful
3868800	3875040	gradients to deal with. The glows that he added in treatment, like there's it's like it goes from
3875040	3880880	purple to a greenish to a red to back to purple, like it seems like there's always a gradient
3880880	3886560	thing that should have been another bullet point is his use of gradients is so widespread. That's
3886560	3891920	a very important thing to consider. Even his glowy bits like right here, like there's a gradient,
3891920	3898000	there's a variety in color among them. And anyway, to me, this is this, I love this image because
3898000	3903840	it just represents like, throw something glowy in there. The fact that primitive shapes can be
3903840	3911520	fascinating, right? So we have these randomly random prisms, not prisms, pyramids, right there,
3911520	3916880	just laying on the ground. You know, let's give it some meaning, let's say that it is, it mimics
3916880	3921760	this character's like, like shape as he's kneeling and like, you know, holding his temple and stuff.
3922960	3927200	It does kind of mimic that shape. So maybe there's some meaning there. But also, it just serves to
3927200	3931120	make the image a little more interesting. It gives something to break up the reflection.
3932160	3936160	And to give some play off of off of these bars even more. So
3938240	3942080	and this is another example where less can be more, in my opinion, like there's not that much
3942080	3950320	happening in the scene. And but still, we get a lot of visual interesting things to to feast our
3950320	3955520	eyes upon. And so I think this primitive this abstract element just throwing the rays in there,
3955520	3960480	it makes us think like, like, when it's abstract, we've never seen this before. It's like, oh,
3960480	3964720	that's different. Like, I'm intrigued already, like, look at it, it's just like intersecting
3964720	3971280	is his thighs and stuff, it just makes you think way more than, I guess, I think it can make you
3971280	3976400	think way more than non abstract things, just realism and stuff like that. So let's look at
3976400	3982320	some more he uses this technique a lot. Well, in general, this whole image is kind of abstract.
3982320	3987600	And and just think of if we break it down how it can be created, you've got a cylindrical structure
3987600	3994960	that's creating this whole. And then procedurally, you can create a texture that that does these
3994960	4003760	jut out spike like things. And so you can generate those spikes procedurally, geometrically, but you
4003760	4011920	can also create the the rings, right, and various intensities going down the length of the cylinder.
4011920	4018080	And so, like, that would be very easy to create if you if you are aware of like, well, in blender's
4018080	4022880	context, like what you can do procedurally, how to enable, you know, displacement and stuff like
4022880	4028880	that. And so that's really not that difficult. It's very interesting to look at, especially I like
4028880	4036080	how his his his his rings tend to glow a little more at the ends of the rings. So it has this like
4036080	4044160	five, what do you call it, fiberglass? Is that what it is? No, optical crap, like fios fiber optics,
4044160	4051120	there we go, like that kind of appearance to it. And then the coolest thing about the image to me
4051120	4056640	is how he throws in these fears. Are they are they clear and refractive? I don't know. Or are
4056640	4061520	they just like chrome spheres? My guess would be chrome, because that would be easier to render.
4061520	4066560	But he populates them, he scatters them throughout the image, he off centers the composition of the
4066560	4072800	tube. So it's in the, you know, bottom right corner, bottom right third. And, and it's just
4072800	4077120	interesting to look at, right, like this could, I think to me, this is one of the ones that clicked
4077120	4082160	with me. After I broke it down, like, yeah, this can absolutely be done in that amount of time.
4082160	4088880	And yay, yay for us, like we can learn from him. And he's so learned from his, his workflow. So
4090240	4096960	that's another example of abstract element. This one to me is another example of just throwing
4096960	4102400	something in the scene that glows. The whole surrounding scene is actually quite detailed,
4102400	4107920	the rock quality, both geometrically shading texture wise, like all of it beautiful.
4109120	4116080	I would guess that he did not, he did not sculpt this or create or model it within the time frame.
4116080	4122560	It's probably part of his library, just given how detailed it is. And so you throw that in there,
4122560	4130480	you create the landscape, throw your people, you pose them. And, and what I find myself doing once
4130480	4136400	he throws, once he puts that column of light down the center is like, I find myself being drawn
4136400	4141040	into the image the way that the people are drawn to that same column in the image, right? They're
4141040	4147280	just, they look like zombies being herded into this bizarre column of light. And I find myself
4147280	4153040	doing that as well. And, and I just would never think of doing that in my own workflow up until
4153040	4157040	seeing people's work. Like I, I don't know, it would be much more boring if it was just,
4157680	4162240	if there's nothing to look at that column of light wasn't so, you know, moth to the flame
4162240	4167440	sort of thing. So I don't know, it's really challenged me to realize, throw like, just experiment,
4167440	4173440	like, get some practice throwing shapes into your scene, making them glow, because the glowing is
4173440	4181440	important because it adds shadows to the scene, it adds reflections to the scene. Generally,
4181600	4186560	very high contrast things, high potential for high contrast, visual interest.
4187840	4192400	Very powerful thing. I actually really want to start just playing with this create a scene,
4192400	4198000	throw some shapes in there. And, and I mean, I can't remember the name of this particular image,
4198000	4202320	but there was a purpose like the column of light represented something. So there was a meaning to
4202320	4210400	the column of light. It's not quite as simple as just throw shapes in there. But anyway, the next
4210400	4217120	one. So this one's pretty cool, in my opinion, because it's extreme simplicity, right? Like,
4217120	4221040	you have the character that at this point we've seen enough characters. Sorry, I've probably
4221040	4226880	been missing some questions. I'm going to get to those after this. But the simplicity of this image,
4227920	4232080	the only complexity is the character. Now, did he spend the whole two hours doing the character?
4232080	4236640	I don't know, I would guess not. He probably has that library. He threw him in there posed it. So
4236640	4240880	it looks like he's being like abducted by an alien kind of thing. The geometry around it,
4240880	4247200	super simple, not even reflections involved. But then you have this rainbow light around
4248000	4253520	surrounding the character. And I mean, you know, it certainly did not take him that long. I mean,
4253520	4258640	now that we've spent so much time in his artwork, we can we're starting to break it down as to how
4258640	4265920	this is achievable, given a mastery of these skills. But, but what's cool about this is if
4265920	4276000	we look up if we just type in Imagine Dragons, like, it became apparently their album cover or
4276000	4282000	they saw that image because it is part of his everyday's. And they decided they assume they
4282000	4287680	asked him and hopefully paid him to use that as part of their their imagery like their their album
4287680	4293120	art. How cool is that, you know, just a couple hours and a powerful image later, you know,
4293120	4298080	you've got connections like that, you've got success of that caliber. And yeah, this is an
4298080	4303760	example of how less can be more. You know, maybe I wouldn't look at this image and think how detailed
4303760	4310320	is that, except for the character, the character does have enough geometric detail that that reads
4310320	4317760	registers to me as a detailed character. But everything else is just very intentionally simple.
4318240	4324000	And yeah, I think that's all for the abstract. Maybe there's one more. But okay, yeah, so the
4324000	4328640	procedural generation idea, like, when you look at this image, hopefully, if you've got experience
4328640	4335840	with Blender, you know that this can be created fairly simply with with modifiers in Blender,
4335840	4342000	and, you know, wire modifiers from an icosphere. And, yeah, I don't know, I don't want to break
4342000	4346720	it down and get too nerdy. But like this kind of shape, we've all probably been there, where we
4347440	4351600	play around with the modifiers and see what we can get. And even that, you know, I've never
4351600	4356320	thought of it as like a something to showcase. But like, he was probably playing with that stuff,
4356320	4361760	too, learning it himself, and realized he could turn into a pretty beautiful image, you know,
4361760	4366320	like I can absolutely imagine this being hung in someone's home, you know, like that's kind of
4366320	4370800	how I see all of his images, like these could be printed and hung in someone's home.
4371680	4377760	That it's that level of artistry and quality visual. But I love how this has just a single
4377760	4383440	light source, seemingly like in the upper right corner, very stark shadows, huge gradient across
4383440	4389280	the entire image. Just, you know, using the mastery of his lighting abilities, it's all of
4389280	4396560	it together creates these things. All right, so finally, the last real category that I'm looking
4396640	4402640	at with him is unique styles. And so we've talked a little bit about, okay, before I get into that,
4402640	4408240	let me let me answer some questions. I've kind of neglected the chat. Let's see here.
4414320	4418800	Question, do you think that it would be would add a nice little punch to his renders if he
4418800	4423440	sub deed the stuff after apologizing versus bullying and everything? I may be wrong, but
4423440	4429440	there's a lot of sharp edges that don't reflect light. Yes. I am. So obviously, when you do
4429440	4434640	subdivision surface, things get a lot harder. Things take a lot more time consuming because you
4434640	4441920	have to, in a general sense, you have to be more mindful about your topology. But I would guess
4442640	4451600	and okay, so let me go back. Let me go back for a second and show you it was the repetition, I
4451600	4461760	believe. Let's go. Okay, this one. So this he maybe he used the bevel modifier, or maybe he
4461760	4467360	modeled with subdivision surface. But like these this image, particularly all these models do have
4467360	4473600	like edge, edge illumination, like reflectivity. So it looks like they've been beveled at least.
4473600	4478080	And in this image, like it registers that way, it seems like maybe modeling is what he was focusing
4478080	4484240	on primarily. So it's not that he doesn't do it, but he chooses not to. And sharp edges, I think,
4484240	4490400	given how how often he's making images, he's probably decided that he likes it. It's not an
4490400	4497120	oversight, but he likes the sharper edges. We are obviously seen here that he doesn't. He can do it.
4498480	4501840	What am I trying to say? He can do beveled edges in that appearance. But
4501840	4511040	I don't know, I'm also a very big fan of his if you can't tell. So I don't think he makes mistakes or
4511040	4516640	oversights, you know, at this point in his in his mastery of these skills, I think everything's
4516640	4522480	pretty intentional. That would be that's what I at least air on the side of. All right, so let me go
4522480	4528960	back to the questions. Oh, but you did say like it adds a nice little punch and I would agree, like
4528960	4534000	I'm a model or primarily like that's that's what I do most of the time. And I like to see the bevels
4534000	4539760	sharp edges can sometimes, you know, ruin that for me. But and so I agree it could, especially in
4539760	4545360	that image we just looked at it does add a nice little punch. Can the same techniques be applied
4545360	4552720	to non abstract art? Yes, I think so. Like this, this is an example, William, of his realism,
4552720	4559680	he's able to achieve photo realism. This, this reminds me of even a little bit that the poster
4559680	4565360	ready player one, which this image was around a pretty certain long before that poster came out.
4565360	4570000	But so maybe this was inspiration for the poster. But this to me, there's no abstract,
4570000	4575680	there's very little abstract, if any abstract nature to this, it's pure photo realism. But we
4575680	4582400	see his his ability to use repetition, to use the power of light sources, and quality shading,
4582400	4586800	you know, the volumetrics up at the top, just makes it feel like a hazy kind of back
4588160	4591920	alleyway feel to this. So yeah, these techniques could totally be used for
4593360	4598880	non abstract things. And, and yeah, so this, this last category is going to showcase like,
4599440	4604000	just a piece of the, the different styles he's able to achieve outside of abstract. But
4604720	4612720	so first we have realism. And then next, we've got this looks straight out of like 2001, a space
4612720	4619760	odyssey back to ever, you know, mentioned that he, he seems to be inspired by, by sci fi, you know,
4619760	4625600	aesthetic. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, but, but the way he treats this image, the treatment
4625600	4631760	and the glow of the lights and the, for some reason, the very or the rich saturated orange red of
4631760	4638000	these, these lines, you know, whatever they are, that's one of those abstract elements, these sinews
4638000	4643600	kind of running down, down the rays running down this, this tube, something about that feels very
4643600	4651040	70s to me and the grain in the image as well. So he achieves that, that distinguished aesthetic.
4651040	4657680	He also has this image, which, you know, to me looks like an 80s album cover, right, like,
4657680	4663760	there's very little shading information. It's almost like it's very graphical, basically, and
4663760	4670080	not a lot of shading, lighting, any of that stuff, but it looks more of an exercise in procedural
4670720	4676400	generation of geometry. But his use of color here is very intentional and very artistic. He's also
4676400	4681280	mentioned that he's been trying to learn color, like along the way and improve his color skills.
4682560	4686800	And this to me is a great example of it, but it's different, right? Like who would have thought
4686880	4691760	these two artists were the same, you know, or the same artist between these three images.
4691760	4697760	So he's really pushing at his box. He's breaking his conventions, breaking what he maybe is comfortable
4697760	4702400	with. I know I would not be comfortable if someone told me, hey, can you create this image? I have
4702400	4706000	to really think about it compared to if someone said, hey, can you create this image? I'd be like,
4706000	4714000	okay, I know how I'd go about it. And so he's got this 80s album cover style. And this is one of
4714000	4718960	my favorites, 90s trapper keeper graphical. And if you don't know what I mean by trapper keeper,
4718960	4724080	let's look that up real quick. These were all the rage when I was in like elementary school.
4724080	4729360	Well, apparently they're still around as a brand. But what I always think of is this kind of stuff.
4730160	4736400	Right. So like these primitive 3d renders with with bright neon colored lights and
4737600	4742720	you just funny shapes. This is another example of it's like they just realized how to render
4742720	4746880	3d stuff and they were they're trying to do it. Although that might be a painting, actually.
4746880	4750400	Yeah, it's probably not a 3d render. But so this kind of style, this aesthetic,
4750400	4753440	I think he achieves here. And he does it several times. Like,
4754640	4759600	this is a theme that he kind of revisits his style, very unique. And it's not it's not
4759600	4764720	something to be taken lightly. Like changing a style is changing a lot about how you see stuff.
4765520	4770720	I mean, if you go if we go look at my portfolio, it looks like the same artist did this, you know,
4770720	4774480	and, and I don't know, I just really respect the fact that he can break those conventions,
4774480	4778320	get out of his comfort zone, and create different things. Before I go on to the next,
4779040	4781200	next styles, let me catch back up on the questions.
4783440	4787520	From Nathan, in your opinion, does the fact that people use cinema 40 have a strong impact on
4787520	4792880	the visual style of his art? Can we achieve similar things with cycles? C 40 octane seems
4792880	4797440	to have a certain look to it. But that was just a service level observation of my own. All right,
4797440	4805040	so my opinion, my professional opinion is that no, again, I've talked about this earlier, but like,
4805040	4811360	the tools are not the thing to focus on at all. It's a gut reaction. And I understand that that
4811360	4818480	like, Oh, his tools must be the reason he's able to do this. But it's definitely I would say,
4818480	4824160	it's definitely not. It's his, it's his understanding of the tools that enables him to do this.
4824160	4828240	If he was proficient with cycles, he'd be able to create the same thing, I guarantee that.
4828880	4834720	Or three studio max and whatever, you know, you name it, like, there was a time when technology
4834720	4840640	was a little more varied. And, and I remember like using engines, render engines that sucked
4840640	4844800	compared to render engines that were good, but they're all good now, they're all good. So it's
4844800	4853440	not about the tools. I personally have used mental ray, vray, Maya software, blender render, cycles,
4853520	4860160	yeah, for Ray. Are there any others that I I mean, PBR stuff like unity's engine,
4862480	4868640	sketch fab's engine, like we're at the point in time where all of these do very similarly,
4868640	4873280	you know, I mean, okay, the PBR is not like comparable to cycles exactly. But
4874240	4878400	all the traditional offline renderers, they can do the same thing, I've used them and I've done
4878400	4883280	the same thing in different engines, all that to say, don't focus on the tools, you're missing
4883280	4893280	out if you think the tools are the reason he's able to do this stuff. I love the glowy stuff,
4893280	4898560	I agree, man, I, I just get lost in it. And I love it. And that's partly subjective, I'm sure, but
4899840	4906720	there's some fun glowy stuff. Technically, they're tetrahedrons. Oh, I'm sorry, maybe you're talking
4906720	4918000	about the pyramid. But thank you for the clarification. Wow, this is PG 13. Yeah, it's about to get
4918000	4924480	close to rated r towards the end. Let me see if I miss anything else. Okay.
4927840	4933040	Oh, yeah, a lot of the images you've chosen for today could be on on a Pink Floyd album cover.
4933040	4936960	That's pretty awesome. Yeah, he's, he's, and obviously, like, he's got that aesthetic, he
4936960	4942400	does most of his renders in like a taller format, not the widescreen, you know, cinematic format.
4942400	4948080	So I think he probably, and given his connection with like VJ stuff, like he's got a connection to
4948080	4952960	music. So he's got to be influenced by that stuff. But yeah, I mean, we've seen Imagine Dragons use
4952960	4961360	his stuff for their album covers. So definitely got got a an album cover aesthetic to him.
4963520	4968800	Pink Floyd is a pretty big rock band. So check them out if you haven't heard of them before.
4971280	4972960	All right, maybe I'm caught up.
4977280	4984160	Sorry, I kind of let the questions get. Wow, you guys are talking. I love it. Okay, cool.
4985440	4992160	Excellent. All right, so back to the styles we've got we've covered 90s Trapper Keeper graphical.
4992240	4998640	Next, we have basically vector art, right? So he's, he's even out of his, he's kind of like
4998640	5003520	crisscrossing software, you know, you usually do this kind of thing with, what is it, Illustrator or
5003520	5010160	like Inkscape, if you're on Linux, where it's like gradients and shapes, right? There's very little,
5010160	5015120	almost no lighting information, we can tell that this big shape is a sphere that's reflecting
5015120	5018320	the other shapes just because the subtle reflection that we can see in there.
5019040	5023680	And all this ball too, but besides that, there's very little information. And so,
5023680	5029680	you know, he's getting into, into the abstract graphical world by using 3D and octane. Like,
5029680	5034720	I love to see him break out of the conventions of even the software and what they're designed for,
5034720	5038480	and like making something completely unique. It's, yeah, it's not something to take,
5038480	5042560	to take lightly to experiment in these different styles, using the same tools.
5043280	5048880	And then this one to me, like go, we have several abstract categories, at least the way I had to
5048880	5054000	find it. This to me is like an abstract portrait. It almost looks like a photograph, like this was a
5054000	5060480	display or a gallery piece in a museum or something. And he took, he took a black and white photo of
5060480	5067280	it, but like, you know, it's centrally framed. The composition is very central. It's this,
5067760	5072880	it's this, you know, there's a theme of square shapes all around everything's square and blocky.
5073760	5079120	But he's just very good at that. And right up his wheelhouse with the sharp, sharp
5080880	5085120	shadows coming from a key light in the upper left corner, and then procedurally generated
5085120	5091840	geometry. So in this way, you know, it looks to me like an abstract photo or portrait. He's also got
5092400	5098800	a painterly, this painterly image. I mean, it registers to me like a painting, like an oil
5098800	5107360	painting or something. There's no reflectivity. But it's like, the way he achieved that style to
5107360	5112960	me is just fascinating. But yeah, this again, looks like something that could be hung in a home.
5112960	5118080	Like I think I could get my wife to buy this and hang in our house at thinking it's a painting and
5118080	5123680	not a 3d render. So yeah, I mean, at this point, I'm just trying to I'm illustrating how many
5124240	5129840	different varieties of style he had, he's able to achieve. And I mean, this is just a scratching
5129840	5135760	the surface, right? Like, we've got 4000 images that we can choose from from him. So this is abstract
5135760	5141360	painterly, abstract realism. This is one of my favorite things about him that draws me into him,
5141360	5147760	where all of the technical proficiency of realism is there, right? The reflections
5147760	5153520	read very, very realistic. The glass refraction reads very realistically. It looks like studio
5153520	5160160	lighting. So everything about the technical part of this feels real. But then this this weird
5160880	5168480	glass blown sphere shape is something I've never seen before. And so like it transports me into this
5169360	5175280	this fake world that feels real, you know, like he's able to do that so well. And and he's just,
5175280	5180480	you know, it's his mastery of those skills and that understanding of computer graphics and
5180480	5186320	realistic rendering that frees him up to create these abstract things to put a twist on it and
5186320	5194160	or a swirl to be literal. So I like this abstract realism, where it's like a shape that I've never
5194160	5199760	seen before, or it's a it's a light beam that I've never seen before. But everything else around
5199760	5205920	it feels tangible and feels real. And then finally, abstract character, you know, we've seen his
5205920	5212240	character work a lot in throughout the images. And you know, as a 3d modelers, we all can probably
5212240	5216320	look at this and think, Oh, yeah, that's just a head model, right? Like those are dime a dozen,
5216320	5222160	you can find them anywhere, we can see, you know, the the the what do you call them eyelash geometry
5222160	5226160	that that kind of serves as these little cards, we can see those in there, we can see the the
5226880	5232560	mouth cavity inside, you know, the transparent glass. But he takes something simple to me.
5233120	5240480	And he creates this, this refractive, what's the word dispersed, like dispersion, you know,
5240480	5247360	refractive dispersion, and makes the transparency have a rainbow color going on, he's, he's broken
5247360	5252480	up the reflections and refractions with with the grunge texture, we can see evidence of that.
5252480	5258240	And he's even like put some internal geometry in there, aside from from the eyes and the the
5258240	5262640	mouth cavity and teeth, there's like some sort of ball back here. It looks like he's almost
5262640	5269040	duplicated the the scalp and like pushed it into the head. And I mean, the only reason I can think
5269040	5274320	of is to make it more visually interesting to give more things more geometry for the refraction.
5275040	5279600	And, and like that's me breaking it down. But what every single one of these images has is when
5279600	5286800	you take a step back, and you just look at it, your eyes have so much to enjoy, and your mind
5286800	5292640	does too, like it challenges your perception. And in that way, it keeps me coming back and back
5292640	5297920	and back, obviously, has led to success for him. And this is just a couple hours, you know, like
5297920	5303520	it's it's a couple hours every day for 10 years. And he's able to do this kind of art. So really,
5303520	5310320	really wide variety of style. I really challenge you to look through his library as much as you
5310320	5315120	can, you'll probably lose a couple hours to doing that, if you're like me. But, and this is again
5315120	5320640	scratching the surface, like we've only in total looked at what, like 30 images out of 4000. So
5321440	5328560	pretty crazy. But the takeaways, let me look if I've got any more. Yeah, so chromatic aberration
5328560	5333280	that might let me see if that was part of the image, there might be a little chromatic aberration,
5333280	5337760	there's definitely some of his renders that have it. I don't know about this one. That poor guy
5337760	5343040	looks like he has a brain tumor. Yeah, maybe that maybe the name of the art has something to do with
5343040	5352480	that. But yeah, okay, so that yeah, you get it Catherine. This is good. It's very, it looks real,
5352480	5359120	but WTF, what is it, right? Like, that's how I how he draws me in. And it's, it's fascinating,
5359120	5366480	and it's expanded my, like, appreciation and appetite for like, things that challenge me
5366480	5373360	visually. So pretty sweet. Here's a question from Omar has people said he knows a bit of coding,
5373360	5378000	it seems some of his stuff could be mathematically generated. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know that
5378000	5386880	he's ever, I've seen any evidence that he does, like, code based, you know, 3d stuff and art
5386880	5393760	generation, geometry generation. But like, it seems very likely given how expansive his tool set is.
5398480	5404080	Is painterly a software? No, painterly to me is, yeah, as a style, someone else already said it.
5404720	5407440	It's just like an adjective for what looks like a painting.
5408160	5419200	Cool. All right, so let's talk about the takeaways. So we've seen a lot of artwork, and a lot of me
5419200	5426480	probably coming across as like a big fan and in bias. And I don't, I don't, I don't deny that he's
5426480	5432080	one of my he's probably my top artist and has been for for a while. He's been the first to really
5432080	5438000	challenge my perception of art in in years. So I'm a big fan of his, we've seen a lot of his art,
5438000	5444080	talked a lot about what makes it great. And in my opinion, but what what I want you to take away,
5444960	5450000	what I want you to hopefully take away is the possibilities, the infinite possibilities in
5450000	5455360	the abstract, okay, at least an appreciation for the abstract. But like what it represents to me,
5455360	5461600	someone who's kind of grown bored with with the stuff I've like, taught or created up to this
5461600	5466160	point, you know, character after character after character, cartoon creature after cartoon creature,
5466960	5472320	shader after shader after shader, all this stuff, you know, that I just repeat and I stick inside
5472320	5479120	my box, but abstract cracks open this wide world of of new things, new ways to use my abilities,
5479120	5485360	new ways to use your abilities, how to improve my abilities. And also how to like a new route for
5485360	5489920	expressing myself. That's one thing that's that's been growing in me, like how to say something
5489920	5495680	that I want to say with my art, not just recreate a lightsaber, you know, not not just do that kind
5495680	5500320	of stuff. So there are infinite possibilities in the abstract, I hope you kind of get some of that.
5501280	5507360	The fact that he is a master people is a master at these technical skills. So his his abstract,
5508400	5514000	I don't mean to go back to the debate, but where I maybe mistakenly can see abstract art as
5514640	5523200	as a shirking of the technical, technical skill, in favor of like expression or experimentation,
5523200	5530000	like he is a master at technical and he's a master at abstract. Oh, but yeah, so the rest of that
5530000	5534400	quote, like, or the rest of that point, the mass, your ability to master the technical skills is
5534400	5540560	what will liberate the artist. I think that's what I get out of people is, and I'll talk about more
5540560	5547840	why in just a minute. But I believe it requires him to be a master in order to convey these abstract
5547840	5554960	visual pieces, not the other way around. So also he's a there's no better there's no better example
5554960	5560720	than practice makes perfect. We can see he's been doing it been added for 10 years, insane.
5562240	5568800	And he said like he's posting this, that he's doing it intentionally to to practice and to get
5568800	5573200	better and by posting it on the internet. And he's being held accountable for that, you know,
5574160	5579280	really, really impressive dedication to it. And finally, remember that people is human. So
5580080	5586880	if in theory, if he can do it, so can you so can I. More realistically, like I'm not really
5586880	5591840	planning on doing this for 10 years, like not many people will. But if I can just glean a few
5591840	5597920	nuggets here and there, apply it to my workflow, take that challenge and it takes me further down
5597920	5603840	the road. Knowing that he's human, that's what can motivate me to do that kind of stuff. Certainly
5603840	5611680	how my my mind works. Is there anything else? Well, okay, I did want to show you about the
5611680	5615920	fact that he is human and practice makes perfect to illustrate this, you can go to his website,
5615920	5621760	look at his every days. And he's posted all of them, I believe. And he's he's got them in archives,
5621760	5627600	right? So you can go down to year one rounds are years as far as I can tell. So round one,
5627600	5632640	he was just focusing on drawing round two, he started to learn cinema 4D. Well, okay, so let's
5632640	5638000	just let's just spend some time in there real quick. Yeah, let's look at some of these.
5640080	5646320	Some of these images, some of these drawings. Now, he's very expressive. So he's, you know,
5646320	5652880	he's got, he's got things to say. And they could be a little PG 13 radar, just be aware of that.
5652880	5660640	But like, from a technical standpoint, like, if I'm honest, it's not like in incredibly
5660640	5665520	impressive work, right? He looks like a younger artist learning things. So that's his drawings.
5665520	5672880	If we go back to his first years in cinema 4D, look at some of this stuff. Yes, this should
5672880	5679600	make you feel so much better. Like this is where we all started, right? Like I didn't really do
5679600	5684800	stuff like this, he's that's already a little more advanced tectonic turds is the name of this one.
5686320	5690160	But like, look at this kind of stuff, he's probably figuring out what lens flares are all
5690160	5695120	about. Like this simple character, like, thank goodness, this artist started out this way,
5695120	5700720	and he's posted it on the internet, like we can see it explicitly his progression of skill. That's
5700720	5705200	what I'm trying to show you. If you go through these, you'll see round three, that was another
5705200	5713680	Cinema 4D, I think seven out of 11 are all 3D based. And, you know, like we can continue to see
5713680	5718080	his work and his progression, how he gets better and better and better, not only in the quality of
5718080	5725200	his 3D, but also like, I think what he's expressing, you see a maturity and an advancement of, of like
5725200	5731760	composition of the voice that I was talking about. So anyway, spend some time there if you don't
5731760	5737120	believe that he is human, and that you couldn't do this stuff too. It's all documented right here
5737120	5742880	in his archives. And eventually, you see him start just, he's just excels every single year,
5742880	5750320	and learns, learns enough to become a just insane, insanely talented artist, gifted artist, sorry,
5750320	5756720	talented, is a questionable term. Alright, now the last thing I want to end with is, when he
5756720	5766080	finished his 10 day, his 10 years in a row, he, he posted this, this image like a, like a, a typographic
5766080	5772960	image to commemorate his 10 years. And I want to end with that, it is a little rated R. So,
5774560	5780240	out of respect for social constructs and what, what we, at this point in time have decided
5780240	5784320	as appropriate language, I'm going to censor it, even though that could, I feel like as a disservice
5784320	5791280	to the actual thing, to his message, but I'm going to censor it. But you remember this, this is,
5791280	5795680	there's been no better challenge in my opinion than what he says here after 10 years of doing this
5795680	5801680	stuff. So remember it, read it to yourself, uncensored, exactly how it is, but so I'm going
5801680	5807040	to read it right now, forget checking Facebook again, forget that picture you just saw on Instagram,
5807040	5811680	forget worrying about how many people liked your last post, forget the news, forget that person
5811680	5816400	you really should email back, forget yourself doubt, forget whatever happened yesterday,
5816400	5822480	forget starting tomorrow, forget, will people like this, forget, will this be good enough,
5822480	5831200	forget all of your excuses, sit down and do work. That, that should motivate the hell out of you,
5831200	5836640	okay? And it does me, and I want to leave it with that, that commemorates his 10 years, no
5836640	5842960	better authority to say that in him. No one who has documented a harder worker than Beeple,
5842960	5850560	than Mike Beeple, Winkleman, wow, I almost forgot his name, how embarrassing. So yeah,
5850560	5857440	that is Beeple, that is an artist study, I hope you got some things out of that, and hope you
5857440	5863600	liked it. So that's going to be all for today, I don't see any other questions. I feel one with
5863600	5868080	that quote, that is amazing. So yeah, if there is any other questions from Glenn Johnson, do you
5868080	5879520	have any of your own artwork inspired by Beeple Kent? Okay, there's one image, let me see if I
5879520	5887840	can find it. It's really bad though, like I mean, it's hardly an inspiration, let me see, let me see
5887840	5899920	where it's at. Um, is it right here? It was a, no, no, no, I'm sorry, it was not this course, it was
5900800	5907280	Art of Sculpting. Sorry, I'm almost there, this one. So this feature image right here,
5907920	5913840	um, all it did, I think I was, I just seen Beeple's work and his use of like harsh pink lighting,
5914560	5920080	basically harsh saturated lighting I've always shied away from. So when I was playing with
5920080	5924720	the new feature image, I took that from him, you know, I was inspired by that. That's it,
5924720	5931200	right? So that's not much at all, but I really do want to, at some point, do a stream where I try
5931280	5938240	to mimic his workflows, I try to apply what I feel like I've learned from analyzing his art,
5938240	5942880	and try to create some abstract image within like a two hour timeframe. So I do want to do that.
5944080	5951760	We'll see when it actually happens, but anyway. Yeah, so that is going to be the stream for today.
5952480	5958640	What's up next for you Kent? Let's see, this month I'm focusing on doing, like,
5959040	5964960	uh, I'm doing a stream each week and next week is going to be a, what is it, a stream about
5964960	5970080	freelancing. We're going to have a discussion with Lampell and Wayne Dixon about freelancing
5970080	5975040	tips and sharing about our experience freelancing and what we've learned about it. We're going to do
5976720	5980080	a couple of other things that I'm going to publish really soon. I've got it all planned,
