{"text": " I'm not that smart. I've spent years of my life believing things that weren't true. I'm sure I still do. I just don't know what they are yet. And I think the most important parts of my education happened in those moments when I realized I was wrong about something. So this is a story about my entire field of study being blown apart by a single question and how I learned to lie with math. I make my living now writing for television, but in my previous life I went to business school and got a master's in economics. And I actually worked for a short time as an economist at the Department of Finance in Ottawa. Total normie job. I'd make small talk in the elevator. If it was Friday we'd talk about how glad we were that it was Friday. And if it wasn't Friday we'd talk about what day it was in relation to Friday and how glad we'd be when it was finally Friday. So while I was living in Ottawa one night I went with one of my friends to go see a talk by David Suzuki. He's this legendary Canadian science broadcaster and environmentalist. Like Bill Nye, the science guy, but his last name is harder to rhyme with. I don't remember much about the talk, but something he said must have hooked my interest because afterwards I went out and bought a book called The David Suzuki Reader. And this book fundamentally changed the way I thought about the world. And it did it with a single question that completely upended everything I learned about economics to that point. It was basically this. If we cut down a tree why does the economy consider that a revenue and not a cost? And something clicked and it was like yeah why does a tree only have economic value after it's turned into a bunch of pottery barn cheeseboards? And that made me question well if a tree isn't part of the economy then what's the economy? Is the atmosphere part of the economy? According to traditional economics it's not. So if your profitable business pollutes the atmosphere it's good for the economy. But is that good? And that made me question economic growth which is sacrosanct in economics and politics. Every leader no matter where they are on the political spectrum brags about how much they're growing the economy. The fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. The fastest economic growth in more than 30 years. And 4% economic growth. Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But if economic growth is destroying the biosphere and we need the biosphere to live then economic growth isn't necessarily making us richer it could actually be making us poorer. But instead of honestly grappling with the negative impacts of economic growth traditional economics just ignores them and only measures the good stuff which is kind of like your doctor only measuring your health by the deliciousness of the food you eat. So I see you're keeping up with your cheesy fries chicken nuggies nice love it scurvy. No I never heard of it. And as I kept digging into these assumptions I eventually hit the bedrock assumption of economics which is the biggest absurdity of all. The ultimate goal of the global economy its mission is to just grow without limits forever. There are no limits on this solitary rock floating in space filled with a bunch of half evolved apes who can barely manage going to bed at a decent time or democracy. That feels wrong. So I realized this social science I have a master's degree in isn't a science at all. Economics is not a science. Economists don't do controlled experiments in a lab. They don't uncover the natural laws of the universe. In fact most of them pretend the natural laws of the universe don't exist. I don't care if there's a Nobel Prize for economics. It's a pointless award. It's like a kids choice award for intellectuals. Economists are smart without question. I worked with a lot of very bright lovely people but they weren't scientists. Economists are basically lawyers for numbers. One of my economics professors in grad school even said this explicitly. She said most of our jobs would be gathering data to prove a conclusion that our boss had already decided on. There's nothing inherently bad about lawyers but we treat what they say with the proper amount of skepticism. We understand that if a lawyer for Totinos argues that Totinos shouldn't have to have nutrition labels because consumers get all the information they need about Totinos from Totino's ads. They're delicious. Teens love them. Case closed. We take that with a grain of salt but we don't do this for economists. Like take the term economists say. We hear this phrase repeated in the media constantly. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. So many economists say. Economists all say. Every economist in the country says it's often assumed that what follows economists say is a bland statement of fact. Like they're meteorologists talking about the weather. But why do we treat economists say with less skepticism than lawyers say? Here's my take on why this happens and it's the main point that I made this video to make. I think we treat economists as these impartial experts above the fray of politics because they're very good at hiding their opinions and they hide them inside math because math looks scientific. But math is not a science. Math is a language. Science is a method. And it's a method that economics doesn't use. Economists just use math to cosplay as scientists. And expressing ideas in math doesn't just make them look more scientific and authoritative. It also makes it more difficult to scrutinize and challenge those ideas. Because most people don't speak math, including me. I had an economics professor who would give entire lectures in math. He would just write equations for an hour. I'd be totally lost. And afterwards I'd go to his office and try to get him to explain a concept to me in words. And he couldn't. He would just write out more equations on his whiteboard. And I was like, buddy, just tell me. Tell me with your mouth. That was frustrating. But it taught me that math can create this sort of fortress around ideas. If you express something in words and it's stupid or depraved, anyone can challenge you. But if you express it in math, it looks respectable, even inarguable. And when you put that math in a graph, it looks sexy. It's hot. I won't have sex with a graph. But this graph also proves that the minimum wage is inefficient because it results in lower than optimal production and creates a deadweight loss. But instead of deadweight loss, you could also label that triangle worker power or like dignity. This graph is an opinion. Math is built on assumptions. And if your assumptions are false, so is your math. And the first time I realized that I was like, Oh, so you can lie with math, because you can hide your false assumptions inside formulas and make them look authoritative. That's harder to do with words. If you just say to me, minimum wage is bad for the economy, I'm going to say, okay, but what do you mean by bad? And what do you mean by economy? Those aren't just neutral words. Those are loaded with assumptions with opinions. You dick. So a lot of what we call bad for the economy and good for the economy are really just value judgments. Going to Dave and Buster's and drinking eight beers is technically better for the economy than rescuing a stray kitten. But is that really better? Not all economists hide behind math and some are doing good work. But I do think these criticisms apply to most economists currently working for powerful institutions like governments and banks. These are the people our political leaders listen to for advice, which means just about everyone in the world is directly impacted by that advice. So we should probably stop treating economists as these infinitely wise apolitical oracles and instead start treating them as who they are, math lawyers. If you want to learn more about what I talked about here, you can read the David Suzuki reader, as I mentioned, and Kate Rayworth's book Donut Economics outlines a really fantastic approach for thinking about the economy in a way that grapples with physical reality instead of ignoring it. And if you want to read the definitive work by a man who would probably dismiss everything I've said here and who thought that we should all vote with our dollar so that the hardworking rich can be rewarded with extra democracy, you can read Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom. I've read it, it sucks, but go for it. As for my Masters of Economics degree, I no longer need it or even have it because I ended up ripping it up to protest my school's refusal to divest from fossil fuels, which maybe didn't deserve that much attention since I wasn't really using it anyway.
