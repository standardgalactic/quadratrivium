00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
So there's a new movie called Air. It's about a Nike marketing executive, Sonny Vakara,

00:05.200 --> 00:10.720
played by Matt Damon, and how he pushed Nike to create an entire line of shoes around Michael

00:10.720 --> 00:19.920
Jordan, the Air Jordans, in 1984. This isn't a biopic of an entrepreneur or an athlete or a company.

00:19.920 --> 00:28.320
It might be the first biopic of a brand. Biopic. Biopic. Okay. Brands are something that I've always

00:28.320 --> 00:32.640
been interested in both as someone who just wants to understand the world better, but also as a

00:32.640 --> 00:37.440
comedy writer, because brands are extremely funny to me. Like somewhere in the world right now,

00:37.440 --> 00:42.400
a conference room full of marketing executives is trying to figure out how to project an identity

00:42.400 --> 00:48.000
and values for a product called like dumpy diapers. But as ridiculous as they are, brands have

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
infiltrated our culture so deeply that the highest level of achievement in our society is to completely

00:54.000 --> 01:00.400
fuse with capitalism and become a living, breathing brand. To be Rihanna slash Fenty,

01:00.400 --> 01:08.560
or Dr. Dre slash Beats, or Jordan Peterson slash Loneliness. And the original celebrity brand,

01:08.560 --> 01:15.120
the first person that everyone wanted to be like, was Mike. Oh, Jordan. Michael Jordan.

01:15.120 --> 01:20.800
And Air tells the story of how Michael Jordan became Air Jordan. But the real story of how

01:20.800 --> 01:26.640
Nike created that brand and how they revolutionized the modern corporation is way more interesting

01:26.640 --> 01:32.240
and less flattering to Nike and its CEO, Phil Knight, than the story this film tells. That story

01:32.240 --> 01:38.560
was first told in a hugely influential book called No Logo. Through a combination of investigative

01:38.560 --> 01:44.320
reporting and brilliant analysis, it explained exactly how Nike and other brands came to latch

01:44.320 --> 01:49.360
onto our culture and consume it like a cool, refreshing Heineken, open your world.

01:51.440 --> 01:57.200
No Logo made its author, Naomi Klein, an intellectual rock star at the age of 29,

01:57.200 --> 02:01.920
one of the biggest rock bands in the world at the time, Radiohead, actually considered naming

02:01.920 --> 02:06.960
one of their albums, No Logo. It's about the invasion of your ideas and your emotions and

02:06.960 --> 02:12.400
your feelings. They ended up calling it Kid A instead, but it's hard to overstate how influential

02:12.400 --> 02:18.480
this book was to an entire generation of people. That popularity was partly due to good timing.

02:18.480 --> 02:25.120
Just days before the book was released on November 30th, 1999, a massive protest began at the World

02:25.120 --> 02:30.880
Trade Organization Summit in Seattle called the Battle of Seattle. Tens of thousands of protesters

02:30.880 --> 02:36.080
were bombarded with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, and the city declared a state

02:36.080 --> 02:42.000
of emergency. Frazier and Niles Crane were utterly aghast. Today, this kind of protest would barely

02:42.000 --> 02:48.160
make the news, but at the time, it blew people's minds. They were like, protest? Why would anyone

02:48.160 --> 02:53.600
protest? It's the 90s. Everything is great. Have you heard the New Hoodie and the Blowfish album?

02:53.600 --> 03:00.800
It's fine. Most young people in the 90s had never even seen a protest in real life, and nobody

03:00.800 --> 03:07.120
had seen a protest like this. People were rejecting an economic order, which, up until that point,

03:07.120 --> 03:13.520
had been widely accepted as, much like Hoodie and the Blowfish, fine. So suddenly, everyone

03:13.520 --> 03:18.720
wanted to understand where all this outrage was coming from, and no logo provided the answer.

03:18.720 --> 03:24.880
I didn't read this book for the first time until 2016, and I reread it recently. And while the parts

03:24.880 --> 03:30.560
documenting the anti-corporate resistance movement were interesting, I want to focus on Klein's

03:30.560 --> 03:36.640
analyses of multinational corporations and their brands. Because the company she used as her main

03:36.640 --> 03:42.720
case study to help readers understand the marketing first workers last business model that took over

03:42.720 --> 03:49.600
in the 90s, and that led to the Battle of Seattle was Nike. So using Naomi Klein as my intellectual

03:49.600 --> 03:56.400
GPS and no logo as one giant citation for this whole video, I'm going to talk about how brands

03:56.400 --> 04:02.720
became so powerful, how Nike helped pioneer this expanded role that brands would play in our economy

04:02.720 --> 04:09.040
and our culture, and why Air is the perfect title for this movie for reasons that have nothing to do

04:09.040 --> 04:15.280
with basketball. So brands, as we know them now, didn't really show up until the late 19th century.

04:15.280 --> 04:20.720
Back then, if you wanted some sugar or flour, you'd go to the local general store, tell the shopkeeper

04:20.720 --> 04:25.680
what you needed, and he would scoop it out of barrels, hopefully not with his hands. But when

04:25.680 --> 04:30.560
mass production started in the 1880s, companies had a problem. Their products were all really

04:30.560 --> 04:35.120
similar to each other. So if they wanted to sell more, they had to stand out. And that's when

04:35.120 --> 04:40.400
companies discovered the first rule of advertising. The more similar products are to each other,

04:40.400 --> 04:45.280
the more important it is for you to fool people into thinking they're actually different. So along

04:45.280 --> 04:50.160
with manufacturing products, companies started manufacturing brands so people could tell them

04:50.160 --> 04:55.200
apart. So you had Heinz Ketchup and Hellman's mayonnaise and Grandpa McDougal's Soothing

04:55.680 --> 05:00.320
now with extra opium. These brands allowed companies to cut the shopkeepers out of the

05:00.320 --> 05:06.080
equation and communicate directly with a customer. But in the mid 1980s, some companies took this a

05:06.080 --> 05:10.800
step further. They realized that people weren't really buying their product as much as they were

05:10.800 --> 05:16.240
buying their brand. So why not take the product out of the equation completely and just sell the

05:16.240 --> 05:21.760
brand? And the company that led the shift to this new type of corporation that outsourced the making

05:21.760 --> 05:27.200
of its products and instead focused completely on marketing was Nike. In the time period when

05:27.200 --> 05:32.960
air takes place in the mid 80s, Nike wasn't some scrappy startup. Its CEO, Phil Knight, was already

05:32.960 --> 05:38.400
extremely rich. He started selling running shoes in the 60s and cashed in on the jogging craze in

05:38.400 --> 05:44.800
the 70s. But by the mid 80s, everybody stopped jogging probably because their knees hurt and

05:44.800 --> 05:50.560
the running shoe market dried up. Nike needed to reinvent itself. So Phil Knight decided that

05:50.560 --> 05:56.080
instead of being a running shoe company, Nike would become a brand factory where shoes were

05:56.080 --> 06:01.760
just the raw material for the real product, the brand. He said, there's no value in making

06:01.760 --> 06:06.640
things anymore. The value is added by careful research by innovation and by marketing. But

06:06.640 --> 06:12.880
how does that work? How do you create value from just pure marketing? What is marketing worth in

06:12.880 --> 06:19.280
actual dollars? That was an open question until 1988. That year, Philip Morris bought craft for

06:19.360 --> 06:25.840
$13 billion, six times more than the company was worth on paper, which means the word craft

06:25.840 --> 06:32.400
was valued at over $10 billion. So just the synapses firing in millions of people's brains,

06:32.400 --> 06:37.520
recognizing the word craft and having certain feelings about that word was worth over $10

06:37.520 --> 06:42.960
billion, which was proof that this marketing first model worked. Ads were no longer just a way to

06:42.960 --> 06:48.080
sell more stuff. They could increase the value of your company. The more you spent on ads,

06:48.080 --> 06:53.040
the more your brand was worth. So Nike and other multinational corporations completely

06:53.040 --> 06:58.240
reoriented themselves towards marketing. And that process involved three steps that had an

06:58.240 --> 07:04.960
enormous impact on our economy and our culture and our politics in ways that are still felt to this

07:04.960 --> 07:11.120
day. The first step was to close the American factories and outsource manufacturing to contractors

07:11.120 --> 07:17.120
and subcontractors in the global south, whose only job was to make stuff as cheaply as possible.

07:17.120 --> 07:22.160
That meant a boom in sweatshops. And we all know this part of the story. People living in low-income

07:22.160 --> 07:27.280
countries around the world are paid starvation wages in horrible conditions to make clothing for

07:27.280 --> 07:32.400
people living in richer countries who try not to think about it. In the early 90s, most people

07:32.400 --> 07:39.280
were still genuinely ignorant about sweatshops, but that all changed in 1996. After years of

07:39.280 --> 07:45.120
activists trying to raise awareness of child labor being used by American corporations overseas,

07:45.120 --> 07:50.400
Life magazine published a report that featured this photo of a Pakistani boy sewing Nike soccer

07:50.400 --> 07:56.880
balls. And everyone freaked out. Anti-sweatshop protests swept across college campuses, calling

07:56.880 --> 08:01.520
out companies by name. The New York Times called it the biggest surge in campus activism in nearly

08:01.520 --> 08:06.400
two decades. Phil Knight was suddenly a villain, and Michael Moore was showing up at his office,

08:06.400 --> 08:12.000
offering him a free trip to Indonesia. But at the end of the day, Phil's friends circled the wagons.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.400
Bill Clinton made him part of a toothless White House task force on sweatshops,

08:16.400 --> 08:21.280
and academics like Jeffrey Sachs, famous economist and Bono Ride or Die,

08:21.280 --> 08:26.320
argued that companies like Nike were basically engaged in a giant poverty reduction program.

08:26.320 --> 08:26.880
He said,

08:26.880 --> 08:30.720
My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops, but that there are too few.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.640
Those are precisely the jobs that was stepping stones for Singapore and Hong Kong,

08:34.640 --> 08:38.720
and those are the jobs that have to come to Africa to get them out of back-breaking rural

08:38.720 --> 08:43.920
poverty. Yeah, it's not like companies want to abduct Africans and enslave them. They just

08:43.920 --> 08:49.680
want to give Africans the opportunity to be slaves in the comfort of their own continent.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.560
So Nike moved its operations from country to country, leaving a trail of sweat and union

08:54.560 --> 08:59.360
crackdowns in its wake. While back in America, they moved on to step two of their new business

08:59.360 --> 09:04.480
model. Once Nike and other multinationals laid off most of their workers, they could put all

09:04.480 --> 09:09.360
that money they saved into perfecting their brands, which was a very different business.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.320
These companies weren't making products anymore, they were making images, and they had to infuse

09:14.320 --> 09:21.040
those images of cola or coffee or margarine, with some kind of meaning that their customers

09:21.040 --> 09:26.560
would feel an emotional connection to. This made the job of marketers way more difficult.

09:26.560 --> 09:31.120
Before the late 80s, if you wanted to sell something, you just had to come up with a catchy

09:31.120 --> 09:36.640
jingle, maybe a cute cartoon character. But now these poor marketing executives were sent on a

09:36.640 --> 09:43.680
quest to find their corporate soul, to find a deep spiritual meaning in like snack cakes.

09:43.680 --> 09:49.360
And every corporation started sounding like it just got back from a backpacking trip to Nepal.

09:49.360 --> 09:55.760
Nike didn't sell shoes anymore, it sold the idea of transcendence through sports. IBM didn't

09:55.760 --> 10:01.760
sell computers, it sold business solutions. And Gillette was no longer just a razor,

10:01.760 --> 10:08.560
it was an experience of confidence and power that you could hold in your actual hand.

10:10.480 --> 10:16.080
But also just a f***ing razor. Understandably, this process of trying to find meaning in

10:16.080 --> 10:22.480
meaninglessness broke the brains of marketing executives. They lost touch with reality completely

10:22.480 --> 10:27.600
and got brand brain. Here's a quote from brand brain sufferer and former head of marketing at

10:27.600 --> 10:34.160
Nike, Scott Bedbury. A great brand raises a bar. It adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.480
Whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup

10:38.480 --> 10:43.760
of coffee you're drinking really matters. What does any of that mean? The cup of coffee you're

10:43.760 --> 10:50.560
drinking will never, ever matter. Unless you're defusing a bomb and somehow the adrenaline just

10:50.560 --> 10:55.920
isn't enough to keep you awake and you need that extra pick me up to keep going, maybe then,

10:55.920 --> 11:01.920
maybe. You see other tragic examples of brand brain all the time, like that room full of staples

11:01.920 --> 11:07.760
executives who stood and applauded for the big reveal of their company's new logo, which was

11:07.760 --> 11:13.280
a staple. Or that Bank of America marketer who wrote and performed an earnest ode to a new credit

11:13.280 --> 11:19.680
card to the tune of U2's one. I'll read some lyrics since the music might infringe on U2's copyright

11:19.680 --> 11:27.360
and I'm already dangerously heavy on Bono in this video. And it's one bank, one card, one name

11:27.360 --> 11:35.440
that's known all over the world, one spirit. We get to share it, leading us to higher standards.

11:36.160 --> 11:43.440
Ooh. So one step two was complete and the company created a brand so powerful that just slapping it

11:43.440 --> 11:48.960
onto something would infuse it with meaning. It was time to slap it on everything they could.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.920
Remember from the craft example, ads aren't just about increasing sales anymore. They're an

11:53.920 --> 11:59.360
investment. The more you advertise, the more your company is worth. So in the 90s, brands started

11:59.360 --> 12:05.120
showing up in places that they never were before, like music festivals and stadiums. Banana stickers

12:05.120 --> 12:10.800
were advertising movies. Colleges signed contracts with soda companies to put sponsored vending machines

12:10.800 --> 12:16.400
on campus. And campus athletics departments all over the US signed sponsorship deals with Nike.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.720
But it went way further and deeper. Brands became culture vampires, sucking the soul out of

12:22.720 --> 12:29.440
everything that was good and cool to add value to themselves. They co-opted fashion, music and

12:29.440 --> 12:35.280
nostalgia. They co-opted whole identities like feminist. And brands didn't just co-opt culture,

12:35.280 --> 12:41.920
they co-opted counterculture. Sprite's obey your thirst slogan was a riff on anti-corporate graffiti.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.400
More recently, we've seen brands trying to co-opt social justice movements, like when Kendall

12:46.400 --> 12:52.320
Jenner solved police violence with high-fructose corn syrup. Now there was a huge backlash to that

12:52.320 --> 12:58.320
Kendall Jenner ad, but the vast, vast majority of branding happens with little to no pushback.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.520
Why is that? No logo suggested that it's partly due to the fact that corporate brands are filling a

13:03.520 --> 13:09.280
social vacuum that they themselves helped create. Throughout the 80s and 90s, the pro-free market

13:09.280 --> 13:15.360
political consensus hollowed out the public sphere. Jobs moved overseas, inequality widened,

13:15.360 --> 13:21.920
and public schools deteriorated. So with fewer public funds for, say, after-school sports programs,

13:21.920 --> 13:27.200
Nike could step in and sponsor its own programs and plaster its logo all over them.

13:27.200 --> 13:33.200
And with a smaller tax base for, say, basic municipal services, KFC could literally fill

13:33.200 --> 13:39.040
in potholes and label them refreshed by KFC. That actually happened, and the most offensive part

13:39.040 --> 13:47.280
to me is the use of the word refreshed. KFC does not refresh. At best, it engorges. At worst,

13:47.280 --> 13:52.880
equalize. But we haven't just lost public services over the last several decades. We've also lost

13:52.880 --> 13:59.520
public spaces. And brands have tried to exploit our nostalgia and longing for those lost spaces.

13:59.520 --> 14:05.600
Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose name on screen here was spelled by a Starbucks barista,

14:05.600 --> 14:09.680
said his company's customers are there for more than just the coffee.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.400
It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth in community people get in

14:14.400 --> 14:19.680
Starbucks stores. Now, it's true that people do have a genuine hunger for warmth and community,

14:19.680 --> 14:25.040
but corporations like Starbucks are terrible at providing them because actual warm welcoming

14:25.040 --> 14:31.360
community spaces don't charge you $10 to drink a small burnt coffee next to a tinny speaker

14:31.360 --> 14:36.480
blasting Ed Sheeran. That Howard Schultz quote about recreating a feeling of community

14:36.480 --> 14:42.880
reminded me of a mall in Los Angeles called the Americana at Brand. The whole place is a replica

14:42.880 --> 14:47.760
of an old fashioned town square. Everything is spotless. There's even a chandelier for some

14:47.760 --> 14:53.040
reason. And an old timey streetcar where a tour guide points out local mom and pop establishments

14:53.040 --> 14:59.840
like the Samsung Galaxy Papa. Obviously, it's not a real town square. It's not a public space.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.880
It's private property. And that's a crucial distinction because in a public space, you can

15:04.880 --> 15:11.520
say or do anything within the confines of the law. But on private property, you can only say or do

15:11.520 --> 15:16.880
what's permitted by its owner. You can't hold a climate change protest at Americana at Brand.

15:16.880 --> 15:21.600
You can't hold a union rally inside of a Starbucks. You can't actually participate in

15:21.600 --> 15:27.040
culture in these places. You can't talk back. It's a one way conversation. And now, of course,

15:27.120 --> 15:32.320
our community spaces are online and so suffocated by brands that they can cut us out of the

15:32.320 --> 15:37.680
conversation completely and just talk directly to each other. Like when Sunny D implied that it

15:37.680 --> 15:43.760
wanted to unalive itself and other brands reached out to help. Just for your reference, I asked

15:43.760 --> 15:50.160
chat GBT what you should do if a brand you love becomes suicidal. It suggested encouraging the

15:50.160 --> 15:54.480
brand to seek help being a supportive listener. And most importantly, remembering that while you

15:54.480 --> 16:00.000
may feel a strong connection to a brand, ultimately their well being is not your responsibility.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.120
So simply dominating all cultural and public and online spaces was never enough for brands.

16:07.120 --> 16:12.080
Remember, they're selling meaning. And what's the main competition if you're selling meaning?

16:12.080 --> 16:17.040
Religion. And this is where Nike's boldest innovation happened because they decided to

16:17.040 --> 16:23.120
compete directly with religion by creating a God. And they did it by following a very classic

16:23.120 --> 16:28.640
paint by numbers mythical formula, a man who could fly. Early Air Jordan ads explicitly

16:28.640 --> 16:33.760
tried to create this illusion that he could defy gravity. Air Jordans weren't just shoes. They

16:33.760 --> 16:39.120
were a portal to a higher plane of existence. Nike's flagship store in midtown Manhattan

16:39.120 --> 16:43.360
is right across the street from a cathedral, which seems appropriate because it feels like

16:43.360 --> 16:48.080
a religious pilgrimage site. It's full of inspirational quotes and glass cases with

16:48.160 --> 16:52.560
hunks of polyurethane encased inside like they're the bones of saints. And what's

16:52.560 --> 16:58.960
interesting is that this store and probably all of the big brand flagship stores in midtown Manhattan

16:58.960 --> 17:04.000
lose money. This is some of the most expensive storefront real estate on the planet. And these

17:04.000 --> 17:08.160
stores don't move nearly enough merchandise to pay for it. But the point of these stores

17:08.160 --> 17:13.200
isn't direct sales. They're meant to increase the value of the brand by making a statement about

17:13.200 --> 17:18.400
how big and important it is. They imprint an experience on the people that visit and inspire

17:18.400 --> 17:24.400
a devotion to the brand. Unfortunately for Nike, turning itself into a religion with Michael Jordan

17:24.400 --> 17:31.360
as its God had a downside because this God had agents who negotiated non exclusivity. So when

17:31.360 --> 17:37.120
Michael Jordan's fame and power outgrew Nike, it lost control of him. And if there was a distinct

17:37.120 --> 17:42.720
moment that signaled this loss of control, it was the 1996 release of the movie Space Jam,

17:42.720 --> 17:48.320
which was essentially a feature length ad for a super brand called Michael Jordan. The director

17:48.320 --> 17:54.640
of Space Jam and part time Norwegian grave digger Joe Pidka has been very open about this. There's

17:54.640 --> 18:00.800
nothing more than a long commercial. They paid for the movie three times with the licensing fees

18:00.800 --> 18:06.320
before that we rolled an inch of film over 200 companies licensed Space Jam merch, which annoyed

18:06.320 --> 18:11.200
Nike because they thought it would water down the Air Jordan brand. Nike didn't want to share the

18:11.200 --> 18:15.840
spotlight. It wanted to be the star. And the amazing thing is brands seem to have learned

18:15.840 --> 18:21.600
from that experience. And today they've co-opted the whole concept of movie stardom. The biggest

18:21.600 --> 18:27.920
movie star in the world right now isn't an actor. It's a brand Marvel. Remember ads increase the

18:27.920 --> 18:34.640
value of a brand and Marvel movies are advertisements for the Marvel brand. So even if a Marvel movie

18:34.640 --> 18:41.760
breaks even if the exposure it gets increases the value of the Marvel brand, it's still profitable

18:41.760 --> 18:47.120
to the company that owns Marvel, Disney. And similarly, even though the film Air wasn't

18:47.120 --> 18:54.320
created by Nike, it will add value to the Nike brand because they perfected this magic trick

18:54.320 --> 19:01.440
of conjuring value out of nothing. Nike makes most of its money out of air. I personally don't

19:01.440 --> 19:06.400
think the transformation of Michael Jordan into a brand deserves to be celebrated as some great

19:06.400 --> 19:13.840
act of ingenuity. And the whole idea of fetishizing a basic commodity is, to me, dumb. But as Naomi

19:13.840 --> 19:19.040
Klein made clear at the end of No Logo, the criticisms of corporations like Nike were never

19:19.040 --> 19:24.880
really about the brands. Brands are a symbol of the injustices of the global economy. That's what

19:24.880 --> 19:31.920
anti-corporate protests were and continue to be about. The brands were only the music. The truth

19:31.920 --> 19:33.520
was in the lyrics.
