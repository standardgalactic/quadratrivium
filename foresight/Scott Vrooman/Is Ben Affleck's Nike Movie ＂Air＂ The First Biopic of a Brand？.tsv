0	5200	So there's a new movie called Air. It's about a Nike marketing executive, Sonny Vakara,
5200	10720	played by Matt Damon, and how he pushed Nike to create an entire line of shoes around Michael
10720	19920	Jordan, the Air Jordans, in 1984. This isn't a biopic of an entrepreneur or an athlete or a company.
19920	28320	It might be the first biopic of a brand. Biopic. Biopic. Okay. Brands are something that I've always
28320	32640	been interested in both as someone who just wants to understand the world better, but also as a
32640	37440	comedy writer, because brands are extremely funny to me. Like somewhere in the world right now,
37440	42400	a conference room full of marketing executives is trying to figure out how to project an identity
42400	48000	and values for a product called like dumpy diapers. But as ridiculous as they are, brands have
48000	54000	infiltrated our culture so deeply that the highest level of achievement in our society is to completely
54000	60400	fuse with capitalism and become a living, breathing brand. To be Rihanna slash Fenty,
60400	68560	or Dr. Dre slash Beats, or Jordan Peterson slash Loneliness. And the original celebrity brand,
68560	75120	the first person that everyone wanted to be like, was Mike. Oh, Jordan. Michael Jordan.
75120	80800	And Air tells the story of how Michael Jordan became Air Jordan. But the real story of how
80800	86640	Nike created that brand and how they revolutionized the modern corporation is way more interesting
86640	92240	and less flattering to Nike and its CEO, Phil Knight, than the story this film tells. That story
92240	98560	was first told in a hugely influential book called No Logo. Through a combination of investigative
98560	104320	reporting and brilliant analysis, it explained exactly how Nike and other brands came to latch
104320	109360	onto our culture and consume it like a cool, refreshing Heineken, open your world.
111440	117200	No Logo made its author, Naomi Klein, an intellectual rock star at the age of 29,
117200	121920	one of the biggest rock bands in the world at the time, Radiohead, actually considered naming
121920	126960	one of their albums, No Logo. It's about the invasion of your ideas and your emotions and
126960	132400	your feelings. They ended up calling it Kid A instead, but it's hard to overstate how influential
132400	138480	this book was to an entire generation of people. That popularity was partly due to good timing.
138480	145120	Just days before the book was released on November 30th, 1999, a massive protest began at the World
145120	150880	Trade Organization Summit in Seattle called the Battle of Seattle. Tens of thousands of protesters
150880	156080	were bombarded with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, and the city declared a state
156080	162000	of emergency. Frazier and Niles Crane were utterly aghast. Today, this kind of protest would barely
162000	168160	make the news, but at the time, it blew people's minds. They were like, protest? Why would anyone
168160	173600	protest? It's the 90s. Everything is great. Have you heard the New Hoodie and the Blowfish album?
173600	180800	It's fine. Most young people in the 90s had never even seen a protest in real life, and nobody
180800	187120	had seen a protest like this. People were rejecting an economic order, which, up until that point,
187120	193520	had been widely accepted as, much like Hoodie and the Blowfish, fine. So suddenly, everyone
193520	198720	wanted to understand where all this outrage was coming from, and no logo provided the answer.
198720	204880	I didn't read this book for the first time until 2016, and I reread it recently. And while the parts
204880	210560	documenting the anti-corporate resistance movement were interesting, I want to focus on Klein's
210560	216640	analyses of multinational corporations and their brands. Because the company she used as her main
216640	222720	case study to help readers understand the marketing first workers last business model that took over
222720	229600	in the 90s, and that led to the Battle of Seattle was Nike. So using Naomi Klein as my intellectual
229600	236400	GPS and no logo as one giant citation for this whole video, I'm going to talk about how brands
236400	242720	became so powerful, how Nike helped pioneer this expanded role that brands would play in our economy
242720	249040	and our culture, and why Air is the perfect title for this movie for reasons that have nothing to do
249040	255280	with basketball. So brands, as we know them now, didn't really show up until the late 19th century.
255280	260720	Back then, if you wanted some sugar or flour, you'd go to the local general store, tell the shopkeeper
260720	265680	what you needed, and he would scoop it out of barrels, hopefully not with his hands. But when
265680	270560	mass production started in the 1880s, companies had a problem. Their products were all really
270560	275120	similar to each other. So if they wanted to sell more, they had to stand out. And that's when
275120	280400	companies discovered the first rule of advertising. The more similar products are to each other,
280400	285280	the more important it is for you to fool people into thinking they're actually different. So along
285280	290160	with manufacturing products, companies started manufacturing brands so people could tell them
290160	295200	apart. So you had Heinz Ketchup and Hellman's mayonnaise and Grandpa McDougal's Soothing
295680	300320	now with extra opium. These brands allowed companies to cut the shopkeepers out of the
300320	306080	equation and communicate directly with a customer. But in the mid 1980s, some companies took this a
306080	310800	step further. They realized that people weren't really buying their product as much as they were
310800	316240	buying their brand. So why not take the product out of the equation completely and just sell the
316240	321760	brand? And the company that led the shift to this new type of corporation that outsourced the making
321760	327200	of its products and instead focused completely on marketing was Nike. In the time period when
327200	332960	air takes place in the mid 80s, Nike wasn't some scrappy startup. Its CEO, Phil Knight, was already
332960	338400	extremely rich. He started selling running shoes in the 60s and cashed in on the jogging craze in
338400	344800	the 70s. But by the mid 80s, everybody stopped jogging probably because their knees hurt and
344800	350560	the running shoe market dried up. Nike needed to reinvent itself. So Phil Knight decided that
350560	356080	instead of being a running shoe company, Nike would become a brand factory where shoes were
356080	361760	just the raw material for the real product, the brand. He said, there's no value in making
361760	366640	things anymore. The value is added by careful research by innovation and by marketing. But
366640	372880	how does that work? How do you create value from just pure marketing? What is marketing worth in
372880	379280	actual dollars? That was an open question until 1988. That year, Philip Morris bought craft for
379360	385840	$13 billion, six times more than the company was worth on paper, which means the word craft
385840	392400	was valued at over $10 billion. So just the synapses firing in millions of people's brains,
392400	397520	recognizing the word craft and having certain feelings about that word was worth over $10
397520	402960	billion, which was proof that this marketing first model worked. Ads were no longer just a way to
402960	408080	sell more stuff. They could increase the value of your company. The more you spent on ads,
408080	413040	the more your brand was worth. So Nike and other multinational corporations completely
413040	418240	reoriented themselves towards marketing. And that process involved three steps that had an
418240	424960	enormous impact on our economy and our culture and our politics in ways that are still felt to this
424960	431120	day. The first step was to close the American factories and outsource manufacturing to contractors
431120	437120	and subcontractors in the global south, whose only job was to make stuff as cheaply as possible.
437120	442160	That meant a boom in sweatshops. And we all know this part of the story. People living in low-income
442160	447280	countries around the world are paid starvation wages in horrible conditions to make clothing for
447280	452400	people living in richer countries who try not to think about it. In the early 90s, most people
452400	459280	were still genuinely ignorant about sweatshops, but that all changed in 1996. After years of
459280	465120	activists trying to raise awareness of child labor being used by American corporations overseas,
465120	470400	Life magazine published a report that featured this photo of a Pakistani boy sewing Nike soccer
470400	476880	balls. And everyone freaked out. Anti-sweatshop protests swept across college campuses, calling
476880	481520	out companies by name. The New York Times called it the biggest surge in campus activism in nearly
481520	486400	two decades. Phil Knight was suddenly a villain, and Michael Moore was showing up at his office,
486400	492000	offering him a free trip to Indonesia. But at the end of the day, Phil's friends circled the wagons.
492000	496400	Bill Clinton made him part of a toothless White House task force on sweatshops,
496400	501280	and academics like Jeffrey Sachs, famous economist and Bono Ride or Die,
501280	506320	argued that companies like Nike were basically engaged in a giant poverty reduction program.
506320	506880	He said,
506880	510720	My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops, but that there are too few.
510720	514640	Those are precisely the jobs that was stepping stones for Singapore and Hong Kong,
514640	518720	and those are the jobs that have to come to Africa to get them out of back-breaking rural
518720	523920	poverty. Yeah, it's not like companies want to abduct Africans and enslave them. They just
523920	529680	want to give Africans the opportunity to be slaves in the comfort of their own continent.
529680	534560	So Nike moved its operations from country to country, leaving a trail of sweat and union
534560	539360	crackdowns in its wake. While back in America, they moved on to step two of their new business
539360	544480	model. Once Nike and other multinationals laid off most of their workers, they could put all
544480	549360	that money they saved into perfecting their brands, which was a very different business.
549360	554320	These companies weren't making products anymore, they were making images, and they had to infuse
554320	561040	those images of cola or coffee or margarine, with some kind of meaning that their customers
561040	566560	would feel an emotional connection to. This made the job of marketers way more difficult.
566560	571120	Before the late 80s, if you wanted to sell something, you just had to come up with a catchy
571120	576640	jingle, maybe a cute cartoon character. But now these poor marketing executives were sent on a
576640	583680	quest to find their corporate soul, to find a deep spiritual meaning in like snack cakes.
583680	589360	And every corporation started sounding like it just got back from a backpacking trip to Nepal.
589360	595760	Nike didn't sell shoes anymore, it sold the idea of transcendence through sports. IBM didn't
595760	601760	sell computers, it sold business solutions. And Gillette was no longer just a razor,
601760	608560	it was an experience of confidence and power that you could hold in your actual hand.
610480	616080	But also just a f***ing razor. Understandably, this process of trying to find meaning in
616080	622480	meaninglessness broke the brains of marketing executives. They lost touch with reality completely
622480	627600	and got brand brain. Here's a quote from brand brain sufferer and former head of marketing at
627600	634160	Nike, Scott Bedbury. A great brand raises a bar. It adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience.
634160	638480	Whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup
638480	643760	of coffee you're drinking really matters. What does any of that mean? The cup of coffee you're
643760	650560	drinking will never, ever matter. Unless you're defusing a bomb and somehow the adrenaline just
650560	655920	isn't enough to keep you awake and you need that extra pick me up to keep going, maybe then,
655920	661920	maybe. You see other tragic examples of brand brain all the time, like that room full of staples
661920	667760	executives who stood and applauded for the big reveal of their company's new logo, which was
667760	673280	a staple. Or that Bank of America marketer who wrote and performed an earnest ode to a new credit
673280	679680	card to the tune of U2's one. I'll read some lyrics since the music might infringe on U2's copyright
679680	687360	and I'm already dangerously heavy on Bono in this video. And it's one bank, one card, one name
687360	695440	that's known all over the world, one spirit. We get to share it, leading us to higher standards.
696160	703440	Ooh. So one step two was complete and the company created a brand so powerful that just slapping it
703440	708960	onto something would infuse it with meaning. It was time to slap it on everything they could.
709040	713920	Remember from the craft example, ads aren't just about increasing sales anymore. They're an
713920	719360	investment. The more you advertise, the more your company is worth. So in the 90s, brands started
719360	725120	showing up in places that they never were before, like music festivals and stadiums. Banana stickers
725120	730800	were advertising movies. Colleges signed contracts with soda companies to put sponsored vending machines
730800	736400	on campus. And campus athletics departments all over the US signed sponsorship deals with Nike.
736400	742720	But it went way further and deeper. Brands became culture vampires, sucking the soul out of
742720	749440	everything that was good and cool to add value to themselves. They co-opted fashion, music and
749440	755280	nostalgia. They co-opted whole identities like feminist. And brands didn't just co-opt culture,
755280	761920	they co-opted counterculture. Sprite's obey your thirst slogan was a riff on anti-corporate graffiti.
761920	766400	More recently, we've seen brands trying to co-opt social justice movements, like when Kendall
766400	772320	Jenner solved police violence with high-fructose corn syrup. Now there was a huge backlash to that
772320	778320	Kendall Jenner ad, but the vast, vast majority of branding happens with little to no pushback.
778320	783520	Why is that? No logo suggested that it's partly due to the fact that corporate brands are filling a
783520	789280	social vacuum that they themselves helped create. Throughout the 80s and 90s, the pro-free market
789280	795360	political consensus hollowed out the public sphere. Jobs moved overseas, inequality widened,
795360	801920	and public schools deteriorated. So with fewer public funds for, say, after-school sports programs,
801920	807200	Nike could step in and sponsor its own programs and plaster its logo all over them.
807200	813200	And with a smaller tax base for, say, basic municipal services, KFC could literally fill
813200	819040	in potholes and label them refreshed by KFC. That actually happened, and the most offensive part
819040	827280	to me is the use of the word refreshed. KFC does not refresh. At best, it engorges. At worst,
827280	832880	equalize. But we haven't just lost public services over the last several decades. We've also lost
832880	839520	public spaces. And brands have tried to exploit our nostalgia and longing for those lost spaces.
839520	845600	Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose name on screen here was spelled by a Starbucks barista,
845600	849680	said his company's customers are there for more than just the coffee.
849680	854400	It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth in community people get in
854400	859680	Starbucks stores. Now, it's true that people do have a genuine hunger for warmth and community,
859680	865040	but corporations like Starbucks are terrible at providing them because actual warm welcoming
865040	871360	community spaces don't charge you $10 to drink a small burnt coffee next to a tinny speaker
871360	876480	blasting Ed Sheeran. That Howard Schultz quote about recreating a feeling of community
876480	882880	reminded me of a mall in Los Angeles called the Americana at Brand. The whole place is a replica
882880	887760	of an old fashioned town square. Everything is spotless. There's even a chandelier for some
887760	893040	reason. And an old timey streetcar where a tour guide points out local mom and pop establishments
893040	899840	like the Samsung Galaxy Papa. Obviously, it's not a real town square. It's not a public space.
899840	904880	It's private property. And that's a crucial distinction because in a public space, you can
904880	911520	say or do anything within the confines of the law. But on private property, you can only say or do
911520	916880	what's permitted by its owner. You can't hold a climate change protest at Americana at Brand.
916880	921600	You can't hold a union rally inside of a Starbucks. You can't actually participate in
921600	927040	culture in these places. You can't talk back. It's a one way conversation. And now, of course,
927120	932320	our community spaces are online and so suffocated by brands that they can cut us out of the
932320	937680	conversation completely and just talk directly to each other. Like when Sunny D implied that it
937680	943760	wanted to unalive itself and other brands reached out to help. Just for your reference, I asked
943760	950160	chat GBT what you should do if a brand you love becomes suicidal. It suggested encouraging the
950160	954480	brand to seek help being a supportive listener. And most importantly, remembering that while you
954480	960000	may feel a strong connection to a brand, ultimately their well being is not your responsibility.
960000	967120	So simply dominating all cultural and public and online spaces was never enough for brands.
967120	972080	Remember, they're selling meaning. And what's the main competition if you're selling meaning?
972080	977040	Religion. And this is where Nike's boldest innovation happened because they decided to
977040	983120	compete directly with religion by creating a God. And they did it by following a very classic
983120	988640	paint by numbers mythical formula, a man who could fly. Early Air Jordan ads explicitly
988640	993760	tried to create this illusion that he could defy gravity. Air Jordans weren't just shoes. They
993760	999120	were a portal to a higher plane of existence. Nike's flagship store in midtown Manhattan
999120	1003360	is right across the street from a cathedral, which seems appropriate because it feels like
1003360	1008080	a religious pilgrimage site. It's full of inspirational quotes and glass cases with
1008160	1012560	hunks of polyurethane encased inside like they're the bones of saints. And what's
1012560	1018960	interesting is that this store and probably all of the big brand flagship stores in midtown Manhattan
1018960	1024000	lose money. This is some of the most expensive storefront real estate on the planet. And these
1024000	1028160	stores don't move nearly enough merchandise to pay for it. But the point of these stores
1028160	1033200	isn't direct sales. They're meant to increase the value of the brand by making a statement about
1033200	1038400	how big and important it is. They imprint an experience on the people that visit and inspire
1038400	1044400	a devotion to the brand. Unfortunately for Nike, turning itself into a religion with Michael Jordan
1044400	1051360	as its God had a downside because this God had agents who negotiated non exclusivity. So when
1051360	1057120	Michael Jordan's fame and power outgrew Nike, it lost control of him. And if there was a distinct
1057120	1062720	moment that signaled this loss of control, it was the 1996 release of the movie Space Jam,
1062720	1068320	which was essentially a feature length ad for a super brand called Michael Jordan. The director
1068320	1074640	of Space Jam and part time Norwegian grave digger Joe Pidka has been very open about this. There's
1074640	1080800	nothing more than a long commercial. They paid for the movie three times with the licensing fees
1080800	1086320	before that we rolled an inch of film over 200 companies licensed Space Jam merch, which annoyed
1086320	1091200	Nike because they thought it would water down the Air Jordan brand. Nike didn't want to share the
1091200	1095840	spotlight. It wanted to be the star. And the amazing thing is brands seem to have learned
1095840	1101600	from that experience. And today they've co-opted the whole concept of movie stardom. The biggest
1101600	1107920	movie star in the world right now isn't an actor. It's a brand Marvel. Remember ads increase the
1107920	1114640	value of a brand and Marvel movies are advertisements for the Marvel brand. So even if a Marvel movie
1114640	1121760	breaks even if the exposure it gets increases the value of the Marvel brand, it's still profitable
1121760	1127120	to the company that owns Marvel, Disney. And similarly, even though the film Air wasn't
1127120	1134320	created by Nike, it will add value to the Nike brand because they perfected this magic trick
1134320	1141440	of conjuring value out of nothing. Nike makes most of its money out of air. I personally don't
1141440	1146400	think the transformation of Michael Jordan into a brand deserves to be celebrated as some great
1146400	1153840	act of ingenuity. And the whole idea of fetishizing a basic commodity is, to me, dumb. But as Naomi
1153840	1159040	Klein made clear at the end of No Logo, the criticisms of corporations like Nike were never
1159040	1164880	really about the brands. Brands are a symbol of the injustices of the global economy. That's what
1164880	1171920	anti-corporate protests were and continue to be about. The brands were only the music. The truth
1171920	1173520	was in the lyrics.
