Checking Scott Vrooman/How To Lie With Math (and why I ripped up my economics degree).txt
1) Economists often use complex math to make their ideas seem more scientific and authoritative, which can make their work appear objective and beyond dispute, even when it's based on assumptions that might be debatable.

2) The reliance on mathematical models in economics can create a barrier that makes the underlying assumptions difficult for non-specialists to scrutinize or challenge.

3) Math can give a veneer of precision and certainty to theories that may not hold up under closer examination in the real world, where economic principles often don't apply as neatly as they do on paper.

4) There's a tendency to treat economists with less skepticism than other experts, like lawyers, partly because their work is presented in what appears to be a scientific language of math.

5) Economics should be treated as a discipline that involves value judgments and assumptions rather than an exact science, and its advice should be scrutinized accordingly, especially when it impacts policy and the economy at large.

Checking Scott Vrooman/Is Ben Affleck's Nike Movie ＂Air＂ The First Biopic of a Brand？.txt
1. **Brand as Religion**: Nike has successfully turned its brand into a religion by creating a mythos around Michael Jordan, presenting him as a figure who can defy gravity through its Air Jordans. This is part of a larger trend where brands attempt to sell meaning and compete with traditional institutions like religion.

2. **Nike's Flagship Stores**: These stores serve as cultural landmarks more than direct sales outlets, aiming to imprint an experience on visitors that inspires devotion to the brand. They often lose money but are strategically placed to enhance the brand's prestige and cultural impact.

3. **Michael Jordan's Independence**: Nike's control over Michael Jordan diminished as his fame and influence grew, leading to situations like the "Space Jam" movie, which was a commercial for both Michael Jordan and the Air Jordan brand but licensed to multiple companies, much to Nike's chagrin.

4. **Brand-Movie Synergy**: Modern brands like Marvel have taken the concept of using film to enhance their value to new heights. Movies are not just entertainment but also advertisements for the brand, ensuring that even if the movie doesn't make a profit, the brand still benefits from the exposure and increased perceived value.

5. **Critique of Brand Worship**: The transformation of athletes like Michael Jordan into brands is seen by some as a trivialization of commodities. Critics argue that the focus on branding obscures the underlying issues within the global economy, including labor exploitation and corporate power.

6. **The Bigger Picture**: Protests against corporations like Nike are not about the brands themselves but about the larger systemic issues they represent, such as economic injustice and the commodification of human beings. The critique is that brands mask these deeper problems with their marketing and cultural influence.
