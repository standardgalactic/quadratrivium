0	5280	I'm not that smart. I've spent years of my life believing things that weren't true. I'm sure
5280	10480	I still do. I just don't know what they are yet. And I think the most important parts of my education
10480	15600	happened in those moments when I realized I was wrong about something. So this is a story about
15600	22320	my entire field of study being blown apart by a single question and how I learned to lie with
22320	28320	math. I make my living now writing for television, but in my previous life I went to business school
28320	33520	and got a master's in economics. And I actually worked for a short time as an economist at the
33520	39760	Department of Finance in Ottawa. Total normie job. I'd make small talk in the elevator. If it was Friday
39760	45440	we'd talk about how glad we were that it was Friday. And if it wasn't Friday we'd talk about
45440	52960	what day it was in relation to Friday and how glad we'd be when it was finally Friday. So while I
52960	58000	was living in Ottawa one night I went with one of my friends to go see a talk by David Suzuki.
58000	63760	He's this legendary Canadian science broadcaster and environmentalist. Like Bill Nye, the science
63760	69520	guy, but his last name is harder to rhyme with. I don't remember much about the talk, but something
69520	74480	he said must have hooked my interest because afterwards I went out and bought a book called
74480	80960	The David Suzuki Reader. And this book fundamentally changed the way I thought about the world.
80960	85600	And it did it with a single question that completely upended everything I learned about
85680	91760	economics to that point. It was basically this. If we cut down a tree why does the economy consider
91760	98560	that a revenue and not a cost? And something clicked and it was like yeah why does a tree
99120	104560	only have economic value after it's turned into a bunch of pottery barn cheeseboards?
104560	110160	And that made me question well if a tree isn't part of the economy then what's the economy?
110160	115200	Is the atmosphere part of the economy? According to traditional economics it's not.
115200	120480	So if your profitable business pollutes the atmosphere it's good for the economy. But is
120480	126960	that good? And that made me question economic growth which is sacrosanct in economics and
126960	132960	politics. Every leader no matter where they are on the political spectrum brags about how much
132960	137920	they're growing the economy. The fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four
137920	143040	decades. We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. The fastest economic growth
143040	148640	in more than 30 years. And 4% economic growth. Americans can be confident about our economic
148640	154400	growth. But if economic growth is destroying the biosphere and we need the biosphere to live
155040	160480	then economic growth isn't necessarily making us richer it could actually be making us poorer.
160480	164720	But instead of honestly grappling with the negative impacts of economic growth
164720	171040	traditional economics just ignores them and only measures the good stuff which is kind of like your
171040	177040	doctor only measuring your health by the deliciousness of the food you eat. So I see you're keeping up
177040	182480	with your cheesy fries chicken nuggies nice love it scurvy. No I never heard of it. And as I kept
182480	187760	digging into these assumptions I eventually hit the bedrock assumption of economics which is the
187760	193760	biggest absurdity of all. The ultimate goal of the global economy its mission is to just grow
194400	202080	without limits forever. There are no limits on this solitary rock floating in space
202080	207520	filled with a bunch of half evolved apes who can barely manage going to bed at a decent time
207520	216000	or democracy. That feels wrong. So I realized this social science I have a master's degree in
216000	222080	isn't a science at all. Economics is not a science. Economists don't do controlled experiments in a
222080	227280	lab. They don't uncover the natural laws of the universe. In fact most of them pretend the natural
227280	232400	laws of the universe don't exist. I don't care if there's a Nobel Prize for economics. It's a
232400	238320	pointless award. It's like a kids choice award for intellectuals. Economists are smart without
238320	243760	question. I worked with a lot of very bright lovely people but they weren't scientists.
243760	249280	Economists are basically lawyers for numbers. One of my economics professors in grad school
249280	255280	even said this explicitly. She said most of our jobs would be gathering data to prove a conclusion
255280	260400	that our boss had already decided on. There's nothing inherently bad about lawyers but we treat
260400	267200	what they say with the proper amount of skepticism. We understand that if a lawyer for Totinos argues
267200	272560	that Totinos shouldn't have to have nutrition labels because consumers get all the information
272560	278400	they need about Totinos from Totino's ads. They're delicious. Teens love them. Case closed.
278960	285280	We take that with a grain of salt but we don't do this for economists. Like take the term economists
285280	291520	say. We hear this phrase repeated in the media constantly. Economists say. Economists say. Economists
291520	296880	say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. So many economists say. Economists
296880	302480	all say. Every economist in the country says it's often assumed that what follows economists say
302560	307840	is a bland statement of fact. Like they're meteorologists talking about the weather. But why
307840	314240	do we treat economists say with less skepticism than lawyers say? Here's my take on why this
314240	320400	happens and it's the main point that I made this video to make. I think we treat economists as these
320400	326800	impartial experts above the fray of politics because they're very good at hiding their opinions
326800	333920	and they hide them inside math because math looks scientific. But math is not a science.
333920	340400	Math is a language. Science is a method. And it's a method that economics doesn't use. Economists
340400	346240	just use math to cosplay as scientists. And expressing ideas in math doesn't just make them
346240	352160	look more scientific and authoritative. It also makes it more difficult to scrutinize and challenge
352160	358400	those ideas. Because most people don't speak math, including me. I had an economics professor who
358400	364560	would give entire lectures in math. He would just write equations for an hour. I'd be totally lost.
364560	370400	And afterwards I'd go to his office and try to get him to explain a concept to me in words.
370960	376240	And he couldn't. He would just write out more equations on his whiteboard. And I was like,
376240	381520	buddy, just tell me. Tell me with your mouth. That was frustrating. But it taught me that math
381520	388160	can create this sort of fortress around ideas. If you express something in words and it's stupid
388160	394960	or depraved, anyone can challenge you. But if you express it in math, it looks respectable,
394960	402160	even inarguable. And when you put that math in a graph, it looks sexy. It's hot. I won't have sex
402160	408160	with a graph. But this graph also proves that the minimum wage is inefficient because it results
408160	415040	in lower than optimal production and creates a deadweight loss. But instead of deadweight loss,
415040	422800	you could also label that triangle worker power or like dignity. This graph is an opinion. Math
422800	427840	is built on assumptions. And if your assumptions are false, so is your math. And the first time I
427840	435920	realized that I was like, Oh, so you can lie with math, because you can hide your false assumptions
435920	441440	inside formulas and make them look authoritative. That's harder to do with words. If you just say
441440	448320	to me, minimum wage is bad for the economy, I'm going to say, okay, but what do you mean by bad?
448320	454080	And what do you mean by economy? Those aren't just neutral words. Those are loaded with assumptions
454080	459920	with opinions. You dick. So a lot of what we call bad for the economy and good for the economy
459920	465760	are really just value judgments. Going to Dave and Buster's and drinking eight beers is technically
465840	471280	better for the economy than rescuing a stray kitten. But is that really better? Not all economists
471280	476480	hide behind math and some are doing good work. But I do think these criticisms apply to most
476480	481200	economists currently working for powerful institutions like governments and banks. These
481200	485920	are the people our political leaders listen to for advice, which means just about everyone in the
485920	491840	world is directly impacted by that advice. So we should probably stop treating economists as these
491920	498800	infinitely wise apolitical oracles and instead start treating them as who they are, math lawyers.
498800	503120	If you want to learn more about what I talked about here, you can read the David Suzuki reader,
503120	508960	as I mentioned, and Kate Rayworth's book Donut Economics outlines a really fantastic approach
508960	514640	for thinking about the economy in a way that grapples with physical reality instead of ignoring
514640	519200	it. And if you want to read the definitive work by a man who would probably dismiss everything I've
519200	524560	said here and who thought that we should all vote with our dollar so that the hardworking rich can
524560	530000	be rewarded with extra democracy, you can read Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom. I've
530000	536960	read it, it sucks, but go for it. As for my Masters of Economics degree, I no longer need it or even
536960	542800	have it because I ended up ripping it up to protest my school's refusal to divest from fossil fuels,
542800	547280	which maybe didn't deserve that much attention since I wasn't really using it anyway.
