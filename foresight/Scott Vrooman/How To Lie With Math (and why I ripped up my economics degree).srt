1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
I'm not that smart. I've spent years of my life believing things that weren't true. I'm sure

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,480
I still do. I just don't know what they are yet. And I think the most important parts of my education

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,600
happened in those moments when I realized I was wrong about something. So this is a story about

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,320
my entire field of study being blown apart by a single question and how I learned to lie with

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,320
math. I make my living now writing for television, but in my previous life I went to business school

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
and got a master's in economics. And I actually worked for a short time as an economist at the

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,760
Department of Finance in Ottawa. Total normie job. I'd make small talk in the elevator. If it was Friday

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,440
we'd talk about how glad we were that it was Friday. And if it wasn't Friday we'd talk about

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,960
what day it was in relation to Friday and how glad we'd be when it was finally Friday. So while I

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,000
was living in Ottawa one night I went with one of my friends to go see a talk by David Suzuki.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,760
He's this legendary Canadian science broadcaster and environmentalist. Like Bill Nye, the science

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,520
guy, but his last name is harder to rhyme with. I don't remember much about the talk, but something

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,480
he said must have hooked my interest because afterwards I went out and bought a book called

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,960
The David Suzuki Reader. And this book fundamentally changed the way I thought about the world.

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
And it did it with a single question that completely upended everything I learned about

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,760
economics to that point. It was basically this. If we cut down a tree why does the economy consider

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,560
that a revenue and not a cost? And something clicked and it was like yeah why does a tree

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,560
only have economic value after it's turned into a bunch of pottery barn cheeseboards?

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,160
And that made me question well if a tree isn't part of the economy then what's the economy?

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Is the atmosphere part of the economy? According to traditional economics it's not.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,480
So if your profitable business pollutes the atmosphere it's good for the economy. But is

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,960
that good? And that made me question economic growth which is sacrosanct in economics and

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,960
politics. Every leader no matter where they are on the political spectrum brags about how much

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,920
they're growing the economy. The fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,040
decades. We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. The fastest economic growth

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,640
in more than 30 years. And 4% economic growth. Americans can be confident about our economic

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,400
growth. But if economic growth is destroying the biosphere and we need the biosphere to live

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,480
then economic growth isn't necessarily making us richer it could actually be making us poorer.

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
But instead of honestly grappling with the negative impacts of economic growth

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,040
traditional economics just ignores them and only measures the good stuff which is kind of like your

31
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,040
doctor only measuring your health by the deliciousness of the food you eat. So I see you're keeping up

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,480
with your cheesy fries chicken nuggies nice love it scurvy. No I never heard of it. And as I kept

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
digging into these assumptions I eventually hit the bedrock assumption of economics which is the

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,760
biggest absurdity of all. The ultimate goal of the global economy its mission is to just grow

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,080
without limits forever. There are no limits on this solitary rock floating in space

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,520
filled with a bunch of half evolved apes who can barely manage going to bed at a decent time

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:36,000
or democracy. That feels wrong. So I realized this social science I have a master's degree in

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,080
isn't a science at all. Economics is not a science. Economists don't do controlled experiments in a

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,280
lab. They don't uncover the natural laws of the universe. In fact most of them pretend the natural

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,400
laws of the universe don't exist. I don't care if there's a Nobel Prize for economics. It's a

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,320
pointless award. It's like a kids choice award for intellectuals. Economists are smart without

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,760
question. I worked with a lot of very bright lovely people but they weren't scientists.

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Economists are basically lawyers for numbers. One of my economics professors in grad school

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,280
even said this explicitly. She said most of our jobs would be gathering data to prove a conclusion

45
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,400
that our boss had already decided on. There's nothing inherently bad about lawyers but we treat

46
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,200
what they say with the proper amount of skepticism. We understand that if a lawyer for Totinos argues

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,560
that Totinos shouldn't have to have nutrition labels because consumers get all the information

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,400
they need about Totinos from Totino's ads. They're delicious. Teens love them. Case closed.

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,280
We take that with a grain of salt but we don't do this for economists. Like take the term economists

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,520
say. We hear this phrase repeated in the media constantly. Economists say. Economists say. Economists

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. So many economists say. Economists

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,480
all say. Every economist in the country says it's often assumed that what follows economists say

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,840
is a bland statement of fact. Like they're meteorologists talking about the weather. But why

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,240
do we treat economists say with less skepticism than lawyers say? Here's my take on why this

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,400
happens and it's the main point that I made this video to make. I think we treat economists as these

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,800
impartial experts above the fray of politics because they're very good at hiding their opinions

57
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,920
and they hide them inside math because math looks scientific. But math is not a science.

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Math is a language. Science is a method. And it's a method that economics doesn't use. Economists

59
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,240
just use math to cosplay as scientists. And expressing ideas in math doesn't just make them

60
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,160
look more scientific and authoritative. It also makes it more difficult to scrutinize and challenge

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,400
those ideas. Because most people don't speak math, including me. I had an economics professor who

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,560
would give entire lectures in math. He would just write equations for an hour. I'd be totally lost.

63
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,400
And afterwards I'd go to his office and try to get him to explain a concept to me in words.

64
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
And he couldn't. He would just write out more equations on his whiteboard. And I was like,

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
buddy, just tell me. Tell me with your mouth. That was frustrating. But it taught me that math

66
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,160
can create this sort of fortress around ideas. If you express something in words and it's stupid

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,960
or depraved, anyone can challenge you. But if you express it in math, it looks respectable,

68
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,160
even inarguable. And when you put that math in a graph, it looks sexy. It's hot. I won't have sex

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,160
with a graph. But this graph also proves that the minimum wage is inefficient because it results

70
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,040
in lower than optimal production and creates a deadweight loss. But instead of deadweight loss,

71
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,800
you could also label that triangle worker power or like dignity. This graph is an opinion. Math

72
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
is built on assumptions. And if your assumptions are false, so is your math. And the first time I

73
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,920
realized that I was like, Oh, so you can lie with math, because you can hide your false assumptions

74
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,440
inside formulas and make them look authoritative. That's harder to do with words. If you just say

75
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,320
to me, minimum wage is bad for the economy, I'm going to say, okay, but what do you mean by bad?

76
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,080
And what do you mean by economy? Those aren't just neutral words. Those are loaded with assumptions

77
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,920
with opinions. You dick. So a lot of what we call bad for the economy and good for the economy

78
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,760
are really just value judgments. Going to Dave and Buster's and drinking eight beers is technically

79
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,280
better for the economy than rescuing a stray kitten. But is that really better? Not all economists

80
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,480
hide behind math and some are doing good work. But I do think these criticisms apply to most

81
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,200
economists currently working for powerful institutions like governments and banks. These

82
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,920
are the people our political leaders listen to for advice, which means just about everyone in the

83
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,840
world is directly impacted by that advice. So we should probably stop treating economists as these

84
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,800
infinitely wise apolitical oracles and instead start treating them as who they are, math lawyers.

85
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
If you want to learn more about what I talked about here, you can read the David Suzuki reader,

86
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,960
as I mentioned, and Kate Rayworth's book Donut Economics outlines a really fantastic approach

87
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,640
for thinking about the economy in a way that grapples with physical reality instead of ignoring

88
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,200
it. And if you want to read the definitive work by a man who would probably dismiss everything I've

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,560
said here and who thought that we should all vote with our dollar so that the hardworking rich can

90
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,000
be rewarded with extra democracy, you can read Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom. I've

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,960
read it, it sucks, but go for it. As for my Masters of Economics degree, I no longer need it or even

92
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,800
have it because I ended up ripping it up to protest my school's refusal to divest from fossil fuels,

93
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,280
which maybe didn't deserve that much attention since I wasn't really using it anyway.
