00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
I'm not that smart. I've spent years of my life believing things that weren't true. I'm sure

00:05.280 --> 00:10.480
I still do. I just don't know what they are yet. And I think the most important parts of my education

00:10.480 --> 00:15.600
happened in those moments when I realized I was wrong about something. So this is a story about

00:15.600 --> 00:22.320
my entire field of study being blown apart by a single question and how I learned to lie with

00:22.320 --> 00:28.320
math. I make my living now writing for television, but in my previous life I went to business school

00:28.320 --> 00:33.520
and got a master's in economics. And I actually worked for a short time as an economist at the

00:33.520 --> 00:39.760
Department of Finance in Ottawa. Total normie job. I'd make small talk in the elevator. If it was Friday

00:39.760 --> 00:45.440
we'd talk about how glad we were that it was Friday. And if it wasn't Friday we'd talk about

00:45.440 --> 00:52.960
what day it was in relation to Friday and how glad we'd be when it was finally Friday. So while I

00:52.960 --> 00:58.000
was living in Ottawa one night I went with one of my friends to go see a talk by David Suzuki.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.760
He's this legendary Canadian science broadcaster and environmentalist. Like Bill Nye, the science

01:03.760 --> 01:09.520
guy, but his last name is harder to rhyme with. I don't remember much about the talk, but something

01:09.520 --> 01:14.480
he said must have hooked my interest because afterwards I went out and bought a book called

01:14.480 --> 01:20.960
The David Suzuki Reader. And this book fundamentally changed the way I thought about the world.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.600
And it did it with a single question that completely upended everything I learned about

01:25.680 --> 01:31.760
economics to that point. It was basically this. If we cut down a tree why does the economy consider

01:31.760 --> 01:38.560
that a revenue and not a cost? And something clicked and it was like yeah why does a tree

01:39.120 --> 01:44.560
only have economic value after it's turned into a bunch of pottery barn cheeseboards?

01:44.560 --> 01:50.160
And that made me question well if a tree isn't part of the economy then what's the economy?

01:50.160 --> 01:55.200
Is the atmosphere part of the economy? According to traditional economics it's not.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.480
So if your profitable business pollutes the atmosphere it's good for the economy. But is

02:00.480 --> 02:06.960
that good? And that made me question economic growth which is sacrosanct in economics and

02:06.960 --> 02:12.960
politics. Every leader no matter where they are on the political spectrum brags about how much

02:12.960 --> 02:17.920
they're growing the economy. The fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four

02:17.920 --> 02:23.040
decades. We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. The fastest economic growth

02:23.040 --> 02:28.640
in more than 30 years. And 4% economic growth. Americans can be confident about our economic

02:28.640 --> 02:34.400
growth. But if economic growth is destroying the biosphere and we need the biosphere to live

02:35.040 --> 02:40.480
then economic growth isn't necessarily making us richer it could actually be making us poorer.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.720
But instead of honestly grappling with the negative impacts of economic growth

02:44.720 --> 02:51.040
traditional economics just ignores them and only measures the good stuff which is kind of like your

02:51.040 --> 02:57.040
doctor only measuring your health by the deliciousness of the food you eat. So I see you're keeping up

02:57.040 --> 03:02.480
with your cheesy fries chicken nuggies nice love it scurvy. No I never heard of it. And as I kept

03:02.480 --> 03:07.760
digging into these assumptions I eventually hit the bedrock assumption of economics which is the

03:07.760 --> 03:13.760
biggest absurdity of all. The ultimate goal of the global economy its mission is to just grow

03:14.400 --> 03:22.080
without limits forever. There are no limits on this solitary rock floating in space

03:22.080 --> 03:27.520
filled with a bunch of half evolved apes who can barely manage going to bed at a decent time

03:27.520 --> 03:36.000
or democracy. That feels wrong. So I realized this social science I have a master's degree in

03:36.000 --> 03:42.080
isn't a science at all. Economics is not a science. Economists don't do controlled experiments in a

03:42.080 --> 03:47.280
lab. They don't uncover the natural laws of the universe. In fact most of them pretend the natural

03:47.280 --> 03:52.400
laws of the universe don't exist. I don't care if there's a Nobel Prize for economics. It's a

03:52.400 --> 03:58.320
pointless award. It's like a kids choice award for intellectuals. Economists are smart without

03:58.320 --> 04:03.760
question. I worked with a lot of very bright lovely people but they weren't scientists.

04:03.760 --> 04:09.280
Economists are basically lawyers for numbers. One of my economics professors in grad school

04:09.280 --> 04:15.280
even said this explicitly. She said most of our jobs would be gathering data to prove a conclusion

04:15.280 --> 04:20.400
that our boss had already decided on. There's nothing inherently bad about lawyers but we treat

04:20.400 --> 04:27.200
what they say with the proper amount of skepticism. We understand that if a lawyer for Totinos argues

04:27.200 --> 04:32.560
that Totinos shouldn't have to have nutrition labels because consumers get all the information

04:32.560 --> 04:38.400
they need about Totinos from Totino's ads. They're delicious. Teens love them. Case closed.

04:38.960 --> 04:45.280
We take that with a grain of salt but we don't do this for economists. Like take the term economists

04:45.280 --> 04:51.520
say. We hear this phrase repeated in the media constantly. Economists say. Economists say. Economists

04:51.520 --> 04:56.880
say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. Economists say. So many economists say. Economists

04:56.880 --> 05:02.480
all say. Every economist in the country says it's often assumed that what follows economists say

05:02.560 --> 05:07.840
is a bland statement of fact. Like they're meteorologists talking about the weather. But why

05:07.840 --> 05:14.240
do we treat economists say with less skepticism than lawyers say? Here's my take on why this

05:14.240 --> 05:20.400
happens and it's the main point that I made this video to make. I think we treat economists as these

05:20.400 --> 05:26.800
impartial experts above the fray of politics because they're very good at hiding their opinions

05:26.800 --> 05:33.920
and they hide them inside math because math looks scientific. But math is not a science.

05:33.920 --> 05:40.400
Math is a language. Science is a method. And it's a method that economics doesn't use. Economists

05:40.400 --> 05:46.240
just use math to cosplay as scientists. And expressing ideas in math doesn't just make them

05:46.240 --> 05:52.160
look more scientific and authoritative. It also makes it more difficult to scrutinize and challenge

05:52.160 --> 05:58.400
those ideas. Because most people don't speak math, including me. I had an economics professor who

05:58.400 --> 06:04.560
would give entire lectures in math. He would just write equations for an hour. I'd be totally lost.

06:04.560 --> 06:10.400
And afterwards I'd go to his office and try to get him to explain a concept to me in words.

06:10.960 --> 06:16.240
And he couldn't. He would just write out more equations on his whiteboard. And I was like,

06:16.240 --> 06:21.520
buddy, just tell me. Tell me with your mouth. That was frustrating. But it taught me that math

06:21.520 --> 06:28.160
can create this sort of fortress around ideas. If you express something in words and it's stupid

06:28.160 --> 06:34.960
or depraved, anyone can challenge you. But if you express it in math, it looks respectable,

06:34.960 --> 06:42.160
even inarguable. And when you put that math in a graph, it looks sexy. It's hot. I won't have sex

06:42.160 --> 06:48.160
with a graph. But this graph also proves that the minimum wage is inefficient because it results

06:48.160 --> 06:55.040
in lower than optimal production and creates a deadweight loss. But instead of deadweight loss,

06:55.040 --> 07:02.800
you could also label that triangle worker power or like dignity. This graph is an opinion. Math

07:02.800 --> 07:07.840
is built on assumptions. And if your assumptions are false, so is your math. And the first time I

07:07.840 --> 07:15.920
realized that I was like, Oh, so you can lie with math, because you can hide your false assumptions

07:15.920 --> 07:21.440
inside formulas and make them look authoritative. That's harder to do with words. If you just say

07:21.440 --> 07:28.320
to me, minimum wage is bad for the economy, I'm going to say, okay, but what do you mean by bad?

07:28.320 --> 07:34.080
And what do you mean by economy? Those aren't just neutral words. Those are loaded with assumptions

07:34.080 --> 07:39.920
with opinions. You dick. So a lot of what we call bad for the economy and good for the economy

07:39.920 --> 07:45.760
are really just value judgments. Going to Dave and Buster's and drinking eight beers is technically

07:45.840 --> 07:51.280
better for the economy than rescuing a stray kitten. But is that really better? Not all economists

07:51.280 --> 07:56.480
hide behind math and some are doing good work. But I do think these criticisms apply to most

07:56.480 --> 08:01.200
economists currently working for powerful institutions like governments and banks. These

08:01.200 --> 08:05.920
are the people our political leaders listen to for advice, which means just about everyone in the

08:05.920 --> 08:11.840
world is directly impacted by that advice. So we should probably stop treating economists as these

08:11.920 --> 08:18.800
infinitely wise apolitical oracles and instead start treating them as who they are, math lawyers.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.120
If you want to learn more about what I talked about here, you can read the David Suzuki reader,

08:23.120 --> 08:28.960
as I mentioned, and Kate Rayworth's book Donut Economics outlines a really fantastic approach

08:28.960 --> 08:34.640
for thinking about the economy in a way that grapples with physical reality instead of ignoring

08:34.640 --> 08:39.200
it. And if you want to read the definitive work by a man who would probably dismiss everything I've

08:39.200 --> 08:44.560
said here and who thought that we should all vote with our dollar so that the hardworking rich can

08:44.560 --> 08:50.000
be rewarded with extra democracy, you can read Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom. I've

08:50.000 --> 08:56.960
read it, it sucks, but go for it. As for my Masters of Economics degree, I no longer need it or even

08:56.960 --> 09:02.800
have it because I ended up ripping it up to protest my school's refusal to divest from fossil fuels,

09:02.800 --> 09:07.280
which maybe didn't deserve that much attention since I wasn't really using it anyway.

09:17.280 --> 09:25.600
because I will be in them. Thank you for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for

09:25.600 --> 09:35.920
