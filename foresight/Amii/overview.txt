1. **Q&A Session**: The panel, including Demis Hassabis from DeepMind, discussed various topics ranging from the impact of AI on society to the future of human-AI collaboration and integration.
   
2. **Human-AI Collaboration**: The consensus was that AI will augment humans rather than replace them, with a focus on areas like caregiving for the elderly as a practical application where economic incentives are significant.

3. **Knowledge Integration**: There was an acknowledgment that human cognitive capacity may be limited in fully understanding and integrating all the knowledge required to build advanced AI systems. Therefore, it's likely that technology will augment our intelligence, with potential solutions being more integrated forms of AI assistance, possibly through wireless connections rather than invasive "wet" interfaces.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The importance of ethics in AI development was highlighted, emphasizing the need for responsible creation and usage of AI technologies.

5. **Appreciation**: Justin from C-FAR expressed gratitude to all involved in organizing the summer school, including the content planning committee, the organizing team, sponsors, and especially Pedro, who ensured participants left with a token of appreciation—a digital certificate and an invitation to stay connected through the Summer School website and Slack.

6. **Feedback and Continuation**: Participants were encouraged to fill out a feedback survey to provide insights on their experience, and the panel emphasized the importance of maintaining communication post-event for future collaboration and engagement.

Checking Amii/Special Announcement： John Carmack & Rich Sutton partner to accelerate development of AGI.txt
1. **Background**: John is the CEO and co-founder of Keen. He previously worked at OpenAI, where he led the Dactyl project, which aimed to teach robots to manipulate objects as adeptly as a human child. He also contributed to OpenAI's Gym environment for training machine learning models in various tasks, which has become an industry standard.

2. **Keen**: Keen is John's current venture, focused on applying AI to make AI within video games more powerful and dynamic. The company seems to be at the intersection of AI research and commercial application, with a commitment to both advancing the field and delivering practical benefits for video games.

3. **Open Research and Collaboration**: While John advocates for open research and has a history of sharing insights and code (as seen with Gym), he also recognizes the need for commercial sensitivity. Keen will likely share tactical insights, such as specific algorithms or optimizers, but may keep more strategic, foundational work confidential to protect their competitive edge and intellectual property.

4. **AGI**: John believes that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will eventually be a solved problem, with the textbook of the future having a thin chapter on it, as it will build upon existing advancements. However, he acknowledges the challenges of protecting proprietary information in a field where employees may carry knowledge away from a company.

5. **Open Source and Commercial Balance**: John understands the importance of open source in advancing technology but also appreciates the commercial imperatives that drive innovation. Keen's approach to sharing insights and code will balance these considerations, contributing to the field while safeguarding its own developments.

6. **Future Outlook**: While John is cautiously optimistic about the progress in AI, he acknowledges that there are significant challenges ahead, including maintaining a balance between open research and commercial interests. The pace of migration towards open source tools may be slow, but incremental improvements continue to be made.

7. **Final Thanks**: John thanks the audience for their questions and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to share insights about his work and the future of AI at Keen. He also offers to answer additional questions post-session if time permits.

Checking Amii/The Tea Time Talks： Rich Sutton, Open Questions in Model-based RL (May 27, 2019).txt
1. The strategy of representing nonlinear interactions as linear features in the state vector is a known approach and is already used effectively in domains such as Wall Street for numerical modeling. The key point is that any complex interaction can be represented linearly if the right set of features (including conjunctions or other combinations of original variables) are included in the model.

2. In neural network-based systems like AlphaGo, a complex nonlinear function is learned through many layers, but it becomes linear at the output layer. This implies that if one can engineer the state to represent all necessary interactions prior to the final layer, the final layer can remain linear and still capture the complexities of the system.

3. The approach advocated here is to focus on engineering a state vector that encapsulates all relevant nonlinear interactions within it, so that any subsequent learning or reasoning processes only need to deal with linear functions, simplifying the process and potentially making it more efficient or easier to understand.

4. If one were to attempt to learn a nonlinear map directly without this engineering, the learning process itself would have to discover how to combine features to account for nonlinear interactions within that map.

In essence, the discussion is about whether to engineer the state vector to contain all necessary information (including interaction terms) before applying linear models, or to let a learning system figure out these interactions as part of the learning process. The first approach can potentially lead to more interpretable and computationally efficient models.

Checking Amii/Upper Bound 2023： Insights Into Intelligence, Keynote by Richard S. Sutton.txt
1. Understanding our own intelligence is crucial to creating AI that surpasses human capabilities. We are trying to make ourselves smarter first, using tools like AI as means to enhance our own abilities.

2. There's a debate on whether we need to fully understand AI to create it. Historically, humans have been able to create entities (like children) without fully understanding them, and this might be applicable to AI as well.

3. Open source and open sharing of research and ideas are essential for fundamental research that will have long-term impacts. It allows for continuous improvement and challenges to ideas, which is vital for progress.

4. Intellectual property is often seen as counterproductive by the speaker, as it can be costly, slow things down, and not always protect ideas in a beneficial way.

5. AI is both a revolutionary tool and a natural continuation of humanity's long history of creating and using tools. It represents both dramatic change and a consistent evolution in our relationship with technology.

6. Human behavior and desires will continue to drive the development and application of AI, as we have always shaped our tools to serve our needs and conveniences.

The speaker emphasizes that while AI is transformative, it is also an extension of humanity's innate tendency to adapt and evolve with our creations. The future of AI should be approached with a blend of excitement for the potential changes and recognition of the ongoing human influence in its development and deployment.
