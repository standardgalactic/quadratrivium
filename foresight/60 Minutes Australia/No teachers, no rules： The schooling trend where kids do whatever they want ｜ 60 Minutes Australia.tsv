0	5000	The new approach to education that will have you falling off your chair.
5000	12000	You see, there's no school, no classes, no teachers, no tests, nothing.
12000	15000	The kids do whatever they want, whenever they want.
15000	19000	It's not homeschooling, it's unschooling.
19000	24000	Giving your children control over their own education may sound crazy,
24000	29000	but as Michael Usher discovered, the results are very surprising.
31000	37000	The bell's rung and it's another busy school morning.
37000	46000	Around Australia, classrooms have filled with three and a half million young students.
46000	52000	But for a growing number of children, these scenes are completely foreign.
52000	58000	Children like the Clarks, who are part of an increasing movement called unschooling.
58000	64000	For them, there are no desks, no tests, no books or curriculum.
64000	68000	It's allowing your children to learn naturally through their passions and what they enjoy to do.
68000	70000	But when do they learn to read and write and add up?
70000	72000	Everyday life.
76000	81000	To understand unschooling, take everything you know about education and turn it on its head.
81000	83000	There are no subjects, only life.
83000	89000	The basics like reading, writing and maths come naturally when the kids are ready.
89000	93000	Unschooled children learn what they want, when they want.
93000	96000	It's completely up to them.
99000	103000	It's very much about teaching them how to learn themselves.
103000	107000	So rather than just giving them some facts, teach them how to find those facts
107000	109000	and also how to problem solve.
109000	111000	I love your one-eyed monster.
111000	117000	Unschooling is not homeschooling, where children follow a curriculum and are regularly tested.
117000	124000	Rachel and George Clark have removed their four kids from the education system altogether.
124000	132000	They believe that everyday life can educate their children better than teachers and textbooks.
132000	141000	You've rejected, in a way, the school system that most people think is not only a right but a privilege.
141000	144000	Depends on who you talk to.
144000	150000	Well, I think our education system hasn't changed substantially in a lot of years
150000	152000	and it still suits a lot of children.
152000	157000	They're happy to do what the teachers ask, happy to learn as they're told, in the order they're told.
157000	159000	We learn small bits to get to the bigger bit.
159000	163000	Some kids, like our elders, they want to see the big picture
163000	166000	and then they'll fill in the gaps of the smaller stuff when they need it.
166000	169000	No, no, no, I'm not dying. I am not dying.
169000	176000	Rachel and George first turn to unschooling to help their eldest daughter, Jemima, who has Aspergers.
176000	180000	The Clarks say Jemima thrived when they took her out of school.
180000	183000	So they also withdrew nine-year-old Millie
183000	188000	and their son William has never set foot inside a classroom.
188000	191000	For us it became a real battle at home in terms of trying to get her to school
191000	194000	and then trying to get her to do what the teachers had asked.
194000	203000	And I just watched my daughter go downhill really quickly in terms of her anger, frustration, anxious, just everything.
203000	207000	So eventually I realised the system didn't fit her and I needed to remove her.
207000	209000	The system wanted her to fit in.
209000	210000	Yeah.
210000	211000	And she didn't fit in.
211000	213000	No, she didn't fit that system.
213000	218000	While the Clarks are very much in the middle of their education experiment.
218000	226000	In rural Victoria, the results are in for one unschooling family.
226000	233000	On their farm just outside of Bendigo, the Sing Brothers are coming home to visit Mum Carling.
233000	236000	The former teacher unschooled all five boys
236000	239000	and all have gone on to follow their passion,
239000	245000	which for most has meant tertiary degrees or trades.
245000	249000	When I learned that children naturally have a wonderful love of learning
249000	255000	and they want to find out things for themselves, I simply allowed for that.
255000	258000	The results are quite amazing.
258000	262000	Joel, the oldest, has a PhD in Information Technology
262000	265000	and now works for Internet Giant Google.
265000	270000	30-year-old Dion is a social worker specialising in at-risk teenagers.
270000	276000	Tali is at university studying music, which the youngest Eric also wants to do.
276000	281000	A 19-year-old Liam works with horses as an apprentice fairy.
281000	284000	Of your boys who've gone on to study later,
284000	287000	how have they done that without a school qualification?
287000	293000	For Joel, who's the eldest, he kind of got a bit bored
293000	298000	here at the age of 13 decided he'd like to find something outside of the home to do.
298000	303000	So we applied for him for the next year to do a computing course
303000	307000	and he did that computing course. He found it so boring.
307000	311000	He did that one and the next year's one all in the same year,
311000	314000	then went on to do another course, eventually went through
314000	320000	and finished university younger than any other university student in Bendigo.
320000	324000	We can't let children just pick and choose what they want to eat
324000	328000	nor can we let them pick and choose what they want to learn.
328000	333000	Dr David Zinger is a senior education lecturer at Monash University.
333000	337000	He's concerned with the rise of unschooling in Australia,
337000	343000	which is largely unregulated and outside the control of state education departments.
343000	347000	I think state authorities need to look very carefully at unschooling
347000	352000	because it certainly doesn't meet the needs of accreditation
352000	354000	of parents following a school curriculum.
354000	356000	Because there is no curriculum?
356000	360000	Well, the curriculum is decided by the child
360000	366000	and if the child wants to play all day, then I guess that's what they do.
369000	374000	If there were a global headquarters for this free-range education revolution,
374000	379000	it would be this unassuming home in the woods of New Hampshire in America's northeast.
389000	393000	No, our kids have never been tested. They've never learned from a textbook.
393000	395000	Our life, we're just learning.
395000	397000	It's no different than how you might live or I might live.
397000	400000	I don't say right now, I'm doing math because I'm baking a cake.
400000	404000	That's really not natural. We don't live life like that.
404000	410000	Author and unschooling advocate Dana Martin is the inspiration for me.
410000	412000	Would you make me a plant hanger again?
412000	413000	Sure, yeah.
413000	414000	I could use another one.
414000	419000	She and her husband Joe practice what they call radical unschooling.
419000	421000	Oh, you're going to do a trail of fire to it?
421000	422000	Yeah.
422000	427000	That means therefore kids don't just have total control over what they learn,
427000	430000	whatever they do, and whenever they do it.
433000	435000	Our kids don't have bedtimes.
435000	438000	They don't have any restrictions on any kind of media,
438000	440000	and they can eat what they want when they want.
441000	444000	Now, when somebody first hears that, they tend to think...
444000	446000	What I'm about to say, that just sounds like Carlos.
446000	448000	I know, and most people think that.
448000	451000	If you would have told me that 15 years ago, I would have believed the same thing.
451000	454000	However, they make really good choices for themselves.
454000	456000	Our kids go to bed when they're tired.
456000	458000	They wake up when they're rested.
458000	460000	Freedom and trust are the basis of this life,
460000	463000	but I know it's really hard for most parents.
465000	467000	Yeah, I mean, the kids have total freedom to, you know,
467000	470000	anything from jumping on the trampoline at two in the morning,
470000	472000	to staying up late, you know.
472000	475000	How light do the kids go to bed sometimes?
475000	478000	Yeah, well, I mean, just last night, I basically said,
478000	479000	what do you think, Orion?
479000	480000	Are you ready to go to bed?
480000	482000	And it was 3.05 a.m.
482000	484000	And he said, yeah, I'm tired.
484000	485000	And how old is he?
485000	486000	And he's five.
489000	491000	I do little jobs, you know.
491000	492000	Great.
492000	494000	They may go to bed and get up late,
494000	496000	but a rules-free lifestyle doesn't mean
496000	498000	the Martin kids sit on their hands.
498000	499000	There we go.
499000	500000	Devon, the eldest,
500000	503000	spends much of his time learning practical skills,
503000	506000	like woodwork and blacksmithing.
508000	510000	If I'm interested in woodworking, then I'm going to woodwork.
510000	512000	You know, if I'm interested in a video game,
512000	514000	I'm going to put that video game, you know,
514000	516000	whatever I want to do, I can do.
516000	518000	Have you looked at subjects, though,
518000	520000	like if you went to school, you'd do history,
520000	522000	geography, math, English?
522000	524000	If I wanted to, I would.
524000	526000	I'm learning what I'm doing,
526000	528000	and I'm doing it pretty well, I'd like to think.
528000	532000	And I figured I can learn it almost anything that way.
532000	534000	History would be easy.
534000	536000	I'd just go online and read about it.
536000	537000	So you can learn a lot from online.
537000	539000	You can learn a lot from YouTube, I guess.
539000	541000	Yeah, we call it the University of YouTube,
541000	543000	or YouTube University.
543000	546000	Have you ever thought that you might like to go to school?
546000	548000	I've thought about it a few times for about four seconds,
548000	550000	and I realised, of course not.
550000	553000	Why would I want to leave this life and go to school?
554000	556000	But back in Bendigo,
556000	558000	the experience of the Sing Boys
558000	563000	suggests that unschooling can deliver very mixed results.
563000	567000	So most students in school would learn to read at the age of six.
567000	569000	How old were your kids?
570000	573000	Some of the children have really struggled
573000	575000	with reading in particular,
575000	580000	and so two of them were 11 and 12,
580000	583000	another two were 14,
583000	588000	and Liam at 19 still finds reading quite difficult.
588000	590000	Carlene is the first to admit
590000	593000	that not all her boys have thrived academically
593000	595000	or even achieved basic literacy.
596000	600000	Well, Liam has found a successful career as a farrier.
600000	603000	He still has trouble with the basics.
603000	606000	I've struggled with reading and writing a little bit.
606000	609000	Is that because if you don't find an interest in it, you don't do it?
609000	612000	I don't really think that that's my problem.
612000	614000	I'm not really sure.
614000	617000	I just know that I've always found it really, really difficult
617000	619000	to read and write.
619000	623000	And older brother Dion didn't really learn to write
623000	625000	until he was well into his 20s.
625000	627000	I think I really only learned to write.
627000	631000	Maybe it might be seven years ago when I actually had to.
631000	634000	So up until then I just got out of it
634000	636000	or avoided it in any way that I could.
636000	640000	Did that set you back that you didn't have that basic skill?
640000	644000	No, I just found ways around it, I think.
644000	647000	Learning to read and write is the most difficult thing
647000	649000	that a child will ever learn,
649000	652000	and it's the most important thing that a child will ever learn.
652000	655000	And to be successful in life today,
655000	657000	children need to be literate and numerate,
657000	662000	and children cannot learn to read and write by themselves.
662000	664000	If the boys were in school,
664000	666000	might they have learnt to read earlier
666000	669000	or at least have problems identified earlier?
669000	673000	I don't think they would have learned to read any faster.
673000	676000	And I think what would have occurred is they wouldn't have been able
676000	678000	to become the people that they've become
678000	681000	because they haven't had any of that pressure
681000	683000	to be a certain way
683000	687000	or to learn in a certain manner that other people have learned.
692000	695000	And now another generation of Carlene's family
695000	698000	is keeping away from the classroom.
698000	703000	Joel and his wife, Nicky, have decided to unschool their four children.
704000	706000	One of the things that is brilliant about unschooling
706000	709000	is it means that you can follow the things that you're interested in.
709000	711000	You wouldn't consider structured classroom education
711000	713000	for your children at all.
713000	714000	No.
714000	716000	At this point in time,
716000	719000	this is what I can see has worked,
719000	723000	and the outcome that is provided for Joel and his brothers
723000	725000	is certainly an outcome
725000	727000	that I would be interested in for my children.
729000	730000	Got your pile?
730000	731000	William's got a few, Millie.
731000	733000	I think you're missing a few.
733000	736000	In Toowoomba, the Clark kids have no problem with literacy.
736000	739000	Both Jemima and Millie are avid readers,
739000	742000	and William is gradually picking it up.
742000	744000	William, at the age of six now,
744000	747000	is, mazes me all the stuff in the letters he knows,
747000	749000	and just every day life they learn it.
749000	751000	But you don't push them in front of a book
751000	754000	to learn to read or write or do maths.
754000	755000	No.
755000	757000	No, I do like to encourage them,
757000	758000	especially in my six-year-old,
758000	760000	to do some letters and numbers today,
760000	762000	but that might be just a jigsaw.
763000	766000	One of the things all these families insist
766000	769000	is that unschooling does not mean un-parenting.
769000	771000	It's a hands-on job finding new ways
771000	774000	for their children to learn every day,
774000	777000	and there are no school holidays or breaks.
778000	779000	I've got to say, as a parent
779000	781000	who's happy to send their kids off to school,
781000	784000	it sounds like a lot of hard work what you're doing.
784000	786000	It's a lot easier than school.
786000	788000	We're very much happy to send our kids to school
788000	790000	before it didn't work.
790000	791000	It doesn't work.
791000	792000	I now know so much more.
792000	794000	I think it doesn't work for all children,
794000	796000	and if it's not working and we've got an alternative,
796000	798000	let's do the alternative.
798000	799000	And they're so happy.
799000	800000	They are.
800000	801000	Yeah.
