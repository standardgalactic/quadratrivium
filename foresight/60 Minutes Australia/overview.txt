Checking 60 Minutes Australia/No teachers, no rules： The schooling trend where kids do whatever they want ｜ 60 Minutes Australia.txt
 Carlene, from a previous segment, has children who struggled with reading and writing while in formal schooling. Her sons Liam and Dion, in particular, found literacy difficult, with Liam not learning to write until his late 20s. Despite this, they have found success in their respective trades. Carlene's older brother Dion also didn't learn to write until his early 30s but has found ways to cope without these skills.

Joel and his wife Nicky Clark are unschooling their four children, which means they do not engage in structured classroom education. They believe that unschooling has allowed their children to develop literacy at their own pace, as evidenced by their six-year-old son William's gradual pickup of reading and writing skills through everyday activities and encouragement from his parents.

The Clarks emphasize that unschooling does not mean neglecting education; rather, it involves a hands-on approach to learning, tailored to each child's interests and pace. They find this approach less demanding than traditional schooling, which didn't work for their family.
