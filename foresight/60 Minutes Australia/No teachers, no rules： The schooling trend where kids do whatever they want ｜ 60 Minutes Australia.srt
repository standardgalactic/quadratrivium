1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The new approach to education that will have you falling off your chair.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You see, there's no school, no classes, no teachers, no tests, nothing.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The kids do whatever they want, whenever they want.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not homeschooling, it's unschooling.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Giving your children control over their own education may sound crazy,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but as Michael Usher discovered, the results are very surprising.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The bell's rung and it's another busy school morning.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Around Australia, classrooms have filled with three and a half million young students.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But for a growing number of children, these scenes are completely foreign.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Children like the Clarks, who are part of an increasing movement called unschooling.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For them, there are no desks, no tests, no books or curriculum.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's allowing your children to learn naturally through their passions and what they enjoy to do.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But when do they learn to read and write and add up?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyday life.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
To understand unschooling, take everything you know about education and turn it on its head.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are no subjects, only life.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The basics like reading, writing and maths come naturally when the kids are ready.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Unschooled children learn what they want, when they want.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's completely up to them.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's very much about teaching them how to learn themselves.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So rather than just giving them some facts, teach them how to find those facts

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and also how to problem solve.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I love your one-eyed monster.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Unschooling is not homeschooling, where children follow a curriculum and are regularly tested.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Rachel and George Clark have removed their four kids from the education system altogether.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They believe that everyday life can educate their children better than teachers and textbooks.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You've rejected, in a way, the school system that most people think is not only a right but a privilege.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Depends on who you talk to.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, I think our education system hasn't changed substantially in a lot of years

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and it still suits a lot of children.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They're happy to do what the teachers ask, happy to learn as they're told, in the order they're told.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We learn small bits to get to the bigger bit.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Some kids, like our elders, they want to see the big picture

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and then they'll fill in the gaps of the smaller stuff when they need it.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no, no, I'm not dying. I am not dying.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Rachel and George first turn to unschooling to help their eldest daughter, Jemima, who has Aspergers.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Clarks say Jemima thrived when they took her out of school.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So they also withdrew nine-year-old Millie

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and their son William has never set foot inside a classroom.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
For us it became a real battle at home in terms of trying to get her to school

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and then trying to get her to do what the teachers had asked.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I just watched my daughter go downhill really quickly in terms of her anger, frustration, anxious, just everything.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So eventually I realised the system didn't fit her and I needed to remove her.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The system wanted her to fit in.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And she didn't fit in.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, she didn't fit that system.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
While the Clarks are very much in the middle of their education experiment.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In rural Victoria, the results are in for one unschooling family.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
On their farm just outside of Bendigo, the Sing Brothers are coming home to visit Mum Carling.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The former teacher unschooled all five boys

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and all have gone on to follow their passion,

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
which for most has meant tertiary degrees or trades.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When I learned that children naturally have a wonderful love of learning

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and they want to find out things for themselves, I simply allowed for that.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The results are quite amazing.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Joel, the oldest, has a PhD in Information Technology

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and now works for Internet Giant Google.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
30-year-old Dion is a social worker specialising in at-risk teenagers.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tali is at university studying music, which the youngest Eric also wants to do.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A 19-year-old Liam works with horses as an apprentice fairy.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Of your boys who've gone on to study later,

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
how have they done that without a school qualification?

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For Joel, who's the eldest, he kind of got a bit bored

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
here at the age of 13 decided he'd like to find something outside of the home to do.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So we applied for him for the next year to do a computing course

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and he did that computing course. He found it so boring.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He did that one and the next year's one all in the same year,

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
then went on to do another course, eventually went through

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and finished university younger than any other university student in Bendigo.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We can't let children just pick and choose what they want to eat

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
nor can we let them pick and choose what they want to learn.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Dr David Zinger is a senior education lecturer at Monash University.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He's concerned with the rise of unschooling in Australia,

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which is largely unregulated and outside the control of state education departments.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think state authorities need to look very carefully at unschooling

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because it certainly doesn't meet the needs of accreditation

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
of parents following a school curriculum.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because there is no curriculum?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, the curriculum is decided by the child

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and if the child wants to play all day, then I guess that's what they do.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If there were a global headquarters for this free-range education revolution,

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it would be this unassuming home in the woods of New Hampshire in America's northeast.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, our kids have never been tested. They've never learned from a textbook.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Our life, we're just learning.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's no different than how you might live or I might live.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't say right now, I'm doing math because I'm baking a cake.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's really not natural. We don't live life like that.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Author and unschooling advocate Dana Martin is the inspiration for me.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Would you make me a plant hanger again?

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sure, yeah.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I could use another one.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
She and her husband Joe practice what they call radical unschooling.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, you're going to do a trail of fire to it?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That means therefore kids don't just have total control over what they learn,

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
whatever they do, and whenever they do it.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Our kids don't have bedtimes.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They don't have any restrictions on any kind of media,

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and they can eat what they want when they want.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, when somebody first hears that, they tend to think...

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What I'm about to say, that just sounds like Carlos.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I know, and most people think that.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you would have told me that 15 years ago, I would have believed the same thing.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
However, they make really good choices for themselves.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Our kids go to bed when they're tired.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They wake up when they're rested.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Freedom and trust are the basis of this life,

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but I know it's really hard for most parents.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, I mean, the kids have total freedom to, you know,

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
anything from jumping on the trampoline at two in the morning,

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to staying up late, you know.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How light do the kids go to bed sometimes?

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, well, I mean, just last night, I basically said,

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
what do you think, Orion?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you ready to go to bed?

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it was 3.05 a.m.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And he said, yeah, I'm tired.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And how old is he?

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And he's five.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I do little jobs, you know.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Great.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They may go to bed and get up late,

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but a rules-free lifestyle doesn't mean

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the Martin kids sit on their hands.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There we go.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Devon, the eldest,

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
spends much of his time learning practical skills,

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
like woodwork and blacksmithing.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If I'm interested in woodworking, then I'm going to woodwork.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You know, if I'm interested in a video game,

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to put that video game, you know,

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
whatever I want to do, I can do.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Have you looked at subjects, though,

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like if you went to school, you'd do history,

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
geography, math, English?

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If I wanted to, I would.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm learning what I'm doing,

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and I'm doing it pretty well, I'd like to think.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I figured I can learn it almost anything that way.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
History would be easy.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'd just go online and read about it.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you can learn a lot from online.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can learn a lot from YouTube, I guess.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, we call it the University of YouTube,

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
or YouTube University.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Have you ever thought that you might like to go to school?

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've thought about it a few times for about four seconds,

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and I realised, of course not.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why would I want to leave this life and go to school?

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But back in Bendigo,

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the experience of the Sing Boys

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
suggests that unschooling can deliver very mixed results.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So most students in school would learn to read at the age of six.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
How old were your kids?

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Some of the children have really struggled

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
with reading in particular,

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and so two of them were 11 and 12,

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
another two were 14,

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and Liam at 19 still finds reading quite difficult.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Carlene is the first to admit

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that not all her boys have thrived academically

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
or even achieved basic literacy.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, Liam has found a successful career as a farrier.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He still has trouble with the basics.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've struggled with reading and writing a little bit.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is that because if you don't find an interest in it, you don't do it?

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't really think that that's my problem.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not really sure.

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I just know that I've always found it really, really difficult

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to read and write.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And older brother Dion didn't really learn to write

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
until he was well into his 20s.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think I really only learned to write.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Maybe it might be seven years ago when I actually had to.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So up until then I just got out of it

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
or avoided it in any way that I could.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Did that set you back that you didn't have that basic skill?

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, I just found ways around it, I think.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Learning to read and write is the most difficult thing

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
that a child will ever learn,

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and it's the most important thing that a child will ever learn.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And to be successful in life today,

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
children need to be literate and numerate,

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and children cannot learn to read and write by themselves.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If the boys were in school,

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
might they have learnt to read earlier

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
or at least have problems identified earlier?

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't think they would have learned to read any faster.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I think what would have occurred is they wouldn't have been able

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to become the people that they've become

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
because they haven't had any of that pressure

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to be a certain way

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
or to learn in a certain manner that other people have learned.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And now another generation of Carlene's family

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is keeping away from the classroom.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Joel and his wife, Nicky, have decided to unschool their four children.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One of the things that is brilliant about unschooling

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
is it means that you can follow the things that you're interested in.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You wouldn't consider structured classroom education

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for your children at all.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
At this point in time,

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
this is what I can see has worked,

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and the outcome that is provided for Joel and his brothers

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is certainly an outcome

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that I would be interested in for my children.

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Got your pile?

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
William's got a few, Millie.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think you're missing a few.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In Toowoomba, the Clark kids have no problem with literacy.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Both Jemima and Millie are avid readers,

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and William is gradually picking it up.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
William, at the age of six now,

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is, mazes me all the stuff in the letters he knows,

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and just every day life they learn it.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But you don't push them in front of a book

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
to learn to read or write or do maths.

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, I do like to encourage them,

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
especially in my six-year-old,

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to do some letters and numbers today,

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but that might be just a jigsaw.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
One of the things all these families insist

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
is that unschooling does not mean un-parenting.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a hands-on job finding new ways

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
for their children to learn every day,

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and there are no school holidays or breaks.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've got to say, as a parent

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
who's happy to send their kids off to school,

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
it sounds like a lot of hard work what you're doing.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's a lot easier than school.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We're very much happy to send our kids to school

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
before it didn't work.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It doesn't work.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I now know so much more.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think it doesn't work for all children,

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and if it's not working and we've got an alternative,

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
let's do the alternative.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And they're so happy.

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They are.

242
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
