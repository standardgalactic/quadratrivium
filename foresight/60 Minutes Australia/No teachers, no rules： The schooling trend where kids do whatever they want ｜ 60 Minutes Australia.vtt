00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The new approach to education that will have you falling off your chair.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
You see, there's no school, no classes, no teachers, no tests, nothing.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
The kids do whatever they want, whenever they want.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
It's not homeschooling, it's unschooling.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Giving your children control over their own education may sound crazy,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
but as Michael Usher discovered, the results are very surprising.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
The bell's rung and it's another busy school morning.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
Around Australia, classrooms have filled with three and a half million young students.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
But for a growing number of children, these scenes are completely foreign.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Children like the Clarks, who are part of an increasing movement called unschooling.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
For them, there are no desks, no tests, no books or curriculum.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
It's allowing your children to learn naturally through their passions and what they enjoy to do.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
But when do they learn to read and write and add up?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Everyday life.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
To understand unschooling, take everything you know about education and turn it on its head.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
There are no subjects, only life.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
The basics like reading, writing and maths come naturally when the kids are ready.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Unschooled children learn what they want, when they want.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It's completely up to them.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
It's very much about teaching them how to learn themselves.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
So rather than just giving them some facts, teach them how to find those facts

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
and also how to problem solve.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I love your one-eyed monster.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Unschooling is not homeschooling, where children follow a curriculum and are regularly tested.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
Rachel and George Clark have removed their four kids from the education system altogether.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
They believe that everyday life can educate their children better than teachers and textbooks.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
You've rejected, in a way, the school system that most people think is not only a right but a privilege.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Depends on who you talk to.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, I think our education system hasn't changed substantially in a lot of years

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
and it still suits a lot of children.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
They're happy to do what the teachers ask, happy to learn as they're told, in the order they're told.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We learn small bits to get to the bigger bit.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Some kids, like our elders, they want to see the big picture

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and then they'll fill in the gaps of the smaller stuff when they need it.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
No, no, no, I'm not dying. I am not dying.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
Rachel and George first turn to unschooling to help their eldest daughter, Jemima, who has Aspergers.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
The Clarks say Jemima thrived when they took her out of school.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
So they also withdrew nine-year-old Millie

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
and their son William has never set foot inside a classroom.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
For us it became a real battle at home in terms of trying to get her to school

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
and then trying to get her to do what the teachers had asked.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
And I just watched my daughter go downhill really quickly in terms of her anger, frustration, anxious, just everything.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
So eventually I realised the system didn't fit her and I needed to remove her.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
The system wanted her to fit in.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
And she didn't fit in.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
No, she didn't fit that system.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
While the Clarks are very much in the middle of their education experiment.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
In rural Victoria, the results are in for one unschooling family.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
On their farm just outside of Bendigo, the Sing Brothers are coming home to visit Mum Carling.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
The former teacher unschooled all five boys

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
and all have gone on to follow their passion,

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
which for most has meant tertiary degrees or trades.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
When I learned that children naturally have a wonderful love of learning

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
and they want to find out things for themselves, I simply allowed for that.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
The results are quite amazing.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Joel, the oldest, has a PhD in Information Technology

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
and now works for Internet Giant Google.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
30-year-old Dion is a social worker specialising in at-risk teenagers.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Tali is at university studying music, which the youngest Eric also wants to do.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
A 19-year-old Liam works with horses as an apprentice fairy.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Of your boys who've gone on to study later,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
how have they done that without a school qualification?

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
For Joel, who's the eldest, he kind of got a bit bored

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
here at the age of 13 decided he'd like to find something outside of the home to do.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
So we applied for him for the next year to do a computing course

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
and he did that computing course. He found it so boring.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
He did that one and the next year's one all in the same year,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
then went on to do another course, eventually went through

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
and finished university younger than any other university student in Bendigo.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
We can't let children just pick and choose what they want to eat

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
nor can we let them pick and choose what they want to learn.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Dr David Zinger is a senior education lecturer at Monash University.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
He's concerned with the rise of unschooling in Australia,

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
which is largely unregulated and outside the control of state education departments.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I think state authorities need to look very carefully at unschooling

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
because it certainly doesn't meet the needs of accreditation

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
of parents following a school curriculum.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Because there is no curriculum?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, the curriculum is decided by the child

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
and if the child wants to play all day, then I guess that's what they do.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
If there were a global headquarters for this free-range education revolution,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
it would be this unassuming home in the woods of New Hampshire in America's northeast.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
No, our kids have never been tested. They've never learned from a textbook.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Our life, we're just learning.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
It's no different than how you might live or I might live.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't say right now, I'm doing math because I'm baking a cake.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
That's really not natural. We don't live life like that.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Author and unschooling advocate Dana Martin is the inspiration for me.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Would you make me a plant hanger again?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Sure, yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I could use another one.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
She and her husband Joe practice what they call radical unschooling.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh, you're going to do a trail of fire to it?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
That means therefore kids don't just have total control over what they learn,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
whatever they do, and whenever they do it.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Our kids don't have bedtimes.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
They don't have any restrictions on any kind of media,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
and they can eat what they want when they want.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Now, when somebody first hears that, they tend to think...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
What I'm about to say, that just sounds like Carlos.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I know, and most people think that.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
If you would have told me that 15 years ago, I would have believed the same thing.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
However, they make really good choices for themselves.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Our kids go to bed when they're tired.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
They wake up when they're rested.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Freedom and trust are the basis of this life,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
but I know it's really hard for most parents.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, I mean, the kids have total freedom to, you know,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
anything from jumping on the trampoline at two in the morning,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
to staying up late, you know.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
How light do the kids go to bed sometimes?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, well, I mean, just last night, I basically said,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
what do you think, Orion?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Are you ready to go to bed?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And it was 3.05 a.m.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And he said, yeah, I'm tired.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
And how old is he?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
And he's five.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I do little jobs, you know.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Great.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They may go to bed and get up late,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
but a rules-free lifestyle doesn't mean

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
the Martin kids sit on their hands.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
There we go.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Devon, the eldest,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
spends much of his time learning practical skills,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
like woodwork and blacksmithing.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
If I'm interested in woodworking, then I'm going to woodwork.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You know, if I'm interested in a video game,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm going to put that video game, you know,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
whatever I want to do, I can do.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Have you looked at subjects, though,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
like if you went to school, you'd do history,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
geography, math, English?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
If I wanted to, I would.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I'm learning what I'm doing,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and I'm doing it pretty well, I'd like to think.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
And I figured I can learn it almost anything that way.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
History would be easy.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'd just go online and read about it.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So you can learn a lot from online.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You can learn a lot from YouTube, I guess.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah, we call it the University of YouTube,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
or YouTube University.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Have you ever thought that you might like to go to school?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I've thought about it a few times for about four seconds,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and I realised, of course not.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Why would I want to leave this life and go to school?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But back in Bendigo,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
the experience of the Sing Boys

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
suggests that unschooling can deliver very mixed results.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
So most students in school would learn to read at the age of six.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
How old were your kids?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Some of the children have really struggled

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
with reading in particular,

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
and so two of them were 11 and 12,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
another two were 14,

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
and Liam at 19 still finds reading quite difficult.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Carlene is the first to admit

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
that not all her boys have thrived academically

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
or even achieved basic literacy.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, Liam has found a successful career as a farrier.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
He still has trouble with the basics.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I've struggled with reading and writing a little bit.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Is that because if you don't find an interest in it, you don't do it?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't really think that that's my problem.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm not really sure.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I just know that I've always found it really, really difficult

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
to read and write.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
And older brother Dion didn't really learn to write

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
until he was well into his 20s.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I think I really only learned to write.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Maybe it might be seven years ago when I actually had to.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
So up until then I just got out of it

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
or avoided it in any way that I could.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Did that set you back that you didn't have that basic skill?

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
No, I just found ways around it, I think.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Learning to read and write is the most difficult thing

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
that a child will ever learn,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
and it's the most important thing that a child will ever learn.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
And to be successful in life today,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
children need to be literate and numerate,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
and children cannot learn to read and write by themselves.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
If the boys were in school,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
might they have learnt to read earlier

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
or at least have problems identified earlier?

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I don't think they would have learned to read any faster.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
And I think what would have occurred is they wouldn't have been able

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
to become the people that they've become

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
because they haven't had any of that pressure

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
to be a certain way

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
or to learn in a certain manner that other people have learned.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
And now another generation of Carlene's family

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
is keeping away from the classroom.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Joel and his wife, Nicky, have decided to unschool their four children.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
One of the things that is brilliant about unschooling

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
is it means that you can follow the things that you're interested in.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You wouldn't consider structured classroom education

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
for your children at all.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
No.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
At this point in time,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
this is what I can see has worked,

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
and the outcome that is provided for Joel and his brothers

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
is certainly an outcome

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
that I would be interested in for my children.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Got your pile?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
William's got a few, Millie.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I think you're missing a few.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
In Toowoomba, the Clark kids have no problem with literacy.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Both Jemima and Millie are avid readers,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and William is gradually picking it up.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
William, at the age of six now,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
is, mazes me all the stuff in the letters he knows,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and just every day life they learn it.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
But you don't push them in front of a book

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
to learn to read or write or do maths.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
No, I do like to encourage them,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
especially in my six-year-old,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
to do some letters and numbers today,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
but that might be just a jigsaw.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
One of the things all these families insist

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
is that unschooling does not mean un-parenting.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It's a hands-on job finding new ways

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
for their children to learn every day,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and there are no school holidays or breaks.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I've got to say, as a parent

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
who's happy to send their kids off to school,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
it sounds like a lot of hard work what you're doing.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It's a lot easier than school.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
We're very much happy to send our kids to school

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
before it didn't work.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
It doesn't work.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I now know so much more.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I think it doesn't work for all children,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and if it's not working and we've got an alternative,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
let's do the alternative.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
And they're so happy.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
They are.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
