0	10000	Hyperbolic space is so cool, but if you've ever seen any kind of visualization, odds are it was this, or this, or oh god the worst one, please stop using this one.
10000	18000	But none of these really gave me a feeling of what it's like to live in a curved space, and that was the reason I started Hyperbolic-a.
18000	23000	So I've come up with what I think is the easiest way to understand Hyperbolic space.
24000	31000	Let's start off with Euclidean in spherical spaces in two dimensions, and then Hyperbolic space in three dimensions come naturally later.
31000	38000	So here's just a regular flatland 2D Euclidean plane that goes on in every direction and has no curvature.
38000	43000	But if we add some positive curvature, we get a spherical shell.
43000	49000	This is not a solid ball, there's no inside or outside, just an infinitely thin two-dimensional shell.
49000	55000	We're only looking at it in 3D because we are higher-dimensional beings looking down at the flatlanders.
55000	63000	You might think this is really similar to us living on the surface of Earth, but there's actually a big difference, and it has to do with light and lines.
63000	67000	Think about light bending around the curved space of a black hole.
67000	73000	Light always travels in the shortest path in a straight line, it's just that the space itself is curved.
73000	82000	So if the Earth actually had a spherical spacetime, then looking out at the horizon, the light you see would actually travel all the way around the Earth.
82000	86000	In fact, there wouldn't be a horizon anymore. Things would be a lot weirder.
86000	89000	Another way to think about curvature is with tiling.
89000	93000	There's only three ways to tile the Euclidean plane with regular polygons.
93000	99000	Four squares at a vertex, six triangles at a vertex, or three hexagons at a vertex.
99000	107000	If you were to say, try pentagons, you'd find that there's not enough space for four and too much gap for three.
107000	113000	But those gaps could get filled with spherical curvature, and you have the familiar dodecahedron.
116000	119000	We can also do three squares around each vertex.
123000	125000	Three triangles.
129000	131000	Four triangles.
134000	136000	Or five triangles.
139000	143000	And just a reminder, all these edges are straight lines.
143000	147000	Everything lives on that two-dimensional shell, and there's no third dimension to curve into.
147000	150000	We're only using it to help visualize the space.
150000	153000	So now let's move on to hyperbolic space.
153000	158000	The theme you'll see for the rest of the video is that for everything weird about spherical geometry,
158000	161000	the opposite is true for hyperbolic geometry.
161000	167000	For example, you just saw that we could have fewer squares around each vertex compared to Euclidean space.
167000	170000	So in hyperbolic space, we can have more.
170000	173000	But how could you cram in another square?
173000	178000	Well, maybe we can do the same trick as the sphere and just bring it out into the third dimension.
178000	181000	We can, and here's how it looks.
181000	185000	This is hyperbolic crochet, courtesy of Mrs. Parade.
185000	188000	You can see how five squares meet at every vertex now.
188000	192000	But it's still hard to visualize everything even with a 3D model,
192000	197000	because if you try to flatten it in one area, everywhere else starts curving.
197000	204000	It's impossible to see it all at once, and it gets even worse as we look at bigger and bigger pieces of the hyperbolic plane.
204000	209000	Though it does give you a sense of how much larger hyperbolic space is compared to Euclidean.
209000	216000	And don't forget, these are all still two-dimensional geometries that we're using in extra dimension to help visualize.
216000	223000	If we want to go up to 3D spaces, then good luck trying to visualize the 3D surface of a 4D hypersphere,
223000	226000	or whatever this mess would look like in four dimensions.
226000	232000	In order to make any sense of things at this point, we're going to need a different way to visualize the hyperbolic plane.
232000	235000	The trick we're going to use is projection.
235000	241000	You're probably familiar with 3D projection, that is taking a 3D object and projecting it to your eyeball or a screen.
241000	249000	After all, you're looking at this cube on your 2D screen, but you still perceive it as 3D, even though we've completely distorted it.
249000	253000	I mean, this is supposed to be a square, but look at all these angles.
253000	255000	Is the cube warped? Of course not.
255000	261000	It's just that projected angles and distances can change depending on where you look at it from, and what projection you use.
261000	266000	Similarly, we can project a curved geometry to a flat one, or vice versa.
266000	273000	You're probably familiar with the Mercader projection for a sphere, but as you can tell, it introduces distortions.
273000	279000	Greenland and Africa look about the same size here, but Africa is actually 14 times larger.
279000	285000	Unfortunately, it's impossible to map a sphere to a plane without introducing distortion,
285000	293000	and that's why there's hundreds of different projections, because either distances, angles, areas, or shapes will get distorted,
293000	296000	and which compromise you want depends on the application.
296000	302000	I'm going to be focusing on a very useful type of projection, stereographic projection.
302000	316000	I'm not going to go into too much detail on this, because Henry Segerman already has a great video
316000	322000	that shows how all these projections work on the spherical and hyperbolic planes using just light and shadows.
322000	325000	It's super cool, so definitely check out that video.
325000	328000	Also, I want to thank Henry because he's been a huge help with hyperbolic.
328000	336000	I really don't think I could have done it without him, and his YouTube channel is totally underrated, so go subscribe if you like things like this.
336000	344000	Okay, now that we have a better way to visualize spherical and hyperbolic space, we can start making some sense of its weird properties.
344000	353000	But first, I have to talk about parallel lines. They don't exist in spherical space.
353000	362000	Any pair of straight lines will always converge and intersect eventually, so the whole concept of two things being parallel is not a global property anymore.
362000	366000	It's a local phenomena that only exists at a point on the line.
366000	370000	And remember how everything hyperbolic is the opposite of spherical?
370000	374000	Well, in hyperbolic space, lines will always diverge.
374000	378000	Remember, both of these are straight lines, just like how this is actually a square.
378000	381000	It just depends on what angle you're looking at it from.
381000	386000	So walking over to the other line will shift the perspective to see it was straight the whole time.
386000	390000	Speaking of walking, let's take a walk on the sphere.
390000	396000	Let's walk up one tile, right one tile, and then down one tile.
396000	401000	We're back where we started, and we just walked around a triangle with three right angles.
401000	409000	In Euclidean space, a triangle's angles have to sum to 180 degrees, but in spherical space, it's always larger.
409000	413000	But did you notice that something else weird happened?
413000	416000	We walked around without ever changing our view direction.
416000	421000	But when we came back to the starting point, everything's been rotated 90 degrees to the left.
421000	426000	This is called halonomy, and it's something you don't experience in Euclidean geometry.
426000	434000	Basically, as you move around the space, you accumulate extra rotation, even if you never change the direction you're facing.
434000	437000	So take a guess what happens on a hyperbolic walk.
437000	450000	We'll walk up one tile, right one tile, down one tile, left one tile, and finally up one more time.
450000	453000	Now we've walked on a pentagon with five right angles.
453000	457000	This time, the sum is less than you would expect for a Euclidean pentagon,
457000	462000	because polygon angles have a smaller sum in hyperbolic space than Euclidean.
462000	468000	And we have the same halonomy effect, but this time rotated in the opposite direction.
468000	471000	One last effect I want to talk about is a physical one.
471000	478000	In the real world, objects are made up of smaller particles, and when an object moves, all of its particles move as well.
478000	487000	But remember, there's no parallel lines in curved space, so an object's particles can't actually all move in the same direction.
487000	494000	In spherical geometry, this means you'd experience a sort of squishing tidal force as you try to move through space.
494000	500000	This is very similar to spaghettification around a black hole, which is also caused by curved space.
500000	505000	And in hyperbolic space, objects experience a stretching tidal force as they move.
505000	511000	With enough speed and curvature, hitting a hyperbolic baseball could actually rip it apart.
511000	517000	Okay, let's switch over to some formulas. How would a curved space affect the circumference of a circle?
517000	523000	It's 2 pi r in Euclidean space, but it's pi sine r in spherical space.
523000	529000	It should kind of make sense why this is true. As the radius gets larger, it reaches a maximum circumference,
529000	534000	then shrinks down to zero, and repeats cyclically.
534000	537000	Want to guess what the hyperbolic opposite is?
537000	543000	It's hyperbolic sine, of course, and this is another really good example of just how large hyperbolic space is,
543000	546000	because this is basically an exponential here.
546000	552000	That means it could take a million times longer to walk around a circle than it would to just walk across it.
552000	556000	The area of a circle also has similar formulas.
556000	563000	Again, area is exponential for hyperbolic space, but interestingly, it grows at the same rate as the circumference,
563000	566000	unlike Euclidean space where it grows as the square.
566000	572000	The Pythagorean formula also has really beautiful analogs in curved space.
572000	577000	And finally, this was one of the coolest formulas, and there's no Euclidean version of it.
577000	582000	In a unit curved space, you can find the area of any triangle given only its angles.
582000	589000	And the formula is so simple. For spherical space, it's just the sum of the angles minus pi. That's it.
589000	595000	In hyperbolic space, it's pi minus the sum of the angles. Isn't that neat?
595000	601000	And there's a good insight from this formula. Since the sum is always less than 180 degrees in hyperbolic space,
601000	610000	it means there's actually a maximum possible area a triangle can have, and that's when all the angles are 0 degrees, and the area is pi.
610000	618000	It happens because all lines eventually diverge, so if you tried to make the triangle any larger, the edges would never be able to intersect at a vertex.
619000	623000	So I hope that's given all of you a little better understanding of curved spaces.
623000	631000	In the next video, I'm going to talk more about three-dimensional spaces, how I'm able to render them in unity, and some of the really cool math behind it.
631000	637000	If you want to build even more intuition about hyperbolic space in the meantime, there's also hyperrogue.
637000	643000	It's one of the only other hyperbolic games out there right now, and it's worth checking out. Link is in the description.
643000	647000	So thanks for coming on this journey, and stay hyperbolic.
648000	653000	I'll see you next time.
