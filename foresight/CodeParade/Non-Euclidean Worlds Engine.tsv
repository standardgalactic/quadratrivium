0	3520	I've been working on a rendering engine for non-Euclidean worlds.
3520	7140	It's a little tricky to explain, so I'll just show you some of the things you can
7140	10040	do before I go into how it works.
10040	11920	First example is this tunnel.
11920	27480	You can see it's really long from the outside, but it's actually really short on the inside.
27480	29500	And then this tunnel is the opposite.
29500	36460	It appears short, but it takes a long time to travel through it.
36460	42460	The shortest path between two points is not necessarily a straight line anymore.
42460	44500	Here's another example of a house.
44500	57980	See if you notice anything suspicious as I walk through it.
57980	59480	Did you catch it?
59480	65080	This four room house actually only has three rooms, red, green, and blue.
65080	69080	This tunnel surprised me a lot because I originally thought it would be super jarring, but actually
69080	73480	everyone I show this to doesn't notice it at all unless I tell them something is off.
73480	76240	I guess our brains just aren't used to thinking this way.
76240	79200	Here's the same house, but with the opposite twist.
79200	83800	There's actually six rooms in this house, and in fact I could cram an infinite amount
83800	97680	of space into any finite space.
97680	98680	Here's another room.
98680	103000	There's just a pillar on one side, and an object on the other.
103000	107440	But if we walk around the pillar, we actually end up in another room.
107440	113720	The object isn't changing, we're actually in another unique space.
113720	122080	If I walk around again, we enter a third room, and this cycle repeats clockwise and counterclockwise.
122080	129320	And notice how you can see both objects at once.
129320	130320	This is a weird one.
130320	135400	We're on a hill that sloped up, but to get up the hill, we can go down the tunnel and
135400	145440	end up on top.
145440	149920	It's also an example of your grandpa's stories about walking uphill both ways.
149920	158840	Maybe he just lived in an onuclidean plane of existence.
158840	160880	Here's where things get really interesting.
160880	168960	We've got a tunnel that's too small to pass through, but as I walk through this tunnel,
168960	174080	my scale also changes.
174080	190080	Still not small enough to get through, but if I go around one more time, I can finally
190200	192320	fit through.
192320	196520	I can go the other way around too to keep getting bigger, but eventually I won't be
196520	199280	able to fit into the tunnel anymore.
199280	200880	So how does all this work?
200880	206000	Well, it's basically the same as the game Portal, but the portals have no seams, and
206000	208000	there's often more than two of them.
208000	211320	There are several surfaces that are actually solid geometry.
211320	215960	It's just that I draw a texture on top of it that's actually a virtual camera rendering
215960	218640	what it would have seemed from that perspective.
218720	222240	When you walk through it, it teleports you seamlessly to where you're supposed to end
222240	224640	up and the illusion is complete.
224640	226840	The rendering is a lot harder than it sounds, though.
226840	231080	Each surface has to recursively render surfaces behind it, conditionally, depending on if
231080	234360	it's occluded or not, from each perspective.
234360	238360	I originally was trying to do this in Unity, but I'm pretty sure it's impossible without
238360	240640	lower level access to the rendering.
240640	243040	Even the scriptable pipeline didn't work for me.
243040	246840	So I was forced to create my own rendering engine in OpenGL.
246840	248600	How do I keep writing engines?
248600	253320	Anyway, the last thing I wanted to talk about are the use cases.
253320	258080	Other than just for puzzle games, this is actually incredibly useful for virtual reality.
258080	263520	You see, normally for room scale VR, you're limited to a small area to walk around in.
263520	268640	You can't really explore larger open worlds without breaking the illusion, like teleporting.
268640	272720	But this engine can compress entire levels to fit into a single room.
272720	277160	Here I have a single 20 foot by 20 foot room that you can walk around in and explore, but
277160	279840	it actually contains a volume 4 times larger.
279840	284600	And although I haven't actually tested this in VR, I'm entirely convinced that this illusion
284600	287160	feels just as real as playing from a screen.
287160	291280	I've uploaded the source and executable to GitHub, so if you're curious, you can try
291280	292720	out this demo.
292720	294880	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you all next time.
