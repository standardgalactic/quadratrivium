1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hyperbolic space is so cool, but if you've ever seen any kind of visualization, odds are it was this, or this, or oh god the worst one, please stop using this one.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But none of these really gave me a feeling of what it's like to live in a curved space, and that was the reason I started Hyperbolic-a.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So I've come up with what I think is the easiest way to understand Hyperbolic space.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's start off with Euclidean in spherical spaces in two dimensions, and then Hyperbolic space in three dimensions come naturally later.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So here's just a regular flatland 2D Euclidean plane that goes on in every direction and has no curvature.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But if we add some positive curvature, we get a spherical shell.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is not a solid ball, there's no inside or outside, just an infinitely thin two-dimensional shell.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're only looking at it in 3D because we are higher-dimensional beings looking down at the flatlanders.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You might think this is really similar to us living on the surface of Earth, but there's actually a big difference, and it has to do with light and lines.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Think about light bending around the curved space of a black hole.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Light always travels in the shortest path in a straight line, it's just that the space itself is curved.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So if the Earth actually had a spherical spacetime, then looking out at the horizon, the light you see would actually travel all the way around the Earth.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In fact, there wouldn't be a horizon anymore. Things would be a lot weirder.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Another way to think about curvature is with tiling.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's only three ways to tile the Euclidean plane with regular polygons.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Four squares at a vertex, six triangles at a vertex, or three hexagons at a vertex.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you were to say, try pentagons, you'd find that there's not enough space for four and too much gap for three.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But those gaps could get filled with spherical curvature, and you have the familiar dodecahedron.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We can also do three squares around each vertex.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Three triangles.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Four triangles.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or five triangles.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And just a reminder, all these edges are straight lines.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Everything lives on that two-dimensional shell, and there's no third dimension to curve into.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're only using it to help visualize the space.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So now let's move on to hyperbolic space.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The theme you'll see for the rest of the video is that for everything weird about spherical geometry,

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the opposite is true for hyperbolic geometry.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
For example, you just saw that we could have fewer squares around each vertex compared to Euclidean space.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So in hyperbolic space, we can have more.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But how could you cram in another square?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, maybe we can do the same trick as the sphere and just bring it out into the third dimension.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We can, and here's how it looks.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is hyperbolic crochet, courtesy of Mrs. Parade.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can see how five squares meet at every vertex now.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But it's still hard to visualize everything even with a 3D model,

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
because if you try to flatten it in one area, everywhere else starts curving.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's impossible to see it all at once, and it gets even worse as we look at bigger and bigger pieces of the hyperbolic plane.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Though it does give you a sense of how much larger hyperbolic space is compared to Euclidean.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And don't forget, these are all still two-dimensional geometries that we're using in extra dimension to help visualize.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If we want to go up to 3D spaces, then good luck trying to visualize the 3D surface of a 4D hypersphere,

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
or whatever this mess would look like in four dimensions.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In order to make any sense of things at this point, we're going to need a different way to visualize the hyperbolic plane.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The trick we're going to use is projection.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're probably familiar with 3D projection, that is taking a 3D object and projecting it to your eyeball or a screen.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After all, you're looking at this cube on your 2D screen, but you still perceive it as 3D, even though we've completely distorted it.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I mean, this is supposed to be a square, but look at all these angles.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is the cube warped? Of course not.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's just that projected angles and distances can change depending on where you look at it from, and what projection you use.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Similarly, we can project a curved geometry to a flat one, or vice versa.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're probably familiar with the Mercader projection for a sphere, but as you can tell, it introduces distortions.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Greenland and Africa look about the same size here, but Africa is actually 14 times larger.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Unfortunately, it's impossible to map a sphere to a plane without introducing distortion,

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and that's why there's hundreds of different projections, because either distances, angles, areas, or shapes will get distorted,

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and which compromise you want depends on the application.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to be focusing on a very useful type of projection, stereographic projection.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not going to go into too much detail on this, because Henry Segerman already has a great video

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that shows how all these projections work on the spherical and hyperbolic planes using just light and shadows.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's super cool, so definitely check out that video.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Also, I want to thank Henry because he's been a huge help with hyperbolic.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I really don't think I could have done it without him, and his YouTube channel is totally underrated, so go subscribe if you like things like this.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, now that we have a better way to visualize spherical and hyperbolic space, we can start making some sense of its weird properties.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But first, I have to talk about parallel lines. They don't exist in spherical space.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Any pair of straight lines will always converge and intersect eventually, so the whole concept of two things being parallel is not a global property anymore.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a local phenomena that only exists at a point on the line.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And remember how everything hyperbolic is the opposite of spherical?

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, in hyperbolic space, lines will always diverge.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Remember, both of these are straight lines, just like how this is actually a square.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It just depends on what angle you're looking at it from.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So walking over to the other line will shift the perspective to see it was straight the whole time.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Speaking of walking, let's take a walk on the sphere.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's walk up one tile, right one tile, and then down one tile.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We're back where we started, and we just walked around a triangle with three right angles.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In Euclidean space, a triangle's angles have to sum to 180 degrees, but in spherical space, it's always larger.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But did you notice that something else weird happened?

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We walked around without ever changing our view direction.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But when we came back to the starting point, everything's been rotated 90 degrees to the left.

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is called halonomy, and it's something you don't experience in Euclidean geometry.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Basically, as you move around the space, you accumulate extra rotation, even if you never change the direction you're facing.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So take a guess what happens on a hyperbolic walk.

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We'll walk up one tile, right one tile, down one tile, left one tile, and finally up one more time.

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now we've walked on a pentagon with five right angles.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This time, the sum is less than you would expect for a Euclidean pentagon,

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because polygon angles have a smaller sum in hyperbolic space than Euclidean.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And we have the same halonomy effect, but this time rotated in the opposite direction.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
One last effect I want to talk about is a physical one.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In the real world, objects are made up of smaller particles, and when an object moves, all of its particles move as well.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But remember, there's no parallel lines in curved space, so an object's particles can't actually all move in the same direction.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
In spherical geometry, this means you'd experience a sort of squishing tidal force as you try to move through space.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is very similar to spaghettification around a black hole, which is also caused by curved space.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And in hyperbolic space, objects experience a stretching tidal force as they move.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
With enough speed and curvature, hitting a hyperbolic baseball could actually rip it apart.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, let's switch over to some formulas. How would a curved space affect the circumference of a circle?

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's 2 pi r in Euclidean space, but it's pi sine r in spherical space.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It should kind of make sense why this is true. As the radius gets larger, it reaches a maximum circumference,

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
then shrinks down to zero, and repeats cyclically.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Want to guess what the hyperbolic opposite is?

98
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's hyperbolic sine, of course, and this is another really good example of just how large hyperbolic space is,

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because this is basically an exponential here.

100
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That means it could take a million times longer to walk around a circle than it would to just walk across it.

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The area of a circle also has similar formulas.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Again, area is exponential for hyperbolic space, but interestingly, it grows at the same rate as the circumference,

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
unlike Euclidean space where it grows as the square.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The Pythagorean formula also has really beautiful analogs in curved space.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And finally, this was one of the coolest formulas, and there's no Euclidean version of it.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In a unit curved space, you can find the area of any triangle given only its angles.

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the formula is so simple. For spherical space, it's just the sum of the angles minus pi. That's it.

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
In hyperbolic space, it's pi minus the sum of the angles. Isn't that neat?

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And there's a good insight from this formula. Since the sum is always less than 180 degrees in hyperbolic space,

110
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
it means there's actually a maximum possible area a triangle can have, and that's when all the angles are 0 degrees, and the area is pi.

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It happens because all lines eventually diverge, so if you tried to make the triangle any larger, the edges would never be able to intersect at a vertex.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I hope that's given all of you a little better understanding of curved spaces.

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In the next video, I'm going to talk more about three-dimensional spaces, how I'm able to render them in unity, and some of the really cool math behind it.

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you want to build even more intuition about hyperbolic space in the meantime, there's also hyperrogue.

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's one of the only other hyperbolic games out there right now, and it's worth checking out. Link is in the description.

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So thanks for coming on this journey, and stay hyperbolic.

117
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll see you next time.
