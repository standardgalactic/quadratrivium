1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Okay, it's no small thing to go last at a conference such as this, and one might hope

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,520
of the final presentation that it says something of what this all comes to in some deep and

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
abiding sense.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,400
Of course, that's going to be very difficult because we've been wrestling with a lot of

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,440
different confers being's work over the last couple of days, and nevertheless, I'm going

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,160
to try to do so and I hope compelling an interesting way, and we're going to see what happens.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,760
So let me frame the discussion first.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,840
What I so love about Ian's recent work is that he's not, in the least, shied away from

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,720
asking some truly fundamental metaphysical questions.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,680
In fact, these questions in many ways pervade the work, and yet, I think a discerning reader

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,560
finds that two fundamental questions in particular frame the entire discussion, the tangled answers

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,680
of which are slowly developed or at least suggested throughout 28, I think, scintillating

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
chapters.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,920
So on the front end, even before the table of contents, the question of Plotinus, but

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,080
we, who are we?

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,240
It's a question that Ian returns to occasionally throughout the book, and on the back end,

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
on the first page of Chapter 28, the final chapter of the book, it is the question of

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
being, the question of Heidegger, the question of Leibniz, the question that has haunted the

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,720
philosophical tradition, namely, why is there something rather than nothing?

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,960
These two monumental questions, of course, there's a relationship between the questions

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,320
of some tangled nature, and you might argue that the way you answer one question is going

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,680
to implicate how you answer the other, and at least what's part of the matter with things

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,560
is that we have no orienting space or position from which to answer these questions.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,240
We do not know who we are, we don't know why we or anything exist, and of course, there's

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
an apophatic dimension to Ian's thought, too, he's more concerned, I'd say, with keeping

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,400
those fundamental questions alive, rather than answering them and saying, here's the

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,160
certain answer, that would be too, a leptomysphere approach, and nevertheless, I think he has

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,560
developed a profound metaphysics of parameters, metaphysical parameters for offering an answer

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,080
to these questions, or at least an entry point to these questions in terms of value, in terms

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
of axiology.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,160
So I want to try to do that today with you, and I want to do so in five propositions.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,440
So a word about propositions first, Matt had reminded us, it's come up several times, I

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,120
follow Whitehead in this, propositions should not just be reduced to the verbal content

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,680
of logical justification, propositions are not just about declarative statements of

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,360
fact, whether it's your fault.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,600
They include that, but there's more to our engagement with propositions for Whitehead.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,440
So instead, when I speak of propositions today, I'm speaking as lures for feeling, or Whitehead

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,040
will speak of propositional feelings as the way we feel our way into the content of propositions

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
as potentials.

40
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,320
In fact, maybe a better way to put it is that propositions are invitations for your feeling,

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
invitations for your attention.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,040
And so when I use the language propositions, let's think about it in that sense, lures

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,280
for your feeling, lures for your attention.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,880
And I want to embed these five propositions in a constellation of different resources

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
and quotations.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,240
Another thing I so love about Ian's book is the entire argument is carried along by his

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,280
immense amount of resources, wonderful quotations, there's something to be valued about a quotation

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:38,640
which fits perfectly, an argument that's being made, and I think you demonstrated that brilliantly.

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
Question one, first lure for your feeling.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,800
The cosmos is not anthropomorphic, rather, human beings are anthropocosmic.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,160
In other words, we are an expression of this cosmos and not a deviation from it.

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,480
I like this language of anthropocosmic.

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,360
I thought I had invented it a few months ago, but it's usually the case you find somebody

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
got there before you.

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,720
Okay, in this case, Harvard Confucian scholar, Tuwei Ming, who says, in this view, human beings

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,480
are not merely creatures, but co-creators of the cosmic process.

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
We must take responsibility, he says, for this anthropocosmic interplay.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,920
It's a beautiful way of expressing it.

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,120
Of course, he wasn't alone.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Nikolai Bardaev, one of my favorite Russian scholars, the knowledge of man rests upon

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,280
the supposition that man is cosmic in his nature.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,800
The French Jesuit priest, Tehard, the person, the human monad is like every monad, essentially

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,840
cosmic, or one of my favorites, Raimundo Panicar, Spanish scholar.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,760
The human community is not limited to its fellow human creatures.

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,280
The human community is also cosmic, since the human being is an integral and even constitutive

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
part of the cosmos itself.

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Of course, it's an ancient insight that we are part of the cosmos and not a part from

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
it.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,680
But it's one that we forgot, certainly in many ways, in the development of modern

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
philosophy.

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,480
It's one we hear forgotten in pithy statements uttered by popular scientists.

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,880
For example, consider a tweet exchange, 2019, between the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Tyson.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,760
We all know who deGrasse Tyson is, and a brilliant response, I think, by the late comedian Norm

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
McDonald.

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,920
So Tyson gets up early in the morning at 6 a.m. of some kind.

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,840
He tweets to his very large following, the universe is blind to our sorrows and indifferent

78
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,360
to our pains.

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Have a nice day.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
It's a great way to start the morning.

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
To which McDonald, I think, brilliantly responds, Neil, there's a logic flaw in your little

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
aphorism that seems quite telling.

83
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Since you and I are part of the universe, we would also be indifferent and uncaring.

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Perhaps you forgot, Neil, that we are not superior to the universe, but merely a fraction

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
of it.

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Have a nice day indeed.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,960
So the logic flaw that Norm is pointing to is that Neil can only utter these statements

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,240
by removing his own existence and experience out of the universe, as if it tells him nothing

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,840
about the universe at large.

90
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,520
After all, we're hardly the kinds of beings who are blind to sorrow and indifferent by

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
pain.

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,360
In fact, at individual and cultural levels, if that's the case, we usually see those as

93
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,440
moral faults, rightly.

94
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,720
So Norm is pointing to this abstraction of the human element, the neglect to realize

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,080
this anthropocosmic interplay as two-way-me put it.

96
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,000
And so I think at the heart of Ian's work is a countering of this kind of pithy statement

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
by Negras Tyson.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,080
And here I want to quote Ian's response as if it were somewhat of a response to statements

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,240
like those of Tyson.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
So Ian says, there's a parallel between the false view that we are separate from and

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,280
over against nature and the idea that we are separate from and over against the cosmos.

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,800
This cannot be true for the same reason in either case.

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,040
We were born out of and returned to the one and the other.

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:13,160
It therefore makes no sense, Neil, to set us up as proud, lonely, tragic figures struggling

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,000
against nature, trying to subdue her or trying to defiantly, trying defiantly to bring love,

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
goodness, and beauty into a hostile cosmos.

107
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,120
Any love, goodness, and beauty we can bring come out of nature and out of the cosmos in

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
the first place.

109
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,600
Where else can they come from?

110
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,680
Where indeed.

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
So the central thrust of this first lure for your feeling is that our anthropocosmic experience

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,680
speaks of the cosmos at large and the cosmos also speaks in human experience.

113
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
But what does it say?

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,600
In part, it's pointing the direction as to what it says in that statement that I read.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,960
Second proposition, second lure for your attention.

116
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,640
What the cosmos proclaims or speaks in human experience is value.

117
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,200
And here I want to turn to Whitehead and Shailer.

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Consider Whitehead.

119
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,720
He says, our enjoyment of actuality is a realization of worth, good, or bad.

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,760
It is value experience.

121
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Its basic expression is, have a care.

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Here is something that matters.

123
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
Yes, he says.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
That's the best phrase.

125
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,040
The primary glimmerings of consciousness reveals something that matters.

126
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,400
So here's Whitehead's statement with McGillchrist about the mattering with or of things.

127
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
For both thinkers, the universe is not made of aqueous dead matter.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,160
It's more accurate to say it's made of what matters.

129
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,160
It's made of meaning and meaning for consciousness, meaning for experience.

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,040
Now similarly, Shailer, who's influenced Ian quite a bit, speaks of a pure value quality

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,160
which is first given and felt experience.

132
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,120
He uses this great analogy of color, right, just as colors are given in visual perception

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
through seeing them.

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,600
So too values are given in value-ception, a mode of feeling through feeling that.

135
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,760
And value-ception is deeper than conception, deeper than perception arguably for Shailer.

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,080
But I like this analogy of color.

137
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,800
If I were to show you a patch of green, for example, on the screen, we wouldn't have to

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
sit back and analytically deduce what color is it that we're looking at.

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,440
It announces itself to us, it proclaims itself to us.

140
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,760
And there's something almost trans-temporal about color too.

141
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
The green on the screen hypothetically would be connected in some way to the green of an

142
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,240
ancient reed in the Nile Delta, say.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,640
We don't simply invent that.

144
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,400
We find it imposed upon us.

145
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,720
We discover it in a certain sense.

146
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,560
And part of Ian's argument is that we approach value in a similar kind of way.

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,800
The customary way to think of values is to see them as piggybacking on and arising out

148
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,320
of our consciousness, a human invention.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,960
An alternative view is that values are not invented but discovered and disclosed, and

150
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,520
it takes life to discover and disclose them.

151
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,960
That they declare themselves in and through the responses of living beings to the world

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
and the world's response to them.

153
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,120
Okay, so the central thrust of the second proposition shared in different ways by Shaler,

154
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,560
by Whitehead, by McGilchrist.

155
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,840
The declaration of experience is value.

156
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,200
All experience is value experience, and experience is the feeling of value.

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
Okay, well, what else can we say about value?

158
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,160
Let's go a little bit deeper.

159
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
Proposition three.

160
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Where there is any value, there is an attendant spectrum or hierarchy of values.

161
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,200
I want to return to Shaler here.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
Note his statement.

163
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,360
In the totality of the realm of values, there exists a single order of ranks that all values

164
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
possess among themselves.

165
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
It is because of this that a value is higher or lower than another.

166
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,040
This order lies, he says, in the essence of values themselves and as does the difference

167
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,640
between positive and negative values.

168
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,840
It does not simply belong to values known by us.

169
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,160
So here's a statement of Shaler's, an objective ordering of values of some kind that is what

170
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,000
it is independent of what I arguably think about it.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,240
Now, I've come to appreciate Shaler's work through reading your work Ian, and in particular

172
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
his hierarchy of values.

173
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,280
We've often seen this often a pyramid structure of five different hierarchies, the lowest

174
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,000
being utility, values of usefulness, moving up to values, essential values, virtue values,

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,440
values, wisdom, truth, beauty, goodness, values of the sacred, the holy.

176
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,160
Again, part of the matter with things is that we've inverted this hierarchy so that values

177
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,120
of utility and usefulness are at the top, the values of holiness and sacred are often

178
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,480
at the bottom.

179
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
This pyramid is often presented in different shades of color as well.

180
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:07,200
I like the analogy of color, it's as if values are the colors of our feelings in some way.

181
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
You can no more abstract, say, a single color from the entire spectrum of color, the hierarchy

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,960
of color of which it is a part, than you can say a single value from the whole qualitative

183
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,160
spectrum of values of which it is a part.

184
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Arguably, there's an interesting, I like that analogy quite a bit.

185
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,800
So for Shaler, we face this hierarchy in some sense in our experience, but some sort of

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,240
value hierarchy is not confined to our experience.

187
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,280
So let's turn to Whitehead here, for example, one of my favorite statements.

188
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,000
He says, on a grand scale, our cosmology discloses a process of overpowering change

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,640
from nebula to stars, stars to planets, from inorganic matter to life, from life to reason

190
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,480
and moral responsibility.

191
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,960
What is going on, at least in part for Whitehead, cosmic evolution is in the business of achievements

192
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,360
of value, which weave into higher achievements of value, which make possible the dawning

193
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,120
of deeper kinds of value, for example, this dawning of moral responsibility, this dawning

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,040
of moral intuition.

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,440
The problem of evolution, Whitehead says, is the development of enduring harmonies of

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,840
enduring shapes of value, which merge into higher attainments beyond themselves.

197
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,160
Aesthetic attainment, he says, is interwoven with the texture of realization.

198
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,160
So Whitehead aesthetic value is the widest and most inclusive form of value that's applicable

199
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,720
to the universe.

200
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,160
It's in this life that Hartzor and his assistant, for a time, says that the most general principles

201
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,760
of harmony and intensity are more ultimate than the laws of physics and the reason for

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,400
there being natural laws, provocative.

203
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,880
Harmony intensity are aesthetic principles that are deeper than laws of physics precisely

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,680
because they're embodied within them.

205
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,340
And here, again, he's reflecting Whitehead, who says it's not the case that we have an

206
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,420
actual world which happens to exhibit an order of nature.

207
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,780
He says, we have a world because there is a more fundamental order of nature.

208
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,940
He follows that saying all order is aesthetic order and the moral order is merely certain

209
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,220
aspects of the aesthetic order.

210
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Now Ian, on occasion, has had time to push back at that because it might risk reducing

211
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,660
moral value to aesthetic value or something to be said for that.

212
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,420
But I think what Whitehead is doing is situating the advent of moral value across an evolutionary

213
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,460
spectrum from more primal experiences of aesthetic intensity, aesthetic harmony.

214
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,940
After all, the formation of protons and electrons was aesthetically intense in terms of harmony

215
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,580
and intensity and order, but it doesn't seem that moral value arguably would apply at that

216
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,260
level to those occurrences.

217
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,060
So I think it's a statement about an arc of evolutionary experience that runs from

218
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,740
the aesthetic all the way in very high forms to the moral.

219
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,900
After all, there's the harmony of a human life, which is both an aesthetic and a moral

220
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
concept.

221
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:04,820
Okay, the third thrust then of this, the third principle, human experience and both cosmological

222
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,020
and biological evolution arguably presuppose this hierarchy of values, this continuum,

223
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,620
but hearts are called the effective continuum of felt values.

224
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,180
Okay, but we can still go deeper, I think.

225
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,540
Fourth proposition, fourth lure for your feeling, for your invitation.

226
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,180
In the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values, which are inclusive

227
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,580
and lower values, which are exclusive.

228
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,420
And I want to quote here James, quote by William James, which Ian also quotes, this is a beautiful

229
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,380
expression of this and it's reflective.

230
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,020
James says, looking back on my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight

231
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,420
to which I cannot help ascribe some metaphysical significance.

232
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,060
The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation.

233
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,380
It's as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoryness and conflict make all our

234
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:04,020
difficulties and troubles, were melded into unity, not only do they as contrasted species

235
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:11,180
belong to one and the same genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one,

236
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,740
is itself the genus, which so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself.

237
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,220
It's just a beautiful statement by James, the kind of asymmetry among opposites and

238
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,780
I love the way Ian describes this.

239
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,860
He says this statement is one that speaks of the equal necessity, but the unequal status

240
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,420
of spiritual opposites in the universe.

241
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,540
So both thinkers are haunted by, well, a kind of axiological asymmetry.

242
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,180
So consider a few axiological co-ans, if you will.

243
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,500
Is it the case in some sense that love can include hate without being diminished, but

244
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,980
hate cannot include love without being extinguished?

245
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,060
Goodness we might say can include evil without being diminished, but evil cannot include

246
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,580
goodness without being extinguished.

247
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,140
Harmony we might say can include discord without being diminished, but discord cannot include

248
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:18,180
harmony without being extinguished, or order perhaps can include chaos without being diminished,

249
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,820
but chaos cannot include order without being extinguished.

250
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,860
And of course we can argue about those and what I'm pointing to is this haunting sense

251
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,980
of axiological asymmetry that seems to be there in the nature of things, but it's not

252
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,580
just axiological asymmetry.

253
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,820
So Ian has argued at various lengths to point to various other asymmetries and his quote

254
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,020
of Louis Pasteur I think is instructive in this regard.

255
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,260
So Pasteur says the universe as a whole is asymmetrical.

256
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,180
Life is dominated by the effects of asymmetrical forces whose enveloping cosmic existence we

257
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,780
sense intuitively.

258
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,540
I would even say Pasteur continues that living species are primordially in their structure,

259
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,580
in their external forms, functions of cosmic asymmetry.

260
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,300
So the central thrust of the fourth principle then that we intuit value as a kind of cosmic

261
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,460
asymmetrical force in some way.

262
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,740
And if that's the case, wouldn't that begin to shed light on the foundations of being

263
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
itself?

264
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,380
Wouldn't that give us perhaps grounds to begin to speak to the reason for or the meaning

265
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,260
of existence as such?

266
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,660
Okay, fifth and final proposition.

267
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,740
Namely at the reason or say the meaning for the world and life itself consists in its

268
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:45,660
ability to respond to the positive proclamations of value which asymmetrically grounded speaking.

269
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,260
And there's a number of things we can point to here.

270
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:55,740
In quotes rightly, I think Thomas Nagel's striking statement that value is not an accidental

271
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,860
side effect of life, rather there is life because life is a necessary condition of value.

272
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,740
So here's a statement that value itself is deeper than life.

273
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,500
You don't have value because of life, you have life because of value, value is the deeper

274
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
concept.

275
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Similarly, Philip Goff and his recent work is along the similar kinds of lines, speaking

276
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,740
of fundamental facts that are as basic as the axioms of mathematics or the laws of physics,

277
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,540
facts of better and worse, or facts about how people ought to behave and he says value

278
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,340
facts if there are any must be primitive facts in their own right to say that they're primitive

279
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,940
means that in some sense they're necessary, return on some deep sense.

280
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,300
Now Goff is re-energizing deeper work that is done by John Leslie, the Canadian British

281
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,220
Canadian philosopher, his axiarchism, which says necessarily, eternally, there can be

282
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,620
ethical requirements for the existence of various things, needs for them to exist.

283
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,420
So for Leslie, the reason we have existence as such, the reason we have a world is because

284
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
it satisfies an ethical need for it.

285
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,300
Ultimately, we have a world because it's good that it exists.

286
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,460
And when we get to the element of goodness, we're at a stopping point, we've given an

287
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,620
axiological answer for why there is anything challenging.

288
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,860
Now Whitehead can be seen as part of this, for example, in a combined statement, all

289
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,900
ultimate reasons he says are in terms of an aim at value.

290
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,860
Life exists for its own sake as the intrinsic reaping of value, and that existence is the

291
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,580
upholding of value intensity, that existence already is an achievement of value.

292
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,660
So these different statements, constellation of statements, are beginning to reason the

293
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,100
reason for being, the reason for the world.

294
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,460
Maybe we can answer in terms of value.

295
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,420
What about the meaning of the world?

296
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:53,260
And Olosky, Russian existential scholar, value is something which pervades everything.

297
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:59,180
It determines the meaning of the world as a whole, as well as the meaning of every person.

298
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,340
Everything that exists, and even everything that may exist, there's that domain of possibility,

299
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,900
is of such nature that it not only exists, but contains within itself either the justification

300
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,300
or the condemnation of its being.

301
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,460
Whitehead on meaning.

302
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,100
And in fact, this is just a partial statement, but Whitehead is responding to the question

303
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,820
of where is it that he thinks philosophy should start, and the statement is a part of his

304
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,820
answer.

305
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,180
He says, our enjoyment of the values of human art, or of natural beauty, our horror at the

306
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,500
obvious vulgarities and defacements which force themselves upon us, all of these modes

307
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,540
of experience are sufficiently abstracted to be relatively obvious, and yet evidently

308
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,060
they disclose the very meaning of things.

309
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,740
Again, the statement about value and meaning.

310
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,780
So there's possibilities of value, there's possibilities of meaning that are in the nature

311
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
of things.

312
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,700
And so the focus is absolutely right on.

313
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,620
It's not we who originate the possibility of truth, goodness, or beauty in the cosmos.

314
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,540
He says, I see value as intrinsic to the universe, and the possibility of appreciating and responding

315
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:20,740
to value, therefore fulfilling its potential as one reason for the cosmos to have evolved

316
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,660
for life.

317
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,500
And yet arguably in a Weltanschau, which sees value as an ontological primitive, we might

318
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,180
have grounds to say that value is not just one reason for the universe to have evolved,

319
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:40,180
but the reason the universe has evolved, the reason, hypothetically, we have a universe

320
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
at all.

321
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,780
Okay, so we've seen five propositions as lures for your feeling, invitations for your attention.

322
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,980
One, the cosmos is not anthropomorphic, human beings are anthropocosmic.

323
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,500
Two, what the cosmos proclaims in human experience is value.

324
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Three, where there is any value, there is an intended spectrum or hierarchy of values.

325
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,740
Four, in the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values

326
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,020
which are inclusive and lower values which are exclusive.

327
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,260
And five, that the reason or the meaning of the world and life itself consists in its

328
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,260
ability to respond to the proclamations of positive value, which asymmetrically ground

329
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,980
its being.

330
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,580
And I want to conclude here with a final challenge.

331
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,580
And I think it's a sort of through line that runs through Ian's work, namely the challenge

332
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,940
of moving from a merely propositional way of knowing to a dispositional orientation towards

333
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
the world.

334
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,900
What would it be like to develop a kind of attitudinal axiology that is transparent to

335
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:55,740
these transcendent values, which ground our being, which find expression in us, which

336
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,820
arguably point an arrow over our shoulder towards an arc of human purpose and human

337
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
meaning?

338
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:09,820
And if we could do that, wouldn't that be a way of answering who it is we are and why

339
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,820
it is that we or anything should exist?

340
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Thank you.
