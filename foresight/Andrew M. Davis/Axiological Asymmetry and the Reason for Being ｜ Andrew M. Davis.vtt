WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Okay, it's no small thing to go last at a conference such as this, and one might hope

00:07.920 --> 00:12.520
of the final presentation that it says something of what this all comes to in some deep and

00:12.520 --> 00:13.520
abiding sense.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.400
Of course, that's going to be very difficult because we've been wrestling with a lot of

00:17.400 --> 00:21.440
different confers being's work over the last couple of days, and nevertheless, I'm going

00:21.440 --> 00:27.160
to try to do so and I hope compelling an interesting way, and we're going to see what happens.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.760
So let me frame the discussion first.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.840
What I so love about Ian's recent work is that he's not, in the least, shied away from

00:35.840 --> 00:38.720
asking some truly fundamental metaphysical questions.

00:38.720 --> 00:44.680
In fact, these questions in many ways pervade the work, and yet, I think a discerning reader

00:44.680 --> 00:50.560
finds that two fundamental questions in particular frame the entire discussion, the tangled answers

00:50.560 --> 00:57.680
of which are slowly developed or at least suggested throughout 28, I think, scintillating

00:57.680 --> 00:58.680
chapters.

00:58.680 --> 01:04.920
So on the front end, even before the table of contents, the question of Plotinus, but

01:04.920 --> 01:08.080
we, who are we?

01:08.080 --> 01:14.240
It's a question that Ian returns to occasionally throughout the book, and on the back end,

01:14.240 --> 01:19.040
on the first page of Chapter 28, the final chapter of the book, it is the question of

01:19.040 --> 01:23.600
being, the question of Heidegger, the question of Leibniz, the question that has haunted the

01:23.600 --> 01:27.720
philosophical tradition, namely, why is there something rather than nothing?

01:27.720 --> 01:31.960
These two monumental questions, of course, there's a relationship between the questions

01:31.960 --> 01:36.320
of some tangled nature, and you might argue that the way you answer one question is going

01:36.320 --> 01:40.680
to implicate how you answer the other, and at least what's part of the matter with things

01:40.680 --> 01:45.560
is that we have no orienting space or position from which to answer these questions.

01:45.560 --> 01:52.240
We do not know who we are, we don't know why we or anything exist, and of course, there's

01:52.240 --> 01:56.560
an apophatic dimension to Ian's thought, too, he's more concerned, I'd say, with keeping

01:56.560 --> 02:01.400
those fundamental questions alive, rather than answering them and saying, here's the

02:01.400 --> 02:07.160
certain answer, that would be too, a leptomysphere approach, and nevertheless, I think he has

02:07.160 --> 02:13.560
developed a profound metaphysics of parameters, metaphysical parameters for offering an answer

02:13.560 --> 02:18.080
to these questions, or at least an entry point to these questions in terms of value, in terms

02:18.080 --> 02:19.080
of axiology.

02:19.080 --> 02:24.160
So I want to try to do that today with you, and I want to do so in five propositions.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.440
So a word about propositions first, Matt had reminded us, it's come up several times, I

02:28.440 --> 02:34.120
follow Whitehead in this, propositions should not just be reduced to the verbal content

02:34.120 --> 02:38.680
of logical justification, propositions are not just about declarative statements of

02:38.680 --> 02:41.360
fact, whether it's your fault.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.600
They include that, but there's more to our engagement with propositions for Whitehead.

02:44.600 --> 02:51.440
So instead, when I speak of propositions today, I'm speaking as lures for feeling, or Whitehead

02:51.440 --> 02:57.040
will speak of propositional feelings as the way we feel our way into the content of propositions

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
as potentials.

02:58.040 --> 03:05.320
In fact, maybe a better way to put it is that propositions are invitations for your feeling,

03:05.320 --> 03:06.920
invitations for your attention.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.040
And so when I use the language propositions, let's think about it in that sense, lures

03:10.040 --> 03:12.280
for your feeling, lures for your attention.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.880
And I want to embed these five propositions in a constellation of different resources

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
and quotations.

03:17.880 --> 03:23.240
Another thing I so love about Ian's book is the entire argument is carried along by his

03:23.240 --> 03:29.280
immense amount of resources, wonderful quotations, there's something to be valued about a quotation

03:29.280 --> 03:38.640
which fits perfectly, an argument that's being made, and I think you demonstrated that brilliantly.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.360
Question one, first lure for your feeling.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.800
The cosmos is not anthropomorphic, rather, human beings are anthropocosmic.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.160
In other words, we are an expression of this cosmos and not a deviation from it.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.480
I like this language of anthropocosmic.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.360
I thought I had invented it a few months ago, but it's usually the case you find somebody

03:58.360 --> 03:59.760
got there before you.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.720
Okay, in this case, Harvard Confucian scholar, Tuwei Ming, who says, in this view, human beings

04:05.720 --> 04:10.480
are not merely creatures, but co-creators of the cosmic process.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.400
We must take responsibility, he says, for this anthropocosmic interplay.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.920
It's a beautiful way of expressing it.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.120
Of course, he wasn't alone.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.920
Nikolai Bardaev, one of my favorite Russian scholars, the knowledge of man rests upon

04:22.920 --> 04:27.280
the supposition that man is cosmic in his nature.

04:27.280 --> 04:33.800
The French Jesuit priest, Tehard, the person, the human monad is like every monad, essentially

04:33.800 --> 04:39.840
cosmic, or one of my favorites, Raimundo Panicar, Spanish scholar.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.760
The human community is not limited to its fellow human creatures.

04:42.760 --> 04:49.280
The human community is also cosmic, since the human being is an integral and even constitutive

04:49.280 --> 04:51.360
part of the cosmos itself.

04:51.360 --> 04:57.720
Of course, it's an ancient insight that we are part of the cosmos and not a part from

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
it.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.680
But it's one that we forgot, certainly in many ways, in the development of modern

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
philosophy.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.480
It's one we hear forgotten in pithy statements uttered by popular scientists.

05:06.480 --> 05:13.880
For example, consider a tweet exchange, 2019, between the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
Tyson.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.760
We all know who deGrasse Tyson is, and a brilliant response, I think, by the late comedian Norm

05:19.760 --> 05:20.760
McDonald.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.920
So Tyson gets up early in the morning at 6 a.m. of some kind.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.840
He tweets to his very large following, the universe is blind to our sorrows and indifferent

05:30.840 --> 05:32.360
to our pains.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.360
Have a nice day.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.120
It's a great way to start the morning.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.160
To which McDonald, I think, brilliantly responds, Neil, there's a logic flaw in your little

05:42.160 --> 05:44.560
aphorism that seems quite telling.

05:44.560 --> 05:49.360
Since you and I are part of the universe, we would also be indifferent and uncaring.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.160
Perhaps you forgot, Neil, that we are not superior to the universe, but merely a fraction

05:54.160 --> 05:55.160
of it.

05:55.160 --> 06:03.040
Have a nice day indeed.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.960
So the logic flaw that Norm is pointing to is that Neil can only utter these statements

06:07.960 --> 06:12.240
by removing his own existence and experience out of the universe, as if it tells him nothing

06:12.240 --> 06:14.840
about the universe at large.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.520
After all, we're hardly the kinds of beings who are blind to sorrow and indifferent by

06:19.520 --> 06:20.520
pain.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.360
In fact, at individual and cultural levels, if that's the case, we usually see those as

06:24.360 --> 06:26.440
moral faults, rightly.

06:26.440 --> 06:31.720
So Norm is pointing to this abstraction of the human element, the neglect to realize

06:31.720 --> 06:37.080
this anthropocosmic interplay as two-way-me put it.

06:37.080 --> 06:42.000
And so I think at the heart of Ian's work is a countering of this kind of pithy statement

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
by Negras Tyson.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.080
And here I want to quote Ian's response as if it were somewhat of a response to statements

06:47.080 --> 06:48.240
like those of Tyson.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.800
So Ian says, there's a parallel between the false view that we are separate from and

06:52.800 --> 06:58.280
over against nature and the idea that we are separate from and over against the cosmos.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.800
This cannot be true for the same reason in either case.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.040
We were born out of and returned to the one and the other.

07:05.040 --> 07:13.160
It therefore makes no sense, Neil, to set us up as proud, lonely, tragic figures struggling

07:13.160 --> 07:20.000
against nature, trying to subdue her or trying to defiantly, trying defiantly to bring love,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.160
goodness, and beauty into a hostile cosmos.

07:24.160 --> 07:29.120
Any love, goodness, and beauty we can bring come out of nature and out of the cosmos in

07:29.120 --> 07:30.120
the first place.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.600
Where else can they come from?

07:32.600 --> 07:35.680
Where indeed.

07:35.680 --> 07:40.720
So the central thrust of this first lure for your feeling is that our anthropocosmic experience

07:40.720 --> 07:47.680
speaks of the cosmos at large and the cosmos also speaks in human experience.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.720
But what does it say?

07:49.720 --> 07:55.600
In part, it's pointing the direction as to what it says in that statement that I read.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.960
Second proposition, second lure for your attention.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.640
What the cosmos proclaims or speaks in human experience is value.

08:03.640 --> 08:08.200
And here I want to turn to Whitehead and Shailer.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Consider Whitehead.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.720
He says, our enjoyment of actuality is a realization of worth, good, or bad.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.760
It is value experience.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.720
Its basic expression is, have a care.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.240
Here is something that matters.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.960
Yes, he says.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
That's the best phrase.

08:21.960 --> 08:27.040
The primary glimmerings of consciousness reveals something that matters.

08:27.040 --> 08:32.400
So here's Whitehead's statement with McGillchrist about the mattering with or of things.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.200
For both thinkers, the universe is not made of aqueous dead matter.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.160
It's more accurate to say it's made of what matters.

08:38.160 --> 08:43.160
It's made of meaning and meaning for consciousness, meaning for experience.

08:43.160 --> 08:48.040
Now similarly, Shailer, who's influenced Ian quite a bit, speaks of a pure value quality

08:48.040 --> 08:51.160
which is first given and felt experience.

08:51.160 --> 08:56.120
He uses this great analogy of color, right, just as colors are given in visual perception

08:56.120 --> 08:57.120
through seeing them.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.600
So too values are given in value-ception, a mode of feeling through feeling that.

09:02.600 --> 09:08.760
And value-ception is deeper than conception, deeper than perception arguably for Shailer.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.080
But I like this analogy of color.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.800
If I were to show you a patch of green, for example, on the screen, we wouldn't have to

09:14.800 --> 09:18.240
sit back and analytically deduce what color is it that we're looking at.

09:18.240 --> 09:22.440
It announces itself to us, it proclaims itself to us.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.760
And there's something almost trans-temporal about color too.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.800
The green on the screen hypothetically would be connected in some way to the green of an

09:30.800 --> 09:34.240
ancient reed in the Nile Delta, say.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.640
We don't simply invent that.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.400
We find it imposed upon us.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.720
We discover it in a certain sense.

09:41.720 --> 09:47.560
And part of Ian's argument is that we approach value in a similar kind of way.

09:47.560 --> 09:52.800
The customary way to think of values is to see them as piggybacking on and arising out

09:52.800 --> 09:56.320
of our consciousness, a human invention.

09:56.320 --> 10:00.960
An alternative view is that values are not invented but discovered and disclosed, and

10:00.960 --> 10:04.520
it takes life to discover and disclose them.

10:04.520 --> 10:09.960
That they declare themselves in and through the responses of living beings to the world

10:10.000 --> 10:13.200
and the world's response to them.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.120
Okay, so the central thrust of the second proposition shared in different ways by Shaler,

10:18.120 --> 10:19.560
by Whitehead, by McGilchrist.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.840
The declaration of experience is value.

10:22.840 --> 10:30.200
All experience is value experience, and experience is the feeling of value.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.240
Okay, well, what else can we say about value?

10:32.240 --> 10:35.160
Let's go a little bit deeper.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.440
Proposition three.

10:37.480 --> 10:43.480
Where there is any value, there is an attendant spectrum or hierarchy of values.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.200
I want to return to Shaler here.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.480
Note his statement.

10:47.480 --> 10:52.360
In the totality of the realm of values, there exists a single order of ranks that all values

10:52.360 --> 10:54.320
possess among themselves.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.560
It is because of this that a value is higher or lower than another.

10:58.560 --> 11:04.040
This order lies, he says, in the essence of values themselves and as does the difference

11:04.040 --> 11:06.640
between positive and negative values.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.840
It does not simply belong to values known by us.

11:09.840 --> 11:16.160
So here's a statement of Shaler's, an objective ordering of values of some kind that is what

11:16.160 --> 11:20.000
it is independent of what I arguably think about it.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.240
Now, I've come to appreciate Shaler's work through reading your work Ian, and in particular

11:25.240 --> 11:26.680
his hierarchy of values.

11:26.680 --> 11:31.280
We've often seen this often a pyramid structure of five different hierarchies, the lowest

11:31.280 --> 11:38.000
being utility, values of usefulness, moving up to values, essential values, virtue values,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.440
values, wisdom, truth, beauty, goodness, values of the sacred, the holy.

11:42.440 --> 11:49.160
Again, part of the matter with things is that we've inverted this hierarchy so that values

11:49.160 --> 11:54.120
of utility and usefulness are at the top, the values of holiness and sacred are often

11:54.120 --> 11:56.480
at the bottom.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.360
This pyramid is often presented in different shades of color as well.

11:59.480 --> 12:07.200
I like the analogy of color, it's as if values are the colors of our feelings in some way.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.440
You can no more abstract, say, a single color from the entire spectrum of color, the hierarchy

12:11.440 --> 12:15.960
of color of which it is a part, than you can say a single value from the whole qualitative

12:15.960 --> 12:18.160
spectrum of values of which it is a part.

12:18.160 --> 12:22.160
Arguably, there's an interesting, I like that analogy quite a bit.

12:22.160 --> 12:27.800
So for Shaler, we face this hierarchy in some sense in our experience, but some sort of

12:27.800 --> 12:31.240
value hierarchy is not confined to our experience.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.280
So let's turn to Whitehead here, for example, one of my favorite statements.

12:35.280 --> 12:40.000
He says, on a grand scale, our cosmology discloses a process of overpowering change

12:40.000 --> 12:45.640
from nebula to stars, stars to planets, from inorganic matter to life, from life to reason

12:45.640 --> 12:47.480
and moral responsibility.

12:47.480 --> 12:53.960
What is going on, at least in part for Whitehead, cosmic evolution is in the business of achievements

12:53.960 --> 12:58.360
of value, which weave into higher achievements of value, which make possible the dawning

12:58.360 --> 13:03.120
of deeper kinds of value, for example, this dawning of moral responsibility, this dawning

13:03.120 --> 13:06.040
of moral intuition.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.440
The problem of evolution, Whitehead says, is the development of enduring harmonies of

13:09.440 --> 13:14.840
enduring shapes of value, which merge into higher attainments beyond themselves.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.160
Aesthetic attainment, he says, is interwoven with the texture of realization.

13:18.160 --> 13:23.160
So Whitehead aesthetic value is the widest and most inclusive form of value that's applicable

13:23.160 --> 13:26.720
to the universe.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.160
It's in this life that Hartzor and his assistant, for a time, says that the most general principles

13:31.160 --> 13:36.760
of harmony and intensity are more ultimate than the laws of physics and the reason for

13:36.760 --> 13:40.400
there being natural laws, provocative.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.880
Harmony intensity are aesthetic principles that are deeper than laws of physics precisely

13:43.880 --> 13:46.680
because they're embodied within them.

13:46.680 --> 13:51.340
And here, again, he's reflecting Whitehead, who says it's not the case that we have an

13:51.340 --> 13:54.420
actual world which happens to exhibit an order of nature.

13:54.420 --> 13:58.780
He says, we have a world because there is a more fundamental order of nature.

13:58.780 --> 14:04.940
He follows that saying all order is aesthetic order and the moral order is merely certain

14:04.940 --> 14:07.220
aspects of the aesthetic order.

14:07.220 --> 14:14.220
Now Ian, on occasion, has had time to push back at that because it might risk reducing

14:14.220 --> 14:17.660
moral value to aesthetic value or something to be said for that.

14:17.660 --> 14:23.420
But I think what Whitehead is doing is situating the advent of moral value across an evolutionary

14:23.420 --> 14:28.460
spectrum from more primal experiences of aesthetic intensity, aesthetic harmony.

14:28.460 --> 14:34.940
After all, the formation of protons and electrons was aesthetically intense in terms of harmony

14:34.940 --> 14:39.580
and intensity and order, but it doesn't seem that moral value arguably would apply at that

14:39.580 --> 14:42.260
level to those occurrences.

14:42.260 --> 14:48.060
So I think it's a statement about an arc of evolutionary experience that runs from

14:48.060 --> 14:51.740
the aesthetic all the way in very high forms to the moral.

14:51.740 --> 14:54.900
After all, there's the harmony of a human life, which is both an aesthetic and a moral

14:54.900 --> 14:55.900
concept.

14:55.900 --> 15:04.820
Okay, the third thrust then of this, the third principle, human experience and both cosmological

15:04.820 --> 15:10.020
and biological evolution arguably presuppose this hierarchy of values, this continuum,

15:10.020 --> 15:13.620
but hearts are called the effective continuum of felt values.

15:13.620 --> 15:17.180
Okay, but we can still go deeper, I think.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.540
Fourth proposition, fourth lure for your feeling, for your invitation.

15:21.540 --> 15:28.180
In the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values, which are inclusive

15:28.180 --> 15:31.580
and lower values, which are exclusive.

15:31.580 --> 15:36.420
And I want to quote here James, quote by William James, which Ian also quotes, this is a beautiful

15:36.420 --> 15:39.380
expression of this and it's reflective.

15:39.380 --> 15:44.020
James says, looking back on my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight

15:44.020 --> 15:48.420
to which I cannot help ascribe some metaphysical significance.

15:48.420 --> 15:52.060
The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation.

15:52.060 --> 15:56.380
It's as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoryness and conflict make all our

15:56.380 --> 16:04.020
difficulties and troubles, were melded into unity, not only do they as contrasted species

16:04.020 --> 16:11.180
belong to one and the same genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one,

16:11.180 --> 16:16.740
is itself the genus, which so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself.

16:16.740 --> 16:22.220
It's just a beautiful statement by James, the kind of asymmetry among opposites and

16:22.220 --> 16:23.780
I love the way Ian describes this.

16:23.780 --> 16:28.860
He says this statement is one that speaks of the equal necessity, but the unequal status

16:28.860 --> 16:33.420
of spiritual opposites in the universe.

16:33.420 --> 16:39.540
So both thinkers are haunted by, well, a kind of axiological asymmetry.

16:39.540 --> 16:44.180
So consider a few axiological co-ans, if you will.

16:44.180 --> 16:49.500
Is it the case in some sense that love can include hate without being diminished, but

16:49.500 --> 16:54.980
hate cannot include love without being extinguished?

16:54.980 --> 17:00.060
Goodness we might say can include evil without being diminished, but evil cannot include

17:00.060 --> 17:03.580
goodness without being extinguished.

17:03.580 --> 17:09.140
Harmony we might say can include discord without being diminished, but discord cannot include

17:09.140 --> 17:18.180
harmony without being extinguished, or order perhaps can include chaos without being diminished,

17:18.180 --> 17:20.820
but chaos cannot include order without being extinguished.

17:20.820 --> 17:25.860
And of course we can argue about those and what I'm pointing to is this haunting sense

17:25.860 --> 17:30.980
of axiological asymmetry that seems to be there in the nature of things, but it's not

17:30.980 --> 17:32.580
just axiological asymmetry.

17:32.580 --> 17:37.820
So Ian has argued at various lengths to point to various other asymmetries and his quote

17:37.820 --> 17:41.020
of Louis Pasteur I think is instructive in this regard.

17:41.020 --> 17:45.260
So Pasteur says the universe as a whole is asymmetrical.

17:45.260 --> 17:51.180
Life is dominated by the effects of asymmetrical forces whose enveloping cosmic existence we

17:51.180 --> 17:53.780
sense intuitively.

17:53.780 --> 17:59.540
I would even say Pasteur continues that living species are primordially in their structure,

17:59.540 --> 18:05.580
in their external forms, functions of cosmic asymmetry.

18:05.580 --> 18:11.300
So the central thrust of the fourth principle then that we intuit value as a kind of cosmic

18:11.300 --> 18:15.460
asymmetrical force in some way.

18:15.460 --> 18:19.740
And if that's the case, wouldn't that begin to shed light on the foundations of being

18:19.740 --> 18:20.740
itself?

18:21.220 --> 18:26.380
Wouldn't that give us perhaps grounds to begin to speak to the reason for or the meaning

18:26.380 --> 18:29.260
of existence as such?

18:29.260 --> 18:33.660
Okay, fifth and final proposition.

18:33.660 --> 18:37.740
Namely at the reason or say the meaning for the world and life itself consists in its

18:37.740 --> 18:45.660
ability to respond to the positive proclamations of value which asymmetrically grounded speaking.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.260
And there's a number of things we can point to here.

18:49.300 --> 18:55.740
In quotes rightly, I think Thomas Nagel's striking statement that value is not an accidental

18:55.740 --> 19:00.860
side effect of life, rather there is life because life is a necessary condition of value.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.740
So here's a statement that value itself is deeper than life.

19:03.740 --> 19:08.500
You don't have value because of life, you have life because of value, value is the deeper

19:08.500 --> 19:09.500
concept.

19:09.500 --> 19:14.500
Similarly, Philip Goff and his recent work is along the similar kinds of lines, speaking

19:14.500 --> 19:20.740
of fundamental facts that are as basic as the axioms of mathematics or the laws of physics,

19:20.740 --> 19:25.540
facts of better and worse, or facts about how people ought to behave and he says value

19:25.540 --> 19:31.340
facts if there are any must be primitive facts in their own right to say that they're primitive

19:31.340 --> 19:37.940
means that in some sense they're necessary, return on some deep sense.

19:37.940 --> 19:43.300
Now Goff is re-energizing deeper work that is done by John Leslie, the Canadian British

19:43.300 --> 19:49.220
Canadian philosopher, his axiarchism, which says necessarily, eternally, there can be

19:49.220 --> 19:55.620
ethical requirements for the existence of various things, needs for them to exist.

19:55.620 --> 19:59.420
So for Leslie, the reason we have existence as such, the reason we have a world is because

19:59.420 --> 20:01.420
it satisfies an ethical need for it.

20:01.420 --> 20:06.300
Ultimately, we have a world because it's good that it exists.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.460
And when we get to the element of goodness, we're at a stopping point, we've given an

20:09.460 --> 20:14.620
axiological answer for why there is anything challenging.

20:14.620 --> 20:18.860
Now Whitehead can be seen as part of this, for example, in a combined statement, all

20:18.860 --> 20:22.900
ultimate reasons he says are in terms of an aim at value.

20:22.900 --> 20:28.860
Life exists for its own sake as the intrinsic reaping of value, and that existence is the

20:28.860 --> 20:35.580
upholding of value intensity, that existence already is an achievement of value.

20:35.580 --> 20:40.660
So these different statements, constellation of statements, are beginning to reason the

20:40.660 --> 20:43.100
reason for being, the reason for the world.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.460
Maybe we can answer in terms of value.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.420
What about the meaning of the world?

20:46.420 --> 20:53.260
And Olosky, Russian existential scholar, value is something which pervades everything.

20:53.260 --> 20:59.180
It determines the meaning of the world as a whole, as well as the meaning of every person.

20:59.180 --> 21:05.340
Everything that exists, and even everything that may exist, there's that domain of possibility,

21:05.340 --> 21:10.900
is of such nature that it not only exists, but contains within itself either the justification

21:10.900 --> 21:16.300
or the condemnation of its being.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.460
Whitehead on meaning.

21:19.460 --> 21:24.100
And in fact, this is just a partial statement, but Whitehead is responding to the question

21:24.100 --> 21:29.820
of where is it that he thinks philosophy should start, and the statement is a part of his

21:29.820 --> 21:30.820
answer.

21:30.820 --> 21:36.180
He says, our enjoyment of the values of human art, or of natural beauty, our horror at the

21:36.180 --> 21:41.500
obvious vulgarities and defacements which force themselves upon us, all of these modes

21:41.500 --> 21:47.540
of experience are sufficiently abstracted to be relatively obvious, and yet evidently

21:47.540 --> 21:51.060
they disclose the very meaning of things.

21:51.060 --> 21:55.740
Again, the statement about value and meaning.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.780
So there's possibilities of value, there's possibilities of meaning that are in the nature

21:58.780 --> 21:59.780
of things.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.700
And so the focus is absolutely right on.

22:01.700 --> 22:07.620
It's not we who originate the possibility of truth, goodness, or beauty in the cosmos.

22:07.620 --> 22:13.540
He says, I see value as intrinsic to the universe, and the possibility of appreciating and responding

22:13.540 --> 22:20.740
to value, therefore fulfilling its potential as one reason for the cosmos to have evolved

22:20.740 --> 22:22.660
for life.

22:22.660 --> 22:28.500
And yet arguably in a Weltanschau, which sees value as an ontological primitive, we might

22:28.540 --> 22:33.180
have grounds to say that value is not just one reason for the universe to have evolved,

22:33.180 --> 22:40.180
but the reason the universe has evolved, the reason, hypothetically, we have a universe

22:40.180 --> 22:41.180
at all.

22:41.180 --> 22:46.780
Okay, so we've seen five propositions as lures for your feeling, invitations for your attention.

22:46.780 --> 22:51.980
One, the cosmos is not anthropomorphic, human beings are anthropocosmic.

22:51.980 --> 22:57.500
Two, what the cosmos proclaims in human experience is value.

22:58.300 --> 23:05.300
Three, where there is any value, there is an intended spectrum or hierarchy of values.

23:05.300 --> 23:10.740
Four, in the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values

23:10.740 --> 23:15.020
which are inclusive and lower values which are exclusive.

23:15.020 --> 23:20.260
And five, that the reason or the meaning of the world and life itself consists in its

23:20.260 --> 23:26.260
ability to respond to the proclamations of positive value, which asymmetrically ground

23:26.300 --> 23:28.980
its being.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.580
And I want to conclude here with a final challenge.

23:32.580 --> 23:36.580
And I think it's a sort of through line that runs through Ian's work, namely the challenge

23:36.580 --> 23:42.940
of moving from a merely propositional way of knowing to a dispositional orientation towards

23:42.940 --> 23:43.940
the world.

23:43.940 --> 23:48.900
What would it be like to develop a kind of attitudinal axiology that is transparent to

23:48.900 --> 23:55.740
these transcendent values, which ground our being, which find expression in us, which

23:55.740 --> 24:01.820
arguably point an arrow over our shoulder towards an arc of human purpose and human

24:01.820 --> 24:02.820
meaning?

24:02.820 --> 24:09.820
And if we could do that, wouldn't that be a way of answering who it is we are and why

24:09.820 --> 24:12.820
it is that we or anything should exist?

24:12.820 --> 24:13.820
Thank you.
