0	7920	Okay, it's no small thing to go last at a conference such as this, and one might hope
7920	12520	of the final presentation that it says something of what this all comes to in some deep and
12520	13520	abiding sense.
13520	17400	Of course, that's going to be very difficult because we've been wrestling with a lot of
17400	21440	different confers being's work over the last couple of days, and nevertheless, I'm going
21440	27160	to try to do so and I hope compelling an interesting way, and we're going to see what happens.
27160	30760	So let me frame the discussion first.
30760	35840	What I so love about Ian's recent work is that he's not, in the least, shied away from
35840	38720	asking some truly fundamental metaphysical questions.
38720	44680	In fact, these questions in many ways pervade the work, and yet, I think a discerning reader
44680	50560	finds that two fundamental questions in particular frame the entire discussion, the tangled answers
50560	57680	of which are slowly developed or at least suggested throughout 28, I think, scintillating
57680	58680	chapters.
58680	64920	So on the front end, even before the table of contents, the question of Plotinus, but
64920	68080	we, who are we?
68080	74240	It's a question that Ian returns to occasionally throughout the book, and on the back end,
74240	79040	on the first page of Chapter 28, the final chapter of the book, it is the question of
79040	83600	being, the question of Heidegger, the question of Leibniz, the question that has haunted the
83600	87720	philosophical tradition, namely, why is there something rather than nothing?
87720	91960	These two monumental questions, of course, there's a relationship between the questions
91960	96320	of some tangled nature, and you might argue that the way you answer one question is going
96320	100680	to implicate how you answer the other, and at least what's part of the matter with things
100680	105560	is that we have no orienting space or position from which to answer these questions.
105560	112240	We do not know who we are, we don't know why we or anything exist, and of course, there's
112240	116560	an apophatic dimension to Ian's thought, too, he's more concerned, I'd say, with keeping
116560	121400	those fundamental questions alive, rather than answering them and saying, here's the
121400	127160	certain answer, that would be too, a leptomysphere approach, and nevertheless, I think he has
127160	133560	developed a profound metaphysics of parameters, metaphysical parameters for offering an answer
133560	138080	to these questions, or at least an entry point to these questions in terms of value, in terms
138080	139080	of axiology.
139080	144160	So I want to try to do that today with you, and I want to do so in five propositions.
144160	148440	So a word about propositions first, Matt had reminded us, it's come up several times, I
148440	154120	follow Whitehead in this, propositions should not just be reduced to the verbal content
154120	158680	of logical justification, propositions are not just about declarative statements of
158680	161360	fact, whether it's your fault.
161360	164600	They include that, but there's more to our engagement with propositions for Whitehead.
164600	171440	So instead, when I speak of propositions today, I'm speaking as lures for feeling, or Whitehead
171440	177040	will speak of propositional feelings as the way we feel our way into the content of propositions
177040	178040	as potentials.
178040	185320	In fact, maybe a better way to put it is that propositions are invitations for your feeling,
185320	186920	invitations for your attention.
186920	190040	And so when I use the language propositions, let's think about it in that sense, lures
190040	192280	for your feeling, lures for your attention.
192280	196880	And I want to embed these five propositions in a constellation of different resources
196880	197880	and quotations.
197880	203240	Another thing I so love about Ian's book is the entire argument is carried along by his
203240	209280	immense amount of resources, wonderful quotations, there's something to be valued about a quotation
209280	218640	which fits perfectly, an argument that's being made, and I think you demonstrated that brilliantly.
218640	221360	Question one, first lure for your feeling.
221360	226800	The cosmos is not anthropomorphic, rather, human beings are anthropocosmic.
226800	232160	In other words, we are an expression of this cosmos and not a deviation from it.
232160	234480	I like this language of anthropocosmic.
234480	238360	I thought I had invented it a few months ago, but it's usually the case you find somebody
238360	239760	got there before you.
239760	245720	Okay, in this case, Harvard Confucian scholar, Tuwei Ming, who says, in this view, human beings
245720	250480	are not merely creatures, but co-creators of the cosmic process.
250480	254400	We must take responsibility, he says, for this anthropocosmic interplay.
254400	256920	It's a beautiful way of expressing it.
256920	259120	Of course, he wasn't alone.
259120	262920	Nikolai Bardaev, one of my favorite Russian scholars, the knowledge of man rests upon
262920	267280	the supposition that man is cosmic in his nature.
267280	273800	The French Jesuit priest, Tehard, the person, the human monad is like every monad, essentially
273800	279840	cosmic, or one of my favorites, Raimundo Panicar, Spanish scholar.
279840	282760	The human community is not limited to its fellow human creatures.
282760	289280	The human community is also cosmic, since the human being is an integral and even constitutive
289280	291360	part of the cosmos itself.
291360	297720	Of course, it's an ancient insight that we are part of the cosmos and not a part from
297720	298720	it.
298720	301680	But it's one that we forgot, certainly in many ways, in the development of modern
301680	302680	philosophy.
302680	306480	It's one we hear forgotten in pithy statements uttered by popular scientists.
306480	313880	For example, consider a tweet exchange, 2019, between the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse
313880	314880	Tyson.
314880	319760	We all know who deGrasse Tyson is, and a brilliant response, I think, by the late comedian Norm
319760	320760	McDonald.
320760	324920	So Tyson gets up early in the morning at 6 a.m. of some kind.
324920	330840	He tweets to his very large following, the universe is blind to our sorrows and indifferent
330840	332360	to our pains.
332360	333360	Have a nice day.
333360	337120	It's a great way to start the morning.
337120	342160	To which McDonald, I think, brilliantly responds, Neil, there's a logic flaw in your little
342160	344560	aphorism that seems quite telling.
344560	349360	Since you and I are part of the universe, we would also be indifferent and uncaring.
349360	354160	Perhaps you forgot, Neil, that we are not superior to the universe, but merely a fraction
354160	355160	of it.
355160	363040	Have a nice day indeed.
363040	367960	So the logic flaw that Norm is pointing to is that Neil can only utter these statements
367960	372240	by removing his own existence and experience out of the universe, as if it tells him nothing
372240	374840	about the universe at large.
374840	379520	After all, we're hardly the kinds of beings who are blind to sorrow and indifferent by
379520	380520	pain.
380520	384360	In fact, at individual and cultural levels, if that's the case, we usually see those as
384360	386440	moral faults, rightly.
386440	391720	So Norm is pointing to this abstraction of the human element, the neglect to realize
391720	397080	this anthropocosmic interplay as two-way-me put it.
397080	402000	And so I think at the heart of Ian's work is a countering of this kind of pithy statement
402000	403000	by Negras Tyson.
403000	407080	And here I want to quote Ian's response as if it were somewhat of a response to statements
407080	408240	like those of Tyson.
408240	412800	So Ian says, there's a parallel between the false view that we are separate from and
412800	418280	over against nature and the idea that we are separate from and over against the cosmos.
418280	420800	This cannot be true for the same reason in either case.
420800	425040	We were born out of and returned to the one and the other.
425040	433160	It therefore makes no sense, Neil, to set us up as proud, lonely, tragic figures struggling
433160	440000	against nature, trying to subdue her or trying to defiantly, trying defiantly to bring love,
440000	444160	goodness, and beauty into a hostile cosmos.
444160	449120	Any love, goodness, and beauty we can bring come out of nature and out of the cosmos in
449120	450120	the first place.
450120	452600	Where else can they come from?
452600	455680	Where indeed.
455680	460720	So the central thrust of this first lure for your feeling is that our anthropocosmic experience
460720	467680	speaks of the cosmos at large and the cosmos also speaks in human experience.
467680	469720	But what does it say?
469720	475600	In part, it's pointing the direction as to what it says in that statement that I read.
475600	479960	Second proposition, second lure for your attention.
479960	483640	What the cosmos proclaims or speaks in human experience is value.
483640	488200	And here I want to turn to Whitehead and Shailer.
488200	489200	Consider Whitehead.
489200	492720	He says, our enjoyment of actuality is a realization of worth, good, or bad.
492720	494760	It is value experience.
494760	497720	Its basic expression is, have a care.
497720	499240	Here is something that matters.
499240	500960	Yes, he says.
500960	501960	That's the best phrase.
501960	507040	The primary glimmerings of consciousness reveals something that matters.
507040	512400	So here's Whitehead's statement with McGillchrist about the mattering with or of things.
512400	515200	For both thinkers, the universe is not made of aqueous dead matter.
515200	518160	It's more accurate to say it's made of what matters.
518160	523160	It's made of meaning and meaning for consciousness, meaning for experience.
523160	528040	Now similarly, Shailer, who's influenced Ian quite a bit, speaks of a pure value quality
528040	531160	which is first given and felt experience.
531160	536120	He uses this great analogy of color, right, just as colors are given in visual perception
536120	537120	through seeing them.
537120	542600	So too values are given in value-ception, a mode of feeling through feeling that.
542600	548760	And value-ception is deeper than conception, deeper than perception arguably for Shailer.
548760	551080	But I like this analogy of color.
551080	554800	If I were to show you a patch of green, for example, on the screen, we wouldn't have to
554800	558240	sit back and analytically deduce what color is it that we're looking at.
558240	562440	It announces itself to us, it proclaims itself to us.
562440	565760	And there's something almost trans-temporal about color too.
565760	570800	The green on the screen hypothetically would be connected in some way to the green of an
570800	574240	ancient reed in the Nile Delta, say.
574240	577640	We don't simply invent that.
577640	579400	We find it imposed upon us.
579400	581720	We discover it in a certain sense.
581720	587560	And part of Ian's argument is that we approach value in a similar kind of way.
587560	592800	The customary way to think of values is to see them as piggybacking on and arising out
592800	596320	of our consciousness, a human invention.
596320	600960	An alternative view is that values are not invented but discovered and disclosed, and
600960	604520	it takes life to discover and disclose them.
604520	609960	That they declare themselves in and through the responses of living beings to the world
610000	613200	and the world's response to them.
613200	618120	Okay, so the central thrust of the second proposition shared in different ways by Shaler,
618120	619560	by Whitehead, by McGilchrist.
619560	622840	The declaration of experience is value.
622840	630200	All experience is value experience, and experience is the feeling of value.
630200	632240	Okay, well, what else can we say about value?
632240	635160	Let's go a little bit deeper.
635160	637440	Proposition three.
637480	643480	Where there is any value, there is an attendant spectrum or hierarchy of values.
643480	646200	I want to return to Shaler here.
646200	647480	Note his statement.
647480	652360	In the totality of the realm of values, there exists a single order of ranks that all values
652360	654320	possess among themselves.
654320	658560	It is because of this that a value is higher or lower than another.
658560	664040	This order lies, he says, in the essence of values themselves and as does the difference
664040	666640	between positive and negative values.
666640	669840	It does not simply belong to values known by us.
669840	676160	So here's a statement of Shaler's, an objective ordering of values of some kind that is what
676160	680000	it is independent of what I arguably think about it.
680000	685240	Now, I've come to appreciate Shaler's work through reading your work Ian, and in particular
685240	686680	his hierarchy of values.
686680	691280	We've often seen this often a pyramid structure of five different hierarchies, the lowest
691280	698000	being utility, values of usefulness, moving up to values, essential values, virtue values,
698000	702440	values, wisdom, truth, beauty, goodness, values of the sacred, the holy.
702440	709160	Again, part of the matter with things is that we've inverted this hierarchy so that values
709160	714120	of utility and usefulness are at the top, the values of holiness and sacred are often
714120	716480	at the bottom.
716480	719360	This pyramid is often presented in different shades of color as well.
719480	727200	I like the analogy of color, it's as if values are the colors of our feelings in some way.
727200	731440	You can no more abstract, say, a single color from the entire spectrum of color, the hierarchy
731440	735960	of color of which it is a part, than you can say a single value from the whole qualitative
735960	738160	spectrum of values of which it is a part.
738160	742160	Arguably, there's an interesting, I like that analogy quite a bit.
742160	747800	So for Shaler, we face this hierarchy in some sense in our experience, but some sort of
747800	751240	value hierarchy is not confined to our experience.
751240	755280	So let's turn to Whitehead here, for example, one of my favorite statements.
755280	760000	He says, on a grand scale, our cosmology discloses a process of overpowering change
760000	765640	from nebula to stars, stars to planets, from inorganic matter to life, from life to reason
765640	767480	and moral responsibility.
767480	773960	What is going on, at least in part for Whitehead, cosmic evolution is in the business of achievements
773960	778360	of value, which weave into higher achievements of value, which make possible the dawning
778360	783120	of deeper kinds of value, for example, this dawning of moral responsibility, this dawning
783120	786040	of moral intuition.
786040	789440	The problem of evolution, Whitehead says, is the development of enduring harmonies of
789440	794840	enduring shapes of value, which merge into higher attainments beyond themselves.
794840	798160	Aesthetic attainment, he says, is interwoven with the texture of realization.
798160	803160	So Whitehead aesthetic value is the widest and most inclusive form of value that's applicable
803160	806720	to the universe.
806720	811160	It's in this life that Hartzor and his assistant, for a time, says that the most general principles
811160	816760	of harmony and intensity are more ultimate than the laws of physics and the reason for
816760	820400	there being natural laws, provocative.
820400	823880	Harmony intensity are aesthetic principles that are deeper than laws of physics precisely
823880	826680	because they're embodied within them.
826680	831340	And here, again, he's reflecting Whitehead, who says it's not the case that we have an
831340	834420	actual world which happens to exhibit an order of nature.
834420	838780	He says, we have a world because there is a more fundamental order of nature.
838780	844940	He follows that saying all order is aesthetic order and the moral order is merely certain
844940	847220	aspects of the aesthetic order.
847220	854220	Now Ian, on occasion, has had time to push back at that because it might risk reducing
854220	857660	moral value to aesthetic value or something to be said for that.
857660	863420	But I think what Whitehead is doing is situating the advent of moral value across an evolutionary
863420	868460	spectrum from more primal experiences of aesthetic intensity, aesthetic harmony.
868460	874940	After all, the formation of protons and electrons was aesthetically intense in terms of harmony
874940	879580	and intensity and order, but it doesn't seem that moral value arguably would apply at that
879580	882260	level to those occurrences.
882260	888060	So I think it's a statement about an arc of evolutionary experience that runs from
888060	891740	the aesthetic all the way in very high forms to the moral.
891740	894900	After all, there's the harmony of a human life, which is both an aesthetic and a moral
894900	895900	concept.
895900	904820	Okay, the third thrust then of this, the third principle, human experience and both cosmological
904820	910020	and biological evolution arguably presuppose this hierarchy of values, this continuum,
910020	913620	but hearts are called the effective continuum of felt values.
913620	917180	Okay, but we can still go deeper, I think.
917180	921540	Fourth proposition, fourth lure for your feeling, for your invitation.
921540	928180	In the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values, which are inclusive
928180	931580	and lower values, which are exclusive.
931580	936420	And I want to quote here James, quote by William James, which Ian also quotes, this is a beautiful
936420	939380	expression of this and it's reflective.
939380	944020	James says, looking back on my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight
944020	948420	to which I cannot help ascribe some metaphysical significance.
948420	952060	The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation.
952060	956380	It's as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoryness and conflict make all our
956380	964020	difficulties and troubles, were melded into unity, not only do they as contrasted species
964020	971180	belong to one and the same genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one,
971180	976740	is itself the genus, which so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself.
976740	982220	It's just a beautiful statement by James, the kind of asymmetry among opposites and
982220	983780	I love the way Ian describes this.
983780	988860	He says this statement is one that speaks of the equal necessity, but the unequal status
988860	993420	of spiritual opposites in the universe.
993420	999540	So both thinkers are haunted by, well, a kind of axiological asymmetry.
999540	1004180	So consider a few axiological co-ans, if you will.
1004180	1009500	Is it the case in some sense that love can include hate without being diminished, but
1009500	1014980	hate cannot include love without being extinguished?
1014980	1020060	Goodness we might say can include evil without being diminished, but evil cannot include
1020060	1023580	goodness without being extinguished.
1023580	1029140	Harmony we might say can include discord without being diminished, but discord cannot include
1029140	1038180	harmony without being extinguished, or order perhaps can include chaos without being diminished,
1038180	1040820	but chaos cannot include order without being extinguished.
1040820	1045860	And of course we can argue about those and what I'm pointing to is this haunting sense
1045860	1050980	of axiological asymmetry that seems to be there in the nature of things, but it's not
1050980	1052580	just axiological asymmetry.
1052580	1057820	So Ian has argued at various lengths to point to various other asymmetries and his quote
1057820	1061020	of Louis Pasteur I think is instructive in this regard.
1061020	1065260	So Pasteur says the universe as a whole is asymmetrical.
1065260	1071180	Life is dominated by the effects of asymmetrical forces whose enveloping cosmic existence we
1071180	1073780	sense intuitively.
1073780	1079540	I would even say Pasteur continues that living species are primordially in their structure,
1079540	1085580	in their external forms, functions of cosmic asymmetry.
1085580	1091300	So the central thrust of the fourth principle then that we intuit value as a kind of cosmic
1091300	1095460	asymmetrical force in some way.
1095460	1099740	And if that's the case, wouldn't that begin to shed light on the foundations of being
1099740	1100740	itself?
1101220	1106380	Wouldn't that give us perhaps grounds to begin to speak to the reason for or the meaning
1106380	1109260	of existence as such?
1109260	1113660	Okay, fifth and final proposition.
1113660	1117740	Namely at the reason or say the meaning for the world and life itself consists in its
1117740	1125660	ability to respond to the positive proclamations of value which asymmetrically grounded speaking.
1125660	1129260	And there's a number of things we can point to here.
1129300	1135740	In quotes rightly, I think Thomas Nagel's striking statement that value is not an accidental
1135740	1140860	side effect of life, rather there is life because life is a necessary condition of value.
1140860	1143740	So here's a statement that value itself is deeper than life.
1143740	1148500	You don't have value because of life, you have life because of value, value is the deeper
1148500	1149500	concept.
1149500	1154500	Similarly, Philip Goff and his recent work is along the similar kinds of lines, speaking
1154500	1160740	of fundamental facts that are as basic as the axioms of mathematics or the laws of physics,
1160740	1165540	facts of better and worse, or facts about how people ought to behave and he says value
1165540	1171340	facts if there are any must be primitive facts in their own right to say that they're primitive
1171340	1177940	means that in some sense they're necessary, return on some deep sense.
1177940	1183300	Now Goff is re-energizing deeper work that is done by John Leslie, the Canadian British
1183300	1189220	Canadian philosopher, his axiarchism, which says necessarily, eternally, there can be
1189220	1195620	ethical requirements for the existence of various things, needs for them to exist.
1195620	1199420	So for Leslie, the reason we have existence as such, the reason we have a world is because
1199420	1201420	it satisfies an ethical need for it.
1201420	1206300	Ultimately, we have a world because it's good that it exists.
1206300	1209460	And when we get to the element of goodness, we're at a stopping point, we've given an
1209460	1214620	axiological answer for why there is anything challenging.
1214620	1218860	Now Whitehead can be seen as part of this, for example, in a combined statement, all
1218860	1222900	ultimate reasons he says are in terms of an aim at value.
1222900	1228860	Life exists for its own sake as the intrinsic reaping of value, and that existence is the
1228860	1235580	upholding of value intensity, that existence already is an achievement of value.
1235580	1240660	So these different statements, constellation of statements, are beginning to reason the
1240660	1243100	reason for being, the reason for the world.
1243100	1244460	Maybe we can answer in terms of value.
1244460	1246420	What about the meaning of the world?
1246420	1253260	And Olosky, Russian existential scholar, value is something which pervades everything.
1253260	1259180	It determines the meaning of the world as a whole, as well as the meaning of every person.
1259180	1265340	Everything that exists, and even everything that may exist, there's that domain of possibility,
1265340	1270900	is of such nature that it not only exists, but contains within itself either the justification
1270900	1276300	or the condemnation of its being.
1276300	1279460	Whitehead on meaning.
1279460	1284100	And in fact, this is just a partial statement, but Whitehead is responding to the question
1284100	1289820	of where is it that he thinks philosophy should start, and the statement is a part of his
1289820	1290820	answer.
1290820	1296180	He says, our enjoyment of the values of human art, or of natural beauty, our horror at the
1296180	1301500	obvious vulgarities and defacements which force themselves upon us, all of these modes
1301500	1307540	of experience are sufficiently abstracted to be relatively obvious, and yet evidently
1307540	1311060	they disclose the very meaning of things.
1311060	1315740	Again, the statement about value and meaning.
1315740	1318780	So there's possibilities of value, there's possibilities of meaning that are in the nature
1318780	1319780	of things.
1319780	1321700	And so the focus is absolutely right on.
1321700	1327620	It's not we who originate the possibility of truth, goodness, or beauty in the cosmos.
1327620	1333540	He says, I see value as intrinsic to the universe, and the possibility of appreciating and responding
1333540	1340740	to value, therefore fulfilling its potential as one reason for the cosmos to have evolved
1340740	1342660	for life.
1342660	1348500	And yet arguably in a Weltanschau, which sees value as an ontological primitive, we might
1348540	1353180	have grounds to say that value is not just one reason for the universe to have evolved,
1353180	1360180	but the reason the universe has evolved, the reason, hypothetically, we have a universe
1360180	1361180	at all.
1361180	1366780	Okay, so we've seen five propositions as lures for your feeling, invitations for your attention.
1366780	1371980	One, the cosmos is not anthropomorphic, human beings are anthropocosmic.
1371980	1377500	Two, what the cosmos proclaims in human experience is value.
1378300	1385300	Three, where there is any value, there is an intended spectrum or hierarchy of values.
1385300	1390740	Four, in the hierarchy of values, there's an asymmetrical relation among higher values
1390740	1395020	which are inclusive and lower values which are exclusive.
1395020	1400260	And five, that the reason or the meaning of the world and life itself consists in its
1400260	1406260	ability to respond to the proclamations of positive value, which asymmetrically ground
1406300	1408980	its being.
1408980	1412580	And I want to conclude here with a final challenge.
1412580	1416580	And I think it's a sort of through line that runs through Ian's work, namely the challenge
1416580	1422940	of moving from a merely propositional way of knowing to a dispositional orientation towards
1422940	1423940	the world.
1423940	1428900	What would it be like to develop a kind of attitudinal axiology that is transparent to
1428900	1435740	these transcendent values, which ground our being, which find expression in us, which
1435740	1441820	arguably point an arrow over our shoulder towards an arc of human purpose and human
1441820	1442820	meaning?
1442820	1449820	And if we could do that, wouldn't that be a way of answering who it is we are and why
1449820	1452820	it is that we or anything should exist?
1452820	1453820	Thank you.
