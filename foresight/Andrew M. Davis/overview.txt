Checking Andrew M. Davis/Axiological Asymmetry and the Reason for Being ï½œ Andrew M. Davis.txt
1. The cosmos is not human-centered but humanity is deeply embedded within the cosmos (anthropocosmic).
2. The values inherent in the cosmos are proclaimed through human experiences, suggesting that value is a fundamental aspect of the universe.
3. Within the spectrum or hierarchy of values, some values are given greater importance and are considered higher or more inclusive.
4. There is an asymmetry in the hierarchy of values, where higher values encompass and give meaning to lower values, which are more exclusive.
5. The existence of the world and life itself may be grounded in its intrinsic ability to respond to and realize positive value, which asymmetrically sustains its being.
6. The challenge lies in moving from an intellectual understanding (propositional knowledge) to a way of being that is attuned to these transcendent values (dispositional orientation).
7. Developing such an attitudinal axiology could provide an answer to the purpose and meaning of human existence, grounded in the cosmos' inherent value.

The speaker suggests that by aligning ourselves with these fundamental values, we can find a deeper understanding of our place in the universe and the reason for the existence of all things. This approach seeks to integrate ethics, ontology, and metaphysics into a coherent worldview that sees value as the cornerstone of reality.
