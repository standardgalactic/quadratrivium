1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Would you like to know more?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello, Malcolm.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, Simone.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
I love your response.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,320
I love that it is your signature greeting with people,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,920
very high energy.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,240
But I also think it is an element of your social autopilot.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,160
Not that I don't have a social autopilot.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm on that right now.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
But I think that's a really interesting part of human

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,320
existence, because for the vast majority of our lives,

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,680
I don't think we're actually, let alone not sapient,

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,160
not even really conscious, not even really aware

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,880
of what's going on.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,160
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,320
And I think it's so arrogant when people pretend

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,960
that they are aware of most of their lives.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
We talk about something called road hypnosis,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,240
where they look back on a drive and they're like,

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,080
I don't remember what I was doing during the drive.

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,360
Their brain just shuts off recording.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,120
And the question is, how much of our life is road hypnosis?

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,320
And I think it's a huge portion of our life.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,000
And it's something, this is what initially got us talking

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560
about consciousness early in our relationship,

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,400
was how do we at least enter moments of lucidity

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
where we are aware of what's going on,

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,920
somewhat sentient, just long enough

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,400
to be able to change things about the internal self

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
model that does run our autopilot.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
So that at least in the majority of the life

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
when we are on autopilot, we are better serving our values,

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,880
better people, more productive, more

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,280
emotionally in control, et cetera.

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,360
And I think our thought on consciousness

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
really evolved in interesting directions

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,760
from there when we started really

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,360
thinking about what consciousness means

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,640
and why maybe it exists.

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,320
So I think this will be really fun to talk about.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Why don't you talk a bit about what you think

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,440
sentience is?

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,360
I think sentience, our experience of consciousness,

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,720
in other words, is really an emergent property

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,080
of a memory compression system.

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,960
So imagine you have a building security system

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
with tons of different inputs.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a feed of doors opening and closing

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,760
within the building, a bunch of different camera feeds,

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,360
a chemical monitoring system coming in,

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,600
everything's feeding into this one control room

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,520
and then being put into a camera feed

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,640
and then being stored in memory.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
And there's a man watching the security feed.

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,520
And I think that's our experience of consciousness

56
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,120
is that our minds are synthesizing, smell, sight,

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,400
hormonal fluctuations going on, a lot of very complex inputs.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,320
They're synthesizing them into something

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,440
that can be compressed into unified memory,

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,240
which if relevant will be stored in long-term memory

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,440
and then in turn influence automatic instinctual responses.

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
And because this memory is being codified

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,560
and in the moment it's being run through a camera system,

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,960
we're getting the impression that there

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,920
is some kind of observed conscious driver that

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,080
is running consciousness.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm going to run this back to you.

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
It's almost like what you're saying is,

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
this guy who is sitting at this feed,

70
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,120
he is collecting all of these different camera inputs,

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,200
all of these different sensory inputs,

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,120
and they are encoded in this single quote unquote

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,520
experience, which is being written into the hard drive

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,000
of this computer.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,080
And when he is referencing what happened in the past,

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,480
when anybody is referencing what happened in the past

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,680
within this big security array, they

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,920
are referencing this encoding.

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,040
And it is because they are referencing this encoding,

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
it creates the perception falsely

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,240
so that the way this encoding works

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
is the way that these things are being

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
experienced in the moment.

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,800
But it isn't, actually.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,080
Well, Ann, that there is some intentional driver

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,880
that's shaping each decision intentionally

87
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,200
through that interface, essentially.

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Whereas the interface only actually

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,160
affects, in so far, the memory itself influences

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
automatic reactions.

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,760
So I think the research supports this.

92
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,440
We automatically respond to things.

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,160
We automatically start taking action in response

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,080
to stimulus before we have some kind of conscious

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,040
understanding that we're doing that.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,360
And our memories absolutely, yeah, MRI missions

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
have shown this.

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,160
And while our memories will influence those responses,

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,760
our current experience of consciousness

100
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,120
is not in the driver's seat.

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
It is just passively experiencing

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,560
this encoding of memories.

103
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,240
It believes this in the driver's seat.

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,120
I think that this is what's really interesting,

105
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,840
is it will apply this feeling of consciousness

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,640
to any experience that you're doing

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,000
or any action that you're taking.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
So when you're doing open brain surgery on someone,

109
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,320
you need to keep them awake to prevent accidentally cutting

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,640
part of the brain you're not supposed to, so they'll check.

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,520
You can do things like apply a small amount of electricity

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,120
to a part of the brain and get the person to move their hand.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
And then you ask them, why did you move your hand?

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,680
And they'll say, oh, I felt like moving my hand.

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,480
And you can also see this with split brain patients.

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,960
These are patients where the corpus callosum is split

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
in their head, and their right brain and their left brain

118
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,640
actually function pretty independently of each other

119
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,040
when this happens.

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,160
So you can cover one eye and communicate

121
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
with part of their brain and not the other part of the brain.

122
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
So you can tell part of their brain, pick up a Rubik's Cube

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
and try to solve it.

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
Then you put something on the other eye

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,360
and you ask, OK, why did you do that?

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,480
And they'll say, oh, I always felt like solving a Rubik's Cube.

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,760
I always wanted to do this.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,640
And you can do this with more complicated things.

129
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,040
So there's this experiment, really great one,

130
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,520
where they would give people pictures of attractive women

131
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,920
and they say, which is the most attractive?

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
And then they do a little sleight of hand later and say, OK,

133
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
why did you say this one was the most attractive?

134
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
But it wasn't the one they chose.

135
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
You'd actually replace it with another picture.

136
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,360
I mean, you could do this with political beliefs as well

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,680
and all sorts of other things.

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,120
And most people will say, oh, I chose this person for x, y,

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,840
z reasons and go into detail about why they chose that person.

140
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,500
Even though that wasn't the person they chose, which shows

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,720
that a lot of our consciousness, a lot of the way

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
that we describe our sentence is more

143
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,940
like sense-making of our environment.

144
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,920
We know we made x decision, but X decision was actually

145
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,560
made completely outside of our sentence as control.

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,480
And then we have this little lying historian

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,520
in our head, which is like, no, I made the decision.

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,560
I made the decision.

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,320
I made every decision.

150
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,260
But he's also recording the history

151
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,060
you remember. So then he's going through and saying, okay, I made the decision for this. It's not that

152
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,580
he doesn't have any say. See, this is where he does have a say in it, something that you mentioned,

153
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,580
which is that he can encode emotions into the things we're doing. And this can actually cause a

154
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,860
lot of... No, emotion isn't the right word, because emotions do, you know, let's say that...

155
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,100
Emotional narratives. Emotional, yeah. So they can encode positive or negative modifiers and

156
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,300
they can shift the narrative. They can change the camera angle or add sad music to something,

157
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,460
essentially, to make it seem like a sad scene. You've seen the YouTube video of the Mary Poppins

158
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:26,620
preview, but done with scary music, and it just seems horrifying. So that's how we can change...

159
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,580
Yeah, that is how we can change the narrative. And the first time I was ever introduced to this idea

160
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,620
that we take action before we consciously are aware of it, the person discussing it said that

161
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,420
there's a lot of implications to this because it would lead many people to believe that they don't

162
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,820
have free will and have them just say, oh, none of this is my fault. I didn't consciously make this

163
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,060
decision anyway, where that's really not quite, we would say the right conclusion, because you

164
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:00,940
do have the ability to color how you perceive reality. It's not in this kind of immediate,

165
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,500
non-asynchronous way that you would expect. I would say that this is just the myth of humanity

166
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,700
versus the actuality of humanity. And we would argue that we likely evolved this ability because

167
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,300
it was like a compression algorithm for communicating ideas to other people. I actually don't suspect

168
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,220
that Great 8 have this sort of internal thing that we call consciousness because they didn't

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,700
need to communicate these. It's a really good compression algorithm for linear experiences

170
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:30,060
over time. But one of the big lies that happens throughout this process is it convinces us that

171
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,060
we are a singular entity, when in fact our brains function much more like we see AI's function with

172
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,700
individual instances running. And we can see this with the corpus callosum split that I mentioned

173
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,940
earlier, where it basically means that we have two largely separate parts of our internal mental

174
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,140
processing that are happening separate from each other. This idea that the decisions you make happen

175
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,060
before they enter your conscious mind, what that basically means is you have another part of your

176
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,260
brain which is making this decision and then delivers it to the conscious mind. When we were

177
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:09,260
talking about the idea of a security camera with a bunch of different feeds, a lot of the

178
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,260
processing is done locally at these various security cameras before they all get centralized into this

179
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,340
sort of communal feed with many of the quote unquote decisions being made at those local levels.

180
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:29,500
And so we have this illusion of ourselves as a singular entity, which is created by the way

181
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,620
this sort of sentience processor works. But it is just an illusion. And so when we say, oh,

182
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,140
we don't really have self-control or we're not responsible for our decisions, I think that

183
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:49,020
actually even overstates the level to which we exist in any sort of a meaningful concept

184
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,940
close to how we think we exist. And so then there's this, I would say, added layer of

185
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,780
complexity or maybe confusion. You shared with me an article saying that a very high

186
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,980
percentage of people don't have an internal monologue. What we would describe as-

187
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,260
Yeah, they don't have an internal monologue. Another high percentage of people can't even

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,780
create images in their mind. And so what we're even describing as consciousness is also not

189
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:24,700
even something that is universal as part of the human experience, which is interesting.

190
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:33,340
Because I think most of us who experience consciousness as we're describing it would

191
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,740
have a very hard time understanding even what that means. I don't know, maybe someone watching

192
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,820
this YouTube video doesn't have an internal monologue. I wonder-

193
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,860
It's hard for you to model that, but I suspect that the human, the variance within the human

194
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,980
condition in terms of how things are processed is probably a lot larger than we give it credit for,

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,220
and it will be even larger in the future. A statistic that I just cannot stop mentioning

196
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,060
because it's something that more people should know, that if you look at the heredity of IQ

197
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,860
right now and you look at the selective pressure, so you look at the number of people who have these

198
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,740
markers versus people who don't have these markers, which you can see because it's genetic

199
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,500
work, as it says you, is this the number of kids they have. We're likely looking at a one standard

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,140
deviation shift down in IQ in the next 75 years in developed countries at least. This is probably

201
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,220
going to affect developing countries later. So I guess good for them. There'll be all the geniuses

202
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,180
in the world. We'll be in Africa or whatever, but places where you have this post prosperity,

203
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:33,420
fertility, collapse situation. And when we think about how quickly and how much human IQ can shift

204
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,860
up or down, we use this one marker IQ, but I suspect it's linked to just all sorts of things

205
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,140
about how we process reality. So actually I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the subject

206
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:51,820
of kids because I think that also as we've become parents, we've had a more complex understanding

207
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,020
of how consciousness develops because we see it start to emerge in our kids. I think there's

208
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,260
definitely this point at which we see consciousness blossoming and it's not one day our kids aren't

209
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,620
very conscious and the next they are. I think that consciousness for example is starting to emerge more

210
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,020
and more especially in our three-year-old. It's just beginning to emerge in our two-year-old. And

211
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,420
I think a lot of that has to do with where they are with language processing. I think it really

212
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:27,340
influences. That's why I suspect this had to do, it evolved alongside language to compress ideas,

213
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,100
but I think that this is where you can see how this system can break in a way that can be very

214
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,100
useful in relationships. So this isn't just like theory or whatever. So one of the things you'll

215
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,220
often see one of our kids do is he'll be in a bad mood, but he won't understand the concept of

216
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,860
generally being in a bad mood. So he'll start crying and he'll say, I want this. Give me that

217
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,420
toy and then you get him the toy and he just, it doesn't stop the bad mood. And so he needs

218
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,980
whatever he notices next, close the door or move that chair. Like he just was like whatever

219
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,340
is currently causing the littlest bit of discomfort, he thinks it's the core cause

220
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,740
of like this bad mood or why he's angry or what he's angry about. And as humans, I think this

221
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,620
happens as well. And this is really bad when a friend tells you you're justified to have an angry

222
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,700
state or something like that, because then this little narrative maker in your head says, ah,

223
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,700
now you get to be angry. Now you're socially justified to be angry and you will feel very

224
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,020
angry about something or you might be in a generally bad mood and your partner comes into

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,060
the house and he does something that just annoys you in the slightest. And then you create the

226
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,140
internal narrative that you are in this bad mood because of what your partner did. And when you

227
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,100
keep in mind why you're feeling these things and you try to keep like fully in touch with the way

228
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,340
your brain is actually working, it leads to a lot more harmony and a lot fewer fights and

229
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,540
relationships because you have language for I am in a bad overlay state right now,

230
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,780
which just means I'm in a bad mood generally, but I'm not actually mad at you or anything specific.

231
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,380
Hold on though, actually, I think you've touched on something very interesting there,

232
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:09,020
which is that maybe sometimes consciousness and narrative building hampers more than helps

233
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:16,140
us. For example, like the toxic girlfriend who has a bad dream in which her boyfriend

234
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:23,180
cheats on her, she wakes up angry at him, like she's mad at him for something he can actually do,

235
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,860
or maybe one day she's just in a bad mood, but then she makes up some narrative about

236
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,860
it's because her boyfriend didn't bring her flowers and doesn't appreciate her,

237
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,220
some he did something mean. The presence of consciousness and the presence of narrative

238
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,700
building would cause her to turn what might be just a very transient bad mood into something that

239
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,180
builds a grudge over time and literally ends up killing the relationship,

240
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,820
humiliatively. And sometimes consciousness hampers us more than it helps us.

241
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,260
What I love about what you're saying here, and this follows your idea of what it means to be

242
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,460
meaningfully human and the spectrum of humanity, which is you become more human the more you take

243
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,780
mastery and ownership over the sort of evolved or quirks of the way your brain works, and you

244
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:17,260
don't allow them to control your actions. Your actions are more logically decided and more

245
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,180
decided based on as close to an objective view of reality as you can get. And so from the perspective

246
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,620
of humanity that you convinced me was a good one, because this wasn't the one I had before,

247
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,820
somebody who does that, somebody who has a dream and then can't logically understand that is not

248
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,420
a justified reason to be mad at somebody, that they are like meaningfully less human than another

249
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,660
person. And so then what does it mean to be fully human? It means to have total mastery over these

250
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,860
things. And that is something that we don't have, but I think it helps people understand because

251
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,900
a lot of people hear the level of disdain we talk about things like sentience and love and happiness

252
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,940
and other human emotional states that a lot of people venerate, but they don't understand where

253
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:05,020
that's coming from. But then wouldn't that make an LM more human than we are? People may not know

254
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,780
what it is. A large language model is more sophisticated than we are. And it's also not

255
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:19,180
bogged down by the need for hunger, human failings, hormones, all these sorts of pollutants,

256
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,140
not pollutants. They're very instrumentally useful for biological human in a modern globalized

257
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,620
society and often with the type of knowledge work that humans are expected to do. It's pretty

258
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,220
counterproductive. Well, I think that this comes to your goal for yourself, where your goal and

259
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,460
iteration of yourself that is your idealized iteration would strip out your emotional shortcomings,

260
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:51,260
be they love or happiness or hatred or pain or greed. And I'm not that way, by the way. I am not as

261
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,820
bought into this philosophy as Simone is. I would not strip those things away from myself. I think

262
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:02,780
that they add something that I feel illogically. I still think has some value, but I don't know,

263
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,460
maybe you feel that way too. I'm mixed on it. I'm mixed on it. One, I'm deeply uncomfortable

264
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,140
being human. I really don't like my body. I really don't like being human. I don't like the corruption

265
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:22,140
to our objective functions that human weaknesses cause. But my general stance is if this is what

266
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,100
I have to deal with, if I've been given a meat puppet, I'm going to use it to the max. I'm going

267
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:34,140
to play the game. You've given me a crappy little battlebot. I'm going to take that thing and I'm

268
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,020
going to destroy everything, even if it's the worst machinery ever. I think the way she talks

269
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,100
about pregnancy, she's, I have a uterus. I am going to wreck that thing. I am going to have so many

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:54,700
babies. I'm going to shreds. If that's what it was meant to do. Yeah. Then as a woman, I reached

271
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,140
the planes of Valhalla by dying in childbirth. Let it happen. Don't worry, Malcolm. I promise.

272
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,620
I will play that clip at your funeral. Thank you. I really should probably plan that out.

273
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,860
But yeah, I feel conflicted. I mean, I, yes, if this is the hand that we're dealt, I'm going to

274
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:18,140
play it and I'm going to play it hard. But at the same time, yeah, I really aspire to that. I don't

275
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,900
think that has to be me. And I guess that's, maybe it's more AI and machines are my Beatrice

276
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,460
and Dante's Inferno, this idealized version of humanity that I know I am not and that I do not

277
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,500
aspire to be, but that I deeply admire. I don't need to become it. I don't need to be with it. I

278
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,980
just, I just see it as a better iteration and as naturally and morally superior. Does that make

279
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,700
sense? What you hope is to make our kids superior to that. Oh, for sure. But our kids are still

280
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,660
biological. They're still human. So I think I'm playing the field. I'm pretty sure this next

281
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,860
generation is going to be the first that integrates with tech. I know you say.

282
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,260
Well, our generation is going to integrate with tech. I'm sure that AI models will be trained

283
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:05,020
on if not us family members or our kids or a combined version of us, which would be even cooler.

284
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,660
But I still think that for a while we're going to be biologically human and limited by

285
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,940
the shortcomings of biological humanity. There's one other element of consciousness that I think

286
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,980
you downplay. You used to not downplay it as much and I don't know why this has changed maybe

287
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,980
because you're so focused on the role that language plays in consciousness. But I do really

288
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:39,660
think that humanities focus on modeling. The actions of other animals and humans plays a role

289
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,620
in our development of kindness because one, there's talk about this model for humanity. It's

290
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,820
yeah. It's the model of humanity that we use in The Pragmatist Guide to Life, which is our first

291
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,940
book, which is why I don't talk about it because this is an older idea that I had. When you're

292
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,300
trying to model other people's behavior, what you do is you have a mental model of them, which is

293
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,540
like an emulation that you're running within your own head of the way that you think that they are

294
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,900
going to act and the things you think that they are thinking. This is how you're able to have

295
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,060
like arguments with little simulations of other people in your head. You have modeled them and

296
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,660
you've modeled you and you are arguing with this different entity. When I was a neuroscientist,

297
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,500
one of the spaces I focused on was schizophrenia. What I actually think that we are seeing when

298
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,740
people hear voices is a lower activation of this. Using TMS, Transmining Stimulation, you

299
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,660
would hyperactivate parts of a person's brain and then if you'd hyperactivate the part that's

300
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,660
associated with saying letters, you put a letter in front of somebody and they won't be able to

301
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,540
help but say it because you have primed them with a vision of that letter and you have lowered the

302
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,820
threshold. I think what's happening with schizophrenia is something similar to that. They have their

303
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,060
system that they use to apply mental models to other things gets activated too easily. It can

304
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,100
be activated by the slightest thing. They look in a store window and they're like, oh, that must

305
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,100
have been done with intentionality. There must be some thought process behind the way everything

306
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,820
was arranged or they see something innocuous in the environment like a helicopter and then they are

307
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,580
like, oh, why is the helicopter there? There must be a person in it. They must be thinking about me.

308
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,540
Oh my gosh. Or they begin to hear whispers. This is why whisper hearing is associated with

309
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,740
schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations are much more common than visual hallucinations.

310
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,020
Visual hallucinations are incredibly rare. But anyway, so that's what's happening with schizophrenia.

311
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,780
The question is, okay, what does this have to do with the regular person? What it has to do

312
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:33,180
as a regular person is that I think people have a sort of internal mental model of themselves

313
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,340
which is used to prime emotional reactions to things. So when the way we talked about this

314
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,460
little like sentience box in your head, what it's doing when it's judging whether or not you should

315
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,820
react emotionally to something and how you should react emotionally to something is it is testing

316
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,460
what's happening in this sort of simulation saying that's what we would call our sentience

317
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,500
against this little mental model that's running of the way it thinks you should be feeling.

318
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,300
And you're saying, oh, does this mean he should be feeling anger? Oh, does this mean he should be

319
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,540
feeling happiness? And then it outputs that emotional state by telling you that you should be

320
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,020
feeling this. The way you can see this is that if somebody justifies a particular emotion, like

321
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,300
you should be really angry about that. Often a person will become much angry and they'll begin

322
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,700
to spin away or how could you let your boyfriend do that to you? And then you're like, ah, this

323
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,060
mental model has been adapted to feel angrier and you will actually experience much more of this

324
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:33,820
emotion. But what were you talking about if not that? In general, the role that modeling things

325
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,900
played in developing human consciousness that maybe what happened is one humans have

326
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,500
an evolutionary advantage if they are able to model predators and prey, because then they can

327
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:53,580
anticipate the moves of these organisms before they make them. And that to that ability would

328
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,980
start to, just like with Schizophrenics, get misapplied to that compression algorithm of memory

329
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,900
that's being formed. It's a mixture of language and so language and narrative building plus our

330
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,900
modeling things that were literally anthropomorphizing ourselves, if that makes sense. That's a good

331
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,620
way to put it. And I think people see, first of all, people with Schizophrenia, not Schizophrenics,

332
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:25,020
they are not defined by their theory. But like people with Frenchness. But we see this in how

333
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,300
easy it is that we answer anthropomorphize things. So I think it's very hard to not answer

334
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,260
anthropomorphize like a dog, right? Like you see a dog, you can see it's happiness, you can see it's

335
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,300
worried about things, you can see it and you perceive it as experiencing these emotions to see

336
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,460
what a human does, even though it probably doesn't. And you could see this in when people kick those

337
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:51,020
robots. Oh my gosh, yes. I see somebody kick with these robots and I'm like, I feel so bad for the

338
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,060
robot. I'm like, how do you do this to this portal? I know, logically, the robot's not experiencing

339
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,620
all that. Now, when you're a human and you're anthropomorphizing yourself, and you have no

340
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,660
way of knowing that you're not feeling these things in a real context, we struggle to not

341
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:12,060
answer anthropomorphize robots. How do we know that the robot's not suffering? How do we know if

342
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,060
its objective function is to run and kick the ball into the net, that it's not experiencing some kind

343
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,060
of suffering? Have you put ugly eyes on a soccer ball? People will feel bad for it. Simone, I'm

344
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,660
just trying to think of the things that people like definitely can empathize with when I'm talking

345
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,660
about this anthropomorphizing of things that most people don't think we should be anthropomorphizing,

346
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,060
with saying that if you didn't know whether or not it could feel emotions and everyone around you

347
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,860
said it could feel emotions, you would 100% believe that robot was feeling emotions,

348
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,540
as soon as you saw it kick because you'd feel so bad when it gets back up and it tries to walk again.

349
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,020
And as humans, it's the same way. If you didn't know, if you didn't have hard proof because you

350
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,940
hadn't gone through all the studies like I have and you didn't know that humans probably don't have

351
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,900
full control of this sort of sentient aspect of themselves and is likely irrelevant, you would

352
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,060
totally answer for more of our humans. And so I love this way of doing things, Simone. A very

353
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:11,660
interesting thought on your part. There is a subreddit. I don't know if it still exists.

354
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:20,460
It's nsfw, where people put ugly eyes on butts. Do you think that people are anther butts?

355
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:30,700
You know, butts. Are they are they anthropomorphizing the butts? Is that part of what's fun about that?

356
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,140
You and I loved, no, it's more me. I try to figure out like what is making people tick behind

357
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:43,740
weird nsfw subreddits, but I'm wondering, is that one is an outstanding one? Subscribe if that's

358
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,900
what you're interested in, is deep dives on why people are engaged. Because that's what,

359
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,980
the pragmatist guy to sexuality was totally like a meditation on this. Why are humans like turned

360
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,660
on? Because obviously we're very interested in the way that like the human mind actually processes

361
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,180
things. I left science. Why didn't I leave science because I didn't feel like real researchers being

362
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,900
done anymore? And I felt like there were specific narratives and it was like toe the line or else.

363
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,580
And I'm glad that we have reached a level of financial security where we are able to talk

364
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,620
about these things and research these things because we actually do a lot of independent

365
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,780
research, which if you're wondering how we get to these ideas and the data that leads us to get to

366
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,780
the ideas, go to our books and that's where we discuss it all. But yeah, I mean, it's really

367
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,860
fun and there are just so many low hanging fruits because academia is not doing anything anymore

368
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,140
or not doing the same level of work. I think it should be in these areas.

369
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,740
So there's one more thing that I think consciousness some credit for and sapience in

370
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,220
general, because I think that an easy conclusion to make from our theories around consciousness,

371
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,660
especially I see it as an illusion, is to say the colonists don't value consciousness. They think

372
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,580
it's an illusion, therefore it doesn't matter. To the contrary, I think it could easily be argued

373
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,540
that sapience is one of the things that we think is most valuable, most interesting. It's what

374
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:02,700
distinguishes humans from other organisms, but it's what makes us. But more important,

375
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,940
more importantly than that, it is this narrative building, whether or not it's illusory or not,

376
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,460
it is what enables us to edit our objective functions. That is the one differentiating

377
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,460
factor. Any non-conscious entity, any entity that doesn't have this narrative building effect,

378
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:28,140
this weird recording and encoding system and modeling system cannot question its actions.

379
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,540
It cannot look at the compression of all the inputs and the narrative that is being woven

380
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:41,100
in say, should we change the narrative? And I think that I've seen critiques of consciousness

381
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,940
where people totally miss that, where they say consciousness can get in the way of things,

382
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,900
not necessarily, it was evolved because it worked, not because it's superior.

383
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,020
And I think they're missing the core point here that consciousness has enabled humanity to pivot

384
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,860
in ways that no species on earth has ever done. It's what allowed us to make the leap. I completely

385
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,180
agree with you. And there was a final point I wanted to close out with here, that there was this fun

386
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:13,340
video clip of, we were talking on Piers Morgan, and you were talking, and you can see me moving

387
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,900
my mouth to your words as you're talking. And people might wonder why I'm doing this. And this

388
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,220
actually relates to something we were talking about in the video. So we are both on opposite

389
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,780
sense of the spectrum. If my model schizophrenia is correct, you basically have an autism to

390
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,460
schizophrenia spectrum, which is how much do you innately mentally model others? With people who

391
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,020
are autistic or have Asperger's, not innately running mental models of other people whenever

392
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,460
they're interacting with people. And people who are on the schizophrenia side of the spectrum,

393
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,900
not being able to help running mental models, even when there's no humans around.

394
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,860
And when we say Simone is diagnosed autism, so definitely on the autism side of the spectrum,

395
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,660
then I am almost certainly, when I look at myself on the schizophrenia side of the spectrum,

396
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,220
which is I don't hear voices or anything like that, but I really struggle to not mentally

397
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,740
model people I'm engaged with to the extent that I basically almost pass out after social

398
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,940
situations. I find them so exhausting. I met a big party. It's like just constantly modeling

399
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,420
everyone. And that's what was happening on that podcast. I was in a heightened emotional state

400
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,340
where I really cared about what she said. So I was running through the words in my head as she

401
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,700
was saying them and trying to process how she would respond to something. And I couldn't help,

402
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,940
but move my mouse because it was that sub level of stimulation. Like I talk about people can't

403
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,380
help but say the letter when that part of their brain is TMS. And that's what was happening there.

404
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,140
But there are reasons why we have in the human genetic code autism and schizophrenia,

405
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,060
why it hasn't been evolved out of us. And it's because both of these extremes are useful.

406
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,060
Autism can make you able to act more logically about the world around you, not being encumbered

407
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,860
by constantly mentally model others. And then my ability, people often will say it's like

408
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,940
eerie how much I can tell what other people are thinking, like to the level where

409
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,300
it can feel to some people like I can read their mind in a conversation.

410
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,100
And I think that is why you have these people on these schizophrenia side of the spectrum.

411
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,580
And then sometimes they just get a little too much of these genes, and it leads them to

412
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,100
hear voices constantly, instead of just having a really hyperactive ability to mentally model

413
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,620
anyone around them. Yeah, no, 100% Malcolm is on overdrive. And then he'll sometimes be

414
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,540
thinking about conversations with other people while we're walking. And I can always tell,

415
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,340
because he gets so deep into them that he's literally like gesturing as that's like we're

416
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,980
driving in the car, like one hand is on the steering wheel, the other hand is like gesturing

417
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,620
his silent conversation he's having with someone he anticipates speaking within the future,

418
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:49,660
or reliving a conversation he had in the past. And he will have these aftershocks from when

419
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:57,820
we socialize, where he feels the stress or pain of saying something not quite right to someone.

420
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:04,460
And it hits him like a ton of bricks, and he will like visibly like crumble and cringe.

421
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,020
It's not just cringe. Yes, like somebody just kicked me in the nuts or something.

422
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,100
Yeah, like, it looks like he has been physically hurt by something. And that is not something

423
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,780
that I can even begin to imagine. And I do think that it's a lot less stressful to be on the

424
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:31,260
autistic end of the spectrum and to just not know that other people like nothing going on there.

425
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Such a good partnership. And I think it was one of our main goals throughout our books and throughout

426
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,380
our lives to understand how humans think and process things and what's really happening in

427
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,700
the human brain. I started my career as a neuroscientist and a philosopher. That was my

428
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,660
interest. It's like, what's really going on? And being able to be in a relationship with somebody

429
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,060
who sees the world so differently has given me such insights that I would never come to on

430
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,100
my own. And I just admire that so much about you, Simone. And I admire that you have taken me to

431
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:05,340
where I am, which is somewhere I never could have reached without your guidance. And I love you so

432
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,340
much. I love you so much too. You're the superhero that I always wish existed. And I still worry

433
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,500
that I'm going to wake up from a coma at some point and find out that you're the sidekick that

434
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,380
actually does everything. I might be the superhero. She's the hacker nerd in the background that like

435
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,780
actually makes everything work. And no, if the hacker nerd went away, the superhero would have

436
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,020
nothing. That is so our relationship. I have nothing without you actually doing all the

437
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:37,180
detective work and telling me where to go next. It's a massively inflated estimation of my

438
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:44,300
contribution. I just follow her instructions. I don't manage my calendar at all. I'm operating

439
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,580
on Simone is driving me like she says, what was the one thing like the thing from aliens?

440
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:57,020
Oh, yeah, like I'm not talking to people. I'm the alien suit that you're using to punch through

441
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:05,740
reality. Power loader. You're the you're Ripley. Oh, okay. That's the other way we both feel about

442
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,660
each other. I adore you. I love these conversations. And I know we have to pick up the kids now. But

443
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,860
I think you're going to make another dish tonight. So I'm going to have fun. Oh,

444
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,900
yes, another base camp cooking. We have a little side playlist of anyone seen it where I try to

445
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,540
come up with new dishes. So you get it right. You get to see the college household at night.

446
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:34,220
What happens after that? Yes. All right, see you soon. Love you.
