00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Would you like to know more?

00:02.160 --> 00:03.840
Hello, Malcolm.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.320
Hello, Simone.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.320
I love your response.

00:08.320 --> 00:13.320
I love that it is your signature greeting with people,

00:13.320 --> 00:14.920
very high energy.

00:14.920 --> 00:19.240
But I also think it is an element of your social autopilot.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.160
Not that I don't have a social autopilot.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.760
I'm on that right now.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.240
But I think that's a really interesting part of human

00:27.240 --> 00:30.320
existence, because for the vast majority of our lives,

00:30.320 --> 00:34.680
I don't think we're actually, let alone not sapient,

00:34.680 --> 00:38.160
not even really conscious, not even really aware

00:38.160 --> 00:38.880
of what's going on.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.160
Oh, yeah.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.320
And I think it's so arrogant when people pretend

00:41.320 --> 00:42.960
that they are aware of most of their lives.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.000
We talk about something called road hypnosis,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.240
where they look back on a drive and they're like,

00:47.240 --> 00:50.080
I don't remember what I was doing during the drive.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.360
Their brain just shuts off recording.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.120
And the question is, how much of our life is road hypnosis?

00:57.120 --> 00:59.320
And I think it's a huge portion of our life.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.000
And it's something, this is what initially got us talking

01:03.000 --> 01:05.560
about consciousness early in our relationship,

01:05.560 --> 01:10.400
was how do we at least enter moments of lucidity

01:10.400 --> 01:14.400
where we are aware of what's going on,

01:14.400 --> 01:16.920
somewhat sentient, just long enough

01:16.920 --> 01:20.400
to be able to change things about the internal self

01:20.400 --> 01:23.200
model that does run our autopilot.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.600
So that at least in the majority of the life

01:25.600 --> 01:30.320
when we are on autopilot, we are better serving our values,

01:30.320 --> 01:33.880
better people, more productive, more

01:33.880 --> 01:36.280
emotionally in control, et cetera.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.360
And I think our thought on consciousness

01:39.360 --> 01:41.280
really evolved in interesting directions

01:41.280 --> 01:44.760
from there when we started really

01:44.760 --> 01:47.360
thinking about what consciousness means

01:47.360 --> 01:49.640
and why maybe it exists.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.320
So I think this will be really fun to talk about.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.160
Why don't you talk a bit about what you think

01:54.200 --> 01:56.440
sentience is?

01:56.440 --> 01:59.360
I think sentience, our experience of consciousness,

01:59.360 --> 02:03.720
in other words, is really an emergent property

02:03.720 --> 02:06.080
of a memory compression system.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.960
So imagine you have a building security system

02:08.960 --> 02:10.960
with tons of different inputs.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.000
It's a feed of doors opening and closing

02:14.000 --> 02:16.760
within the building, a bunch of different camera feeds,

02:16.760 --> 02:20.360
a chemical monitoring system coming in,

02:20.360 --> 02:23.600
everything's feeding into this one control room

02:23.640 --> 02:26.520
and then being put into a camera feed

02:26.520 --> 02:28.640
and then being stored in memory.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.160
And there's a man watching the security feed.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.520
And I think that's our experience of consciousness

02:34.520 --> 02:40.120
is that our minds are synthesizing, smell, sight,

02:40.120 --> 02:45.400
hormonal fluctuations going on, a lot of very complex inputs.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.320
They're synthesizing them into something

02:47.320 --> 02:49.440
that can be compressed into unified memory,

02:49.440 --> 02:52.240
which if relevant will be stored in long-term memory

02:52.240 --> 02:57.440
and then in turn influence automatic instinctual responses.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.360
And because this memory is being codified

03:01.360 --> 03:05.560
and in the moment it's being run through a camera system,

03:05.560 --> 03:08.960
we're getting the impression that there

03:08.960 --> 03:13.920
is some kind of observed conscious driver that

03:13.920 --> 03:17.080
is running consciousness.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.560
I'm going to run this back to you.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.720
It's almost like what you're saying is,

03:20.720 --> 03:24.640
this guy who is sitting at this feed,

03:24.640 --> 03:28.120
he is collecting all of these different camera inputs,

03:28.120 --> 03:30.200
all of these different sensory inputs,

03:30.200 --> 03:34.120
and they are encoded in this single quote unquote

03:34.120 --> 03:38.520
experience, which is being written into the hard drive

03:38.520 --> 03:40.000
of this computer.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.080
And when he is referencing what happened in the past,

03:45.080 --> 03:47.480
when anybody is referencing what happened in the past

03:47.480 --> 03:49.680
within this big security array, they

03:49.720 --> 03:52.920
are referencing this encoding.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.040
And it is because they are referencing this encoding,

03:56.040 --> 03:58.440
it creates the perception falsely

03:58.440 --> 04:01.240
so that the way this encoding works

04:01.240 --> 04:02.960
is the way that these things are being

04:02.960 --> 04:04.560
experienced in the moment.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.800
But it isn't, actually.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.080
Well, Ann, that there is some intentional driver

04:10.080 --> 04:13.880
that's shaping each decision intentionally

04:13.880 --> 04:16.200
through that interface, essentially.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
Whereas the interface only actually

04:18.800 --> 04:22.160
affects, in so far, the memory itself influences

04:22.160 --> 04:23.840
automatic reactions.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.760
So I think the research supports this.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.440
We automatically respond to things.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.160
We automatically start taking action in response

04:33.160 --> 04:36.080
to stimulus before we have some kind of conscious

04:36.080 --> 04:38.040
understanding that we're doing that.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.360
And our memories absolutely, yeah, MRI missions

04:42.360 --> 04:43.920
have shown this.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.160
And while our memories will influence those responses,

04:49.160 --> 04:52.760
our current experience of consciousness

04:52.760 --> 04:54.120
is not in the driver's seat.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.080
It is just passively experiencing

04:56.080 --> 04:57.560
this encoding of memories.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.240
It believes this in the driver's seat.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.120
I think that this is what's really interesting,

05:01.120 --> 05:04.840
is it will apply this feeling of consciousness

05:04.840 --> 05:06.640
to any experience that you're doing

05:06.640 --> 05:08.000
or any action that you're taking.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.480
So when you're doing open brain surgery on someone,

05:10.480 --> 05:13.320
you need to keep them awake to prevent accidentally cutting

05:13.320 --> 05:15.640
part of the brain you're not supposed to, so they'll check.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.520
You can do things like apply a small amount of electricity

05:18.520 --> 05:21.120
to a part of the brain and get the person to move their hand.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.960
And then you ask them, why did you move your hand?

05:22.960 --> 05:24.680
And they'll say, oh, I felt like moving my hand.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.480
And you can also see this with split brain patients.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.960
These are patients where the corpus callosum is split

05:28.960 --> 05:31.080
in their head, and their right brain and their left brain

05:31.080 --> 05:33.640
actually function pretty independently of each other

05:33.640 --> 05:35.040
when this happens.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.160
So you can cover one eye and communicate

05:37.160 --> 05:39.320
with part of their brain and not the other part of the brain.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.560
So you can tell part of their brain, pick up a Rubik's Cube

05:41.560 --> 05:42.680
and try to solve it.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.320
Then you put something on the other eye

05:44.320 --> 05:46.360
and you ask, OK, why did you do that?

05:46.360 --> 05:48.480
And they'll say, oh, I always felt like solving a Rubik's Cube.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.760
I always wanted to do this.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.640
And you can do this with more complicated things.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.040
So there's this experiment, really great one,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.520
where they would give people pictures of attractive women

05:56.520 --> 05:57.920
and they say, which is the most attractive?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.920
And then they do a little sleight of hand later and say, OK,

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
why did you say this one was the most attractive?

06:01.920 --> 06:02.920
But it wasn't the one they chose.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.480
You'd actually replace it with another picture.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.360
I mean, you could do this with political beliefs as well

06:06.360 --> 06:07.680
and all sorts of other things.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.120
And most people will say, oh, I chose this person for x, y,

06:12.120 --> 06:14.840
z reasons and go into detail about why they chose that person.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.500
Even though that wasn't the person they chose, which shows

06:18.500 --> 06:20.720
that a lot of our consciousness, a lot of the way

06:20.720 --> 06:22.400
that we describe our sentence is more

06:22.400 --> 06:24.940
like sense-making of our environment.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.920
We know we made x decision, but X decision was actually

06:28.920 --> 06:31.560
made completely outside of our sentence as control.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.480
And then we have this little lying historian

06:33.480 --> 06:36.520
in our head, which is like, no, I made the decision.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.560
I made the decision.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.320
I made every decision.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.260
But he's also recording the history

06:41.260 --> 06:46.060
you remember. So then he's going through and saying, okay, I made the decision for this. It's not that

06:46.060 --> 06:49.580
he doesn't have any say. See, this is where he does have a say in it, something that you mentioned,

06:49.580 --> 06:55.580
which is that he can encode emotions into the things we're doing. And this can actually cause a

06:55.580 --> 07:00.860
lot of... No, emotion isn't the right word, because emotions do, you know, let's say that...

07:00.860 --> 07:07.100
Emotional narratives. Emotional, yeah. So they can encode positive or negative modifiers and

07:07.100 --> 07:12.300
they can shift the narrative. They can change the camera angle or add sad music to something,

07:12.300 --> 07:18.460
essentially, to make it seem like a sad scene. You've seen the YouTube video of the Mary Poppins

07:18.460 --> 07:26.620
preview, but done with scary music, and it just seems horrifying. So that's how we can change...

07:26.620 --> 07:31.580
Yeah, that is how we can change the narrative. And the first time I was ever introduced to this idea

07:31.580 --> 07:36.620
that we take action before we consciously are aware of it, the person discussing it said that

07:36.620 --> 07:41.420
there's a lot of implications to this because it would lead many people to believe that they don't

07:41.420 --> 07:45.820
have free will and have them just say, oh, none of this is my fault. I didn't consciously make this

07:45.820 --> 07:52.060
decision anyway, where that's really not quite, we would say the right conclusion, because you

07:52.780 --> 08:00.940
do have the ability to color how you perceive reality. It's not in this kind of immediate,

08:00.940 --> 08:05.500
non-asynchronous way that you would expect. I would say that this is just the myth of humanity

08:05.500 --> 08:10.700
versus the actuality of humanity. And we would argue that we likely evolved this ability because

08:10.700 --> 08:14.300
it was like a compression algorithm for communicating ideas to other people. I actually don't suspect

08:14.300 --> 08:18.220
that Great 8 have this sort of internal thing that we call consciousness because they didn't

08:18.220 --> 08:22.700
need to communicate these. It's a really good compression algorithm for linear experiences

08:22.700 --> 08:30.060
over time. But one of the big lies that happens throughout this process is it convinces us that

08:30.060 --> 08:36.060
we are a singular entity, when in fact our brains function much more like we see AI's function with

08:36.060 --> 08:40.700
individual instances running. And we can see this with the corpus callosum split that I mentioned

08:40.700 --> 08:46.940
earlier, where it basically means that we have two largely separate parts of our internal mental

08:46.940 --> 08:52.140
processing that are happening separate from each other. This idea that the decisions you make happen

08:52.140 --> 08:56.060
before they enter your conscious mind, what that basically means is you have another part of your

08:56.060 --> 09:01.260
brain which is making this decision and then delivers it to the conscious mind. When we were

09:01.260 --> 09:09.260
talking about the idea of a security camera with a bunch of different feeds, a lot of the

09:09.260 --> 09:15.260
processing is done locally at these various security cameras before they all get centralized into this

09:15.260 --> 09:21.340
sort of communal feed with many of the quote unquote decisions being made at those local levels.

09:21.340 --> 09:29.500
And so we have this illusion of ourselves as a singular entity, which is created by the way

09:29.500 --> 09:34.620
this sort of sentience processor works. But it is just an illusion. And so when we say, oh,

09:35.340 --> 09:42.140
we don't really have self-control or we're not responsible for our decisions, I think that

09:42.140 --> 09:49.020
actually even overstates the level to which we exist in any sort of a meaningful concept

09:49.020 --> 09:54.940
close to how we think we exist. And so then there's this, I would say, added layer of

09:56.300 --> 10:02.780
complexity or maybe confusion. You shared with me an article saying that a very high

10:02.780 --> 10:07.980
percentage of people don't have an internal monologue. What we would describe as-

10:07.980 --> 10:11.260
Yeah, they don't have an internal monologue. Another high percentage of people can't even

10:11.260 --> 10:16.780
create images in their mind. And so what we're even describing as consciousness is also not

10:16.780 --> 10:24.700
even something that is universal as part of the human experience, which is interesting.

10:24.700 --> 10:33.340
Because I think most of us who experience consciousness as we're describing it would

10:33.340 --> 10:39.740
have a very hard time understanding even what that means. I don't know, maybe someone watching

10:39.740 --> 10:43.820
this YouTube video doesn't have an internal monologue. I wonder-

10:43.900 --> 10:48.860
It's hard for you to model that, but I suspect that the human, the variance within the human

10:48.860 --> 10:53.980
condition in terms of how things are processed is probably a lot larger than we give it credit for,

10:53.980 --> 10:58.220
and it will be even larger in the future. A statistic that I just cannot stop mentioning

10:58.220 --> 11:02.060
because it's something that more people should know, that if you look at the heredity of IQ

11:02.060 --> 11:06.860
right now and you look at the selective pressure, so you look at the number of people who have these

11:06.860 --> 11:09.740
markers versus people who don't have these markers, which you can see because it's genetic

11:09.820 --> 11:13.500
work, as it says you, is this the number of kids they have. We're likely looking at a one standard

11:13.500 --> 11:18.140
deviation shift down in IQ in the next 75 years in developed countries at least. This is probably

11:18.140 --> 11:22.220
going to affect developing countries later. So I guess good for them. There'll be all the geniuses

11:22.220 --> 11:27.180
in the world. We'll be in Africa or whatever, but places where you have this post prosperity,

11:27.180 --> 11:33.420
fertility, collapse situation. And when we think about how quickly and how much human IQ can shift

11:33.420 --> 11:38.860
up or down, we use this one marker IQ, but I suspect it's linked to just all sorts of things

11:38.860 --> 11:44.140
about how we process reality. So actually I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the subject

11:44.140 --> 11:51.820
of kids because I think that also as we've become parents, we've had a more complex understanding

11:51.820 --> 11:57.020
of how consciousness develops because we see it start to emerge in our kids. I think there's

11:57.020 --> 12:03.260
definitely this point at which we see consciousness blossoming and it's not one day our kids aren't

12:03.260 --> 12:08.620
very conscious and the next they are. I think that consciousness for example is starting to emerge more

12:08.620 --> 12:15.020
and more especially in our three-year-old. It's just beginning to emerge in our two-year-old. And

12:15.020 --> 12:21.420
I think a lot of that has to do with where they are with language processing. I think it really

12:21.420 --> 12:27.340
influences. That's why I suspect this had to do, it evolved alongside language to compress ideas,

12:27.340 --> 12:31.100
but I think that this is where you can see how this system can break in a way that can be very

12:31.100 --> 12:35.100
useful in relationships. So this isn't just like theory or whatever. So one of the things you'll

12:35.100 --> 12:40.220
often see one of our kids do is he'll be in a bad mood, but he won't understand the concept of

12:40.220 --> 12:44.860
generally being in a bad mood. So he'll start crying and he'll say, I want this. Give me that

12:44.860 --> 12:49.420
toy and then you get him the toy and he just, it doesn't stop the bad mood. And so he needs

12:49.420 --> 12:55.980
whatever he notices next, close the door or move that chair. Like he just was like whatever

12:56.700 --> 13:01.340
is currently causing the littlest bit of discomfort, he thinks it's the core cause

13:01.900 --> 13:07.740
of like this bad mood or why he's angry or what he's angry about. And as humans, I think this

13:07.740 --> 13:12.620
happens as well. And this is really bad when a friend tells you you're justified to have an angry

13:12.620 --> 13:16.700
state or something like that, because then this little narrative maker in your head says, ah,

13:16.700 --> 13:20.700
now you get to be angry. Now you're socially justified to be angry and you will feel very

13:20.700 --> 13:25.020
angry about something or you might be in a generally bad mood and your partner comes into

13:25.020 --> 13:30.060
the house and he does something that just annoys you in the slightest. And then you create the

13:30.060 --> 13:36.140
internal narrative that you are in this bad mood because of what your partner did. And when you

13:36.140 --> 13:41.100
keep in mind why you're feeling these things and you try to keep like fully in touch with the way

13:41.100 --> 13:45.340
your brain is actually working, it leads to a lot more harmony and a lot fewer fights and

13:45.340 --> 13:50.540
relationships because you have language for I am in a bad overlay state right now,

13:51.260 --> 13:58.780
which just means I'm in a bad mood generally, but I'm not actually mad at you or anything specific.

13:58.860 --> 14:02.380
Hold on though, actually, I think you've touched on something very interesting there,

14:02.380 --> 14:09.020
which is that maybe sometimes consciousness and narrative building hampers more than helps

14:09.020 --> 14:16.140
us. For example, like the toxic girlfriend who has a bad dream in which her boyfriend

14:16.140 --> 14:23.180
cheats on her, she wakes up angry at him, like she's mad at him for something he can actually do,

14:23.180 --> 14:28.860
or maybe one day she's just in a bad mood, but then she makes up some narrative about

14:28.860 --> 14:32.860
it's because her boyfriend didn't bring her flowers and doesn't appreciate her,

14:32.860 --> 14:38.220
some he did something mean. The presence of consciousness and the presence of narrative

14:38.220 --> 14:44.700
building would cause her to turn what might be just a very transient bad mood into something that

14:45.260 --> 14:49.180
builds a grudge over time and literally ends up killing the relationship,

14:49.260 --> 14:53.820
humiliatively. And sometimes consciousness hampers us more than it helps us.

14:53.820 --> 14:57.260
What I love about what you're saying here, and this follows your idea of what it means to be

14:57.260 --> 15:04.460
meaningfully human and the spectrum of humanity, which is you become more human the more you take

15:04.460 --> 15:10.780
mastery and ownership over the sort of evolved or quirks of the way your brain works, and you

15:10.780 --> 15:17.260
don't allow them to control your actions. Your actions are more logically decided and more

15:17.260 --> 15:23.180
decided based on as close to an objective view of reality as you can get. And so from the perspective

15:23.180 --> 15:26.620
of humanity that you convinced me was a good one, because this wasn't the one I had before,

15:27.180 --> 15:31.820
somebody who does that, somebody who has a dream and then can't logically understand that is not

15:31.820 --> 15:37.420
a justified reason to be mad at somebody, that they are like meaningfully less human than another

15:37.420 --> 15:41.660
person. And so then what does it mean to be fully human? It means to have total mastery over these

15:41.660 --> 15:46.860
things. And that is something that we don't have, but I think it helps people understand because

15:46.940 --> 15:53.900
a lot of people hear the level of disdain we talk about things like sentience and love and happiness

15:53.900 --> 15:58.940
and other human emotional states that a lot of people venerate, but they don't understand where

15:58.940 --> 16:05.020
that's coming from. But then wouldn't that make an LM more human than we are? People may not know

16:05.020 --> 16:10.780
what it is. A large language model is more sophisticated than we are. And it's also not

16:10.780 --> 16:19.180
bogged down by the need for hunger, human failings, hormones, all these sorts of pollutants,

16:19.180 --> 16:26.140
not pollutants. They're very instrumentally useful for biological human in a modern globalized

16:26.140 --> 16:30.620
society and often with the type of knowledge work that humans are expected to do. It's pretty

16:30.620 --> 16:36.220
counterproductive. Well, I think that this comes to your goal for yourself, where your goal and

16:36.220 --> 16:42.460
iteration of yourself that is your idealized iteration would strip out your emotional shortcomings,

16:42.460 --> 16:51.260
be they love or happiness or hatred or pain or greed. And I'm not that way, by the way. I am not as

16:51.260 --> 16:55.820
bought into this philosophy as Simone is. I would not strip those things away from myself. I think

16:55.820 --> 17:02.780
that they add something that I feel illogically. I still think has some value, but I don't know,

17:02.780 --> 17:08.460
maybe you feel that way too. I'm mixed on it. I'm mixed on it. One, I'm deeply uncomfortable

17:08.460 --> 17:14.140
being human. I really don't like my body. I really don't like being human. I don't like the corruption

17:14.140 --> 17:22.140
to our objective functions that human weaknesses cause. But my general stance is if this is what

17:22.140 --> 17:27.100
I have to deal with, if I've been given a meat puppet, I'm going to use it to the max. I'm going

17:27.180 --> 17:34.140
to play the game. You've given me a crappy little battlebot. I'm going to take that thing and I'm

17:34.140 --> 17:41.020
going to destroy everything, even if it's the worst machinery ever. I think the way she talks

17:41.020 --> 17:47.100
about pregnancy, she's, I have a uterus. I am going to wreck that thing. I am going to have so many

17:47.100 --> 17:54.700
babies. I'm going to shreds. If that's what it was meant to do. Yeah. Then as a woman, I reached

17:54.700 --> 18:00.140
the planes of Valhalla by dying in childbirth. Let it happen. Don't worry, Malcolm. I promise.

18:00.140 --> 18:06.620
I will play that clip at your funeral. Thank you. I really should probably plan that out.

18:06.620 --> 18:10.860
But yeah, I feel conflicted. I mean, I, yes, if this is the hand that we're dealt, I'm going to

18:10.860 --> 18:18.140
play it and I'm going to play it hard. But at the same time, yeah, I really aspire to that. I don't

18:18.140 --> 18:23.900
think that has to be me. And I guess that's, maybe it's more AI and machines are my Beatrice

18:23.900 --> 18:30.460
and Dante's Inferno, this idealized version of humanity that I know I am not and that I do not

18:30.460 --> 18:35.500
aspire to be, but that I deeply admire. I don't need to become it. I don't need to be with it. I

18:35.500 --> 18:41.980
just, I just see it as a better iteration and as naturally and morally superior. Does that make

18:41.980 --> 18:46.700
sense? What you hope is to make our kids superior to that. Oh, for sure. But our kids are still

18:46.700 --> 18:51.660
biological. They're still human. So I think I'm playing the field. I'm pretty sure this next

18:51.660 --> 18:54.860
generation is going to be the first that integrates with tech. I know you say.

18:54.860 --> 18:59.260
Well, our generation is going to integrate with tech. I'm sure that AI models will be trained

18:59.260 --> 19:05.020
on if not us family members or our kids or a combined version of us, which would be even cooler.

19:05.580 --> 19:11.660
But I still think that for a while we're going to be biologically human and limited by

19:12.780 --> 19:18.940
the shortcomings of biological humanity. There's one other element of consciousness that I think

19:18.940 --> 19:23.980
you downplay. You used to not downplay it as much and I don't know why this has changed maybe

19:23.980 --> 19:29.980
because you're so focused on the role that language plays in consciousness. But I do really

19:29.980 --> 19:39.660
think that humanities focus on modeling. The actions of other animals and humans plays a role

19:39.660 --> 19:44.620
in our development of kindness because one, there's talk about this model for humanity. It's

19:45.580 --> 19:49.820
yeah. It's the model of humanity that we use in The Pragmatist Guide to Life, which is our first

19:49.820 --> 19:52.940
book, which is why I don't talk about it because this is an older idea that I had. When you're

19:52.940 --> 19:58.300
trying to model other people's behavior, what you do is you have a mental model of them, which is

19:58.300 --> 20:02.540
like an emulation that you're running within your own head of the way that you think that they are

20:02.540 --> 20:05.900
going to act and the things you think that they are thinking. This is how you're able to have

20:05.900 --> 20:10.060
like arguments with little simulations of other people in your head. You have modeled them and

20:10.140 --> 20:15.660
you've modeled you and you are arguing with this different entity. When I was a neuroscientist,

20:15.660 --> 20:19.500
one of the spaces I focused on was schizophrenia. What I actually think that we are seeing when

20:19.500 --> 20:25.740
people hear voices is a lower activation of this. Using TMS, Transmining Stimulation, you

20:25.740 --> 20:29.660
would hyperactivate parts of a person's brain and then if you'd hyperactivate the part that's

20:29.660 --> 20:33.660
associated with saying letters, you put a letter in front of somebody and they won't be able to

20:33.660 --> 20:38.540
help but say it because you have primed them with a vision of that letter and you have lowered the

20:38.540 --> 20:43.820
threshold. I think what's happening with schizophrenia is something similar to that. They have their

20:43.820 --> 20:50.060
system that they use to apply mental models to other things gets activated too easily. It can

20:50.060 --> 20:55.100
be activated by the slightest thing. They look in a store window and they're like, oh, that must

20:55.100 --> 20:59.100
have been done with intentionality. There must be some thought process behind the way everything

20:59.100 --> 21:03.820
was arranged or they see something innocuous in the environment like a helicopter and then they are

21:03.820 --> 21:07.580
like, oh, why is the helicopter there? There must be a person in it. They must be thinking about me.

21:07.580 --> 21:12.540
Oh my gosh. Or they begin to hear whispers. This is why whisper hearing is associated with

21:12.540 --> 21:15.740
schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations are much more common than visual hallucinations.

21:15.740 --> 21:21.020
Visual hallucinations are incredibly rare. But anyway, so that's what's happening with schizophrenia.

21:22.060 --> 21:26.780
The question is, okay, what does this have to do with the regular person? What it has to do

21:26.780 --> 21:33.180
as a regular person is that I think people have a sort of internal mental model of themselves

21:33.180 --> 21:39.340
which is used to prime emotional reactions to things. So when the way we talked about this

21:39.340 --> 21:44.460
little like sentience box in your head, what it's doing when it's judging whether or not you should

21:44.460 --> 21:49.820
react emotionally to something and how you should react emotionally to something is it is testing

21:49.820 --> 21:54.460
what's happening in this sort of simulation saying that's what we would call our sentience

21:54.460 --> 21:59.500
against this little mental model that's running of the way it thinks you should be feeling.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.300
And you're saying, oh, does this mean he should be feeling anger? Oh, does this mean he should be

22:02.300 --> 22:06.540
feeling happiness? And then it outputs that emotional state by telling you that you should be

22:06.540 --> 22:11.020
feeling this. The way you can see this is that if somebody justifies a particular emotion, like

22:11.020 --> 22:16.300
you should be really angry about that. Often a person will become much angry and they'll begin

22:16.300 --> 22:20.700
to spin away or how could you let your boyfriend do that to you? And then you're like, ah, this

22:20.700 --> 22:26.060
mental model has been adapted to feel angrier and you will actually experience much more of this

22:26.060 --> 22:33.820
emotion. But what were you talking about if not that? In general, the role that modeling things

22:33.820 --> 22:39.900
played in developing human consciousness that maybe what happened is one humans have

22:40.700 --> 22:45.500
an evolutionary advantage if they are able to model predators and prey, because then they can

22:45.500 --> 22:53.580
anticipate the moves of these organisms before they make them. And that to that ability would

22:53.580 --> 22:59.980
start to, just like with Schizophrenics, get misapplied to that compression algorithm of memory

22:59.980 --> 23:07.900
that's being formed. It's a mixture of language and so language and narrative building plus our

23:07.900 --> 23:13.900
modeling things that were literally anthropomorphizing ourselves, if that makes sense. That's a good

23:13.900 --> 23:18.620
way to put it. And I think people see, first of all, people with Schizophrenia, not Schizophrenics,

23:18.620 --> 23:25.020
they are not defined by their theory. But like people with Frenchness. But we see this in how

23:25.020 --> 23:30.300
easy it is that we answer anthropomorphize things. So I think it's very hard to not answer

23:30.300 --> 23:35.260
anthropomorphize like a dog, right? Like you see a dog, you can see it's happiness, you can see it's

23:35.260 --> 23:40.300
worried about things, you can see it and you perceive it as experiencing these emotions to see

23:40.300 --> 23:44.460
what a human does, even though it probably doesn't. And you could see this in when people kick those

23:44.460 --> 23:51.020
robots. Oh my gosh, yes. I see somebody kick with these robots and I'm like, I feel so bad for the

23:51.020 --> 23:56.060
robot. I'm like, how do you do this to this portal? I know, logically, the robot's not experiencing

23:56.060 --> 24:00.620
all that. Now, when you're a human and you're anthropomorphizing yourself, and you have no

24:00.620 --> 24:05.660
way of knowing that you're not feeling these things in a real context, we struggle to not

24:05.660 --> 24:12.060
answer anthropomorphize robots. How do we know that the robot's not suffering? How do we know if

24:12.060 --> 24:18.060
its objective function is to run and kick the ball into the net, that it's not experiencing some kind

24:18.060 --> 24:24.060
of suffering? Have you put ugly eyes on a soccer ball? People will feel bad for it. Simone, I'm

24:24.060 --> 24:29.660
just trying to think of the things that people like definitely can empathize with when I'm talking

24:29.660 --> 24:33.660
about this anthropomorphizing of things that most people don't think we should be anthropomorphizing,

24:33.660 --> 24:38.060
with saying that if you didn't know whether or not it could feel emotions and everyone around you

24:38.060 --> 24:42.860
said it could feel emotions, you would 100% believe that robot was feeling emotions,

24:42.860 --> 24:46.540
as soon as you saw it kick because you'd feel so bad when it gets back up and it tries to walk again.

24:46.540 --> 24:51.020
And as humans, it's the same way. If you didn't know, if you didn't have hard proof because you

24:51.020 --> 24:54.940
hadn't gone through all the studies like I have and you didn't know that humans probably don't have

24:55.660 --> 24:59.900
full control of this sort of sentient aspect of themselves and is likely irrelevant, you would

24:59.900 --> 25:04.060
totally answer for more of our humans. And so I love this way of doing things, Simone. A very

25:04.060 --> 25:11.660
interesting thought on your part. There is a subreddit. I don't know if it still exists.

25:11.660 --> 25:20.460
It's nsfw, where people put ugly eyes on butts. Do you think that people are anther butts?

25:21.100 --> 25:30.700
You know, butts. Are they are they anthropomorphizing the butts? Is that part of what's fun about that?

25:30.700 --> 25:36.140
You and I loved, no, it's more me. I try to figure out like what is making people tick behind

25:36.140 --> 25:43.740
weird nsfw subreddits, but I'm wondering, is that one is an outstanding one? Subscribe if that's

25:43.740 --> 25:47.900
what you're interested in, is deep dives on why people are engaged. Because that's what,

25:47.900 --> 25:51.980
the pragmatist guy to sexuality was totally like a meditation on this. Why are humans like turned

25:51.980 --> 25:55.660
on? Because obviously we're very interested in the way that like the human mind actually processes

25:55.660 --> 25:59.180
things. I left science. Why didn't I leave science because I didn't feel like real researchers being

25:59.180 --> 26:03.900
done anymore? And I felt like there were specific narratives and it was like toe the line or else.

26:03.900 --> 26:07.580
And I'm glad that we have reached a level of financial security where we are able to talk

26:07.580 --> 26:10.620
about these things and research these things because we actually do a lot of independent

26:10.620 --> 26:14.780
research, which if you're wondering how we get to these ideas and the data that leads us to get to

26:14.780 --> 26:18.780
the ideas, go to our books and that's where we discuss it all. But yeah, I mean, it's really

26:18.780 --> 26:22.860
fun and there are just so many low hanging fruits because academia is not doing anything anymore

26:22.860 --> 26:26.140
or not doing the same level of work. I think it should be in these areas.

26:26.140 --> 26:33.740
So there's one more thing that I think consciousness some credit for and sapience in

26:33.740 --> 26:38.220
general, because I think that an easy conclusion to make from our theories around consciousness,

26:38.220 --> 26:45.660
especially I see it as an illusion, is to say the colonists don't value consciousness. They think

26:45.660 --> 26:51.580
it's an illusion, therefore it doesn't matter. To the contrary, I think it could easily be argued

26:51.580 --> 26:56.540
that sapience is one of the things that we think is most valuable, most interesting. It's what

26:56.540 --> 27:02.700
distinguishes humans from other organisms, but it's what makes us. But more important,

27:02.700 --> 27:08.940
more importantly than that, it is this narrative building, whether or not it's illusory or not,

27:09.740 --> 27:14.460
it is what enables us to edit our objective functions. That is the one differentiating

27:14.460 --> 27:20.460
factor. Any non-conscious entity, any entity that doesn't have this narrative building effect,

27:20.460 --> 27:28.140
this weird recording and encoding system and modeling system cannot question its actions.

27:28.140 --> 27:32.540
It cannot look at the compression of all the inputs and the narrative that is being woven

27:32.540 --> 27:41.100
in say, should we change the narrative? And I think that I've seen critiques of consciousness

27:41.820 --> 27:46.940
where people totally miss that, where they say consciousness can get in the way of things,

27:47.740 --> 27:51.900
not necessarily, it was evolved because it worked, not because it's superior.

27:51.900 --> 27:57.020
And I think they're missing the core point here that consciousness has enabled humanity to pivot

27:57.020 --> 28:02.860
in ways that no species on earth has ever done. It's what allowed us to make the leap. I completely

28:02.860 --> 28:07.180
agree with you. And there was a final point I wanted to close out with here, that there was this fun

28:07.180 --> 28:13.340
video clip of, we were talking on Piers Morgan, and you were talking, and you can see me moving

28:13.340 --> 28:17.900
my mouth to your words as you're talking. And people might wonder why I'm doing this. And this

28:17.900 --> 28:22.220
actually relates to something we were talking about in the video. So we are both on opposite

28:22.220 --> 28:26.780
sense of the spectrum. If my model schizophrenia is correct, you basically have an autism to

28:26.780 --> 28:32.460
schizophrenia spectrum, which is how much do you innately mentally model others? With people who

28:32.460 --> 28:37.020
are autistic or have Asperger's, not innately running mental models of other people whenever

28:37.020 --> 28:40.460
they're interacting with people. And people who are on the schizophrenia side of the spectrum,

28:40.460 --> 28:43.900
not being able to help running mental models, even when there's no humans around.

28:43.900 --> 28:48.860
And when we say Simone is diagnosed autism, so definitely on the autism side of the spectrum,

28:48.860 --> 28:53.660
then I am almost certainly, when I look at myself on the schizophrenia side of the spectrum,

28:53.660 --> 29:00.220
which is I don't hear voices or anything like that, but I really struggle to not mentally

29:00.220 --> 29:05.740
model people I'm engaged with to the extent that I basically almost pass out after social

29:05.740 --> 29:10.940
situations. I find them so exhausting. I met a big party. It's like just constantly modeling

29:10.940 --> 29:15.420
everyone. And that's what was happening on that podcast. I was in a heightened emotional state

29:15.420 --> 29:19.340
where I really cared about what she said. So I was running through the words in my head as she

29:19.340 --> 29:24.700
was saying them and trying to process how she would respond to something. And I couldn't help,

29:24.700 --> 29:28.940
but move my mouse because it was that sub level of stimulation. Like I talk about people can't

29:28.940 --> 29:34.380
help but say the letter when that part of their brain is TMS. And that's what was happening there.

29:35.260 --> 29:40.140
But there are reasons why we have in the human genetic code autism and schizophrenia,

29:40.140 --> 29:44.060
why it hasn't been evolved out of us. And it's because both of these extremes are useful.

29:44.060 --> 29:50.060
Autism can make you able to act more logically about the world around you, not being encumbered

29:50.060 --> 29:54.860
by constantly mentally model others. And then my ability, people often will say it's like

29:54.860 --> 29:58.940
eerie how much I can tell what other people are thinking, like to the level where

29:58.940 --> 30:02.300
it can feel to some people like I can read their mind in a conversation.

30:02.300 --> 30:07.100
And I think that is why you have these people on these schizophrenia side of the spectrum.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.580
And then sometimes they just get a little too much of these genes, and it leads them to

30:11.580 --> 30:17.100
hear voices constantly, instead of just having a really hyperactive ability to mentally model

30:17.100 --> 30:24.620
anyone around them. Yeah, no, 100% Malcolm is on overdrive. And then he'll sometimes be

30:24.620 --> 30:28.540
thinking about conversations with other people while we're walking. And I can always tell,

30:28.540 --> 30:33.340
because he gets so deep into them that he's literally like gesturing as that's like we're

30:33.340 --> 30:37.980
driving in the car, like one hand is on the steering wheel, the other hand is like gesturing

30:37.980 --> 30:42.620
his silent conversation he's having with someone he anticipates speaking within the future,

30:42.620 --> 30:49.660
or reliving a conversation he had in the past. And he will have these aftershocks from when

30:49.660 --> 30:57.820
we socialize, where he feels the stress or pain of saying something not quite right to someone.

30:57.900 --> 31:04.460
And it hits him like a ton of bricks, and he will like visibly like crumble and cringe.

31:05.740 --> 31:09.020
It's not just cringe. Yes, like somebody just kicked me in the nuts or something.

31:09.020 --> 31:15.100
Yeah, like, it looks like he has been physically hurt by something. And that is not something

31:15.100 --> 31:22.780
that I can even begin to imagine. And I do think that it's a lot less stressful to be on the

31:22.780 --> 31:31.260
autistic end of the spectrum and to just not know that other people like nothing going on there.

31:32.220 --> 31:36.220
Such a good partnership. And I think it was one of our main goals throughout our books and throughout

31:36.220 --> 31:40.380
our lives to understand how humans think and process things and what's really happening in

31:40.380 --> 31:44.700
the human brain. I started my career as a neuroscientist and a philosopher. That was my

31:44.700 --> 31:49.660
interest. It's like, what's really going on? And being able to be in a relationship with somebody

31:49.740 --> 31:54.060
who sees the world so differently has given me such insights that I would never come to on

31:54.060 --> 31:59.100
my own. And I just admire that so much about you, Simone. And I admire that you have taken me to

31:59.100 --> 32:05.340
where I am, which is somewhere I never could have reached without your guidance. And I love you so

32:05.340 --> 32:11.340
much. I love you so much too. You're the superhero that I always wish existed. And I still worry

32:11.340 --> 32:15.500
that I'm going to wake up from a coma at some point and find out that you're the sidekick that

32:15.500 --> 32:20.380
actually does everything. I might be the superhero. She's the hacker nerd in the background that like

32:20.380 --> 32:24.780
actually makes everything work. And no, if the hacker nerd went away, the superhero would have

32:24.780 --> 32:31.020
nothing. That is so our relationship. I have nothing without you actually doing all the

32:31.020 --> 32:37.180
detective work and telling me where to go next. It's a massively inflated estimation of my

32:37.180 --> 32:44.300
contribution. I just follow her instructions. I don't manage my calendar at all. I'm operating

32:44.380 --> 32:49.580
on Simone is driving me like she says, what was the one thing like the thing from aliens?

32:50.700 --> 32:57.020
Oh, yeah, like I'm not talking to people. I'm the alien suit that you're using to punch through

32:57.020 --> 33:05.740
reality. Power loader. You're the you're Ripley. Oh, okay. That's the other way we both feel about

33:05.740 --> 33:11.660
each other. I adore you. I love these conversations. And I know we have to pick up the kids now. But

33:12.460 --> 33:16.860
I think you're going to make another dish tonight. So I'm going to have fun. Oh,

33:16.860 --> 33:21.900
yes, another base camp cooking. We have a little side playlist of anyone seen it where I try to

33:21.900 --> 33:26.540
come up with new dishes. So you get it right. You get to see the college household at night.

33:26.540 --> 33:34.220
What happens after that? Yes. All right, see you soon. Love you.
