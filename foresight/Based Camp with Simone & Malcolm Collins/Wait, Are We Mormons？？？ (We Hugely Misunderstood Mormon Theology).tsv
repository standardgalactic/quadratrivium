0	18000	This really shocked me because it was the more conservative Mormons, the ones who would be considered more extremists, who thought that we were more similar to Mormonism in our beliefs, and it was the less conservative Mormons who thought that our beliefs were more distant from Mormons.
18000	29680	If you look across the Mormon tradition, when I started talking to more Mormons and more conservative Mormons about the way they think like the metaphysics of the universe actually works, there is more diversity within Mormon beliefs.
30160	34160	Then there is within any other religion that I'm aware of.
34160	41360	What's extra interesting is there's both that diversity, but also this like quiet, like we don't talk about this diversity.
41360	42400	Yeah, we don't talk about this.
42400	43600	We don't talk about it.
43600	48640	So let's talk about one here, right? Like multiple mortal prohibitions, right?
48640	57040	This was fascinating to me because it has shown that I fundamentally misunderstood Mormonism in our previous videos on Mormonism.
57040	58560	Would you like to know more?
58560	60560	Well, this is very exciting.
60560	65840	I get to use my new fancy speaker because it's because it's metal like it right now.
65840	69200	I feel like I'm holding a frozen rod of ice right now.
69200	70040	It is so cool.
70040	71640	Is this your new camera?
71640	72640	Yeah.
72640	80840	OK, well, I am really excited for this episode and I am always so disappointed when there's an episode that like I absolutely love.
80840	83840	But like we don't get a bunch of watches on it or something.
83840	85080	No one's going to watch this.
85080	86280	Yeah, I don't know.
86360	96160	In terms of watching something that I thought I didn't want to watch, I watched all of Saturday Warriors per your request and it was cheesy and it was.
96160	97960	But oh my gosh, I cried.
97960	98760	I cried.
98760	99560	I cried.
99560	108160	So people who aren't familiar with Saturday Warriors, it was recommended to us because we've been talking a lot with a Mormon fan of the show to try to understand the religion better.
108160	110840	And he suggested that we check out this movie.
111000	116960	And it is really interesting because he said that like it gives a good example of why a lot of Mormons had a lot of kids.
116960	119240	So you can see their perspective.
119240	127560	And throughout the entire movie, you're having your heart strings pulled by this little girl who's stuck in heaven because her parents haven't had a kid yet.
127560	129440	And they haven't had all their kids.
129440	131920	They haven't had the seventh kid that they were supposed to have.
131920	132640	Eighth kid.
132640	133320	Eighth kid.
133320	135640	Emily, what's wrong?
135640	137440	I'm the last kid to be born.
137440	140040	What if by that time, mom and dad don't want me?
141000	144920	But I've seen lots of families make promises and then break them.
144920	146760	Not us.
146760	151440	Emily, I will see to it personally that you're not forgotten.
151440	152640	You promised to me?
152640	153640	I promise.
153640	153840	Yeah.
153840	160360	And then the other another one of their kids, the bad guys in this, you want to talk about getting us on board with you?
160360	163840	Bad guys in this were called Population Zero.
163840	172320	And they were a rock band that had seduced one of the sons into thinking abortion was cool and population reduction was cool.
172320	174000	Look at this.
174000	178520	Erlich says that population growth will lead to famine.
178520	182520	And in this decade, hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.
182520	185440	So what's the solution for his population control?
185440	190720	Well, people will need to be coerced, but it's for a good cause.
190720	195040	I mean, it's the only answer unless you don't like eating.
195040	196200	I think it's a little extreme.
196200	196920	Come on.
196920	197960	Well, this is serious.
197960	200560	People need to stop having so many kids.
200560	202320	No offense.
202320	206520	Jimmy, how come your parents can't keep their hands off each other?
206520	210160	You want to find out?
210160	213680	The earth is sick and we are the cancer.
213680	223680	Every day the babies are destroying the world.
223680	233680	Eating all our applesauce, what can we do?
233680	234680	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
234680	235680	Far out, man.
235680	236680	Play that again.
236680	238680	Just messing around, man.
238680	248680	No, Jimmy, for real this time, and keep that melody.
248680	257680	Every day the world is getting smaller by fall.
257680	264680	Bursting at the seams, what can we do?
264680	270680	Your population is the answer, my friend.
270680	277680	Without it, the rest of us are doomed.
277680	278680	Who can survive?
278680	279680	Who can survive?
279680	281680	Not one of us will be a...
281680	283680	Literally, anti-natalist rock band.
283680	284680	Hilarious.
284680	285680	Right?
285680	286680	Can you get more?
286680	289680	But this whole line of conversation started for us.
289680	292680	It was a really interesting moment for me.
292680	298680	I was on stage, and I have talked with the transhumanist Mormons before,
298680	301680	like the weird, technophilic Mormons,
301680	305680	which I think a lot of Mormons would consider kind of different from mainstream Mormons.
305680	312680	And the fact that our ideology and our belief system really aligns closely with theirs,
312680	315680	that did not surprise me at all.
315680	316680	Right.
316680	317680	Here's what shocked me.
317680	318680	So we're on the stage, it's Kevin Dolan.
318680	321680	Kevin Dolan is of the conservative faction of Mormons.
321680	324680	So much so that he's often, when people talk about like the Deseret Nationalists,
324680	326680	that's who they're talking about.
326680	327680	The Mormon separatists.
327680	332680	However, Mormon extremists disregarded federal warnings and established Port Joe Smith
332680	334680	deep inside the arachnid quarantine zone.
334680	339680	Too late, they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists.
339680	343680	Arachnids, would you like to know more?
343680	345680	So that's the faction.
345680	347680	And we were on stage and he just came out,
347680	350680	because I thought that he would see our religious beliefs,
350680	352680	our synthetic religious beliefs where we say,
352680	356680	okay, broadly in years from now, if our people alive,
356680	359680	they're probably going to be closer to gods than humans.
359680	362680	And that this, or the way we would think of a god than a human,
362680	365680	and that they wouldn't relate to time the way we relate to time.
365680	369680	And so it's sort of like a self-manifesting entity that is influencing us today.
369680	372680	So he saw this, he actually related it to interstellar.
372680	374680	He said, your beliefs are basically interstellar, right?
374680	376680	I don't know, I haven't seen it recently, but I was like, yeah, sure, why not?
376680	379680	And he's like, that is just Mormon.
379680	382680	Like he's like, you guys are basically just Mormons.
382680	384680	And that surprised me.
384680	390680	Because that did not align what I understood a conservative Mormon would think.
390680	392680	And I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait.
392680	395680	And so then I started talking to some other Mormons who were at the conference
395680	397680	about Mormonism.
397680	399680	And they're like, yeah, you guys are just Mormons,
399680	402680	or your beliefs are very similar to Mormon beliefs.
402680	407680	And this really shocked me because it was the more conservative Mormons,
407680	410680	the ones who would be considered more extremist,
410680	415680	who thought that we were more similar to Mormonism in our beliefs,
415680	417680	or as they would say at the Church of Latter-day Saints.
417680	424680	And it was the less conservative Mormons who thought that our beliefs were more distant from Mormons.
424680	425680	Isn't that wild?
425680	428680	Well, it's not wild when you dig into it.
428680	429680	Yes, right.
429680	435680	This was fascinating to me because it has shown that I fundamentally misunderstood Mormonism
435680	437680	in our previous videos on Mormonism,
437680	440680	and in our previous writings on Mormonism,
440680	442680	because I fundamentally one misunderstood,
442680	447680	well, the biggest thing is I misunderstood how they determine what they think is true.
447680	450680	And there's a very interesting thing that Mormons do
450680	454680	that no other faith in the world I'm aware of,
454680	456680	because like we have studied a lot of faith.
456680	458680	And none of the other ones do this.
459680	463680	Which is if I go to one Mormon and I say,
463680	467680	hey, I've heard a lot of Mormons believe X,
467680	471680	or like church fathers believe X and have talked about X frequently.
471680	475680	So like two examples here might be like eternal progression
475680	478680	or like multiple mortal prohibitions.
478680	480680	These are two things we'll both talk about on this podcast.
480680	485680	It is not infrequent if they do not believe in multiple mortal prohibitions or eternal progression.
485680	490680	They'll just say, no, no large group of Mormons have ever believed this.
490680	493680	None of the common Mormons ever believed this.
493680	495680	None of the church fathers ever believed this.
495680	498680	And many of you point to them like texts, like no,
498680	503680	like this is in like stuff that was put out by by major church fathers.
503680	507680	They'll then say, okay, maybe some Mormons do believe this,
507680	510680	but they are influenced by the devil.
510680	513680	What really influenced by the devil?
513680	515680	Yeah, this is regularly what you see.
515680	519680	And this is fascinating to me because like Protestants, for example,
519680	522680	I'm, I'm, you know, if you're talking about like pre-millennialist
522680	524680	or post-millennialist Protestants,
524680	527680	so people who don't know what I'm talking about here,
527680	529680	in the conservative Protestant community,
529680	533680	one of the biggest debates is does Jesus like,
533680	536680	like does the rapture happen before the tribulation
536680	540680	or does the rapture happen after the tribulation?
540680	545680	Do like, like devout Christians actually have to go through this period of tribulation
545680	547680	or will they be raptured beforehand?
547680	550680	And then the period of tribulation has been to help people, you know,
550680	554680	anyway, nuanced discussion, but none of them are going to say,
554680	557680	no, there's not some other group that has this other view.
557680	560680	And if there is, they're, they're being manipulated by the devil.
560680	564680	They're like, no, we have a serious difference in faith.
564680	568680	And we study this and, and these are the arguments from my faith.
568680	574680	So there's people out there who are mistaken, but you know, they're not like demons.
574680	577680	Well, and, and, and the, the reason why,
577680	579680	so this has really confused me about Mormonism,
579680	583680	because whenever I tried to study Mormonism in the past,
583680	586680	if I was going to get like a broad view of Mormonism,
586680	591680	I actually would always get the best broad views from people who had left the church.
591680	592680	Hmm. Yeah.
592680	595680	Well, often those are the people who are talking about it.
595680	596680	Well, yeah.
596680	599680	So, and I should point out, I'm not saying that Mormons never disagree about this stuff,
599680	603680	but if you want to see like the actual disagreements that Mormons are having,
603680	605680	go to the comment section on Mormon blogs.
605680	609680	Don't go to the articles themselves.
609680	615680	And this then came to why would the conservatives be more accepting of our beliefs than the non-conservatives?
615680	619680	Why would they think that our beliefs are closer to Mormon beliefs?
619680	623680	And this is because the more sophisticated Mormon theology,
623680	626680	the more interesting Mormon theology from my perspective,
626680	633680	and, and frankly, it's sort of wackier, wackier in that it is less in a line with just generic in theology,
633680	637680	actually typically the older Mormon theology,
637680	643680	or the Mormon theology you would know if you dug really deep into Mormon history.
643680	647680	Well, I mean, that was really interesting about one way that it was explained to us.
647680	653680	Is it like from like most really unique LDS theological concepts,
653680	659680	you need to have an IQ of at least 130 and most like most Mormons don't.
659680	660680	They don't really care.
660680	661680	They're not really involved in it.
661680	664680	And it's really about the lifestyle and even a lot of leadership,
664680	669680	just like theology is not like the primary thing of action here.
669680	670680	It's, it's.
670680	673680	I'll actually read a quote from one of the early church fathers,
673680	680680	which I found very interesting and quite prophetic of our own belief system.
680680	685680	Orson Pratt, this is the guy who was born in 1811, wrote this, right?
685680	688680	And, and so when I first went to them, I was like, yeah, but you know,
688680	691680	we believe that like intergenerationally,
691680	694680	like we don't believe that everyone's going to inherit their own planet one day or something like that.
694680	696680	And they're like, oh, no, no, no, that's not actually.
696680	699680	So they pointed me to this Orson Pratt quote,
699680	701680	but not everyone's going to inherit their own planet one day.
701680	706680	Some people will as humans, like similar to humans as we are today,
706680	709680	will be elevated to a state of Godhood.
709680	712680	And they're like, some Mormons believe that some Mormons believe other things.
712680	716680	You should look at what the actual, you know, quotes from these early church fathers.
716680	718680	So I'm going to read this quote by Orson Pratt.
718680	722680	This is on whenever he uses the word intelligence, he's talking about the soul.
722680	729680	And so he sort of has this hypothesis that maybe the soul exists as individual soul particles,
729680	734680	which when people die, can break apart and reform.
734680	739680	So like we may have some soul particles in us that previously came from like plants or something like that.
739680	749680	So we say we can suppose that these particles possessed of the power to move themselves would not have exerted that power during the endless duration proceeding their organization.
749680	757680	If they were once organized in the vegetable kingdom, and then disorganized by becoming the food of celestial animals,
757680	762680	and then again reorganized in the form of spirits of animals, which is a higher sphere of being,
762680	772680	then is it unreasonable to suppose that the scene particles have from eternity been passing through an endless chain of unions and disunions,
772680	782680	organizations and disorganizations until at least they are permitted to enter into the highest and most exalted sphere of organization in the image of God.
782680	785680	So that's really fascinating.
785680	788680	And here's a quote from Brigham Young.
788680	800680	When the elements in an organized form do not fill the end of their creation, they are thrown back again, like Brother Kimball's old potteryware to be ground up and made again.
800680	818680	So you hear these two and these purport an idea of sort of human souls going through a cycle in which they eventually become God like souls through this sort of forging and reforging process,
818680	826680	which is actually really, really similar to our belief if you made it entirely materialistic.
826680	841680	Isn't that something the idea that like our kids are a part of us in a chance to improve on us, you know, intergenerationally and that they have, you know, what we would think of as the soul, which is the collection of ideas and genetics that make us up.
841680	847680	They have aspects of that but reforge to improve and that eventually this thing will become a deity.
847680	853680	Very, very, very, very, very, very similar beliefs, but these are early church beliefs.
853680	863680	And so early Mormons like Mormons who are of the most conservative faction would align more with these earlier beliefs than the more modern church beliefs.
863680	873680	And so the question would be why did the church changes beliefs, and this comes to a really unique thing about Mormonism I didn't fully grasp.
874680	893680	So it is that Mormonism unlike any religious tradition in the entire world, the current prophet, the current head of the religion has more say than their original book or the founder of the religion.
894680	902680	That is the current prophet can override Joseph Smith can just say Joseph Smith was wrong when he said that.
902680	917680	No other religion you as a Muslim would say like Mohammed was misunderstood, or this was misquoted or this was, or you would say this about Jesus, you know, you wouldn't say the pope cannot override Jesus.
917680	919680	Like that would be considered insane.
919680	920680	Yeah.
920680	923680	It actually gets even wilder than that.
923680	941680	There are instances I have found where current prophets, like Elder Fielding in Answers to Gospel Questions volume five will claim that Joseph Smith said things that he definitely doesn't seem to have ever said or at least was never recorded in anything I can find.
941680	949680	For example, that's where the quote that goes something along the lines of the prophet Joseph Smith said that reincarnation is a doctrine of the devil.
949680	962680	And have you not read that the devil would deceive the elect where when I tried to look through textual evidence, I cannot find Joseph Smith saying anywhere that he thought reincarnation was a tool of the devil.
962680	971680	And in fact, I can find many sources that seem to indicate and many of his contemporaries seem to indicate that he did believe in some form of reincarnation.
971680	980680	Though Joseph Smith did say that the doctrine of transmigration of souls or souls passing directly to your children was false.
980680	986680	So imagine if you had something like the pope saying Jesus said that this is of the devil.
986680	993680	And you're just like or a current, you know, imam saying Mohammed said this is this is a doctrine of the devil.
993680	996680	And yet there is no evidence for that.
996680	1003680	This would be incredibly confusing to an outsider trying to learn about the religion and what the boundaries of the belief system actually are.
1003680	1006680	And it leads to a religion.
1006680	1010680	I had talked about Mormon being an accelerationist religion in the past.
1010680	1013680	What I undersold how accelerationist it is.
1013680	1016680	Well, I think you didn't even know the extent, I think.
1016680	1017680	Yeah, yeah.
1017680	1025680	So it made it really hard for me because I'm trying to go out there and understand what do Mormons actually believe.
1025680	1031680	And I was continually thwarted because I was thinking about it like a Protestant or a Catholic or a Jew.
1031680	1033680	Thinking about it like a Protestant, like just my typical.
1033680	1034680	Okay, I'm looking at their books.
1034680	1036680	What did their books actually say?
1036680	1037680	What did the founding fathers?
1037680	1041680	What are the most important people in the movement actually say?
1041680	1044680	And they'll just like dismiss this stuff.
1044680	1046680	Like this famous speech by Joseph Smith.
1046680	1053680	Oh, I put a thing here where he basically lays out the idea that, oh yeah, humans will eventually become gods.
1053680	1055680	Some modern Mormons just throw this out.
1055680	1058680	Why do they just throw this out?
1058680	1061680	And that God started like a human today, right?
1061680	1067680	And you can look at, here are some quotes that AI generated when I was having it, like asking it about Mormon concepts.
1067680	1069680	What?
1069680	1074680	It said, God was once as humans are now, but eternally God.
1074680	1077680	That is exactly what we believe about God.
1077680	1082680	He was once as humans are now because he was once us, like literally us.
1082680	1085680	But he also was eternally God because that's the way we think time works.
1085680	1090680	A being like God and Christ means unity of purpose, not abilities.
1090680	1095680	So being like God and Christ means unity of purpose, not abilities.
1095680	1097680	You would say, yes, exactly.
1097680	1101680	That's what this intergenerational improvement means.
1101680	1104680	Or you could look at something like their belief in pre-life, basically, right?
1104680	1110680	Like in this movie, it started with all of them sort of in heaven, living their pre-lives, having their pre-families.
1110680	1111680	Hi, I'm Todd.
1111680	1112680	Richards.
1112680	1113680	I know.
1113680	1114680	We're in love.
1114680	1120680	And so we were wondering if it's possible if you could put us down in the same town.
1120680	1121680	Right.
1121680	1122680	Or the same street.
1122680	1124680	At least at the same time, if possible.
1124680	1125680	How about the same family?
1125680	1126680	Yes.
1126680	1127680	That would be great, yeah.
1127680	1128680	No.
1128680	1129680	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1129680	1133680	We believe something very similar, but it's due to how we see time.
1133680	1135680	Because we see all time is happening at once.
1135680	1143680	We believe that all of our kids, our friends, do know each other and are waiting to come into existence, but in the future.
1143680	1144680	Right.
1144680	1152680	So to be, to clarify, in the movie, Saturday Warriors, it begins with everyone in heaven and they already know each other and they know that they're going to be family.
1152680	1154680	And they're like, oh, I can't wait.
1154680	1155680	This is going to be so great.
1155680	1157680	What kind of dance should I do first for mom and dad?
1157680	1159680	Something classical?
1159680	1160680	Or?
1160680	1161680	Cha-cha.
1161680	1164680	Cha-cha.
1165680	1167680	So, maybe just a twist then.
1167680	1172680	Yeah.
1172680	1176680	Whereas like, we don't think there's some anti-chamber before.
1176680	1183680	It's just that everything that has happened and will happen is happening and it's sort of all at once.
1183680	1185680	And it's already happened.
1185680	1186680	Yes.
1186680	1193340	Like my little daughter when I interact with my little daughter in 10 years and it's kid number 12 that everyone told us not to have
1194280	1198840	Is that little girl who's being denied life by us choosing not to have a kid?
1199320	1202800	It is a life that we would have robbed
1203160	1206920	Right just as much as Mormon think that you have robbed a person of their life
1207420	1211400	One thing that I want to say which I think is really interesting is when I look at these Mormon videos
1211760	1213760	They're very similar to
1214040	1221040	How if we were trying to explain our belief systems to a child or somebody who is living in like the early
1221600	1226960	1800s we would have explained our belief system which makes it feel very
1227560	1231460	contiguous with Mormonism in fact one part of our
1232440	1236600	Holiday future day that we haven't really talked much publicly about and we've been
1237200	1244360	Solidifying actually after after seeing this movie how it would play out is the day of martyrs which comes before future day
1244600	1250840	Which is dedicated to readings of the martyrdom of man one of the books that we see
1250920	1256500	Like we would see Joseph Smith as being divinely inspired by the same entity
1256520	1261880	Which we believe inspired us in which every member of the family both the kids and us
1262360	1265140	Explained to past iterations of their parents
1265200	1271560	So that would be our parents in our case why they should have us and why it is a good thing that we would come to
1271720	1275000	Exist and what we plan to do with that existence
1275080	1279920	Well, also thinking our ancestors not just you know our biological ancestors
1279920	1287480	But the ancestors of humanity in general for the hardships that they underwent to give us our current
1288080	1294200	Technological and material bounty as the martyrdom of man states even in the 1800s
1294200	1302960	That's your average English person back then lived a better life than your Anglo-Saxon King and you know from our perspective today
1303360	1310440	Your average American probably lives a better life than the Queen of England when that book was written and this is through the
1311680	1312760	intergenerational
1312760	1319880	martyrdom of our ancestors and ourselves to make things better for the next generation and it is a
1320280	1323400	This is where they sort of take up the mantle of that responsibility
1323880	1330280	This cycle of continual improvement while also hopefully instilling an amount of gratitude
1330880	1333800	For how good they have it vis-a-vis
1334240	1339160	What the daily life of most humans used to be like hundreds of years ago?
1339160	1348000	This is meant to instill in our kids that they exist for a reason and that being alive is a privilege
1348000	1350000	and it's a privilege that comes with
1350600	1353000	duties and responsibilities to
1353800	1356960	Justify your own existence. I should note here though
1356960	1363640	It's less relevant for this particular conversation that the day of martyrs is also dedicated to reading from Fox's book of martyrs
1363640	1371280	Not just the martyrdom of man. These readings are meant to remind kids and our family more broadly what our duty is in
1371320	1372680	face of
1372680	1379200	tyranny or those who would claim to have mental authority over our belief systems
1379200	1385280	Well also reminding them to never become that person themselves never become the person who is
1385720	1392400	Telling somebody else what they have to believe is true and not true because the highest level of freedom an
1392520	1398960	Individual has is the freedom to choose what they believe and that freedom must both be protected
1399000	1402200	but also in parts on individuals the duty to
1402760	1406880	Think carefully about those things and decide with prudence
1407240	1413480	How you think things actually work without allowing other people to tell you what to believe now
1413480	1417640	Obviously, we haven't talked about this publicly yet because it's one of the belief systems
1417760	1426040	That's probably gonna get us most shamed by anti-natalists, but it is very very similar to these scenes in Saturday Warriors
1426040	1428920	I love how a lot of our more publicly facing
1429560	1432400	Documents are more just like philosophy and stuff like that
1432440	1438160	But we get into actual like religious insanity if you are actually a regular listener to the podcast
1438240	1442440	So I swear when like anti-natalists are prepping for a debate with us or something
1442440	1448680	This is what they must be imagining far as I'm concerned this Saturday night. There's not even gonna be a fight
1448680	1450680	I will torture his body
1450920	1457220	So that he's so learns to be humble. I'm gonna knock him out round one bitch. God chose me for this fight
1457800	1459800	God is the teacher
1459800	1461960	Derek is the student wait
1463320	1464960	What do you say?
1464960	1466960	Yeah, God chose him
1467320	1469320	God's lessons are
1470280	1471960	So beautiful
1471960	1475360	God's lessons are beautiful. I'm sorry. Who put this fight together
1476120	1484200	This is what I do if y'all got an actual crazy person to meet for me to fight well, that's not fair to me or him
1490000	1496040	I'm sorry, is this a crazy now this gets really interesting and it's sort of I think the core failure of
1496640	1500440	Mormonism and modern Mormonism is that a lot of
1501200	1509280	Mormonism recently in Mormon trends and like why they pretend or or move towards not having these beliefs is a
1510960	1517240	Drive to be seen as quote-unquote normal Christians or just another branch of Christianity
1518000	1520000	and in that
1520520	1528440	Quest they have abandoned many of the spiky and more unique parts of their history and theology
1529280	1535280	Which were honestly the more sophisticated and compelling parts to me now that I have the cooler stuff, right?
1535680	1538640	But I think that that's the case with most
1539200	1545800	Religions that like if you actually dive deep into the dogma and you really really get into it and get technical
1545800	1551360	It does get weird. No, no, Protestant think so evangelicals. They've gone so much
1552200	1557920	No, I'm referring to like Catholicism Judaism Islam like I'm going into like I'm not
1558280	1560280	I'm not talking about
1560760	1565320	When those religions become softer when they abandon the weirder parts as themselves
1565600	1571260	They're typically doing it in an effort to conform with the urban monoculture
1572220	1576340	And that's my point when I'm when I'm talking about when you get to the core of a religion and it gets weird
1576340	1578540	I'm referring to hard religions, right?
1578540	1580820	I guess you're right to an extent
1580820	1587260	But what's really interesting is that Mormonism hasn't attempted to conform to the urban monoculture as much like there's a faction that's doing that
1587380	1592100	But where they have lost most of their traditions is in trying to conform to conservative
1592260	1599260	iterations of other Christian denomination where they have become tried to become more like just another type of evangelical Protestants
1599540	1604620	When they are nothing like and this and so the question is is why are they doing this?
1604620	1610860	And this is when I look at Mormonism as an outsider and and I look at the collapsing fertility rates within Mormonism
1610860	1613820	I actually think that this is a problem of the genetic vortex
1613820	1621360	So we talked about how religions and genetics can reinforce each other where people with specific genetic predilections can convert to a religion
1621700	1627360	Disproportionately which can lead to those sociological profiles being higher within that religion. I think historically
1628080	1634280	Mormonism really selected for and in culturally and genetically. So I think there's two things going on here
1634880	1637600	an extreme amount of
1638480	1643360	social anxiety and and desire to engage in social
1643800	1645640	Status competitions, right?
1645640	1651400	And I think that this is why if you look at like the way that like alcohol ravaged Native American communities
1651400	1656380	I think things like tiktok and social media have ravaged Mormon communities same was
1657600	1659600	Tiktok is the alcohol of
1659720	1667360	To of Mormon people. Well that and that this desire to fit in is what drove them to abandoning
1667360	1669160	I think the more
1669160	1675040	Interesting and to my perspective sophisticated aspect of their religion but also to deny that they're different
1675040	1680560	So this is another really interesting thing if you look across the Mormon tradition when I started like talking to more Mormons and more
1680560	1685000	Conservative Mormons about the way they think like the metaphysics of the universe actually works, right?
1685040	1687840	There is more diversity within Mormon beliefs
1687840	1693240	Yeah, then there is within any other religion that I'm aware of like what's it?
1693240	1699440	What's extra interesting is there's both that diversity, but also this like quiet like we don't talk about this diversity
1699720	1704680	Yeah, we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it. So so let's let's talk about one here, right?
1704680	1710700	Like multiple mortal prohibitions, right? Okay define what that is. So this is the so there
1711580	1717100	Okay, so there's different theories on what it means or ways that the church relates to it, right?
1717100	1718060	All right
1718060	1722180	some people like the most mainstream perspective in the church is
1722860	1727220	You exist before you're born like this is one prohibition you come to life, right?
1727220	1732900	As a human and then you die and then comes the next part like whatever comes after that
1732940	1733860	Okay
1733860	1739260	Some Mormons though believe that you actually sort of get reincarnated or like the quote
1739260	1743620	I was talking about earlier like that doesn't just mean that your soul holistically gets reincarnated
1743620	1746740	It may be like a dissolved recombined reincarnated
1746900	1750820	But that's a huge diversity in beliefs about what happens after death
1751060	1756900	There really are some Mormons that believe that that most people are going to get their own planet and become gods
1756900	1763500	Like if they're good people and they follow Mormon teachings my father my brother and I had been there at the hospital
1764380	1767540	As we walked out my brother and I who went to the car together
1768540	1774900	Smile they looked up in the mountains and remember that mother had always said she loved the mountains so much that he and I laughed and
1775220	1780020	Guess that if in fact the celestial worlds are really flat a sea of glass
1780380	1784540	She'll be eager to get away to build her own worlds and the first thing she'll build will be mountains
1784820	1786860	But a lot of Mormons don't believe that at all
1786860	1794740	They believe in like more of a traditional heaven like that's a while different in beliefs like you do not see like you look at a
1794900	1802860	Belief system that has many different beliefs right like a huge diversity like Hinduism. Yeah, but at least they agree broadly on what happens after you die
1804340	1807380	Yeah, no, this is so interesting and also like that over time
1807780	1814060	There's been a shift within the LDS church on like what cannon gets more emphasis like
1814460	1823060	One person said that currently they feel like it's 35 percent book of Mormon 10 percent Old Testament and 25 percent New Testament and then
1823380	1828460	You know, maybe like 30 percent DNC plus pearl of great price
1828460	1834620	Which I hadn't even heard of before but then like they they also thought that the Book of Mormon probably peaked in
1835340	1838420	1990 and New Testament is probably at its peak now
1838420	1846980	So these like shifts in emphasis too of like which which which text is getting a lot of emphasis which to me sounded a lot like
1847820	1853820	Jewish tradition it seems like in Jewish tradition like different texts will get emphasis at different times as well
1853940	1860380	So just I just had no idea there was this level of dynamicness, right? This is insane a lot in common with Jewish tradition
1860380	1866980	Yeah, except it has a weird mix of Jewish and Catholic versions of how they determine right well because like with with Jewish traditions
1866980	1872540	Like you just you know like there are names for the different subsets of like these guys believe this thing and these guys believe this thing and
1872540	1877540	Emphasize this text and blah blah blah so you like know who's and the one who wins is the one who gets the most followers, right?
1877540	1881060	And then but with with Catholicism, it's like no we're like here's where we are
1881060	1884020	You know this these this is the official stance with it was a Judaism
1884020	1888700	It's like you have these fall you these different theologies like bubbling in the background, right?
1888700	1895220	And then the one that wins is the one that covertly gets the most social acceptance within the community
1895220	1900340	Right, and then that becomes what the current prophet will say or whatever. Yeah, and that is
1901340	1906340	Genuinely fascinating, but it's and it's not even the current prophet with the LDS church either
1906340	1913380	And I remember seeing this with my friends in college who were Mormon like everyone kind of has their favorite
1914060	1916060	their favorite and like
1916500	1923860	People will wax nostalgic about in like different subgroups and subcultures within the LDS church will have their like it was this guy
1923860	1928000	He had he had it figured out and I thought that that's really interesting too that like
1928440	1931520	that there is a disproportionate influence of
1932520	1934520	You know the current
1934880	1937800	Had honcho essentially, but some groups
1938600	1942980	Still give the disproportionate emphasis to their favorite past one, which is super interesting
1943480	1949840	Yeah, so then this all becomes very interesting because when I first asked this question are we actually just Mormons, right?
1949840	1952040	I came at it thinking like a Protestant
1952040	1958000	I'm like, I'll go to the text and see the outlines of what beliefs make someone a Mormon, right?
1958000	1962120	Oh, yeah, like what what metaphysical understanding of reality etc etc, right?
1962120	1967200	Like what is the boundaries of their metaphysical understanding of reality where if you pass out of it?
1967200	1973520	You would know definitely no longer be a Mormon anymore. Yeah, and what I found is that's not the way Mormonism works. Nope
1973520	1978160	And so well then it becomes a cultural question or rather what we think of Mormonism
1978160	1982000	And then I think whether or not we are Mormons depends on what Mormons thinks
1982040	1990040	Like yeah, it's up to them because our beliefs aren't really changing other than the way that we relate to Mormonism as a cultural group
1990040	1993800	Yeah, so but I think we we're the same way about
1994600	1997640	Judaism like yeah, you know what whether we
1998000	2003440	Consider our kids to be Jewish depends on what other Jews think and so many Jews have been like well
2003440	2007360	If you're matrilinearly Jewish then you're Jewish and so we're like well, okay, then our kids are Jewish
2007360	2014520	But like yeah, it's interesting that we to a certain extent define whether or not we fall into another religion's category of being part of them
2014520	2017960	It's like well, you tell us, you know, like we're doing our thing over here, but you tell us
2018000	2020680	but hold on now this gets interesting to us so then
2023200	2026360	With our perspective and we're talking about this concern more he goes
2026360	2031960	Oh, your beliefs were divinely inspired they came to you via revelation in the same way that you know
2031960	2038160	Joseph Smith's beliefs came to him and if you look at Joseph Smith from our religion's traditions, right?
2038160	2040920	So there's a video where we talk about like the demons we make for our kids and I'm like
2040920	2045680	I just took those demons from books that were popular during my lifetime
2046120	2049120	But I still think that they are likely real
2049920	2056520	Representations of the way that the demonic force the basilisk as we call it the the evil side of the future police that tests us
2056520	2058880	Call it the basilisk after Rocco's basilisk
2058880	2062480	We recently came up with this and I really like this at the term for the adversary the basilisk
2062480	2066720	And the other word that we came up with recently was agents of Providence instead of you the other word future police
2066720	2069560	Which sounds a little too hokey for us for you Malcolm
2071360	2075600	So so we believe that we were influenced by modern-day media
2075600	2084520	But that modern-day media was inspired and to an extent constructed by God the beings that exist in the future, right?
2084720	2090880	So when you look at the traditional complaints about Joseph Smith, hold on a minute
2092400	2094400	Pull this up at the beginning here
2096760	2099840	Where you know a lot of people will say well, you know if you look at the
2100600	2106040	Mormon theology it appears to borrow a lot from what we're like at the time sci-fi books like
2106280	2109120	I'm you Hebrew is which was a book that said well
2109120	2113400	Maybe the lost tribe of Israel went to the United States and had some other things that aligned with Mormonism
2113440	2116680	And then a voyage to the moon which was a popular sci-fi of the time
2116680	2120520	Some Mormon stuff actually has a lot of parallels to that and so people will say well
2120520	2124800	He was just copying you know fiction of his time whereas from our perspective. We'd say yes
2124800	2130520	That's how God works. Yeah God inspired that fiction so that it could influence Joseph Smith. Yeah. Yep
2130520	2137480	Or they'd say no he was just making this up like reading things out of a hat that that in order to and it's like
2137480	2140760	Yeah, that's what we did with our religion. I still think it's divinely inspired
2140840	2149000	I still think that the God create like like motivated us through whatever means they could to create an entirely new like
2149000	2153320	Or we thought new religious structure that we now find has a lot of parallels with early Mormon
2153480	2157920	You know theology, right? So we look at Joseph Smith's doing that. We're like, yeah
2157920	2159640	That doesn't mean it wasn't divinely inspired at all
2159640	2164680	In fact to us when we're determining whether or not a belief system was divinely inspired
2164760	2170560	We look at its efficacy its spread and the quality of life of its members
2171400	2178520	And from that it is self-evident that Mormonism was one of the many belief systems that was divinely inspired
2178600	2180600	Like we think that Christianity
2180600	2184680	Given the impact it's had on human history given the importance it's had on us in
2184920	2189800	In developing the way we see the world and everything like that that christ was literally
2190440	2193960	a divinely manipulated or inspired being and
2194600	2196520	As evidence of that
2196520	2198760	Is the effect that he has had on the world
2199400	2202920	So much so that if mary says well, you know, he was created
2203080	2206920	Who's to say the future beliefs like if they're really going to influence like one person's life
2207000	2211400	They're like we're really investing in this person having a huge impact with the agents of providence
2211400	2214920	If we're really investing on this one person having a big impact on human history
2215480	2217800	Who's to say they didn't actually fertilize his mother?
2218360	2223160	Right like that could have happened in which case that is god fertilizing his mother, right?
2223240	2227880	So so in that instance, you know, we do believe an agent of the divine now
2228200	2233800	I think that's probably less likely than other other options that they could have used available to them
2234200	2237240	But for all of these things they they do not
2237880	2241000	Have any discord with our belief system. So from us. Yes
2241400	2247560	Joseph Smith was self-evidently a divinely inspired individual and he was inspired by the same
2248040	2254600	Things that inspired us and yet his revelation in the early church father's revelation was an incomplete revelation
2254760	2257240	just as he would say, you know the
2258120	2260520	Just the Protestant texts are an incomplete revelation
2261080	2263000	And so in that sense
2263000	2269480	Yes, but we aren't like culturally Mormon and we don't relate to truth the way Mormons relate to truth
2269720	2274040	Although our family people often think we're Mormons people who aren't Mormons when they visit us
2274040	2276840	I remember one guy we tried to sell our company to him. I don't know if you remember this
2277320	2280600	And you know, we were walking with him and he goes, you know, I'd sell my company to you guys
2280600	2284600	But I really don't feel comfortable. You know, you guys are really a little too strong with this whole Mormon thing
2286120	2291480	And we're like what like just maybe maybe you're more Mormon than you think Malcolm
2291800	2295880	Maybe I don't know. I drink I hear a lot of Mormons do that too. You know, it might be
2297400	2300680	I mean, you know, there's like the whole no caffeine thing, but then like everyone's
2301480	2303480	You know drinking tons of like
2303960	2311160	I don't know but but I will say that I now feel much more of a kinship with this religious tradition
2312040	2314040	than I did historically
2314760	2316120	and
2316120	2321720	One thing that I believe about Mormonism, you know, after studying it more after looking at the the the actual diversity of
2321800	2323800	Seological beliefs with in Mormonism
2323880	2330440	Is I do not think that the centralized structure that that makes up the Mormon church right now is long term stable
2330840	2336520	It's sort of like if all Mormons actually just hashed out their theological differences, they would realize that they're not the same religion
2336840	2341720	well, but I think you're what you're missing here is that for the vast majority of
2343000	2349160	LDS church members, it's not about the doctrine. It's about the lifestyle and I think there's more agreement on that
2349880	2353080	Well, you know, so this is really interesting. They're part of the same cultural group
2353400	2358680	Yeah, it's cultural group. So within something like, you know, Judaism when they are having theological differences
2358680	2360760	They'll debate it with like biblical texts and stuff like that
2360760	2365640	What's really interesting is when I look at Mormon theological debates, they do not often go back to text
2365880	2367880	They will relate to modern science
2368200	2371000	Depending like whatever science was common during their time period
2371320	2372760	They will relate to
2372760	2376920	philosophical constructs very similar to like a metaphysics department at a university
2377400	2380280	They are very unbounded by text
2380760	2386200	In the debates that I've read and like the comment sections on blogs that are supposed to be about conservative Mormons
2386600	2391800	And so in a way, you know being part of this larger cultural group and saying, okay
2391800	2393640	We'll agree to just have those of us
2393640	2397800	We'll all participate in this larger cultural group, which is under the central hierarchy
2398200	2402840	But those of us that are smart, we're actually allowed to think very broadly
2403240	2407000	Around the way we relate to the divine around the way we relate to the concept of
2407320	2414600	Don't you feel like you're kind of describing what what we describe as the index where like you have a bunch of culturally aligned
2415240	2418200	We kind of all want the same thing things groups
2418760	2424120	Who share a dating pool who share a lot of cultural resources that work better at scale
2424760	2427400	Who may have some different metaphysical
2428360	2434600	Views on how things work, but ultimately work better together and are just pulling and sharing these resources
2434680	2436360	I feel like that's
2436360	2438360	Very stable and I feel like it's a
2439400	2441400	Pretty smart solution
2442120	2443880	Yeah, so
2443880	2447400	Here's my take. So would would you say would you say we're Mormons or we're not Mormons?
2449080	2455640	To what I said earlier, I think it depends on what various Mormons would say to some Mormons. We're Mormons to other Mormons. We're not Mormons
2456760	2461960	Yeah, well, I I agree with that and I think we're we're way more Mormon than many Mormons. I'll say that
2462520	2466520	Okay, well, I'd be very interested to see where where Mormonism ends up going
2466600	2470360	If they can maintain this centralized structure, that would be very interesting
2470680	2474440	If they do end up dividing into different subgroups
2474920	2478440	That's where and I think that this is well the core reason we're not Mormons
2478440	2481320	It's the way we relate to truth is a bit different than the way Mormons relate to truth
2481720	2484920	and that we we really care about this level of
2485880	2489800	Technical correctness and the same way that like even when we went into Mormonism trying to look at their scripture
2489800	2492520	Oh, but like we want a hard sci-fi version of religion, right?
2492600	2496680	But I also I don't think I think many and we've met them now
2496840	2500440	I think many people in the LDS church who consider themselves to be quite devout
2501000	2506040	Are taking the same approach. Well, and that's why I think that if we look in a hundred years or in 200 years
2506520	2510680	What becomes like if our religious system continues down the road?
2510680	2513240	It's going down and our kids are raised within that system
2513720	2517400	If they met a Mormon in 200 years because I also think that Mormonism is changing
2517720	2523000	From one of these technophilic factions and they're still around in a hundred years. I think there would be almost no difference
2523720	2526920	Hmm very very very very similar belief system. Well, there you go
2527560	2531880	But I do not think that we are whatever Mormonism is today and whatever we are today
2532280	2534280	I think are two slightly different things
2534600	2540680	However, I think whatever we are today may actually be more appealing to some people who maybe historically
2541080	2545000	Would have been within the Mormon church if the church does go woke or something like that
2545240	2548920	And that's where I think that we may end up merging in the near term
2549320	2550120	If
2550120	2554760	Well, like I saw one guy who had like donated to biden is in line for church succession
2555240	2559320	So they may go. Whoa the next guy going or they may go super conservative
2559320	2561560	It's hard to say no the next guy is very conservative
2561560	2565800	And so what happens? Does that mean the conservatives leaves the movement? Maybe maybe they don't if they do
2566280	2570280	Then that's where I'm like, okay that group of Mormons that has left the central church
2570520	2572520	Maybe it's just our bristling was hierarchy
2572840	2575320	We would be very open to joining
2575800	2582520	Any aspect of the merman church that broke from the central hierarchy, but so long as they are
2583080	2586600	Under the central hierarchy. We just have too much of an instinctual
2587880	2589080	distaste in other words
2589080	2596520	We we bristle at the idea that there would be something like a conference sunday and some random guy would sit up and talk about like
2597240	2602120	These are our values. This is our lifestyle and we're like, no, no, don't speak for us. Don't speak for us
2602200	2605960	This is not okay. So yeah that that we can never square with I think
2606920	2614360	Yeah, that's fair, but I think that one day will be Mormons. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I have been called an honorary Mormon for many years of my life
2614600	2615880	so
2615880	2620040	By that means it's is she really culturally identified with Mormon in college
2620040	2622440	She never drunk or anything like that because all of her friends are Mormons
2622600	2629240	And I went to a Mormon preschool too like all of my like most I guess culturally formative and like comfortable periods of my life
2629400	2631400	Were in exclusively Mormon groups
2632200	2633400	so
2633400	2635400	Until I met you and then you're my new home
2637240	2640200	So thank you for that. I love you. I love you Simone and yeah
2640200	2644680	It was so funny watching that movie because I was like, oh, this is just what we believe like a saturday morning preacher with
2644840	2650120	That's called saturday warrior saturday warrior. Yeah saturday warriors. Check it out if you're watching
2650280	2654920	I'll add a link to it's on youtube. You can watch the whole thing. There was a remake in the 90s
2655800	2657800	Really engaging
2659640	2661640	Answer my friend
2663080	2666440	Without it the rest of us are due
2673800	2677240	When I saw that I kept being like, oh, that's just us like that's the way we see kids
2677320	2678920	That's the way we see
2678920	2683880	You know the future that's the way and it also really relates to our views around things like IVF in a way that differentiates us from
2683880	2685960	Catholics and that I believe that we are killing the kids
2685960	2690120	We do not we need to do everything in our power to bring these kids to life
2690280	2693960	Yeah, we you know everything else is the kid who we have left
2694520	2699400	Because we have killed a kid that I need to answer to one day one of my kids that wouldn't be here with us
2699400	2704760	You know, yeah, there's this one scene in which the the parents are in the hospital three months pregnant and like
2705880	2708600	The the pregnancy is kind of iffy and the mother's kind of you know
2708600	2711960	Like in a lot of pain and who knows what's going to happen and like the unborn girl
2712440	2714680	Is watching in the hospital room kind of like
2715480	2719000	Like is everything going to be okay? And she's like this cute little girl and you're like
2719560	2720600	No
2720600	2724520	This pregnancy has to go through so it's yeah, they really you know
2724520	2729960	They tug at your heartstrings despite it being dated and cheesy and I hate musicals and it's a musical
2730680	2736840	I'm telling you man. I cried like a baby every every kid we don't bring into our family is someone that we have erased from the timeline
2737240	2743240	Yeah, well this this really if if someone struggles to understand what we mean when we say that it might help to watch this
2744040	2746040	musical
2746280	2748280	I really like
2749000	2755160	It comes back to anime every time. Well, anyway, I'll edit in and editing. It's called shakugana no shana
2755560	2757560	but it's an anime where
2758360	2761400	It represents sort of their soul in their existence
2762040	2764680	And the the bad guys in this anime
2765080	2771560	They will wipe out they eat these people's existence. So they wipe out this flame and and when the flame goes out
2773240	2778280	Nobody suffers like the individual doesn't suffer the people around them don't suffer because they are erased from history
2778440	2782120	Yeah, it's an endless goal. Yes. They are erased from ever existing
2782680	2786440	And when you watch this it's heart-wrenching to watch this happen to people because to me
2786520	2790760	This is so much worse than just killing someone. Yeah, the lost potential breaks our hearts
2791720	2793720	You
2796520	2797800	That kid
2797800	2799320	But why
2799320	2802040	They are replacements of people who had their existence consumed
2802760	2805320	by denizens of the crimson world their torches
2806280	2807960	Their replacements
2807960	2809960	What are you talking about?
2809960	2813240	This world's balance would be disrupted if they disappeared too suddenly
2813800	2818120	Therefore replacements for those people are provided to soften the impact. They're temporary
2818760	2820600	but then you're
2820600	2822600	Saying we're
2822760	2824600	Life no
2824600	2830360	The real you has had its existence consumed and is no longer living right now. You're nothing but residue
2839480	2841960	I I don't exist anymore
2843960	2847000	Well, yeah, and this is what we think a
2847560	2854040	Moral action equivalent to wiping out one of these fires that destroys a person's soul and they never exist within a timeline
2854520	2860120	This is what we think is happening when we don't bring a kid into this world that we otherwise could have
2861960	2863000	Anyway, absolutely
2863000	2867320	We'll do a longer video on when we think life begins and how we can think of that in the near future
2867480	2873960	But we actually are going to chat with a Catholic father about this first because we want to better understand the Catholic perspective
2874360	2875560	Yep
2875560	2878140	All right. Love you to death. Love you too. Gorgeous
