0	2160	I was walking behind these three women,
2160	4600	and one of the women turns to one of the other women
4600	7640	and goes, I would never date a guy who's not
7640	9800	seeing a psychologist.
9800	11960	And then all of the other women were like, mm-hmm.
11960	14560	Yes, I agree.
14560	18440	And what I realized is that their psychologists
18440	21160	had accepted into all three of these women independently
21160	23640	and enough, and this is a common enough thing,
23640	25720	that apparently women can just say
25720	27120	this within certain social circles
27120	29720	and assume that everyone will have the same brainwashing,
29760	31600	that you cannot be mentally healthy
31600	33440	without seeing a psychologist.
33440	36960	That was what was implied was what was being said.
38160	42800	That is the highest horror
42800	46040	of psychologically mispractice
46040	49800	that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.
49800	51760	That a psychologist had convinced them
51760	53640	of largely two things.
53640	56280	One is, you can't be psychologically healthy
56280	57800	without seeing a psychologist.
57800	60480	And then two is, you can't be psychologically healthy
60480	63480	without continuing to see a psychologist.
63480	66920	They were creating dependency in their patients
66920	69600	to get a recurring stream of revenue.
69600	72080	Now, what this cult of psychology does
72080	74640	is people go to a psychologist with a problem,
75520	80320	and they then say, oh, that problem is likely tied
80320	83360	to a trauma early in your life.
83360	86160	Let's determine what this trauma is,
86160	88360	and then we can constantly meet about this trauma,
88360	92520	because if you don't have me acting as a constant bulwark
92520	96720	against this trauma, then it will fall upon you
96720	100000	and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.
100000	101040	And that's dependency.
101040	102760	This is actually the mechanisms
102760	104320	that Scientologists would use.
104320	105680	They would do a theme reading,
105680	107200	and they would ask you questions about things
107200	108600	like your parents or other things
108600	110680	that happened early in your life.
110680	113800	And then they would say, ah, you have some trauma
113840	116200	with your mom or your trauma with your dad.
116200	119680	And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,
119680	121840	which is interesting to me that you have this one field
121840	124920	that is so vilified for milking people from their money
124920	127040	and creating dependency, which is Scientology.
127040	128200	And then you have this other field,
128200	131240	which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,
131240	132760	which is the psychologist,
132760	135240	but in a way it's because they're competing
135240	138600	for the same customers using the same mechanisms.
138600	139520	Oh, wow.
139520	142720	Why there is this fight here.
142760	144440	Would you like to know more?
144440	145480	Hello, gorgeous.
145480	146560	Hello, Simone.
146560	147720	It's wonderful to be here with you today.
147720	148800	What are we talking about?
148800	150600	Psychology.
150600	151840	Are you ready?
151840	153400	So people may not know this.
153400	156280	I started my early career in neuroscience and psychology.
156280	161280	So yes, I did some early work in brain-computer interface,
161800	165200	but before that, I was a psychologist
165200	167000	who focused on schizophrenia and stuff like that,
167000	170200	but also like more general psychology stuff.
170200	174200	And recently I have become horrified
174200	176440	and very disappointed in the field
176440	180880	because it seems to be turning into a cult.
180880	183360	And I mean that very literally
183360	187600	and as terrifyingly as it could possibly be interpreted.
187600	191000	So to people who don't know this about psychology,
191000	193320	one of the things that all young psychologists
193320	196340	are taught about when you're just starting out in psychology
196340	201340	is the horror of the fad that was hypnosis.
201980	206620	Because it turns out that when somebody comes to you
206620	209300	and you're in a position of authority over them,
209300	214020	it is very easy to implant memories in their mind
214020	215980	using specific procedures.
215980	217620	Many of those look like hypnosis,
217620	219500	but they also look like other things.
219500	220740	This is one of these big things
220740	223140	that they always teach you early in psychology.
223140	225460	It's that memories are not actually
225460	227580	that great a predictor of whether or not something
227580	229900	actually happened the way it's being remembered happened.
229900	232420	And this is all important for court psychologists
232420	236020	and stuff like that, but the real tragedy comes
236020	237380	when people go to a psychologist
237380	240420	to try to work out some problem they have.
240420	243300	And then that psychologist through mechanisms
243300	247460	that we now know can implant memories in a person's mind,
247460	251300	which is hypnosis, implant a bunch of memories of trauma
251300	255280	in someone's mind and then use those memories of trauma
255280	258320	to justify why that person is seeing a psychologist.
258320	260700	And then historically, there were many cases
260700	264160	of using those memories of trauma to cut the person off
264160	266120	from people who would have broken them out of the cult,
266120	268000	gotten them away from the psychologist.
268000	270520	There's the famous case of a young girl
270520	272000	who accused her father of rape,
272000	274720	which it seems he almost certainly did not do.
274720	276720	And yet he went to trial over this and everything
276720	278200	really had damage to his life.
278200	279780	And when I'm doing editing,
279780	282160	I'll find the name of the case and put it on screen here
282160	285360	because it's this really heartbreaking case
285360	289520	of how easy it is to accidentally brainwash someone
289520	292000	if they come to you as a psychologist.
292000	294800	And so there was this moment not too long ago
294800	297720	where I was in a room of really high profile people.
297720	301440	I'm talking about like top level people in our society,
301440	302640	controlling things and stuff like that.
302640	304800	And I was walking behind these three women
304800	307200	and one of the women turns to one of the other women
307200	309800	and goes, I would never date a guy
309800	311640	who's not seeing a psychologist.
312480	313960	And then all of the other women were like,
313960	315760	mm-hmm, yes, I agree.
316720	321080	And what I realized is that their psychologists
321080	323760	had accepted into all three of these women independently
323760	326280	and enough, and this is a common enough thing
326280	328600	that apparently like women can just say this
328600	330200	was in certain social circles and assume
330200	332360	that everyone will have the same brainwashing,
332360	334200	that you cannot be mentally healthy
334200	336040	without seeing a psychologist.
336040	339560	That was what was implied was what was being said.
340560	345240	That is the highest horror
345240	348480	of psychologically mispractice
348480	352240	that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.
352240	354160	That a psychologist had convinced them
354160	356040	of largely two things.
356040	358720	One is you can't be psychologically healthy
358720	360200	without seeing a psychologist.
360200	362880	And then two is you can't be psychologically healthy
362880	365880	without continuing to see a psychologist.
365880	369320	They were creating dependency in their patients
369520	372200	to get a recurring stream of revenue.
372200	373760	This doesn't come as a surprise, right?
373760	376200	Because when we talk about governance
376200	379680	and we talk about what makes people do what they're doing,
379680	384320	when you have a career in which you maintain clients
384320	386120	and have repeat clients
386120	389160	because they continue to need your services,
389160	392560	any psychologist, psychotherapist, therapist, whatever,
392560	395520	counselor who is really good at their job.
395520	398160	That is to say helping people not need counseling
398160	400960	or therapy or psychoanalysis or whatever anymore.
400960	404520	If you're really good at your job, you lose your customers.
404520	406840	If you are really good at creating dependency
406840	410520	and reinforcing someone's mental struggles,
410520	414000	then you have a thriving career and customer base,
414000	415560	especially if they think that they need you
415560	418160	and that you are somehow helping even while you're secretly
418160	420560	or subconsciously making things worse.
420560	422440	So there's this huge adverse incentive,
422440	423920	one that we also really complain about
423920	426600	in the nonprofit world where the nonprofits
426600	429560	that tend to stick around and survive
429560	431800	are those which raise money effectively,
431800	434760	not which solve their problem effectively.
434760	437440	So I guess we're seeing the same problem in psychology
437440	439120	as we are in the world of nonprofits,
439120	441560	which is the successful psychologists are those
441560	445200	that are very good at getting clients dependent on them.
445200	446040	Correct?
446040	448240	So I think that this is a really critical point
448240	449440	that you've made Simone,
449440	452280	which is I don't think that anyone has really gone into this
452280	453880	or that many people have gone into this
453880	455680	with nefarious intentions,
455720	458280	nor do I think it's a problem in how psychologists are taught
458280	461400	because I was warned against this going into psychology.
461400	463560	The problem is that if you're a good psychologist,
463560	465040	you earn less money.
465040	467920	If you have less money, you have less room for advertising,
467920	470720	less money for advertising, less money for client acquisition,
470720	472080	and you have lower margins,
472080	475120	which mean you can get less high profile clients often.
475120	476440	So really what you're seeing,
476440	478000	and I think the reason you see this in the
478000	479880	quote unquote elite levels of psychology
479880	482600	more than I think the general psychological audience,
482600	485400	although I don't know how widespread this practice is,
485440	488520	is because of the people who either subconsciously
488520	490640	or accidentally fall into this practice
490640	492720	of accidentally brainwashing their patients
492720	495160	into thinking they need a psychologist constantly,
495160	497720	economically out-compete the psychologists
497720	499680	who aren't doing this practice.
499680	501640	And I think that this is one of those things
501640	503400	where no one is acting nefariously.
503400	505440	Nobody went into this saying,
505440	508520	I want to incept people with the idea
508520	510640	that they can't be mentally healthy without one
510640	512320	continuing to see me or two,
512320	513680	that they should cut themselves off
513680	515520	from everyone who's not seeing a psychologist
515520	518320	in terms of their sort of personal, emotional life.
518320	520720	But that's also a really interesting thing.
520720	522800	If psychologists tell people,
522800	525880	also the people who you are engaged with in your life
525880	527440	need to see a psychologist,
527440	529960	that's additional customers, right?
529960	532440	If it's, oh, well, you should stop interacting
532440	534720	with your parents unless they're also seeing a psychologist.
534720	536360	By the way, here's my card.
536360	538720	By the way, you shouldn't date people
538720	540360	unless they're also seeing a psychologist.
540360	542080	By the way, here's my card.
542080	543560	And so there's many elements
543560	547240	of how this sort of cult accidentally can evolve.
547240	549080	And I think that some psychologists
549080	550880	have some of these practices and not others.
550880	551880	And some psychologists,
551880	553040	I'm not saying all psychologists
553040	554000	are part of this cult movement.
554000	555440	What I'm saying is that it does exist
555440	556680	within the psychology movement.
556680	558640	And even when I talk to people with a psychology background
558640	559680	who aren't caught up in this,
559680	561800	they're like, oh God, yeah, I've definitely seen that.
561800	562880	And it's really scary.
562880	564000	So let's talk about the way
564000	566800	that psychology is generally supposed to work
566800	568520	when you go to see a psychologist.
568520	569960	And then we can contrast that
570000	573080	with the way you know you're dealing with probably
573080	574840	a bad psychologist or a psychologist
574840	577120	who is creating dependency.
577120	579480	It is typically you go to a psychologist
579480	581120	and you have some issue.
581120	583760	And what they are supposed to do
583760	587440	is help you rewrite your internal self-narrative
587440	589520	so that thing that is an issue
589520	591160	is either not an issue
591160	593960	or not debilitating to your daily life.
593960	596600	That is what a good psychologist does.
596600	598360	You might go to a psychologist
598360	601240	believing that you have some sort of a crippling problem
601240	602400	that you can't get out of
602400	605120	and they work with you to not have a crippling problem
605120	605960	that you can't get out of
605960	607560	and not have to see a psychologist anymore.
607560	610600	Now what a quote, unquote evil psychologist does,
610600	612360	this cult of psychology does
612360	614920	is people go to a psychologist with a problem.
615800	618240	And they then say,
618240	622120	oh, that problem is likely tied to a trauma
622120	623640	early in your life.
623640	626440	Let's determine what this trauma is.
626520	628760	And then we can constantly meet about this trauma
628760	631120	because if you don't have me
631120	634680	acting as a constant bulwark against this trauma,
634680	637080	then it will fall upon you
637080	640360	and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.
640360	641400	And that's dependency
641400	643000	because they're saying without me acting
643000	644560	as this sort of bulwark.
644560	647040	And what is really fascinating is when I was younger,
647040	648200	I was interested in joining cults.
648200	650880	So like not, I didn't want to join a cult.
650880	653120	I was interested in how people could be convinced
653120	653960	to believe things.
653960	656680	It seemed obviously not true to me.
656680	658760	And one of the things I did is I went to a number
658760	660560	of like psychology recruitment sessions,
660560	662200	not psychology, Scientology.
662200	664440	Sorry, the brady and slip of the tongue there.
664440	667200	I went to Scientology recruitment sessions.
667200	669160	And this is actually the mechanisms
669160	670720	that Scientologists would use.
670720	672080	They would do a theme reading
672080	673600	and they would ask you questions about things
673600	675360	like your parents or something like that
675360	678080	or other things that happened early in your life.
678080	679760	And then the theme reading is basically
679760	680960	a galvanic spin response.
680960	682960	So they could tell when you would get nervous.
682960	684000	And then they would say,
684000	686880	ah, you have some trauma with your mom
686880	688400	or your trauma with your dad,
688400	691440	depending on how you reacted galvanic spin response wise
691440	693720	to their questions around this stuff.
693720	697240	And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,
697240	699360	which is interesting to me that you have this one field
699360	702440	that is so vilified for milking people from their money
702440	704560	and creating dependency, which is Scientology.
704560	705720	And then you have this other field
705720	708760	which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,
708760	710320	which is psychologists.
710320	712760	But in a way, it's because they're competing
712760	716120	for the same customers using the same mechanisms.
716120	717040	Oh, wow.
717040	720080	Why there is this fight here.
720080	721880	And interesting when Scientology evolves,
721880	723120	that was during one of the periods
723120	725080	where this is one of those really interesting things.
725080	727080	So if you go back to Christian science,
727080	727920	a lot of people are like,
727920	729040	oh, isn't that ridiculous
729040	730840	that they don't want to use modern medicine?
730840	732840	However, actually, if you look at the time period
732840	734440	when Christian science evolved,
734440	737840	modern medicine might have actually lowered life expectancy
737840	739680	because that was back when they were doing leeches
739680	741880	and bone cuttings and everything.
741880	744000	And so it actually made sense during that time.
744000	747160	If you look at during the early evolution of Scientology,
747160	750000	this was happening during the hypnotherapy epidemic.
750000	751880	So they might have actually had a point
751880	755320	that their mechanisms that was actually interesting
755320	758280	is their mechanisms might have been prescient
758280	762880	of the direction psychology was going to go 30, 40 years
762880	766640	in the future, which is just fascinating to me
766640	768600	that we now see them as evil.
768600	771040	And yet they were just creating dependency
771040	772080	in the same way psychologists do.
772080	773520	Now, of course they didn't go as far.
773520	775280	And so what psychologists have
775280	776520	that the Scientologists didn't have
776520	778280	was certain regulatory organizations
778280	780480	which can just bar them and stuff like that
780480	782120	so that they couldn't go quite as far
782120	784520	with molesting people or something
784520	788720	or creating essential slaves or any of the other things
788720	790880	that of course, for legal reasons,
790880	794720	I'm not saying Scientology has ever done any of these things.
794720	797280	But what I'm saying is that the tech,
797280	800160	if they might, because it's such a centralized organization,
800160	802360	they wouldn't have the same system
802360	805200	for preventing these kinds of extreme levels of abuse.
805200	807520	But that doesn't mean that the core techniques
807520	809560	that they're using aren't the same techniques,
809560	812720	that the field of psychology had allowed itself
812720	815600	or has allowed itself to drift into.
815600	817640	And this terrifies me.
817640	819800	Let me add another layer of complexity though,
819800	821280	because as much as this is terrifying
821280	824120	and as much as we frame this as like people unknowingly
824120	825680	entering into these relationships
825680	829800	where dependency is created and then turned into victims,
829800	832080	part of me wonders if this is an open secret
832080	834200	because we've had this conversation with friends,
834200	836280	we've had this conversation with people quite frankly
836280	838440	because we find it interesting.
838440	840080	And we've met many people
840080	843360	who have undergone really hard mental periods
843360	846080	that their lives most people have, I think,
846080	848920	who have ended up independent relationships with therapists
848920	850760	and just flat out told us,
850760	853640	yeah, I see a therapist a couple of times a week,
853640	854480	it's gotten to the point
854480	856240	where my insurance doesn't accept them anymore,
856240	857760	I'm paying out of pocket for this.
857760	859800	So this is obviously a big investment.
859800	863880	I know that this is a dependent relationship,
863880	866800	but also it's been a big help for me.
866800	870680	And even though I know that this is not right, I need this.
870680	872560	This is one of the problems with psychological biases
872560	874680	is you can know you have a psychological bias
874680	876360	and it doesn't help you get out of it.
876360	878360	You can know that you're in a culture,
878360	880000	in a dependent relationship,
880000	883160	but the psychologist has effectively created this dependency.
883160	884440	You can't easily leave it.
884440	885280	That's one of the problems.
885280	888080	You essentially need cult deprogramming to get out of this.
888080	889320	And does such a thing exist?
889320	892800	What can we say to our friends who are in those positions
892800	894280	or if someone's watching this video and they're like,
894280	898800	oh, wait, yeah, I am in a codependent relationship.
898800	900280	I'm paying out of pocket for someone.
900280	903080	This is really, it's not sustainable.
903080	905280	And obviously my problem's not going away, right?
905280	907000	Like I still have crippling anxiety
907000	909920	or this terrible traumatic thing that's interrupting my life.
909920	911240	What would you say to them then?
911240	913640	There is no cult deprogramming for therapists.
913640	916000	I think that that's the key is solving it yourself.
916000	919400	If you don't, if whenever you give your mind,
919400	921800	your mental state to another person,
921800	924720	you create enormous personal vulnerability.
924720	927560	And so yes, it's harder to do it on your own.
927560	930360	But the truth is that the things that the psychologists
930360	931720	are taught about how to engage us,
931720	934400	someone are just not that complex.
934400	936680	They're gonna say they are, they really aren't.
936680	939040	It's just personal narrative building stuff,
939040	941360	which you can read about in the Pragment Just Guide to Life.
941360	944040	But if you aren't interested in that,
944040	946040	then try to find another psychologist,
946040	948040	interview them early on like you should a psychologist.
948040	951080	And I would say the big red flag is the more a psychologist
951080	953120	is focused on the concept of trauma,
953120	954840	especially trauma as an immutable thing,
954840	956720	as not a goal to get over,
956720	958760	then they are likely on the evil side
958760	960480	or the dependency creating side.
960480	963240	If they are focused on either not focused on trauma
963240	966240	or their focus on trauma is helping you overcome
966240	969240	the trauma entirely, then they are likely,
969240	971280	more likely to be on the positive side.
971280	974800	But what's interesting is I've noticed that these ideas
974800	976600	that have been incepted into people
976600	978160	have worked their way in a way
978160	980240	into mainstream progressive politics,
980240	984080	where people now define themselves by their traumas
984080	987880	and they see them as like a major part of their self identity.
987880	989960	And I think what's really interesting
989960	993640	is other religious movements used to have defenses against this.
993640	994880	And this is one of the things we talk about
994880	996840	in the Pragment Just Guide to Crafting Religion
996840	998640	is that a lot of religious movements
998640	1001440	essentially had roles that were like psychologists.
1001440	1002760	I mean, of course they did, right?
1002760	1004400	This isn't a new need for people
1004400	1006040	to some extent within the Jewish community,
1006040	1007880	like that's what your rabbi would do.
1007880	1009160	And in the Mormon community, you know,
1009160	1010120	you have solutions to this.
1010120	1011080	And within these communities,
1011080	1013360	because they didn't use psychologists to recruit people
1013360	1015240	in the way that Scientologists did,
1015240	1017960	they were genuinely interested in mental health.
1017960	1021240	And one of the best mental health focused communities
1021240	1023440	or systems that evolved to do this
1023440	1026040	that I just have endless admiration for
1026040	1027920	is the Catholic system.
1027920	1031960	So what the Catholic system is, the confession system,
1031960	1035960	what it allows you to do is go to someone,
1035960	1038960	say, this is something bad I've done
1038960	1040040	or this is something I've done
1040040	1043680	that is causing mental trouble for me or something like that.
1043680	1045920	And what they don't say very importantly
1045920	1048920	is know that thing wasn't actually bad.
1048920	1049920	They don't say, oh no,
1049920	1051680	you're just automatically forgiven for it,
1051680	1054640	which is what the Bible says, you know, as you repent,
1054640	1055880	but it's actually a better system
1055880	1059040	than even what I think from a psychological standpoint,
1059040	1061120	is to say, yes, what you did is bad.
1061120	1065040	Here is a concrete list of things you can do
1065040	1068560	to atone for the bad thing you did.
1068560	1070800	So it's an acknowledgement of the badness
1070800	1073160	and then creating a self-narrative within the person
1073160	1074680	that they can overcome that
1074680	1075880	through following this list of things.
1075880	1078440	Now, of course, they're also creating dependency
1078440	1079960	to the church to some extent, right?
1079960	1082920	Oh, you need to keep going every time you do a bad thing.
1083000	1086880	But what's really admirable about the system they created
1086880	1090320	is it's a very difficult system to abuse,
1090320	1093760	either accidentally or on purpose.
1093760	1096480	The pseudo anonymity of the system
1096480	1098600	makes it harder for a person to form a dependency
1098600	1100160	on a single individual.
1100160	1103760	The high level of ethics around not talking about,
1103760	1105120	and this is like a really important thing
1105120	1105960	for Catholic periods,
1105960	1108080	you cannot say what was told to you in confession,
1108080	1109720	even if it could save someone's life
1109720	1111040	or it prevent a murder,
1111040	1113600	which is actually higher than the level of trust
1113600	1115000	you have with your psychologist.
1115000	1117320	If you go to a psychologist and you say something
1117320	1119040	that says just that you could kill someone else
1119040	1121800	or self-harm, they actually have a duty to report you,
1121800	1124120	like serious risk of your own life,
1124120	1126640	where the Catholic priest has a higher level of trust
1126640	1127680	in that.
1127680	1129960	And even if you have a dumb person
1129960	1132120	who could accidentally give a person bad advice,
1132120	1134880	they're actually working within a fairly narrow range
1134880	1136520	of answers they can give you.
1136520	1138920	And it's really hard for them to give an answer
1138920	1141880	that creates that much psychological damage.
1141880	1146200	So there are mechanisms for better systems in this.
1146200	1149560	The problem is that these mechanisms aren't available
1149560	1152000	to the masses or to the secular
1152000	1155720	or like religiously derived masses
1155720	1158400	that are no longer in these traditions
1158400	1160080	that offer services like this.
1160080	1164360	So I know you don't really like alcoholics anonymous,
1164360	1166720	for example, because what it has become
1166720	1168000	is actually quite corrupted
1168000	1170560	and it has various adverse incentives at play.
1170560	1172120	It's another example of an organization
1172120	1173240	that was started with good intent,
1173240	1174520	but essentially has become a cult,
1174520	1175560	but that's for a different video.
1175560	1176720	Right, that's for a different video.
1176720	1178400	And not all of it, factions of it.
1178400	1181800	I do want to ask you about their buddy system.
1181800	1183480	You know, that you, when you go into AA,
1183480	1185760	there's a lot of stuff that is whatever,
1185760	1187360	but one of the things that you do have,
1187360	1189520	rather than a therapist, rather than a priest
1189520	1192320	that you confess to, rather than a centralized authority,
1192320	1195400	you just have another one of the people of this group
1195400	1200240	who shares your struggle being your accountability buddy.
1200240	1201840	And it seems like sometimes these people have,
1201840	1203400	they've been through it more than you have,
1203400	1204800	but at least, so they're more advanced.
1204800	1206280	Yeah, so what are they really doing?
1206280	1208440	They're preventing you from leaving AA.
1208440	1209600	You could say they're preventing you
1209600	1211080	from getting back on alcohol,
1211080	1212520	but just as much of preventing you
1212520	1214040	from getting back on alcohol,
1214040	1217400	they consider a failure scenario two things.
1217400	1220960	You getting back on alcohol or you leaving AA.
1220960	1222440	What are your thoughts on, and we'll say-
1222440	1223640	And this is where the whole idea
1223640	1224600	to take a step aside here.
1224600	1226720	This is where the concept of a dry drunk within AA
1226720	1228720	comes from, if anybody doesn't believe me.
1228720	1229800	Look at this concept.
1229800	1232520	Many people in the cult version of AA
1232520	1234920	believe that quitting alcohol through a mechanism
1234920	1239120	other than AA is as bad as continuing to be an alcoholic,
1239120	1242440	which to me shows the point is staying in AA.
1242440	1244640	It's not getting off alcohol,
1244640	1247000	which is what I mean when I say this is a cult,
1247000	1248320	and it's not all of AA.
1248320	1250400	And the same way it's not all psychologists,
1250400	1251560	but the buddy system-
1252040	1255600	Let's return to mechanisms that people can turn to
1255600	1257080	if they don't turn to a therapist,
1257080	1259800	if they're not Catholic and they don't wanna go to confession.
1259800	1261440	Do you think a buddy system,
1261440	1263560	so someone maybe who's been through the same thing
1263560	1266760	that you have or someone that you really trust as a friend
1266760	1269480	is a good alternative to just figuring it out by yourself?
1269480	1271600	Cause I don't think everyone's really ready for that.
1271600	1272440	Just a side note,
1272440	1275400	as somebody who really studied cults and loves cults,
1275400	1277000	buddy systems are really common in cults.
1277000	1279360	It's one of the most common systems.
1279360	1281200	We love Mormons, we'll have a video on them in the future,
1281200	1283600	but Mormons due to an extent use a buddy system
1283600	1284880	during a person's mission trip
1284880	1287160	to prevent them from deconverting
1287160	1290680	so that they have somebody they can turn to constantly,
1290680	1293240	but that also is supervising them to an extent.
1293240	1295000	And when you look at cults,
1295000	1296880	actually one of the reasons why cults historically
1296880	1299440	use buddy systems is for converting people.
1299440	1300680	But what some cults found,
1300680	1301920	and there's some great research on that,
1301920	1303720	that was actually done by the cults themselves
1303720	1304960	because they kept records,
1304960	1306840	I think the Mooneys were the ones who did this,
1306840	1309320	is it was never approached somebody as an individual
1309360	1311400	because they'll think that it's like a sexual thing
1311400	1313000	or like you're hitting on them or something
1313000	1314560	or like it's weird.
1314560	1316920	But if you approach them with a buddy,
1316920	1319440	which is the smallest group you can do this with,
1319440	1322600	they have a much higher chance of not being afraid of you
1322600	1324640	and not seeing you as threatening.
1324640	1327400	So yes, buddy system is actually often a sign
1327400	1328440	that you're joining a cult.
1328440	1331040	And I need to stress, I don't think Mormonism is a cult,
1331040	1333840	they just, the buddy system is there to prevent deconversion.
1333840	1336240	But to the point that you were making,
1336240	1338200	can a buddy system be good?
1338200	1339440	It may be good,
1339440	1342360	but I really think the ultimate buddy system is a spouse.
1342360	1345840	And what you really have to type is spouse
1345840	1348560	that can help you work through these things for yourself,
1348560	1351120	which Simone does for me all the time,
1352920	1354400	I've been brainwashed by my spouse.
1354400	1356080	That's really what I'm saying here.
1356080	1357360	I've been brainwashed
1357360	1360400	into just having absolute mental dependency on my spouse.
1360400	1363160	Well, what I hear you saying is,
1364080	1367680	buddy systems are a viable therapy mechanism.
1367680	1370440	Isn't that what someone who had brainwashed me would say?
1370440	1371760	Hmm.
1371760	1374960	No, I know what I'm saying is buddy systems may work,
1374960	1376400	but they're not a terribly good system.
1376400	1379440	Well, I think a buddy system is a really good system
1379440	1383880	if you're trying to opt into someone's lifestyle or solution.
1383880	1385280	So if you think-
1385280	1388520	If the buddy system is managed by an organization
1388520	1390840	that you can have total trust,
1390840	1392720	has your best interest at heart.
1392720	1393960	I'm referring to a friend.
1393960	1395080	I'm referring to a spouse.
1395080	1396120	I'm referring to a mentor.
1396120	1398720	I'm not referring to anything that's organizationally related.
1398720	1401680	I'm referring to the dynamic of someone that you trust
1401680	1403240	helping you work through something.
1403240	1404800	Well, then you better have total trust in them
1404800	1406800	because you know what, that buddy,
1406800	1408440	there's a reason why there's all these rules
1408440	1410560	against sleeping with your psychologist and stuff like that.
1410560	1412200	If you're a female and that buddy's a male,
1412200	1413480	they're probably gonna try to sleep with you
1413480	1415680	unless you have like enormous trust in them or vice versa.
1415680	1417640	No, this is how people create dependency.
1417640	1419960	This is how I understand
1419960	1422560	if you have total trust in the person you're going with
1422560	1424680	in this buddy system, great.
1424680	1428240	But the problem is that you can often misjudge someone.
1428240	1432080	And when you use someone to be this kind of sounding board,
1432080	1435320	you outsource the keys to your mental kingdom
1435320	1436480	to someone else,
1436480	1437960	which puts you in a position
1437960	1439760	of enormous mental vulnerability.
1439760	1441280	But Malcolm, I think what you're missing
1441280	1442840	is when people are severely depressed,
1442840	1445440	when people are severely traumatized,
1445440	1446280	they may not have-
1446280	1447360	So the question should be solved
1447360	1449840	with pharmacological intervention
1449840	1453080	and potentially even more extreme interventions
1453080	1455320	like electroshock therapy
1455320	1457720	works really well for extreme depression.
1457720	1461520	There are solutions to the more extreme psychological problems.
1461520	1463960	This is same for things like schizophrenia
1463960	1464800	and stuff like that.
1464800	1466920	But those aren't psychologist problems.
1468000	1470640	Those are psychiatrist problems.
1470640	1473480	It's a different fricking degree, okay?
1473480	1475960	It's a different, it's a completely different level.
1475960	1478600	One prescribes things and the other doesn't.
1478640	1480480	Go to the one that prescribes things
1480480	1481640	if that's what you're looking for.
1481640	1483040	If you're looking for solutions
1483040	1484600	that you can't come to yourself
1484600	1485720	or you can't come to with a buddy.
1485720	1487080	And I do agree, a buddy,
1487080	1489840	all I'm doing is highlighting the importance
1489840	1493520	of understanding that if you go to a buddy,
1493520	1494360	trust that buddy,
1494360	1496240	but the truth that you could probably trust a buddy
1496240	1498240	better than you can a random psychologist.
1498240	1499080	That is true.
1499080	1501240	Like the only thing you really have faith
1501240	1503680	that the psychologist isn't going to do,
1503680	1507440	is there likely not or less likely going to
1507440	1510000	do something that's just absolutely egregious to you.
1510000	1511400	But they are much more likely
1511400	1513200	to just create a generic dependency.
1513200	1516080	Whereas a buddy may have a slightly higher probability
1516080	1517720	of doing something absolutely egregious,
1517720	1519000	but a much lower probability
1519000	1520560	of creating general dependency.
1520560	1524360	So long as you prepped in with framing for this,
1524360	1526040	which the pragmatist got into life,
1526040	1527680	which is our shortest book by far
1527680	1530560	and sells for 99 cents and all the profits go to charity.
1530560	1533240	So like we created it actually when we wrote that book,
1533240	1535600	it was to try to create an alternative to CBT.
1535600	1537120	CBT is actually a great system.
1537120	1538320	We just wanted an alternative
1538320	1540640	that people with less training could use
1540640	1541880	was more reliability.
1541880	1545080	CBT standing for cognitive behavioral therapy.
1545080	1548200	But it was originally meant to be a
1548200	1550280	if then training manual for psychologists.
1550280	1552200	And actually an AI was going to be trained on it
1552200	1553080	to become a psychologist.
1553080	1555640	One AI team reached out to us after reading it.
1555640	1556760	If you read it and you're like,
1556760	1558640	this sounds like a psychologist training manual.
1558640	1560360	That's actually the way it was written.
1560360	1563440	And so it could actually help you in that scenario
1563440	1566040	to prevent the more extreme ways
1566080	1567440	you might engage with something,
1567440	1569720	but then also just self-reflection
1569720	1571400	with this very simple concept.
1571400	1573120	And I'll present the concept to you.
1573120	1574960	You have an internal self-narrative.
1574960	1577720	Who you are, what your role is in the world,
1577720	1579400	what events have caused you trauma,
1579400	1580960	how you relate to those trauma.
1580960	1582720	This is all part of your self-narrative.
1582720	1585040	It's the narrative you tell yourself.
1585040	1588000	The core goal of this person you're going to
1588000	1589360	is for you to go to them,
1589360	1592120	say this is how I would like to rewrite my self-narrative
1592120	1593560	or this is my self-narrative today
1593560	1595720	and here's how it's causing me problems.
1595720	1598320	And to work with you in rewriting that self-narrative,
1598320	1602080	which is actually self-narratives are incredibly malleable.
1602080	1603800	Even though we pretend in society today
1603800	1606160	like they are this immutable part of who we are,
1606160	1607080	they are not.
1607080	1610280	It's very, like research shows are very malleable.
1610280	1613200	So you're going to this person to rewrite your self-narrative
1613200	1616160	into one that is less damaging to your daily life
1616160	1618920	or your goals for who you want to be or yourself.
1618920	1620280	And that's just a very doable thing.
1620280	1621360	You don't need to read the book,
1621360	1623240	just go into it with that concept.
1623240	1625000	We'll also understanding that this person
1625000	1627920	who's rewriting your self-narrative could rewrite it
1627920	1631520	to say, you absolutely need to keep seeing me
1631520	1633320	and giving me money and give me all your money.
1633320	1636040	And then do all these things I tell you to do
1636040	1638520	or you will never be mentally healthy.
1638520	1640160	And that's the danger.
1640160	1642120	So that's the red flag to look for.
1642120	1643280	Speaking of red flags,
1643280	1646040	we have to go get our kids from daycare.
1646040	1648120	So let's go run, run, run, get that.
1648120	1650200	And I will start dinner.
1650200	1651480	I love you so much, Malcolm.
1651480	1652440	I'll see you soon.
