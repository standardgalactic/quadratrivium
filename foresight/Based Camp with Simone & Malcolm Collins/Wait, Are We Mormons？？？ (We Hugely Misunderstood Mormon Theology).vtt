WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
This really shocked me because it was the more conservative Mormons, the ones who would be considered more extremists, who thought that we were more similar to Mormonism in our beliefs, and it was the less conservative Mormons who thought that our beliefs were more distant from Mormons.

00:18.000 --> 00:29.680
If you look across the Mormon tradition, when I started talking to more Mormons and more conservative Mormons about the way they think like the metaphysics of the universe actually works, there is more diversity within Mormon beliefs.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.160
Then there is within any other religion that I'm aware of.

00:34.160 --> 00:41.360
What's extra interesting is there's both that diversity, but also this like quiet, like we don't talk about this diversity.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.400
Yeah, we don't talk about this.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.600
We don't talk about it.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.640
So let's talk about one here, right? Like multiple mortal prohibitions, right?

00:48.640 --> 00:57.040
This was fascinating to me because it has shown that I fundamentally misunderstood Mormonism in our previous videos on Mormonism.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.560
Would you like to know more?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.560
Well, this is very exciting.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.840
I get to use my new fancy speaker because it's because it's metal like it right now.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.200
I feel like I'm holding a frozen rod of ice right now.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.040
It is so cool.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.640
Is this your new camera?

01:11.640 --> 01:12.640
Yeah.

01:12.640 --> 01:20.840
OK, well, I am really excited for this episode and I am always so disappointed when there's an episode that like I absolutely love.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.840
But like we don't get a bunch of watches on it or something.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.080
No one's going to watch this.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.280
Yeah, I don't know.

01:26.360 --> 01:36.160
In terms of watching something that I thought I didn't want to watch, I watched all of Saturday Warriors per your request and it was cheesy and it was.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.960
But oh my gosh, I cried.

01:37.960 --> 01:38.760
I cried.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.560
I cried.

01:39.560 --> 01:48.160
So people who aren't familiar with Saturday Warriors, it was recommended to us because we've been talking a lot with a Mormon fan of the show to try to understand the religion better.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.840
And he suggested that we check out this movie.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.960
And it is really interesting because he said that like it gives a good example of why a lot of Mormons had a lot of kids.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.240
So you can see their perspective.

01:59.240 --> 02:07.560
And throughout the entire movie, you're having your heart strings pulled by this little girl who's stuck in heaven because her parents haven't had a kid yet.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.440
And they haven't had all their kids.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.920
They haven't had the seventh kid that they were supposed to have.

02:11.920 --> 02:12.640
Eighth kid.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.320
Eighth kid.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.640
Emily, what's wrong?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.440
I'm the last kid to be born.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.040
What if by that time, mom and dad don't want me?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.920
But I've seen lots of families make promises and then break them.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.760
Not us.

02:26.760 --> 02:31.440
Emily, I will see to it personally that you're not forgotten.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.640
You promised to me?

02:32.640 --> 02:33.640
I promise.

02:33.640 --> 02:33.840
Yeah.

02:33.840 --> 02:40.360
And then the other another one of their kids, the bad guys in this, you want to talk about getting us on board with you?

02:40.360 --> 02:43.840
Bad guys in this were called Population Zero.

02:43.840 --> 02:52.320
And they were a rock band that had seduced one of the sons into thinking abortion was cool and population reduction was cool.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.000
Look at this.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.520
Erlich says that population growth will lead to famine.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.520
And in this decade, hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.440
So what's the solution for his population control?

03:05.440 --> 03:10.720
Well, people will need to be coerced, but it's for a good cause.

03:10.720 --> 03:15.040
I mean, it's the only answer unless you don't like eating.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.200
I think it's a little extreme.

03:16.200 --> 03:16.920
Come on.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.960
Well, this is serious.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.560
People need to stop having so many kids.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.320
No offense.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.520
Jimmy, how come your parents can't keep their hands off each other?

03:26.520 --> 03:30.160
You want to find out?

03:30.160 --> 03:33.680
The earth is sick and we are the cancer.

03:33.680 --> 03:43.680
Every day the babies are destroying the world.

03:43.680 --> 03:53.680
Eating all our applesauce, what can we do?

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.680
Far out, man.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
Play that again.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.680
Just messing around, man.

03:58.680 --> 04:08.680
No, Jimmy, for real this time, and keep that melody.

04:08.680 --> 04:17.680
Every day the world is getting smaller by fall.

04:17.680 --> 04:24.680
Bursting at the seams, what can we do?

04:24.680 --> 04:30.680
Your population is the answer, my friend.

04:30.680 --> 04:37.680
Without it, the rest of us are doomed.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
Who can survive?

04:38.680 --> 04:39.680
Who can survive?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.680
Not one of us will be a...

04:41.680 --> 04:43.680
Literally, anti-natalist rock band.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.680
Hilarious.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.680
Right?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
Can you get more?

04:46.680 --> 04:49.680
But this whole line of conversation started for us.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.680
It was a really interesting moment for me.

04:52.680 --> 04:58.680
I was on stage, and I have talked with the transhumanist Mormons before,

04:58.680 --> 05:01.680
like the weird, technophilic Mormons,

05:01.680 --> 05:05.680
which I think a lot of Mormons would consider kind of different from mainstream Mormons.

05:05.680 --> 05:12.680
And the fact that our ideology and our belief system really aligns closely with theirs,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.680
that did not surprise me at all.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
Right.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
Here's what shocked me.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
So we're on the stage, it's Kevin Dolan.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.680
Kevin Dolan is of the conservative faction of Mormons.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.680
So much so that he's often, when people talk about like the Deseret Nationalists,

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
that's who they're talking about.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
The Mormon separatists.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.680
However, Mormon extremists disregarded federal warnings and established Port Joe Smith

05:32.680 --> 05:34.680
deep inside the arachnid quarantine zone.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.680
Too late, they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.680
Arachnids, would you like to know more?

05:43.680 --> 05:45.680
So that's the faction.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.680
And we were on stage and he just came out,

05:47.680 --> 05:50.680
because I thought that he would see our religious beliefs,

05:50.680 --> 05:52.680
our synthetic religious beliefs where we say,

05:52.680 --> 05:56.680
okay, broadly in years from now, if our people alive,

05:56.680 --> 05:59.680
they're probably going to be closer to gods than humans.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.680
And that this, or the way we would think of a god than a human,

06:02.680 --> 06:05.680
and that they wouldn't relate to time the way we relate to time.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.680
And so it's sort of like a self-manifesting entity that is influencing us today.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.680
So he saw this, he actually related it to interstellar.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
He said, your beliefs are basically interstellar, right?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.680
I don't know, I haven't seen it recently, but I was like, yeah, sure, why not?

06:16.680 --> 06:19.680
And he's like, that is just Mormon.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.680
Like he's like, you guys are basically just Mormons.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.680
And that surprised me.

06:24.680 --> 06:30.680
Because that did not align what I understood a conservative Mormon would think.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.680
And I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.680
And so then I started talking to some other Mormons who were at the conference

06:35.680 --> 06:37.680
about Mormonism.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.680
And they're like, yeah, you guys are just Mormons,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.680
or your beliefs are very similar to Mormon beliefs.

06:42.680 --> 06:47.680
And this really shocked me because it was the more conservative Mormons,

06:47.680 --> 06:50.680
the ones who would be considered more extremist,

06:50.680 --> 06:55.680
who thought that we were more similar to Mormonism in our beliefs,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.680
or as they would say at the Church of Latter-day Saints.

06:57.680 --> 07:04.680
And it was the less conservative Mormons who thought that our beliefs were more distant from Mormons.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
Isn't that wild?

07:05.680 --> 07:08.680
Well, it's not wild when you dig into it.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Yes, right.

07:09.680 --> 07:15.680
This was fascinating to me because it has shown that I fundamentally misunderstood Mormonism

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
in our previous videos on Mormonism,

07:17.680 --> 07:20.680
and in our previous writings on Mormonism,

07:20.680 --> 07:22.680
because I fundamentally one misunderstood,

07:22.680 --> 07:27.680
well, the biggest thing is I misunderstood how they determine what they think is true.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.680
And there's a very interesting thing that Mormons do

07:30.680 --> 07:34.680
that no other faith in the world I'm aware of,

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
because like we have studied a lot of faith.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.680
And none of the other ones do this.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.680
Which is if I go to one Mormon and I say,

07:43.680 --> 07:47.680
hey, I've heard a lot of Mormons believe X,

07:47.680 --> 07:51.680
or like church fathers believe X and have talked about X frequently.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.680
So like two examples here might be like eternal progression

07:55.680 --> 07:58.680
or like multiple mortal prohibitions.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.680
These are two things we'll both talk about on this podcast.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.680
It is not infrequent if they do not believe in multiple mortal prohibitions or eternal progression.

08:05.680 --> 08:10.680
They'll just say, no, no large group of Mormons have ever believed this.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.680
None of the common Mormons ever believed this.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
None of the church fathers ever believed this.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.680
And many of you point to them like texts, like no,

08:18.680 --> 08:23.680
like this is in like stuff that was put out by by major church fathers.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.680
They'll then say, okay, maybe some Mormons do believe this,

08:27.680 --> 08:30.680
but they are influenced by the devil.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.680
What really influenced by the devil?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.680
Yeah, this is regularly what you see.

08:35.680 --> 08:39.680
And this is fascinating to me because like Protestants, for example,

08:39.680 --> 08:42.680
I'm, I'm, you know, if you're talking about like pre-millennialist

08:42.680 --> 08:44.680
or post-millennialist Protestants,

08:44.680 --> 08:47.680
so people who don't know what I'm talking about here,

08:47.680 --> 08:49.680
in the conservative Protestant community,

08:49.680 --> 08:53.680
one of the biggest debates is does Jesus like,

08:53.680 --> 08:56.680
like does the rapture happen before the tribulation

08:56.680 --> 09:00.680
or does the rapture happen after the tribulation?

09:00.680 --> 09:05.680
Do like, like devout Christians actually have to go through this period of tribulation

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
or will they be raptured beforehand?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.680
And then the period of tribulation has been to help people, you know,

09:10.680 --> 09:14.680
anyway, nuanced discussion, but none of them are going to say,

09:14.680 --> 09:17.680
no, there's not some other group that has this other view.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.680
And if there is, they're, they're being manipulated by the devil.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.680
They're like, no, we have a serious difference in faith.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.680
And we study this and, and these are the arguments from my faith.

09:28.680 --> 09:34.680
So there's people out there who are mistaken, but you know, they're not like demons.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.680
Well, and, and, and the, the reason why,

09:37.680 --> 09:39.680
so this has really confused me about Mormonism,

09:39.680 --> 09:43.680
because whenever I tried to study Mormonism in the past,

09:43.680 --> 09:46.680
if I was going to get like a broad view of Mormonism,

09:46.680 --> 09:51.680
I actually would always get the best broad views from people who had left the church.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.680
Hmm. Yeah.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.680
Well, often those are the people who are talking about it.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Well, yeah.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.680
So, and I should point out, I'm not saying that Mormons never disagree about this stuff,

09:59.680 --> 10:03.680
but if you want to see like the actual disagreements that Mormons are having,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.680
go to the comment section on Mormon blogs.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.680
Don't go to the articles themselves.

10:09.680 --> 10:15.680
And this then came to why would the conservatives be more accepting of our beliefs than the non-conservatives?

10:15.680 --> 10:19.680
Why would they think that our beliefs are closer to Mormon beliefs?

10:19.680 --> 10:23.680
And this is because the more sophisticated Mormon theology,

10:23.680 --> 10:26.680
the more interesting Mormon theology from my perspective,

10:26.680 --> 10:33.680
and, and frankly, it's sort of wackier, wackier in that it is less in a line with just generic in theology,

10:33.680 --> 10:37.680
actually typically the older Mormon theology,

10:37.680 --> 10:43.680
or the Mormon theology you would know if you dug really deep into Mormon history.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.680
Well, I mean, that was really interesting about one way that it was explained to us.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.680
Is it like from like most really unique LDS theological concepts,

10:53.680 --> 10:59.680
you need to have an IQ of at least 130 and most like most Mormons don't.

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
They don't really care.

11:00.680 --> 11:01.680
They're not really involved in it.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.680
And it's really about the lifestyle and even a lot of leadership,

11:04.680 --> 11:09.680
just like theology is not like the primary thing of action here.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
It's, it's.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.680
I'll actually read a quote from one of the early church fathers,

11:13.680 --> 11:20.680
which I found very interesting and quite prophetic of our own belief system.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.680
Orson Pratt, this is the guy who was born in 1811, wrote this, right?

11:25.680 --> 11:28.680
And, and so when I first went to them, I was like, yeah, but you know,

11:28.680 --> 11:31.680
we believe that like intergenerationally,

11:31.680 --> 11:34.680
like we don't believe that everyone's going to inherit their own planet one day or something like that.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.680
And they're like, oh, no, no, no, that's not actually.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.680
So they pointed me to this Orson Pratt quote,

11:39.680 --> 11:41.680
but not everyone's going to inherit their own planet one day.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.680
Some people will as humans, like similar to humans as we are today,

11:46.680 --> 11:49.680
will be elevated to a state of Godhood.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.680
And they're like, some Mormons believe that some Mormons believe other things.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.680
You should look at what the actual, you know, quotes from these early church fathers.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.680
So I'm going to read this quote by Orson Pratt.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.680
This is on whenever he uses the word intelligence, he's talking about the soul.

12:02.680 --> 12:09.680
And so he sort of has this hypothesis that maybe the soul exists as individual soul particles,

12:09.680 --> 12:14.680
which when people die, can break apart and reform.

12:14.680 --> 12:19.680
So like we may have some soul particles in us that previously came from like plants or something like that.

12:19.680 --> 12:29.680
So we say we can suppose that these particles possessed of the power to move themselves would not have exerted that power during the endless duration proceeding their organization.

12:29.680 --> 12:37.680
If they were once organized in the vegetable kingdom, and then disorganized by becoming the food of celestial animals,

12:37.680 --> 12:42.680
and then again reorganized in the form of spirits of animals, which is a higher sphere of being,

12:42.680 --> 12:52.680
then is it unreasonable to suppose that the scene particles have from eternity been passing through an endless chain of unions and disunions,

12:52.680 --> 13:02.680
organizations and disorganizations until at least they are permitted to enter into the highest and most exalted sphere of organization in the image of God.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.680
So that's really fascinating.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.680
And here's a quote from Brigham Young.

13:08.680 --> 13:20.680
When the elements in an organized form do not fill the end of their creation, they are thrown back again, like Brother Kimball's old potteryware to be ground up and made again.

13:20.680 --> 13:38.680
So you hear these two and these purport an idea of sort of human souls going through a cycle in which they eventually become God like souls through this sort of forging and reforging process,

13:38.680 --> 13:46.680
which is actually really, really similar to our belief if you made it entirely materialistic.

13:46.680 --> 14:01.680
Isn't that something the idea that like our kids are a part of us in a chance to improve on us, you know, intergenerationally and that they have, you know, what we would think of as the soul, which is the collection of ideas and genetics that make us up.

14:01.680 --> 14:07.680
They have aspects of that but reforge to improve and that eventually this thing will become a deity.

14:07.680 --> 14:13.680
Very, very, very, very, very, very similar beliefs, but these are early church beliefs.

14:13.680 --> 14:23.680
And so early Mormons like Mormons who are of the most conservative faction would align more with these earlier beliefs than the more modern church beliefs.

14:23.680 --> 14:33.680
And so the question would be why did the church changes beliefs, and this comes to a really unique thing about Mormonism I didn't fully grasp.

14:34.680 --> 14:53.680
So it is that Mormonism unlike any religious tradition in the entire world, the current prophet, the current head of the religion has more say than their original book or the founder of the religion.

14:54.680 --> 15:02.680
That is the current prophet can override Joseph Smith can just say Joseph Smith was wrong when he said that.

15:02.680 --> 15:17.680
No other religion you as a Muslim would say like Mohammed was misunderstood, or this was misquoted or this was, or you would say this about Jesus, you know, you wouldn't say the pope cannot override Jesus.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.680
Like that would be considered insane.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
Yeah.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.680
It actually gets even wilder than that.

15:23.680 --> 15:41.680
There are instances I have found where current prophets, like Elder Fielding in Answers to Gospel Questions volume five will claim that Joseph Smith said things that he definitely doesn't seem to have ever said or at least was never recorded in anything I can find.

15:41.680 --> 15:49.680
For example, that's where the quote that goes something along the lines of the prophet Joseph Smith said that reincarnation is a doctrine of the devil.

15:49.680 --> 16:02.680
And have you not read that the devil would deceive the elect where when I tried to look through textual evidence, I cannot find Joseph Smith saying anywhere that he thought reincarnation was a tool of the devil.

16:02.680 --> 16:11.680
And in fact, I can find many sources that seem to indicate and many of his contemporaries seem to indicate that he did believe in some form of reincarnation.

16:11.680 --> 16:20.680
Though Joseph Smith did say that the doctrine of transmigration of souls or souls passing directly to your children was false.

16:20.680 --> 16:26.680
So imagine if you had something like the pope saying Jesus said that this is of the devil.

16:26.680 --> 16:33.680
And you're just like or a current, you know, imam saying Mohammed said this is this is a doctrine of the devil.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.680
And yet there is no evidence for that.

16:36.680 --> 16:43.680
This would be incredibly confusing to an outsider trying to learn about the religion and what the boundaries of the belief system actually are.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.680
And it leads to a religion.

16:46.680 --> 16:50.680
I had talked about Mormon being an accelerationist religion in the past.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.680
What I undersold how accelerationist it is.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.680
Well, I think you didn't even know the extent, I think.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.680
Yeah, yeah.

16:57.680 --> 17:05.680
So it made it really hard for me because I'm trying to go out there and understand what do Mormons actually believe.

17:05.680 --> 17:11.680
And I was continually thwarted because I was thinking about it like a Protestant or a Catholic or a Jew.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.680
Thinking about it like a Protestant, like just my typical.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
Okay, I'm looking at their books.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.680
What did their books actually say?

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
What did the founding fathers?

17:17.680 --> 17:21.680
What are the most important people in the movement actually say?

17:21.680 --> 17:24.680
And they'll just like dismiss this stuff.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.680
Like this famous speech by Joseph Smith.

17:26.680 --> 17:33.680
Oh, I put a thing here where he basically lays out the idea that, oh yeah, humans will eventually become gods.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.680
Some modern Mormons just throw this out.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.680
Why do they just throw this out?

17:38.680 --> 17:41.680
And that God started like a human today, right?

17:41.680 --> 17:47.680
And you can look at, here are some quotes that AI generated when I was having it, like asking it about Mormon concepts.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.680
What?

17:49.680 --> 17:54.680
It said, God was once as humans are now, but eternally God.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.680
That is exactly what we believe about God.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.680
He was once as humans are now because he was once us, like literally us.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.680
But he also was eternally God because that's the way we think time works.

18:05.680 --> 18:10.680
A being like God and Christ means unity of purpose, not abilities.

18:10.680 --> 18:15.680
So being like God and Christ means unity of purpose, not abilities.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
You would say, yes, exactly.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.680
That's what this intergenerational improvement means.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.680
Or you could look at something like their belief in pre-life, basically, right?

18:24.680 --> 18:30.680
Like in this movie, it started with all of them sort of in heaven, living their pre-lives, having their pre-families.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Hi, I'm Todd.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
Richards.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
I know.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
We're in love.

18:34.680 --> 18:40.680
And so we were wondering if it's possible if you could put us down in the same town.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
Right.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.680
Or the same street.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.680
At least at the same time, if possible.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.680
How about the same family?

18:45.680 --> 18:46.680
Yes.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
That would be great, yeah.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
No.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.680
We believe something very similar, but it's due to how we see time.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.680
Because we see all time is happening at once.

18:55.680 --> 19:03.680
We believe that all of our kids, our friends, do know each other and are waiting to come into existence, but in the future.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
Right.

19:04.680 --> 19:12.680
So to be, to clarify, in the movie, Saturday Warriors, it begins with everyone in heaven and they already know each other and they know that they're going to be family.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.680
And they're like, oh, I can't wait.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.680
This is going to be so great.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.680
What kind of dance should I do first for mom and dad?

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
Something classical?

19:19.680 --> 19:20.680
Or?

19:20.680 --> 19:21.680
Cha-cha.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.680
Cha-cha.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.680
So, maybe just a twist then.

19:27.680 --> 19:32.680
Yeah.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.680
Whereas like, we don't think there's some anti-chamber before.

19:36.680 --> 19:43.680
It's just that everything that has happened and will happen is happening and it's sort of all at once.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.680
And it's already happened.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.680
Yes.

19:46.680 --> 19:53.340
Like my little daughter when I interact with my little daughter in 10 years and it's kid number 12 that everyone told us not to have

19:54.280 --> 19:58.840
Is that little girl who's being denied life by us choosing not to have a kid?

19:59.320 --> 20:02.800
It is a life that we would have robbed

20:03.160 --> 20:06.920
Right just as much as Mormon think that you have robbed a person of their life

20:07.420 --> 20:11.400
One thing that I want to say which I think is really interesting is when I look at these Mormon videos

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
They're very similar to

20:14.040 --> 20:21.040
How if we were trying to explain our belief systems to a child or somebody who is living in like the early

20:21.600 --> 20:26.960
1800s we would have explained our belief system which makes it feel very

20:27.560 --> 20:31.460
contiguous with Mormonism in fact one part of our

20:32.440 --> 20:36.600
Holiday future day that we haven't really talked much publicly about and we've been

20:37.200 --> 20:44.360
Solidifying actually after after seeing this movie how it would play out is the day of martyrs which comes before future day

20:44.600 --> 20:50.840
Which is dedicated to readings of the martyrdom of man one of the books that we see

20:50.920 --> 20:56.500
Like we would see Joseph Smith as being divinely inspired by the same entity

20:56.520 --> 21:01.880
Which we believe inspired us in which every member of the family both the kids and us

21:02.360 --> 21:05.140
Explained to past iterations of their parents

21:05.200 --> 21:11.560
So that would be our parents in our case why they should have us and why it is a good thing that we would come to

21:11.720 --> 21:15.000
Exist and what we plan to do with that existence

21:15.080 --> 21:19.920
Well, also thinking our ancestors not just you know our biological ancestors

21:19.920 --> 21:27.480
But the ancestors of humanity in general for the hardships that they underwent to give us our current

21:28.080 --> 21:34.200
Technological and material bounty as the martyrdom of man states even in the 1800s

21:34.200 --> 21:42.960
That's your average English person back then lived a better life than your Anglo-Saxon King and you know from our perspective today

21:43.360 --> 21:50.440
Your average American probably lives a better life than the Queen of England when that book was written and this is through the

21:51.680 --> 21:52.760
intergenerational

21:52.760 --> 21:59.880
martyrdom of our ancestors and ourselves to make things better for the next generation and it is a

22:00.280 --> 22:03.400
This is where they sort of take up the mantle of that responsibility

22:03.880 --> 22:10.280
This cycle of continual improvement while also hopefully instilling an amount of gratitude

22:10.880 --> 22:13.800
For how good they have it vis-a-vis

22:14.240 --> 22:19.160
What the daily life of most humans used to be like hundreds of years ago?

22:19.160 --> 22:28.000
This is meant to instill in our kids that they exist for a reason and that being alive is a privilege

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
and it's a privilege that comes with

22:30.600 --> 22:33.000
duties and responsibilities to

22:33.800 --> 22:36.960
Justify your own existence. I should note here though

22:36.960 --> 22:43.640
It's less relevant for this particular conversation that the day of martyrs is also dedicated to reading from Fox's book of martyrs

22:43.640 --> 22:51.280
Not just the martyrdom of man. These readings are meant to remind kids and our family more broadly what our duty is in

22:51.320 --> 22:52.680
face of

22:52.680 --> 22:59.200
tyranny or those who would claim to have mental authority over our belief systems

22:59.200 --> 23:05.280
Well also reminding them to never become that person themselves never become the person who is

23:05.720 --> 23:12.400
Telling somebody else what they have to believe is true and not true because the highest level of freedom an

23:12.520 --> 23:18.960
Individual has is the freedom to choose what they believe and that freedom must both be protected

23:19.000 --> 23:22.200
but also in parts on individuals the duty to

23:22.760 --> 23:26.880
Think carefully about those things and decide with prudence

23:27.240 --> 23:33.480
How you think things actually work without allowing other people to tell you what to believe now

23:33.480 --> 23:37.640
Obviously, we haven't talked about this publicly yet because it's one of the belief systems

23:37.760 --> 23:46.040
That's probably gonna get us most shamed by anti-natalists, but it is very very similar to these scenes in Saturday Warriors

23:46.040 --> 23:48.920
I love how a lot of our more publicly facing

23:49.560 --> 23:52.400
Documents are more just like philosophy and stuff like that

23:52.440 --> 23:58.160
But we get into actual like religious insanity if you are actually a regular listener to the podcast

23:58.240 --> 24:02.440
So I swear when like anti-natalists are prepping for a debate with us or something

24:02.440 --> 24:08.680
This is what they must be imagining far as I'm concerned this Saturday night. There's not even gonna be a fight

24:08.680 --> 24:10.680
I will torture his body

24:10.920 --> 24:17.220
So that he's so learns to be humble. I'm gonna knock him out round one bitch. God chose me for this fight

24:17.800 --> 24:19.800
God is the teacher

24:19.800 --> 24:21.960
Derek is the student wait

24:23.320 --> 24:24.960
What do you say?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.960
Yeah, God chose him

24:27.320 --> 24:29.320
God's lessons are

24:30.280 --> 24:31.960
So beautiful

24:31.960 --> 24:35.360
God's lessons are beautiful. I'm sorry. Who put this fight together

24:36.120 --> 24:44.200
This is what I do if y'all got an actual crazy person to meet for me to fight well, that's not fair to me or him

24:50.000 --> 24:56.040
I'm sorry, is this a crazy now this gets really interesting and it's sort of I think the core failure of

24:56.640 --> 25:00.440
Mormonism and modern Mormonism is that a lot of

25:01.200 --> 25:09.280
Mormonism recently in Mormon trends and like why they pretend or or move towards not having these beliefs is a

25:10.960 --> 25:17.240
Drive to be seen as quote-unquote normal Christians or just another branch of Christianity

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
and in that

25:20.520 --> 25:28.440
Quest they have abandoned many of the spiky and more unique parts of their history and theology

25:29.280 --> 25:35.280
Which were honestly the more sophisticated and compelling parts to me now that I have the cooler stuff, right?

25:35.680 --> 25:38.640
But I think that that's the case with most

25:39.200 --> 25:45.800
Religions that like if you actually dive deep into the dogma and you really really get into it and get technical

25:45.800 --> 25:51.360
It does get weird. No, no, Protestant think so evangelicals. They've gone so much

25:52.200 --> 25:57.920
No, I'm referring to like Catholicism Judaism Islam like I'm going into like I'm not

25:58.280 --> 26:00.280
I'm not talking about

26:00.760 --> 26:05.320
When those religions become softer when they abandon the weirder parts as themselves

26:05.600 --> 26:11.260
They're typically doing it in an effort to conform with the urban monoculture

26:12.220 --> 26:16.340
And that's my point when I'm when I'm talking about when you get to the core of a religion and it gets weird

26:16.340 --> 26:18.540
I'm referring to hard religions, right?

26:18.540 --> 26:20.820
I guess you're right to an extent

26:20.820 --> 26:27.260
But what's really interesting is that Mormonism hasn't attempted to conform to the urban monoculture as much like there's a faction that's doing that

26:27.380 --> 26:32.100
But where they have lost most of their traditions is in trying to conform to conservative

26:32.260 --> 26:39.260
iterations of other Christian denomination where they have become tried to become more like just another type of evangelical Protestants

26:39.540 --> 26:44.620
When they are nothing like and this and so the question is is why are they doing this?

26:44.620 --> 26:50.860
And this is when I look at Mormonism as an outsider and and I look at the collapsing fertility rates within Mormonism

26:50.860 --> 26:53.820
I actually think that this is a problem of the genetic vortex

26:53.820 --> 27:01.360
So we talked about how religions and genetics can reinforce each other where people with specific genetic predilections can convert to a religion

27:01.700 --> 27:07.360
Disproportionately which can lead to those sociological profiles being higher within that religion. I think historically

27:08.080 --> 27:14.280
Mormonism really selected for and in culturally and genetically. So I think there's two things going on here

27:14.880 --> 27:17.600
an extreme amount of

27:18.480 --> 27:23.360
social anxiety and and desire to engage in social

27:23.800 --> 27:25.640
Status competitions, right?

27:25.640 --> 27:31.400
And I think that this is why if you look at like the way that like alcohol ravaged Native American communities

27:31.400 --> 27:36.380
I think things like tiktok and social media have ravaged Mormon communities same was

27:37.600 --> 27:39.600
Tiktok is the alcohol of

27:39.720 --> 27:47.360
To of Mormon people. Well that and that this desire to fit in is what drove them to abandoning

27:47.360 --> 27:49.160
I think the more

27:49.160 --> 27:55.040
Interesting and to my perspective sophisticated aspect of their religion but also to deny that they're different

27:55.040 --> 28:00.560
So this is another really interesting thing if you look across the Mormon tradition when I started like talking to more Mormons and more

28:00.560 --> 28:05.000
Conservative Mormons about the way they think like the metaphysics of the universe actually works, right?

28:05.040 --> 28:07.840
There is more diversity within Mormon beliefs

28:07.840 --> 28:13.240
Yeah, then there is within any other religion that I'm aware of like what's it?

28:13.240 --> 28:19.440
What's extra interesting is there's both that diversity, but also this like quiet like we don't talk about this diversity

28:19.720 --> 28:24.680
Yeah, we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it. So so let's let's talk about one here, right?

28:24.680 --> 28:30.700
Like multiple mortal prohibitions, right? Okay define what that is. So this is the so there

28:31.580 --> 28:37.100
Okay, so there's different theories on what it means or ways that the church relates to it, right?

28:37.100 --> 28:38.060
All right

28:38.060 --> 28:42.180
some people like the most mainstream perspective in the church is

28:42.860 --> 28:47.220
You exist before you're born like this is one prohibition you come to life, right?

28:47.220 --> 28:52.900
As a human and then you die and then comes the next part like whatever comes after that

28:52.940 --> 28:53.860
Okay

28:53.860 --> 28:59.260
Some Mormons though believe that you actually sort of get reincarnated or like the quote

28:59.260 --> 29:03.620
I was talking about earlier like that doesn't just mean that your soul holistically gets reincarnated

29:03.620 --> 29:06.740
It may be like a dissolved recombined reincarnated

29:06.900 --> 29:10.820
But that's a huge diversity in beliefs about what happens after death

29:11.060 --> 29:16.900
There really are some Mormons that believe that that most people are going to get their own planet and become gods

29:16.900 --> 29:23.500
Like if they're good people and they follow Mormon teachings my father my brother and I had been there at the hospital

29:24.380 --> 29:27.540
As we walked out my brother and I who went to the car together

29:28.540 --> 29:34.900
Smile they looked up in the mountains and remember that mother had always said she loved the mountains so much that he and I laughed and

29:35.220 --> 29:40.020
Guess that if in fact the celestial worlds are really flat a sea of glass

29:40.380 --> 29:44.540
She'll be eager to get away to build her own worlds and the first thing she'll build will be mountains

29:44.820 --> 29:46.860
But a lot of Mormons don't believe that at all

29:46.860 --> 29:54.740
They believe in like more of a traditional heaven like that's a while different in beliefs like you do not see like you look at a

29:54.900 --> 30:02.860
Belief system that has many different beliefs right like a huge diversity like Hinduism. Yeah, but at least they agree broadly on what happens after you die

30:04.340 --> 30:07.380
Yeah, no, this is so interesting and also like that over time

30:07.780 --> 30:14.060
There's been a shift within the LDS church on like what cannon gets more emphasis like

30:14.460 --> 30:23.060
One person said that currently they feel like it's 35 percent book of Mormon 10 percent Old Testament and 25 percent New Testament and then

30:23.380 --> 30:28.460
You know, maybe like 30 percent DNC plus pearl of great price

30:28.460 --> 30:34.620
Which I hadn't even heard of before but then like they they also thought that the Book of Mormon probably peaked in

30:35.340 --> 30:38.420
1990 and New Testament is probably at its peak now

30:38.420 --> 30:46.980
So these like shifts in emphasis too of like which which which text is getting a lot of emphasis which to me sounded a lot like

30:47.820 --> 30:53.820
Jewish tradition it seems like in Jewish tradition like different texts will get emphasis at different times as well

30:53.940 --> 31:00.380
So just I just had no idea there was this level of dynamicness, right? This is insane a lot in common with Jewish tradition

31:00.380 --> 31:06.980
Yeah, except it has a weird mix of Jewish and Catholic versions of how they determine right well because like with with Jewish traditions

31:06.980 --> 31:12.540
Like you just you know like there are names for the different subsets of like these guys believe this thing and these guys believe this thing and

31:12.540 --> 31:17.540
Emphasize this text and blah blah blah so you like know who's and the one who wins is the one who gets the most followers, right?

31:17.540 --> 31:21.060
And then but with with Catholicism, it's like no we're like here's where we are

31:21.060 --> 31:24.020
You know this these this is the official stance with it was a Judaism

31:24.020 --> 31:28.700
It's like you have these fall you these different theologies like bubbling in the background, right?

31:28.700 --> 31:35.220
And then the one that wins is the one that covertly gets the most social acceptance within the community

31:35.220 --> 31:40.340
Right, and then that becomes what the current prophet will say or whatever. Yeah, and that is

31:41.340 --> 31:46.340
Genuinely fascinating, but it's and it's not even the current prophet with the LDS church either

31:46.340 --> 31:53.380
And I remember seeing this with my friends in college who were Mormon like everyone kind of has their favorite

31:54.060 --> 31:56.060
their favorite and like

31:56.500 --> 32:03.860
People will wax nostalgic about in like different subgroups and subcultures within the LDS church will have their like it was this guy

32:03.860 --> 32:08.000
He had he had it figured out and I thought that that's really interesting too that like

32:08.440 --> 32:11.520
that there is a disproportionate influence of

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
You know the current

32:14.880 --> 32:17.800
Had honcho essentially, but some groups

32:18.600 --> 32:22.980
Still give the disproportionate emphasis to their favorite past one, which is super interesting

32:23.480 --> 32:29.840
Yeah, so then this all becomes very interesting because when I first asked this question are we actually just Mormons, right?

32:29.840 --> 32:32.040
I came at it thinking like a Protestant

32:32.040 --> 32:38.000
I'm like, I'll go to the text and see the outlines of what beliefs make someone a Mormon, right?

32:38.000 --> 32:42.120
Oh, yeah, like what what metaphysical understanding of reality etc etc, right?

32:42.120 --> 32:47.200
Like what is the boundaries of their metaphysical understanding of reality where if you pass out of it?

32:47.200 --> 32:53.520
You would know definitely no longer be a Mormon anymore. Yeah, and what I found is that's not the way Mormonism works. Nope

32:53.520 --> 32:58.160
And so well then it becomes a cultural question or rather what we think of Mormonism

32:58.160 --> 33:02.000
And then I think whether or not we are Mormons depends on what Mormons thinks

33:02.040 --> 33:10.040
Like yeah, it's up to them because our beliefs aren't really changing other than the way that we relate to Mormonism as a cultural group

33:10.040 --> 33:13.800
Yeah, so but I think we we're the same way about

33:14.600 --> 33:17.640
Judaism like yeah, you know what whether we

33:18.000 --> 33:23.440
Consider our kids to be Jewish depends on what other Jews think and so many Jews have been like well

33:23.440 --> 33:27.360
If you're matrilinearly Jewish then you're Jewish and so we're like well, okay, then our kids are Jewish

33:27.360 --> 33:34.520
But like yeah, it's interesting that we to a certain extent define whether or not we fall into another religion's category of being part of them

33:34.520 --> 33:37.960
It's like well, you tell us, you know, like we're doing our thing over here, but you tell us

33:38.000 --> 33:40.680
but hold on now this gets interesting to us so then

33:43.200 --> 33:46.360
With our perspective and we're talking about this concern more he goes

33:46.360 --> 33:51.960
Oh, your beliefs were divinely inspired they came to you via revelation in the same way that you know

33:51.960 --> 33:58.160
Joseph Smith's beliefs came to him and if you look at Joseph Smith from our religion's traditions, right?

33:58.160 --> 34:00.920
So there's a video where we talk about like the demons we make for our kids and I'm like

34:00.920 --> 34:05.680
I just took those demons from books that were popular during my lifetime

34:06.120 --> 34:09.120
But I still think that they are likely real

34:09.920 --> 34:16.520
Representations of the way that the demonic force the basilisk as we call it the the evil side of the future police that tests us

34:16.520 --> 34:18.880
Call it the basilisk after Rocco's basilisk

34:18.880 --> 34:22.480
We recently came up with this and I really like this at the term for the adversary the basilisk

34:22.480 --> 34:26.720
And the other word that we came up with recently was agents of Providence instead of you the other word future police

34:26.720 --> 34:29.560
Which sounds a little too hokey for us for you Malcolm

34:31.360 --> 34:35.600
So so we believe that we were influenced by modern-day media

34:35.600 --> 34:44.520
But that modern-day media was inspired and to an extent constructed by God the beings that exist in the future, right?

34:44.720 --> 34:50.880
So when you look at the traditional complaints about Joseph Smith, hold on a minute

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
Pull this up at the beginning here

34:56.760 --> 34:59.840
Where you know a lot of people will say well, you know if you look at the

35:00.600 --> 35:06.040
Mormon theology it appears to borrow a lot from what we're like at the time sci-fi books like

35:06.280 --> 35:09.120
I'm you Hebrew is which was a book that said well

35:09.120 --> 35:13.400
Maybe the lost tribe of Israel went to the United States and had some other things that aligned with Mormonism

35:13.440 --> 35:16.680
And then a voyage to the moon which was a popular sci-fi of the time

35:16.680 --> 35:20.520
Some Mormon stuff actually has a lot of parallels to that and so people will say well

35:20.520 --> 35:24.800
He was just copying you know fiction of his time whereas from our perspective. We'd say yes

35:24.800 --> 35:30.520
That's how God works. Yeah God inspired that fiction so that it could influence Joseph Smith. Yeah. Yep

35:30.520 --> 35:37.480
Or they'd say no he was just making this up like reading things out of a hat that that in order to and it's like

35:37.480 --> 35:40.760
Yeah, that's what we did with our religion. I still think it's divinely inspired

35:40.840 --> 35:49.000
I still think that the God create like like motivated us through whatever means they could to create an entirely new like

35:49.000 --> 35:53.320
Or we thought new religious structure that we now find has a lot of parallels with early Mormon

35:53.480 --> 35:57.920
You know theology, right? So we look at Joseph Smith's doing that. We're like, yeah

35:57.920 --> 35:59.640
That doesn't mean it wasn't divinely inspired at all

35:59.640 --> 36:04.680
In fact to us when we're determining whether or not a belief system was divinely inspired

36:04.760 --> 36:10.560
We look at its efficacy its spread and the quality of life of its members

36:11.400 --> 36:18.520
And from that it is self-evident that Mormonism was one of the many belief systems that was divinely inspired

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
Like we think that Christianity

36:20.600 --> 36:24.680
Given the impact it's had on human history given the importance it's had on us in

36:24.920 --> 36:29.800
In developing the way we see the world and everything like that that christ was literally

36:30.440 --> 36:33.960
a divinely manipulated or inspired being and

36:34.600 --> 36:36.520
As evidence of that

36:36.520 --> 36:38.760
Is the effect that he has had on the world

36:39.400 --> 36:42.920
So much so that if mary says well, you know, he was created

36:43.080 --> 36:46.920
Who's to say the future beliefs like if they're really going to influence like one person's life

36:47.000 --> 36:51.400
They're like we're really investing in this person having a huge impact with the agents of providence

36:51.400 --> 36:54.920
If we're really investing on this one person having a big impact on human history

36:55.480 --> 36:57.800
Who's to say they didn't actually fertilize his mother?

36:58.360 --> 37:03.160
Right like that could have happened in which case that is god fertilizing his mother, right?

37:03.240 --> 37:07.880
So so in that instance, you know, we do believe an agent of the divine now

37:08.200 --> 37:13.800
I think that's probably less likely than other other options that they could have used available to them

37:14.200 --> 37:17.240
But for all of these things they they do not

37:17.880 --> 37:21.000
Have any discord with our belief system. So from us. Yes

37:21.400 --> 37:27.560
Joseph Smith was self-evidently a divinely inspired individual and he was inspired by the same

37:28.040 --> 37:34.600
Things that inspired us and yet his revelation in the early church father's revelation was an incomplete revelation

37:34.760 --> 37:37.240
just as he would say, you know the

37:38.120 --> 37:40.520
Just the Protestant texts are an incomplete revelation

37:41.080 --> 37:43.000
And so in that sense

37:43.000 --> 37:49.480
Yes, but we aren't like culturally Mormon and we don't relate to truth the way Mormons relate to truth

37:49.720 --> 37:54.040
Although our family people often think we're Mormons people who aren't Mormons when they visit us

37:54.040 --> 37:56.840
I remember one guy we tried to sell our company to him. I don't know if you remember this

37:57.320 --> 38:00.600
And you know, we were walking with him and he goes, you know, I'd sell my company to you guys

38:00.600 --> 38:04.600
But I really don't feel comfortable. You know, you guys are really a little too strong with this whole Mormon thing

38:06.120 --> 38:11.480
And we're like what like just maybe maybe you're more Mormon than you think Malcolm

38:11.800 --> 38:15.880
Maybe I don't know. I drink I hear a lot of Mormons do that too. You know, it might be

38:17.400 --> 38:20.680
I mean, you know, there's like the whole no caffeine thing, but then like everyone's

38:21.480 --> 38:23.480
You know drinking tons of like

38:23.960 --> 38:31.160
I don't know but but I will say that I now feel much more of a kinship with this religious tradition

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
than I did historically

38:34.760 --> 38:36.120
and

38:36.120 --> 38:41.720
One thing that I believe about Mormonism, you know, after studying it more after looking at the the the actual diversity of

38:41.800 --> 38:43.800
Seological beliefs with in Mormonism

38:43.880 --> 38:50.440
Is I do not think that the centralized structure that that makes up the Mormon church right now is long term stable

38:50.840 --> 38:56.520
It's sort of like if all Mormons actually just hashed out their theological differences, they would realize that they're not the same religion

38:56.840 --> 39:01.720
well, but I think you're what you're missing here is that for the vast majority of

39:03.000 --> 39:09.160
LDS church members, it's not about the doctrine. It's about the lifestyle and I think there's more agreement on that

39:09.880 --> 39:13.080
Well, you know, so this is really interesting. They're part of the same cultural group

39:13.400 --> 39:18.680
Yeah, it's cultural group. So within something like, you know, Judaism when they are having theological differences

39:18.680 --> 39:20.760
They'll debate it with like biblical texts and stuff like that

39:20.760 --> 39:25.640
What's really interesting is when I look at Mormon theological debates, they do not often go back to text

39:25.880 --> 39:27.880
They will relate to modern science

39:28.200 --> 39:31.000
Depending like whatever science was common during their time period

39:31.320 --> 39:32.760
They will relate to

39:32.760 --> 39:36.920
philosophical constructs very similar to like a metaphysics department at a university

39:37.400 --> 39:40.280
They are very unbounded by text

39:40.760 --> 39:46.200
In the debates that I've read and like the comment sections on blogs that are supposed to be about conservative Mormons

39:46.600 --> 39:51.800
And so in a way, you know being part of this larger cultural group and saying, okay

39:51.800 --> 39:53.640
We'll agree to just have those of us

39:53.640 --> 39:57.800
We'll all participate in this larger cultural group, which is under the central hierarchy

39:58.200 --> 40:02.840
But those of us that are smart, we're actually allowed to think very broadly

40:03.240 --> 40:07.000
Around the way we relate to the divine around the way we relate to the concept of

40:07.320 --> 40:14.600
Don't you feel like you're kind of describing what what we describe as the index where like you have a bunch of culturally aligned

40:15.240 --> 40:18.200
We kind of all want the same thing things groups

40:18.760 --> 40:24.120
Who share a dating pool who share a lot of cultural resources that work better at scale

40:24.760 --> 40:27.400
Who may have some different metaphysical

40:28.360 --> 40:34.600
Views on how things work, but ultimately work better together and are just pulling and sharing these resources

40:34.680 --> 40:36.360
I feel like that's

40:36.360 --> 40:38.360
Very stable and I feel like it's a

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
Pretty smart solution

40:42.120 --> 40:43.880
Yeah, so

40:43.880 --> 40:47.400
Here's my take. So would would you say would you say we're Mormons or we're not Mormons?

40:49.080 --> 40:55.640
To what I said earlier, I think it depends on what various Mormons would say to some Mormons. We're Mormons to other Mormons. We're not Mormons

40:56.760 --> 41:01.960
Yeah, well, I I agree with that and I think we're we're way more Mormon than many Mormons. I'll say that

41:02.520 --> 41:06.520
Okay, well, I'd be very interested to see where where Mormonism ends up going

41:06.600 --> 41:10.360
If they can maintain this centralized structure, that would be very interesting

41:10.680 --> 41:14.440
If they do end up dividing into different subgroups

41:14.920 --> 41:18.440
That's where and I think that this is well the core reason we're not Mormons

41:18.440 --> 41:21.320
It's the way we relate to truth is a bit different than the way Mormons relate to truth

41:21.720 --> 41:24.920
and that we we really care about this level of

41:25.880 --> 41:29.800
Technical correctness and the same way that like even when we went into Mormonism trying to look at their scripture

41:29.800 --> 41:32.520
Oh, but like we want a hard sci-fi version of religion, right?

41:32.600 --> 41:36.680
But I also I don't think I think many and we've met them now

41:36.840 --> 41:40.440
I think many people in the LDS church who consider themselves to be quite devout

41:41.000 --> 41:46.040
Are taking the same approach. Well, and that's why I think that if we look in a hundred years or in 200 years

41:46.520 --> 41:50.680
What becomes like if our religious system continues down the road?

41:50.680 --> 41:53.240
It's going down and our kids are raised within that system

41:53.720 --> 41:57.400
If they met a Mormon in 200 years because I also think that Mormonism is changing

41:57.720 --> 42:03.000
From one of these technophilic factions and they're still around in a hundred years. I think there would be almost no difference

42:03.720 --> 42:06.920
Hmm very very very very similar belief system. Well, there you go

42:07.560 --> 42:11.880
But I do not think that we are whatever Mormonism is today and whatever we are today

42:12.280 --> 42:14.280
I think are two slightly different things

42:14.600 --> 42:20.680
However, I think whatever we are today may actually be more appealing to some people who maybe historically

42:21.080 --> 42:25.000
Would have been within the Mormon church if the church does go woke or something like that

42:25.240 --> 42:28.920
And that's where I think that we may end up merging in the near term

42:29.320 --> 42:30.120
If

42:30.120 --> 42:34.760
Well, like I saw one guy who had like donated to biden is in line for church succession

42:35.240 --> 42:39.320
So they may go. Whoa the next guy going or they may go super conservative

42:39.320 --> 42:41.560
It's hard to say no the next guy is very conservative

42:41.560 --> 42:45.800
And so what happens? Does that mean the conservatives leaves the movement? Maybe maybe they don't if they do

42:46.280 --> 42:50.280
Then that's where I'm like, okay that group of Mormons that has left the central church

42:50.520 --> 42:52.520
Maybe it's just our bristling was hierarchy

42:52.840 --> 42:55.320
We would be very open to joining

42:55.800 --> 43:02.520
Any aspect of the merman church that broke from the central hierarchy, but so long as they are

43:03.080 --> 43:06.600
Under the central hierarchy. We just have too much of an instinctual

43:07.880 --> 43:09.080
distaste in other words

43:09.080 --> 43:16.520
We we bristle at the idea that there would be something like a conference sunday and some random guy would sit up and talk about like

43:17.240 --> 43:22.120
These are our values. This is our lifestyle and we're like, no, no, don't speak for us. Don't speak for us

43:22.200 --> 43:25.960
This is not okay. So yeah that that we can never square with I think

43:26.920 --> 43:34.360
Yeah, that's fair, but I think that one day will be Mormons. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I have been called an honorary Mormon for many years of my life

43:34.600 --> 43:35.880
so

43:35.880 --> 43:40.040
By that means it's is she really culturally identified with Mormon in college

43:40.040 --> 43:42.440
She never drunk or anything like that because all of her friends are Mormons

43:42.600 --> 43:49.240
And I went to a Mormon preschool too like all of my like most I guess culturally formative and like comfortable periods of my life

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
Were in exclusively Mormon groups

43:52.200 --> 43:53.400
so

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
Until I met you and then you're my new home

43:57.240 --> 44:00.200
So thank you for that. I love you. I love you Simone and yeah

44:00.200 --> 44:04.680
It was so funny watching that movie because I was like, oh, this is just what we believe like a saturday morning preacher with

44:04.840 --> 44:10.120
That's called saturday warrior saturday warrior. Yeah saturday warriors. Check it out if you're watching

44:10.280 --> 44:14.920
I'll add a link to it's on youtube. You can watch the whole thing. There was a remake in the 90s

44:15.800 --> 44:17.800
Really engaging

44:19.640 --> 44:21.640
Answer my friend

44:23.080 --> 44:26.440
Without it the rest of us are due

44:33.800 --> 44:37.240
When I saw that I kept being like, oh, that's just us like that's the way we see kids

44:37.320 --> 44:38.920
That's the way we see

44:38.920 --> 44:43.880
You know the future that's the way and it also really relates to our views around things like IVF in a way that differentiates us from

44:43.880 --> 44:45.960
Catholics and that I believe that we are killing the kids

44:45.960 --> 44:50.120
We do not we need to do everything in our power to bring these kids to life

44:50.280 --> 44:53.960
Yeah, we you know everything else is the kid who we have left

44:54.520 --> 44:59.400
Because we have killed a kid that I need to answer to one day one of my kids that wouldn't be here with us

44:59.400 --> 45:04.760
You know, yeah, there's this one scene in which the the parents are in the hospital three months pregnant and like

45:05.880 --> 45:08.600
The the pregnancy is kind of iffy and the mother's kind of you know

45:08.600 --> 45:11.960
Like in a lot of pain and who knows what's going to happen and like the unborn girl

45:12.440 --> 45:14.680
Is watching in the hospital room kind of like

45:15.480 --> 45:19.000
Like is everything going to be okay? And she's like this cute little girl and you're like

45:19.560 --> 45:20.600
No

45:20.600 --> 45:24.520
This pregnancy has to go through so it's yeah, they really you know

45:24.520 --> 45:29.960
They tug at your heartstrings despite it being dated and cheesy and I hate musicals and it's a musical

45:30.680 --> 45:36.840
I'm telling you man. I cried like a baby every every kid we don't bring into our family is someone that we have erased from the timeline

45:37.240 --> 45:43.240
Yeah, well this this really if if someone struggles to understand what we mean when we say that it might help to watch this

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
musical

45:46.280 --> 45:48.280
I really like

45:49.000 --> 45:55.160
It comes back to anime every time. Well, anyway, I'll edit in and editing. It's called shakugana no shana

45:55.560 --> 45:57.560
but it's an anime where

45:58.360 --> 46:01.400
It represents sort of their soul in their existence

46:02.040 --> 46:04.680
And the the bad guys in this anime

46:05.080 --> 46:11.560
They will wipe out they eat these people's existence. So they wipe out this flame and and when the flame goes out

46:13.240 --> 46:18.280
Nobody suffers like the individual doesn't suffer the people around them don't suffer because they are erased from history

46:18.440 --> 46:22.120
Yeah, it's an endless goal. Yes. They are erased from ever existing

46:22.680 --> 46:26.440
And when you watch this it's heart-wrenching to watch this happen to people because to me

46:26.520 --> 46:30.760
This is so much worse than just killing someone. Yeah, the lost potential breaks our hearts

46:31.720 --> 46:33.720
You

46:36.520 --> 46:37.800
That kid

46:37.800 --> 46:39.320
But why

46:39.320 --> 46:42.040
They are replacements of people who had their existence consumed

46:42.760 --> 46:45.320
by denizens of the crimson world their torches

46:46.280 --> 46:47.960
Their replacements

46:47.960 --> 46:49.960
What are you talking about?

46:49.960 --> 46:53.240
This world's balance would be disrupted if they disappeared too suddenly

46:53.800 --> 46:58.120
Therefore replacements for those people are provided to soften the impact. They're temporary

46:58.760 --> 47:00.600
but then you're

47:00.600 --> 47:02.600
Saying we're

47:02.760 --> 47:04.600
Life no

47:04.600 --> 47:10.360
The real you has had its existence consumed and is no longer living right now. You're nothing but residue

47:19.480 --> 47:21.960
I I don't exist anymore

47:23.960 --> 47:27.000
Well, yeah, and this is what we think a

47:27.560 --> 47:34.040
Moral action equivalent to wiping out one of these fires that destroys a person's soul and they never exist within a timeline

47:34.520 --> 47:40.120
This is what we think is happening when we don't bring a kid into this world that we otherwise could have

47:41.960 --> 47:43.000
Anyway, absolutely

47:43.000 --> 47:47.320
We'll do a longer video on when we think life begins and how we can think of that in the near future

47:47.480 --> 47:53.960
But we actually are going to chat with a Catholic father about this first because we want to better understand the Catholic perspective

47:54.360 --> 47:55.560
Yep

47:55.560 --> 47:58.140
All right. Love you to death. Love you too. Gorgeous
