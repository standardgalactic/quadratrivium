00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
I was walking behind these three women,

00:02.160 --> 00:04.600
and one of the women turns to one of the other women

00:04.600 --> 00:07.640
and goes, I would never date a guy who's not

00:07.640 --> 00:09.800
seeing a psychologist.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.960
And then all of the other women were like, mm-hmm.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.560
Yes, I agree.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.440
And what I realized is that their psychologists

00:18.440 --> 00:21.160
had accepted into all three of these women independently

00:21.160 --> 00:23.640
and enough, and this is a common enough thing,

00:23.640 --> 00:25.720
that apparently women can just say

00:25.720 --> 00:27.120
this within certain social circles

00:27.120 --> 00:29.720
and assume that everyone will have the same brainwashing,

00:29.760 --> 00:31.600
that you cannot be mentally healthy

00:31.600 --> 00:33.440
without seeing a psychologist.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.960
That was what was implied was what was being said.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.800
That is the highest horror

00:42.800 --> 00:46.040
of psychologically mispractice

00:46.040 --> 00:49.800
that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.760
That a psychologist had convinced them

00:51.760 --> 00:53.640
of largely two things.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.280
One is, you can't be psychologically healthy

00:56.280 --> 00:57.800
without seeing a psychologist.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.480
And then two is, you can't be psychologically healthy

01:00.480 --> 01:03.480
without continuing to see a psychologist.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.920
They were creating dependency in their patients

01:06.920 --> 01:09.600
to get a recurring stream of revenue.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.080
Now, what this cult of psychology does

01:12.080 --> 01:14.640
is people go to a psychologist with a problem,

01:15.520 --> 01:20.320
and they then say, oh, that problem is likely tied

01:20.320 --> 01:23.360
to a trauma early in your life.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.160
Let's determine what this trauma is,

01:26.160 --> 01:28.360
and then we can constantly meet about this trauma,

01:28.360 --> 01:32.520
because if you don't have me acting as a constant bulwark

01:32.520 --> 01:36.720
against this trauma, then it will fall upon you

01:36.720 --> 01:40.000
and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.040
And that's dependency.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.760
This is actually the mechanisms

01:42.760 --> 01:44.320
that Scientologists would use.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.680
They would do a theme reading,

01:45.680 --> 01:47.200
and they would ask you questions about things

01:47.200 --> 01:48.600
like your parents or other things

01:48.600 --> 01:50.680
that happened early in your life.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.800
And then they would say, ah, you have some trauma

01:53.840 --> 01:56.200
with your mom or your trauma with your dad.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.680
And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,

01:59.680 --> 02:01.840
which is interesting to me that you have this one field

02:01.840 --> 02:04.920
that is so vilified for milking people from their money

02:04.920 --> 02:07.040
and creating dependency, which is Scientology.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.200
And then you have this other field,

02:08.200 --> 02:11.240
which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,

02:11.240 --> 02:12.760
which is the psychologist,

02:12.760 --> 02:15.240
but in a way it's because they're competing

02:15.240 --> 02:18.600
for the same customers using the same mechanisms.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.520
Oh, wow.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.720
Why there is this fight here.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.440
Would you like to know more?

02:24.440 --> 02:25.480
Hello, gorgeous.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.560
Hello, Simone.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.720
It's wonderful to be here with you today.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.800
What are we talking about?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.600
Psychology.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.840
Are you ready?

02:31.840 --> 02:33.400
So people may not know this.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.280
I started my early career in neuroscience and psychology.

02:36.280 --> 02:41.280
So yes, I did some early work in brain-computer interface,

02:41.800 --> 02:45.200
but before that, I was a psychologist

02:45.200 --> 02:47.000
who focused on schizophrenia and stuff like that,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.200
but also like more general psychology stuff.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.200
And recently I have become horrified

02:54.200 --> 02:56.440
and very disappointed in the field

02:56.440 --> 03:00.880
because it seems to be turning into a cult.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.360
And I mean that very literally

03:03.360 --> 03:07.600
and as terrifyingly as it could possibly be interpreted.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.000
So to people who don't know this about psychology,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.320
one of the things that all young psychologists

03:13.320 --> 03:16.340
are taught about when you're just starting out in psychology

03:16.340 --> 03:21.340
is the horror of the fad that was hypnosis.

03:21.980 --> 03:26.620
Because it turns out that when somebody comes to you

03:26.620 --> 03:29.300
and you're in a position of authority over them,

03:29.300 --> 03:34.020
it is very easy to implant memories in their mind

03:34.020 --> 03:35.980
using specific procedures.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.620
Many of those look like hypnosis,

03:37.620 --> 03:39.500
but they also look like other things.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.740
This is one of these big things

03:40.740 --> 03:43.140
that they always teach you early in psychology.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.460
It's that memories are not actually

03:45.460 --> 03:47.580
that great a predictor of whether or not something

03:47.580 --> 03:49.900
actually happened the way it's being remembered happened.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.420
And this is all important for court psychologists

03:52.420 --> 03:56.020
and stuff like that, but the real tragedy comes

03:56.020 --> 03:57.380
when people go to a psychologist

03:57.380 --> 04:00.420
to try to work out some problem they have.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.300
And then that psychologist through mechanisms

04:03.300 --> 04:07.460
that we now know can implant memories in a person's mind,

04:07.460 --> 04:11.300
which is hypnosis, implant a bunch of memories of trauma

04:11.300 --> 04:15.280
in someone's mind and then use those memories of trauma

04:15.280 --> 04:18.320
to justify why that person is seeing a psychologist.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.700
And then historically, there were many cases

04:20.700 --> 04:24.160
of using those memories of trauma to cut the person off

04:24.160 --> 04:26.120
from people who would have broken them out of the cult,

04:26.120 --> 04:28.000
gotten them away from the psychologist.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.520
There's the famous case of a young girl

04:30.520 --> 04:32.000
who accused her father of rape,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.720
which it seems he almost certainly did not do.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.720
And yet he went to trial over this and everything

04:36.720 --> 04:38.200
really had damage to his life.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.780
And when I'm doing editing,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.160
I'll find the name of the case and put it on screen here

04:42.160 --> 04:45.360
because it's this really heartbreaking case

04:45.360 --> 04:49.520
of how easy it is to accidentally brainwash someone

04:49.520 --> 04:52.000
if they come to you as a psychologist.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.800
And so there was this moment not too long ago

04:54.800 --> 04:57.720
where I was in a room of really high profile people.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.440
I'm talking about like top level people in our society,

05:01.440 --> 05:02.640
controlling things and stuff like that.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.800
And I was walking behind these three women

05:04.800 --> 05:07.200
and one of the women turns to one of the other women

05:07.200 --> 05:09.800
and goes, I would never date a guy

05:09.800 --> 05:11.640
who's not seeing a psychologist.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.960
And then all of the other women were like,

05:13.960 --> 05:15.760
mm-hmm, yes, I agree.

05:16.720 --> 05:21.080
And what I realized is that their psychologists

05:21.080 --> 05:23.760
had accepted into all three of these women independently

05:23.760 --> 05:26.280
and enough, and this is a common enough thing

05:26.280 --> 05:28.600
that apparently like women can just say this

05:28.600 --> 05:30.200
was in certain social circles and assume

05:30.200 --> 05:32.360
that everyone will have the same brainwashing,

05:32.360 --> 05:34.200
that you cannot be mentally healthy

05:34.200 --> 05:36.040
without seeing a psychologist.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.560
That was what was implied was what was being said.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.240
That is the highest horror

05:45.240 --> 05:48.480
of psychologically mispractice

05:48.480 --> 05:52.240
that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.160
That a psychologist had convinced them

05:54.160 --> 05:56.040
of largely two things.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.720
One is you can't be psychologically healthy

05:58.720 --> 06:00.200
without seeing a psychologist.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.880
And then two is you can't be psychologically healthy

06:02.880 --> 06:05.880
without continuing to see a psychologist.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.320
They were creating dependency in their patients

06:09.520 --> 06:12.200
to get a recurring stream of revenue.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.760
This doesn't come as a surprise, right?

06:13.760 --> 06:16.200
Because when we talk about governance

06:16.200 --> 06:19.680
and we talk about what makes people do what they're doing,

06:19.680 --> 06:24.320
when you have a career in which you maintain clients

06:24.320 --> 06:26.120
and have repeat clients

06:26.120 --> 06:29.160
because they continue to need your services,

06:29.160 --> 06:32.560
any psychologist, psychotherapist, therapist, whatever,

06:32.560 --> 06:35.520
counselor who is really good at their job.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.160
That is to say helping people not need counseling

06:38.160 --> 06:40.960
or therapy or psychoanalysis or whatever anymore.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.520
If you're really good at your job, you lose your customers.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.840
If you are really good at creating dependency

06:46.840 --> 06:50.520
and reinforcing someone's mental struggles,

06:50.520 --> 06:54.000
then you have a thriving career and customer base,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.560
especially if they think that they need you

06:55.560 --> 06:58.160
and that you are somehow helping even while you're secretly

06:58.160 --> 07:00.560
or subconsciously making things worse.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.440
So there's this huge adverse incentive,

07:02.440 --> 07:03.920
one that we also really complain about

07:03.920 --> 07:06.600
in the nonprofit world where the nonprofits

07:06.600 --> 07:09.560
that tend to stick around and survive

07:09.560 --> 07:11.800
are those which raise money effectively,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.760
not which solve their problem effectively.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.440
So I guess we're seeing the same problem in psychology

07:17.440 --> 07:19.120
as we are in the world of nonprofits,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.560
which is the successful psychologists are those

07:21.560 --> 07:25.200
that are very good at getting clients dependent on them.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.040
Correct?

07:26.040 --> 07:28.240
So I think that this is a really critical point

07:28.240 --> 07:29.440
that you've made Simone,

07:29.440 --> 07:32.280
which is I don't think that anyone has really gone into this

07:32.280 --> 07:33.880
or that many people have gone into this

07:33.880 --> 07:35.680
with nefarious intentions,

07:35.720 --> 07:38.280
nor do I think it's a problem in how psychologists are taught

07:38.280 --> 07:41.400
because I was warned against this going into psychology.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.560
The problem is that if you're a good psychologist,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.040
you earn less money.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.920
If you have less money, you have less room for advertising,

07:47.920 --> 07:50.720
less money for advertising, less money for client acquisition,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.080
and you have lower margins,

07:52.080 --> 07:55.120
which mean you can get less high profile clients often.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.440
So really what you're seeing,

07:56.440 --> 07:58.000
and I think the reason you see this in the

07:58.000 --> 07:59.880
quote unquote elite levels of psychology

07:59.880 --> 08:02.600
more than I think the general psychological audience,

08:02.600 --> 08:05.400
although I don't know how widespread this practice is,

08:05.440 --> 08:08.520
is because of the people who either subconsciously

08:08.520 --> 08:10.640
or accidentally fall into this practice

08:10.640 --> 08:12.720
of accidentally brainwashing their patients

08:12.720 --> 08:15.160
into thinking they need a psychologist constantly,

08:15.160 --> 08:17.720
economically out-compete the psychologists

08:17.720 --> 08:19.680
who aren't doing this practice.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.640
And I think that this is one of those things

08:21.640 --> 08:23.400
where no one is acting nefariously.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.440
Nobody went into this saying,

08:25.440 --> 08:28.520
I want to incept people with the idea

08:28.520 --> 08:30.640
that they can't be mentally healthy without one

08:30.640 --> 08:32.320
continuing to see me or two,

08:32.320 --> 08:33.680
that they should cut themselves off

08:33.680 --> 08:35.520
from everyone who's not seeing a psychologist

08:35.520 --> 08:38.320
in terms of their sort of personal, emotional life.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.720
But that's also a really interesting thing.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.800
If psychologists tell people,

08:42.800 --> 08:45.880
also the people who you are engaged with in your life

08:45.880 --> 08:47.440
need to see a psychologist,

08:47.440 --> 08:49.960
that's additional customers, right?

08:49.960 --> 08:52.440
If it's, oh, well, you should stop interacting

08:52.440 --> 08:54.720
with your parents unless they're also seeing a psychologist.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.360
By the way, here's my card.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.720
By the way, you shouldn't date people

08:58.720 --> 09:00.360
unless they're also seeing a psychologist.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.080
By the way, here's my card.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.560
And so there's many elements

09:03.560 --> 09:07.240
of how this sort of cult accidentally can evolve.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.080
And I think that some psychologists

09:09.080 --> 09:10.880
have some of these practices and not others.

09:10.880 --> 09:11.880
And some psychologists,

09:11.880 --> 09:13.040
I'm not saying all psychologists

09:13.040 --> 09:14.000
are part of this cult movement.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.440
What I'm saying is that it does exist

09:15.440 --> 09:16.680
within the psychology movement.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.640
And even when I talk to people with a psychology background

09:18.640 --> 09:19.680
who aren't caught up in this,

09:19.680 --> 09:21.800
they're like, oh God, yeah, I've definitely seen that.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.880
And it's really scary.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.000
So let's talk about the way

09:24.000 --> 09:26.800
that psychology is generally supposed to work

09:26.800 --> 09:28.520
when you go to see a psychologist.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.960
And then we can contrast that

09:30.000 --> 09:33.080
with the way you know you're dealing with probably

09:33.080 --> 09:34.840
a bad psychologist or a psychologist

09:34.840 --> 09:37.120
who is creating dependency.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.480
It is typically you go to a psychologist

09:39.480 --> 09:41.120
and you have some issue.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.760
And what they are supposed to do

09:43.760 --> 09:47.440
is help you rewrite your internal self-narrative

09:47.440 --> 09:49.520
so that thing that is an issue

09:49.520 --> 09:51.160
is either not an issue

09:51.160 --> 09:53.960
or not debilitating to your daily life.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.600
That is what a good psychologist does.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.360
You might go to a psychologist

09:58.360 --> 10:01.240
believing that you have some sort of a crippling problem

10:01.240 --> 10:02.400
that you can't get out of

10:02.400 --> 10:05.120
and they work with you to not have a crippling problem

10:05.120 --> 10:05.960
that you can't get out of

10:05.960 --> 10:07.560
and not have to see a psychologist anymore.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.600
Now what a quote, unquote evil psychologist does,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.360
this cult of psychology does

10:12.360 --> 10:14.920
is people go to a psychologist with a problem.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.240
And they then say,

10:18.240 --> 10:22.120
oh, that problem is likely tied to a trauma

10:22.120 --> 10:23.640
early in your life.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.440
Let's determine what this trauma is.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.760
And then we can constantly meet about this trauma

10:28.760 --> 10:31.120
because if you don't have me

10:31.120 --> 10:34.680
acting as a constant bulwark against this trauma,

10:34.680 --> 10:37.080
then it will fall upon you

10:37.080 --> 10:40.360
and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.400
And that's dependency

10:41.400 --> 10:43.000
because they're saying without me acting

10:43.000 --> 10:44.560
as this sort of bulwark.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.040
And what is really fascinating is when I was younger,

10:47.040 --> 10:48.200
I was interested in joining cults.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.880
So like not, I didn't want to join a cult.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.120
I was interested in how people could be convinced

10:53.120 --> 10:53.960
to believe things.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.680
It seemed obviously not true to me.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.760
And one of the things I did is I went to a number

10:58.760 --> 11:00.560
of like psychology recruitment sessions,

11:00.560 --> 11:02.200
not psychology, Scientology.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.440
Sorry, the brady and slip of the tongue there.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.200
I went to Scientology recruitment sessions.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.160
And this is actually the mechanisms

11:09.160 --> 11:10.720
that Scientologists would use.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.080
They would do a theme reading

11:12.080 --> 11:13.600
and they would ask you questions about things

11:13.600 --> 11:15.360
like your parents or something like that

11:15.360 --> 11:18.080
or other things that happened early in your life.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.760
And then the theme reading is basically

11:19.760 --> 11:20.960
a galvanic spin response.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.960
So they could tell when you would get nervous.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.000
And then they would say,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.880
ah, you have some trauma with your mom

11:26.880 --> 11:28.400
or your trauma with your dad,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.440
depending on how you reacted galvanic spin response wise

11:31.440 --> 11:33.720
to their questions around this stuff.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.240
And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,

11:37.240 --> 11:39.360
which is interesting to me that you have this one field

11:39.360 --> 11:42.440
that is so vilified for milking people from their money

11:42.440 --> 11:44.560
and creating dependency, which is Scientology.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.720
And then you have this other field

11:45.720 --> 11:48.760
which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.320
which is psychologists.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.760
But in a way, it's because they're competing

11:52.760 --> 11:56.120
for the same customers using the same mechanisms.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.040
Oh, wow.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.080
Why there is this fight here.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.880
And interesting when Scientology evolves,

12:01.880 --> 12:03.120
that was during one of the periods

12:03.120 --> 12:05.080
where this is one of those really interesting things.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
So if you go back to Christian science,

12:07.080 --> 12:07.920
a lot of people are like,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.040
oh, isn't that ridiculous

12:09.040 --> 12:10.840
that they don't want to use modern medicine?

12:10.840 --> 12:12.840
However, actually, if you look at the time period

12:12.840 --> 12:14.440
when Christian science evolved,

12:14.440 --> 12:17.840
modern medicine might have actually lowered life expectancy

12:17.840 --> 12:19.680
because that was back when they were doing leeches

12:19.680 --> 12:21.880
and bone cuttings and everything.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.000
And so it actually made sense during that time.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.160
If you look at during the early evolution of Scientology,

12:27.160 --> 12:30.000
this was happening during the hypnotherapy epidemic.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.880
So they might have actually had a point

12:31.880 --> 12:35.320
that their mechanisms that was actually interesting

12:35.320 --> 12:38.280
is their mechanisms might have been prescient

12:38.280 --> 12:42.880
of the direction psychology was going to go 30, 40 years

12:42.880 --> 12:46.640
in the future, which is just fascinating to me

12:46.640 --> 12:48.600
that we now see them as evil.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.040
And yet they were just creating dependency

12:51.040 --> 12:52.080
in the same way psychologists do.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.520
Now, of course they didn't go as far.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.280
And so what psychologists have

12:55.280 --> 12:56.520
that the Scientologists didn't have

12:56.520 --> 12:58.280
was certain regulatory organizations

12:58.280 --> 13:00.480
which can just bar them and stuff like that

13:00.480 --> 13:02.120
so that they couldn't go quite as far

13:02.120 --> 13:04.520
with molesting people or something

13:04.520 --> 13:08.720
or creating essential slaves or any of the other things

13:08.720 --> 13:10.880
that of course, for legal reasons,

13:10.880 --> 13:14.720
I'm not saying Scientology has ever done any of these things.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.280
But what I'm saying is that the tech,

13:17.280 --> 13:20.160
if they might, because it's such a centralized organization,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.360
they wouldn't have the same system

13:22.360 --> 13:25.200
for preventing these kinds of extreme levels of abuse.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.520
But that doesn't mean that the core techniques

13:27.520 --> 13:29.560
that they're using aren't the same techniques,

13:29.560 --> 13:32.720
that the field of psychology had allowed itself

13:32.720 --> 13:35.600
or has allowed itself to drift into.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.640
And this terrifies me.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.800
Let me add another layer of complexity though,

13:39.800 --> 13:41.280
because as much as this is terrifying

13:41.280 --> 13:44.120
and as much as we frame this as like people unknowingly

13:44.120 --> 13:45.680
entering into these relationships

13:45.680 --> 13:49.800
where dependency is created and then turned into victims,

13:49.800 --> 13:52.080
part of me wonders if this is an open secret

13:52.080 --> 13:54.200
because we've had this conversation with friends,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.280
we've had this conversation with people quite frankly

13:56.280 --> 13:58.440
because we find it interesting.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.080
And we've met many people

14:00.080 --> 14:03.360
who have undergone really hard mental periods

14:03.360 --> 14:06.080
that their lives most people have, I think,

14:06.080 --> 14:08.920
who have ended up independent relationships with therapists

14:08.920 --> 14:10.760
and just flat out told us,

14:10.760 --> 14:13.640
yeah, I see a therapist a couple of times a week,

14:13.640 --> 14:14.480
it's gotten to the point

14:14.480 --> 14:16.240
where my insurance doesn't accept them anymore,

14:16.240 --> 14:17.760
I'm paying out of pocket for this.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.800
So this is obviously a big investment.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.880
I know that this is a dependent relationship,

14:23.880 --> 14:26.800
but also it's been a big help for me.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.680
And even though I know that this is not right, I need this.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.560
This is one of the problems with psychological biases

14:32.560 --> 14:34.680
is you can know you have a psychological bias

14:34.680 --> 14:36.360
and it doesn't help you get out of it.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.360
You can know that you're in a culture,

14:38.360 --> 14:40.000
in a dependent relationship,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.160
but the psychologist has effectively created this dependency.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.440
You can't easily leave it.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.280
That's one of the problems.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.080
You essentially need cult deprogramming to get out of this.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.320
And does such a thing exist?

14:49.320 --> 14:52.800
What can we say to our friends who are in those positions

14:52.800 --> 14:54.280
or if someone's watching this video and they're like,

14:54.280 --> 14:58.800
oh, wait, yeah, I am in a codependent relationship.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.280
I'm paying out of pocket for someone.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.080
This is really, it's not sustainable.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.280
And obviously my problem's not going away, right?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.000
Like I still have crippling anxiety

15:07.000 --> 15:09.920
or this terrible traumatic thing that's interrupting my life.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.240
What would you say to them then?

15:11.240 --> 15:13.640
There is no cult deprogramming for therapists.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.000
I think that that's the key is solving it yourself.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.400
If you don't, if whenever you give your mind,

15:19.400 --> 15:21.800
your mental state to another person,

15:21.800 --> 15:24.720
you create enormous personal vulnerability.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.560
And so yes, it's harder to do it on your own.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.360
But the truth is that the things that the psychologists

15:30.360 --> 15:31.720
are taught about how to engage us,

15:31.720 --> 15:34.400
someone are just not that complex.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.680
They're gonna say they are, they really aren't.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.040
It's just personal narrative building stuff,

15:39.040 --> 15:41.360
which you can read about in the Pragment Just Guide to Life.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.040
But if you aren't interested in that,

15:44.040 --> 15:46.040
then try to find another psychologist,

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
interview them early on like you should a psychologist.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.080
And I would say the big red flag is the more a psychologist

15:51.080 --> 15:53.120
is focused on the concept of trauma,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.840
especially trauma as an immutable thing,

15:54.840 --> 15:56.720
as not a goal to get over,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.760
then they are likely on the evil side

15:58.760 --> 16:00.480
or the dependency creating side.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.240
If they are focused on either not focused on trauma

16:03.240 --> 16:06.240
or their focus on trauma is helping you overcome

16:06.240 --> 16:09.240
the trauma entirely, then they are likely,

16:09.240 --> 16:11.280
more likely to be on the positive side.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.800
But what's interesting is I've noticed that these ideas

16:14.800 --> 16:16.600
that have been incepted into people

16:16.600 --> 16:18.160
have worked their way in a way

16:18.160 --> 16:20.240
into mainstream progressive politics,

16:20.240 --> 16:24.080
where people now define themselves by their traumas

16:24.080 --> 16:27.880
and they see them as like a major part of their self identity.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.960
And I think what's really interesting

16:29.960 --> 16:33.640
is other religious movements used to have defenses against this.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.880
And this is one of the things we talk about

16:34.880 --> 16:36.840
in the Pragment Just Guide to Crafting Religion

16:36.840 --> 16:38.640
is that a lot of religious movements

16:38.640 --> 16:41.440
essentially had roles that were like psychologists.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.760
I mean, of course they did, right?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.400
This isn't a new need for people

16:44.400 --> 16:46.040
to some extent within the Jewish community,

16:46.040 --> 16:47.880
like that's what your rabbi would do.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.160
And in the Mormon community, you know,

16:49.160 --> 16:50.120
you have solutions to this.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.080
And within these communities,

16:51.080 --> 16:53.360
because they didn't use psychologists to recruit people

16:53.360 --> 16:55.240
in the way that Scientologists did,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.960
they were genuinely interested in mental health.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.240
And one of the best mental health focused communities

17:01.240 --> 17:03.440
or systems that evolved to do this

17:03.440 --> 17:06.040
that I just have endless admiration for

17:06.040 --> 17:07.920
is the Catholic system.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.960
So what the Catholic system is, the confession system,

17:11.960 --> 17:15.960
what it allows you to do is go to someone,

17:15.960 --> 17:18.960
say, this is something bad I've done

17:18.960 --> 17:20.040
or this is something I've done

17:20.040 --> 17:23.680
that is causing mental trouble for me or something like that.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.920
And what they don't say very importantly

17:25.920 --> 17:28.920
is know that thing wasn't actually bad.

17:28.920 --> 17:29.920
They don't say, oh no,

17:29.920 --> 17:31.680
you're just automatically forgiven for it,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.640
which is what the Bible says, you know, as you repent,

17:34.640 --> 17:35.880
but it's actually a better system

17:35.880 --> 17:39.040
than even what I think from a psychological standpoint,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.120
is to say, yes, what you did is bad.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.040
Here is a concrete list of things you can do

17:45.040 --> 17:48.560
to atone for the bad thing you did.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.800
So it's an acknowledgement of the badness

17:50.800 --> 17:53.160
and then creating a self-narrative within the person

17:53.160 --> 17:54.680
that they can overcome that

17:54.680 --> 17:55.880
through following this list of things.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.440
Now, of course, they're also creating dependency

17:58.440 --> 17:59.960
to the church to some extent, right?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.920
Oh, you need to keep going every time you do a bad thing.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.880
But what's really admirable about the system they created

18:06.880 --> 18:10.320
is it's a very difficult system to abuse,

18:10.320 --> 18:13.760
either accidentally or on purpose.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.480
The pseudo anonymity of the system

18:16.480 --> 18:18.600
makes it harder for a person to form a dependency

18:18.600 --> 18:20.160
on a single individual.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.760
The high level of ethics around not talking about,

18:23.760 --> 18:25.120
and this is like a really important thing

18:25.120 --> 18:25.960
for Catholic periods,

18:25.960 --> 18:28.080
you cannot say what was told to you in confession,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.720
even if it could save someone's life

18:29.720 --> 18:31.040
or it prevent a murder,

18:31.040 --> 18:33.600
which is actually higher than the level of trust

18:33.600 --> 18:35.000
you have with your psychologist.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.320
If you go to a psychologist and you say something

18:37.320 --> 18:39.040
that says just that you could kill someone else

18:39.040 --> 18:41.800
or self-harm, they actually have a duty to report you,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.120
like serious risk of your own life,

18:44.120 --> 18:46.640
where the Catholic priest has a higher level of trust

18:46.640 --> 18:47.680
in that.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.960
And even if you have a dumb person

18:49.960 --> 18:52.120
who could accidentally give a person bad advice,

18:52.120 --> 18:54.880
they're actually working within a fairly narrow range

18:54.880 --> 18:56.520
of answers they can give you.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.920
And it's really hard for them to give an answer

18:58.920 --> 19:01.880
that creates that much psychological damage.

19:01.880 --> 19:06.200
So there are mechanisms for better systems in this.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.560
The problem is that these mechanisms aren't available

19:09.560 --> 19:12.000
to the masses or to the secular

19:12.000 --> 19:15.720
or like religiously derived masses

19:15.720 --> 19:18.400
that are no longer in these traditions

19:18.400 --> 19:20.080
that offer services like this.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.360
So I know you don't really like alcoholics anonymous,

19:24.360 --> 19:26.720
for example, because what it has become

19:26.720 --> 19:28.000
is actually quite corrupted

19:28.000 --> 19:30.560
and it has various adverse incentives at play.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.120
It's another example of an organization

19:32.120 --> 19:33.240
that was started with good intent,

19:33.240 --> 19:34.520
but essentially has become a cult,

19:34.520 --> 19:35.560
but that's for a different video.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.720
Right, that's for a different video.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.400
And not all of it, factions of it.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.800
I do want to ask you about their buddy system.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.480
You know, that you, when you go into AA,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.760
there's a lot of stuff that is whatever,

19:45.760 --> 19:47.360
but one of the things that you do have,

19:47.360 --> 19:49.520
rather than a therapist, rather than a priest

19:49.520 --> 19:52.320
that you confess to, rather than a centralized authority,

19:52.320 --> 19:55.400
you just have another one of the people of this group

19:55.400 --> 20:00.240
who shares your struggle being your accountability buddy.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.840
And it seems like sometimes these people have,

20:01.840 --> 20:03.400
they've been through it more than you have,

20:03.400 --> 20:04.800
but at least, so they're more advanced.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.280
Yeah, so what are they really doing?

20:06.280 --> 20:08.440
They're preventing you from leaving AA.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.600
You could say they're preventing you

20:09.600 --> 20:11.080
from getting back on alcohol,

20:11.080 --> 20:12.520
but just as much of preventing you

20:12.520 --> 20:14.040
from getting back on alcohol,

20:14.040 --> 20:17.400
they consider a failure scenario two things.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.960
You getting back on alcohol or you leaving AA.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.440
What are your thoughts on, and we'll say-

20:22.440 --> 20:23.640
And this is where the whole idea

20:23.640 --> 20:24.600
to take a step aside here.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.720
This is where the concept of a dry drunk within AA

20:26.720 --> 20:28.720
comes from, if anybody doesn't believe me.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.800
Look at this concept.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.520
Many people in the cult version of AA

20:32.520 --> 20:34.920
believe that quitting alcohol through a mechanism

20:34.920 --> 20:39.120
other than AA is as bad as continuing to be an alcoholic,

20:39.120 --> 20:42.440
which to me shows the point is staying in AA.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.640
It's not getting off alcohol,

20:44.640 --> 20:47.000
which is what I mean when I say this is a cult,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.320
and it's not all of AA.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.400
And the same way it's not all psychologists,

20:50.400 --> 20:51.560
but the buddy system-

20:52.040 --> 20:55.600
Let's return to mechanisms that people can turn to

20:55.600 --> 20:57.080
if they don't turn to a therapist,

20:57.080 --> 20:59.800
if they're not Catholic and they don't wanna go to confession.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.440
Do you think a buddy system,

21:01.440 --> 21:03.560
so someone maybe who's been through the same thing

21:03.560 --> 21:06.760
that you have or someone that you really trust as a friend

21:06.760 --> 21:09.480
is a good alternative to just figuring it out by yourself?

21:09.480 --> 21:11.600
Cause I don't think everyone's really ready for that.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.440
Just a side note,

21:12.440 --> 21:15.400
as somebody who really studied cults and loves cults,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.000
buddy systems are really common in cults.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.360
It's one of the most common systems.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.200
We love Mormons, we'll have a video on them in the future,

21:21.200 --> 21:23.600
but Mormons due to an extent use a buddy system

21:23.600 --> 21:24.880
during a person's mission trip

21:24.880 --> 21:27.160
to prevent them from deconverting

21:27.160 --> 21:30.680
so that they have somebody they can turn to constantly,

21:30.680 --> 21:33.240
but that also is supervising them to an extent.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.000
And when you look at cults,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.880
actually one of the reasons why cults historically

21:36.880 --> 21:39.440
use buddy systems is for converting people.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.680
But what some cults found,

21:40.680 --> 21:41.920
and there's some great research on that,

21:41.920 --> 21:43.720
that was actually done by the cults themselves

21:43.720 --> 21:44.960
because they kept records,

21:44.960 --> 21:46.840
I think the Mooneys were the ones who did this,

21:46.840 --> 21:49.320
is it was never approached somebody as an individual

21:49.360 --> 21:51.400
because they'll think that it's like a sexual thing

21:51.400 --> 21:53.000
or like you're hitting on them or something

21:53.000 --> 21:54.560
or like it's weird.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.920
But if you approach them with a buddy,

21:56.920 --> 21:59.440
which is the smallest group you can do this with,

21:59.440 --> 22:02.600
they have a much higher chance of not being afraid of you

22:02.600 --> 22:04.640
and not seeing you as threatening.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.400
So yes, buddy system is actually often a sign

22:07.400 --> 22:08.440
that you're joining a cult.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.040
And I need to stress, I don't think Mormonism is a cult,

22:11.040 --> 22:13.840
they just, the buddy system is there to prevent deconversion.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.240
But to the point that you were making,

22:16.240 --> 22:18.200
can a buddy system be good?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.440
It may be good,

22:19.440 --> 22:22.360
but I really think the ultimate buddy system is a spouse.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.840
And what you really have to type is spouse

22:25.840 --> 22:28.560
that can help you work through these things for yourself,

22:28.560 --> 22:31.120
which Simone does for me all the time,

22:32.920 --> 22:34.400
I've been brainwashed by my spouse.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.080
That's really what I'm saying here.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.360
I've been brainwashed

22:37.360 --> 22:40.400
into just having absolute mental dependency on my spouse.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.160
Well, what I hear you saying is,

22:44.080 --> 22:47.680
buddy systems are a viable therapy mechanism.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.440
Isn't that what someone who had brainwashed me would say?

22:50.440 --> 22:51.760
Hmm.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.960
No, I know what I'm saying is buddy systems may work,

22:54.960 --> 22:56.400
but they're not a terribly good system.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.440
Well, I think a buddy system is a really good system

22:59.440 --> 23:03.880
if you're trying to opt into someone's lifestyle or solution.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.280
So if you think-

23:05.280 --> 23:08.520
If the buddy system is managed by an organization

23:08.520 --> 23:10.840
that you can have total trust,

23:10.840 --> 23:12.720
has your best interest at heart.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.960
I'm referring to a friend.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.080
I'm referring to a spouse.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.120
I'm referring to a mentor.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.720
I'm not referring to anything that's organizationally related.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.680
I'm referring to the dynamic of someone that you trust

23:21.680 --> 23:23.240
helping you work through something.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.800
Well, then you better have total trust in them

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
because you know what, that buddy,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.440
there's a reason why there's all these rules

23:28.440 --> 23:30.560
against sleeping with your psychologist and stuff like that.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.200
If you're a female and that buddy's a male,

23:32.200 --> 23:33.480
they're probably gonna try to sleep with you

23:33.480 --> 23:35.680
unless you have like enormous trust in them or vice versa.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.640
No, this is how people create dependency.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.960
This is how I understand

23:39.960 --> 23:42.560
if you have total trust in the person you're going with

23:42.560 --> 23:44.680
in this buddy system, great.

23:44.680 --> 23:48.240
But the problem is that you can often misjudge someone.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.080
And when you use someone to be this kind of sounding board,

23:52.080 --> 23:55.320
you outsource the keys to your mental kingdom

23:55.320 --> 23:56.480
to someone else,

23:56.480 --> 23:57.960
which puts you in a position

23:57.960 --> 23:59.760
of enormous mental vulnerability.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.280
But Malcolm, I think what you're missing

24:01.280 --> 24:02.840
is when people are severely depressed,

24:02.840 --> 24:05.440
when people are severely traumatized,

24:05.440 --> 24:06.280
they may not have-

24:06.280 --> 24:07.360
So the question should be solved

24:07.360 --> 24:09.840
with pharmacological intervention

24:09.840 --> 24:13.080
and potentially even more extreme interventions

24:13.080 --> 24:15.320
like electroshock therapy

24:15.320 --> 24:17.720
works really well for extreme depression.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.520
There are solutions to the more extreme psychological problems.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.960
This is same for things like schizophrenia

24:23.960 --> 24:24.800
and stuff like that.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.920
But those aren't psychologist problems.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.640
Those are psychiatrist problems.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.480
It's a different fricking degree, okay?

24:33.480 --> 24:35.960
It's a different, it's a completely different level.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.600
One prescribes things and the other doesn't.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.480
Go to the one that prescribes things

24:40.480 --> 24:41.640
if that's what you're looking for.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.040
If you're looking for solutions

24:43.040 --> 24:44.600
that you can't come to yourself

24:44.600 --> 24:45.720
or you can't come to with a buddy.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.080
And I do agree, a buddy,

24:47.080 --> 24:49.840
all I'm doing is highlighting the importance

24:49.840 --> 24:53.520
of understanding that if you go to a buddy,

24:53.520 --> 24:54.360
trust that buddy,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.240
but the truth that you could probably trust a buddy

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
better than you can a random psychologist.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.080
That is true.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.240
Like the only thing you really have faith

25:01.240 --> 25:03.680
that the psychologist isn't going to do,

25:03.680 --> 25:07.440
is there likely not or less likely going to

25:07.440 --> 25:10.000
do something that's just absolutely egregious to you.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.400
But they are much more likely

25:11.400 --> 25:13.200
to just create a generic dependency.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.080
Whereas a buddy may have a slightly higher probability

25:16.080 --> 25:17.720
of doing something absolutely egregious,

25:17.720 --> 25:19.000
but a much lower probability

25:19.000 --> 25:20.560
of creating general dependency.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.360
So long as you prepped in with framing for this,

25:24.360 --> 25:26.040
which the pragmatist got into life,

25:26.040 --> 25:27.680
which is our shortest book by far

25:27.680 --> 25:30.560
and sells for 99 cents and all the profits go to charity.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.240
So like we created it actually when we wrote that book,

25:33.240 --> 25:35.600
it was to try to create an alternative to CBT.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.120
CBT is actually a great system.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.320
We just wanted an alternative

25:38.320 --> 25:40.640
that people with less training could use

25:40.640 --> 25:41.880
was more reliability.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.080
CBT standing for cognitive behavioral therapy.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.200
But it was originally meant to be a

25:48.200 --> 25:50.280
if then training manual for psychologists.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.200
And actually an AI was going to be trained on it

25:52.200 --> 25:53.080
to become a psychologist.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.640
One AI team reached out to us after reading it.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.760
If you read it and you're like,

25:56.760 --> 25:58.640
this sounds like a psychologist training manual.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.360
That's actually the way it was written.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.440
And so it could actually help you in that scenario

26:03.440 --> 26:06.040
to prevent the more extreme ways

26:06.080 --> 26:07.440
you might engage with something,

26:07.440 --> 26:09.720
but then also just self-reflection

26:09.720 --> 26:11.400
with this very simple concept.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.120
And I'll present the concept to you.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.960
You have an internal self-narrative.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.720
Who you are, what your role is in the world,

26:17.720 --> 26:19.400
what events have caused you trauma,

26:19.400 --> 26:20.960
how you relate to those trauma.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.720
This is all part of your self-narrative.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.040
It's the narrative you tell yourself.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.000
The core goal of this person you're going to

26:28.000 --> 26:29.360
is for you to go to them,

26:29.360 --> 26:32.120
say this is how I would like to rewrite my self-narrative

26:32.120 --> 26:33.560
or this is my self-narrative today

26:33.560 --> 26:35.720
and here's how it's causing me problems.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.320
And to work with you in rewriting that self-narrative,

26:38.320 --> 26:42.080
which is actually self-narratives are incredibly malleable.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.800
Even though we pretend in society today

26:43.800 --> 26:46.160
like they are this immutable part of who we are,

26:46.160 --> 26:47.080
they are not.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.280
It's very, like research shows are very malleable.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.200
So you're going to this person to rewrite your self-narrative

26:53.200 --> 26:56.160
into one that is less damaging to your daily life

26:56.160 --> 26:58.920
or your goals for who you want to be or yourself.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.280
And that's just a very doable thing.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.360
You don't need to read the book,

27:01.360 --> 27:03.240
just go into it with that concept.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.000
We'll also understanding that this person

27:05.000 --> 27:07.920
who's rewriting your self-narrative could rewrite it

27:07.920 --> 27:11.520
to say, you absolutely need to keep seeing me

27:11.520 --> 27:13.320
and giving me money and give me all your money.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.040
And then do all these things I tell you to do

27:16.040 --> 27:18.520
or you will never be mentally healthy.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.160
And that's the danger.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.120
So that's the red flag to look for.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.280
Speaking of red flags,

27:23.280 --> 27:26.040
we have to go get our kids from daycare.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.120
So let's go run, run, run, get that.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.200
And I will start dinner.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.480
I love you so much, Malcolm.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.440
I'll see you soon.
