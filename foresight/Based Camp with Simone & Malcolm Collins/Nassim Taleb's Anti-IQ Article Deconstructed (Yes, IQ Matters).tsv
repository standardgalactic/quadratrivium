0	1460	When you look at our prison system,
1460	4620	the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.
4620	8500	And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage
8500	9380	when compared to you,
9380	11620	when you tell people to throw that out,
11620	13500	that what?
13500	16380	You are taking the most vulnerable people in our society
16380	18540	who are in a situation to do something
18540	22980	they had no control over and completely acting
22980	25380	like they had the same advantage as you did in life.
25380	26600	It is sick.
26600	27700	It is sick.
27700	29140	It is not moral.
29220	31300	And you need to get your fucking shit together
31300	33060	and actually look at the data
33060	35580	instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.
35580	37860	So you can play your little virtue game, okay?
37860	41660	Because people are suffering for your bullshit.
41660	43540	And so you can feel like a hero
43540	47940	without having to challenge actual real world problems
47940	51100	and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages
51100	53180	that you were born with, which other people worked.
53180	55740	He ends up making an argument that needs to say
55740	57020	that he has achieved everything
57020	58580	that he has achieved in life
58580	60020	without systemic advantages.
60020	65020	And he has just willed himself to this place that he is.
65220	68740	Simultaneously while flaunting that systemic advantage
68740	71460	right in every sense, like to a fault,
71460	73260	like to a point of illegibility.
74900	76340	Would you like to know more?
76340	80740	So Malcolm, what if I told you that obviously
80740	82700	wealth doesn't predict success
82700	85340	because there are tons of millionaires and billionaires
85340	86900	who just do nothing with their lives
86900	88780	and piss away all their money.
88780	91540	And obviously being like super, super poor,
91540	93460	like under the poverty line is a problem.
93460	95420	But above a certain level,
95420	98540	it really doesn't matter about how much money you have.
98540	100660	Oh, I think that would make a lot of sense.
100660	102380	I think that's exactly the type of thing
102380	103900	a wealthy person would argue.
103900	105300	Right, though.
105300	108060	So I got to talk about how we got on this topic.
108060	110700	We had a fan of the show stay over at our house
110700	112380	because they happened to be passing through the area.
112380	113620	And one of the things that they mentioned
113620	115220	because they were like, well, this is an area
115220	118140	where I question something that you guys talk about a lot.
118140	121980	Specifically, he believed that IQ didn't matter at all.
121980	123500	And the reason he believes this
123500	126700	is because another smart person who he looked up to
126700	129500	had argued this very passionately,
129500	131900	specifically Naseem Taleb.
132940	134940	He wrote this medium post about this
134940	138900	called IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle.
138900	140820	And I read this medium post
140820	145380	and I saw it as a really interesting opportunity
145380	150380	because self-contained within the post itself
150580	154300	was the proof that he was manipulating data
154300	156780	and essentially lying to the reader.
156780	161780	But what we want to try to do on this episode
161940	166700	is to not just show that, yes, IQ likely does matter,
166700	170300	but give you the tools necessary to,
170300	174660	even if you don't understand the scientific language
174660	176460	was which a person is arguing,
176460	179080	i.e. in this case advanced statistics,
179080	180980	even if you don't understand that,
180980	185980	understand the telltale signs that a person is lying to you
186540	188940	and be able to tell that they are lying to you
188940	191100	even if you don't understand what they are saying.
191100	196100	And better than all of that, get to deeper truths
196260	199500	than you even could from reading an article
199500	203060	from the perspective of somebody who agreed
203060	205380	with what he is true or what you already believe.
205380	208860	And by that, what I mean is if somebody
208860	212260	who really believes in career is invested in IQ mattering,
212260	214220	writes an article that IQ matters,
214220	215780	well, they can't really trust it
215780	218180	even cause they might be lying with statistics as well.
218180	220780	If somebody who deeply believes IQ doesn't matter
220780	222740	or at least tries to argue that
222740	224900	has sprinkled throughout his article
224900	227820	little admissions to where IQ does matter,
227820	229580	you can know that at least in those areas
229580	233020	it definitely matters because he has everything at stake
233020	234380	in showing that it doesn't.
234380	236980	So that's why learning to read articles
236980	238580	in this way is really important.
238580	240260	Now, before we go further with this,
240260	242500	I wanna elaborate on the analogy
242500	244260	that Simone started the show is
244260	246660	because I think this is where we're going as a society.
246660	248780	And a lot of these people today
248780	252100	who were born with advantages over people,
252100	255580	born with usually really high IQs,
255580	257620	and then they pretend like they've achieved
257620	260420	everything that they've achieved on their own,
260420	262940	it is not the look that they think it is.
262940	266380	It's very much the new, I don't see race.
266380	269100	Pretending you don't see a systemic advantage
269100	272260	that you have had over other people your entire life
272260	273340	and taking credit being like,
273340	276220	well, I was starting from the same position they were
276220	278740	is not humble, okay?
278740	283740	It is dehumanizing and it is cruel and evil
284060	286340	and it prevents us as a society
286340	289180	from potentially solving systemic issues
289180	293140	for people who weren't born with your immense privilege.
293140	296460	I say this to Nassid because he is somebody
296460	297820	who was born with this immense privilege.
297820	300780	Yeah, he's clearly someone who is very smart
300780	302300	and who benefits from a high IQ.
302300	306060	And if he were to in good faith take an IQ test,
306060	308740	he would probably end up with a very high IQ score.
308740	310140	Like it's pretty apparent.
310140	313140	I wanna start off too with some caveats that like,
313140	315820	you know, a lot of what he says is we agree with,
315820	318180	you know, IQ, like if you have a really high IQ,
318180	320180	it doesn't mean you're gonna be super successful,
320180	322380	obviously not, you know, this is why with our school
322380	324740	we select for I will as we say and not IQ
324740	326020	because, you know, being really smart
326020	328140	does not predict success, but he claims
328140	331380	that's what like IQ enthusiasts also claim,
331380	333100	which is not, it's just not true.
333100	334420	So he makes a lot of false claims on that.
334420	335900	I just wanna say that we agree.
335900	338540	He also says a really key thing with IQ is like it,
338540	341260	where it is most predictive and where it is the biggest deal
341260	344180	is where there's really low IQ, but he seems to like,
344180	345620	I don't know, just discount that.
345620	347260	That's not important when actually like,
347260	348300	it's been a really big deal.
348300	350220	This is why lead remediation, you know,
350220	352100	like reducing lead exposure for populations
352100	353700	has been such a big deal.
353700	354540	He also-
354540	358060	Which was caught and measured through IQ.
358060	360580	This is the place where IQ in public policy
360580	363180	has had a positive impact on the lives
363180	365460	of pretty much everyone living on earth today.
365460	367020	Yeah, because people were willing to admit that,
367020	368860	you know, the low IQ is a problem.
368860	371380	And then also he talks about, you know,
371380	374900	people misusing IQ often in very unsavory, disgusting ways.
374900	376700	You know, he points to racism a lot.
376700	377940	That's totally true.
377940	381540	But all sorts of messed up people use like misuse,
381540	383580	all sorts of science and pseudoscience
383580	386460	and other nonsense to forward their agendas.
386460	389820	Just because you see one idiot use something in a poor way,
389820	391340	doesn't mean it's not, you know,
391340	393900	it's not a relevant field in other ways.
393900	394740	So-
394740	396020	Before we go further with this,
396020	400780	I think we can break this down into a few core points
400780	402420	when you're analyzing an article like this.
402420	403260	Okay, okay.
403260	404460	Yeah, let's do it.
404460	408380	So one is you're looking for what the motivation is.
408380	412340	Then you want to look at the data sets that they present.
412340	417020	You want to look at what they think the alternatives are
417020	417860	that they're presenting.
417860	420900	If IQ doesn't matter, what are the alternatives?
420900	423180	You need to look at where they concede
423180	425660	that the other side has points.
425660	430300	And you need to look at what I call repeated hand flails.
430300	434740	A repeated hand flail is a really bad argument
434740	436980	that is used repeatedly
436980	439060	and that is obviously a bad argument,
439060	442260	but that at first glance can seem
442260	444500	like it's a really powerful argument.
444500	447020	So I'll start with a repeated hand flail
447020	448860	that he uses throughout the piece.
448860	451500	Because it's really obvious and it really got on my nerves.
451500	454540	Which was IQ doesn't matter
454540	456580	because the same individual,
456580	458420	if you test them again with an IQ test,
458420	460020	on average that test is going to differ
460020	463740	from their first score by about a third of standard deviation.
463740	465260	And that's a big difference.
465260	468220	And therefore that proves that IQ tests don't matter.
468220	470700	Now, I ask a person to just,
470700	472980	and this is how when you're hearing something like this
472980	475380	and you're like, okay, he's using a lot of words
475380	477060	like the standard deviation
477060	480540	and comparing this to different parts of the IQ stuff.
480540	481580	Ignore all of that.
481580	483660	Just use your common sense, okay?
483660	485900	So replace IQ test with a different test.
485900	487460	Like a biology test, right?
487460	491420	Like I'm taking a 10th grade biology test
491420	493700	and I am comparing my knowledge of biology
493700	496460	to the other students in the room's knowledge of biology.
496460	498100	Now, if I retake that test,
498100	500500	if you retake any test about,
500500	504140	you are going to differentiate from your previous results
504140	505980	by about a third of a standard deviation.
505980	508140	If it's like a really big test.
508140	508980	That's just normal.
508980	509820	Anyone should know,
509820	511180	you're not gonna get the same results
511180	513260	like every time you retake a test.
513260	515700	That's a normal function of tests.
515700	517740	However, that being the case,
517740	519980	that doesn't mean that biology test
519980	521660	isn't measuring anything
521660	523780	in terms of a student's knowledge of biology.
523780	524860	Interesting biology.
525860	527100	And so this is the first thing.
527100	528740	When they are criticizing something,
528740	531500	like if they're continually using an argument, think,
531500	533220	okay, but is there something else
533220	534660	that we all generally agree on?
534660	536620	That the bar is a good way
536620	538820	to measure how good a lawyer is doing
538820	541940	or that driver's exams are a good way to measure,
541940	544100	do these have different results
544100	546220	when a single individual retakes the test?
546220	548180	And the answer is yes.
548180	550100	Well, then why does he keep bringing this up?
550100	551100	Why is it so important?
551100	552540	It is because, well,
552540	554740	it's just a weird rhetorical tactic
554740	556020	he keeps going back to.
556020	558540	Yeah, I think connected to this kind of
558540	559980	is at the very beginning,
559980	562100	and this was like a big trigger for me.
562100	564980	He says technical backbone,
564980	567020	like he links to a technical backbone
567020	568780	as here's just like at the top of his article,
568780	571740	here's my link to basically what he implies is,
571740	573900	oh, if you really wanna understand why I'm correct
573900	575660	and you wanna see it on a technical standpoint,
575660	577580	an academic peer reviewed standpoint,
577580	579100	this will explain everything.
579100	583060	And you click over to it and it's just a research journal
583060	585020	article pointing to examples
585020	588340	of people mistaking correlation with causation.
588340	590780	It isn't actually related to the arguments
590780	593300	he makes in his blog post.
593300	594740	And it's one of those things that really bothers me
594740	597260	because often people will link to something
597260	599700	and be like, oh, here's what backs up my argument.
599700	603220	And it, I mean, usually it's at least broadly related
603220	604060	to their argument.
604060	605660	This even wasn't really related to his argument.
605660	606780	He sometimes argued that, oh,
606780	608980	people don't understand correlation and causation.
608980	610580	But yeah, that really bothered me.
610580	612380	People are like, read this other thing.
612380	614300	You mentioned that I would note as well,
614300	616140	should be a big red flag with people.
616140	618460	Smart people can write in a way
618460	620660	that dumb people can understand.
620660	621540	Yes.
621540	624700	When we were right, people like who watch our channel
624700	628700	and stuff like that, they sometimes accuse us of talking,
628700	631020	like we have a theothorus in front of us.
631020	631860	Okay, whatever.
631900	632940	I don't think that we do that.
632940	634340	To me, I talk really plain
634340	636820	and that reminds me of that scene in Idiocracy
636820	637980	where they're like,
637980	641100	I think it might be because of these drugs the army put me on.
641100	643500	But if you could just get me well enough
643500	644660	to get back to base.
644660	645740	Right.
646740	648180	Kick ass.
648180	650540	Well, don't want to sound like a dick or nothing,
650540	654260	but it says on your chart that you're fucked up.
654260	657420	You talk like a fag and your shit's all retarded.
657420	660860	What I do is just saying thing.
660860	663100	Yeah, you know what I mean?
663100	667100	Like, no, I'm serious here.
667940	668980	I need help.
668980	670820	There's that fag talk we talked about.
670820	672900	But yeah, and there's that scene
672900	674660	where he's just trying to talk a normal
674660	677100	and the other person just from a different cultural group
677100	680220	here that is intentionally training to sound erudite.
680220	683580	Well, but he does really gatekeep throughout this essay.
683580	685260	For example, like in one sentence,
685260	686940	well, however, if you take up a perian,
686940	689500	havenky and view of intelligence in another sentence,
689500	692220	he's IQ doesn't detect convexity of mistakes.
692220	693980	Like, what?
693980	697220	So with the point being here is what I was saying,
697220	700620	is that for us, when we use words that sound,
700620	702380	I don't know, it's a somebody different from us
702380	704020	that we're using as the source or something,
704020	706700	they are still intelligible in context.
706700	710780	They are not intentionally meant to get a viewer
710780	714020	to disengage or sort of shut down
714020	715300	and just listen to the other one.
715300	717140	And be like, oh, I guess I'll have to take your word for it
717140	718380	because I don't understand this
718380	719900	and therefore you must be smarter than me.
719900	721580	So I'm just gonna assume that you're right.
721580	722420	Yeah.
722420	725780	And I would say that if you notice that happening in a piece
725780	727580	and never ever take away from that,
727580	729380	this person knows what they're talking about.
729380	731820	Yeah, but can you believe he's like literally
731820	736820	in an article that he's using to disprove IQ as like a thing,
736980	741540	he's using IQ correlated vocabulary nonsense.
741540	742900	Using SAT words.
742900	745340	Yeah, I'm like, the fuck, you know, he talks always,
745340	747380	he's like, you know, this isn't Gaussian.
747380	748700	And okay, you know what, honestly,
748700	750580	like I've been out of academia long enough
750580	752700	to have forgotten that Gaussian was in reference
752700	754060	to a normal distribution.
754060	755660	He could have just said normal distribution.
755660	757860	This man who apparently throughout his writing
757860	759900	makes it very clear that he really hates academia
759900	762260	uses a lot of academic speech,
762260	763860	which is also really interesting.
763860	765660	The techniques and I love the first point you mentioned,
765660	766660	which is a huge red flag.
766660	768740	If somebody says, here's a source
768740	770140	and the source has nothing to do
770140	771740	is what they're talking about really
771740	773900	or is really just meant to shit on academics.
773900	775500	That's all it was trying to do.
775500	777940	And he doesn't say that's what this is.
777940	782460	You need to be aware that at the very outside of this piece,
782460	784340	he's saying, I am willing to mislead you
784340	786060	to try to make my point.
786060	787340	That is what is being signaled here.
787340	789620	But first we gotta go back to this framework I set up.
789620	792100	Okay, so what is his motivation with this piece?
792100	793860	Because he cites his motivation
793860	796900	throughout the piece very plainly.
796900	800060	He cites very clearly that he believes
800060	805060	that if IQ is a real thing, then the racists are correct.
805300	809180	And racists will be able to implement racist policy,
809180	811420	which will hurt people if IQ is a real.
811420	813060	This is like second paragraph.
813060	815180	People bent on showing that some populations
815180	816940	have inferior mental abilities
816940	819220	based on IQ equals intelligence.
819220	821420	Those have been upset with me for robbing them
821420	823420	of this quote unquote scientific tool.
823420	825700	His goal right here, he lays it out.
825700	830180	Second paragraph, I am trying to rob racist of a tool.
830180	832300	Now see the way I read that section
832300	833980	is he gives a bulleted list
833980	836860	and he's like basically IQ was something championed by,
836860	838780	first he says racist and eugenicists,
838780	841380	and second he says psychometrics peddlers
841380	842380	looking for suckers.
842380	843820	And I thought what he was trying to do there
843820	846740	was basically associate this domain
846740	850260	with unsavory people and exploitative people.
850260	852740	I think he also uses the association to discredit
852740	856100	anyone who talks about IQ, but just saying they're racists.
856100	857740	Okay, so he's using it for two reasons.
857740	860420	But it is very clear from the piece
860420	863820	that he believes that if IQ is a real thing,
863820	865580	then the racists are right.
865580	868580	I get in the outro, the argument that quote unquote,
868580	870020	some races are better at running,
870020	872300	hence inference about the brain is stale,
872300	873540	mental capacity is much more,
873540	875140	he goes over this over and over.
875140	875980	It is very clear.
875980	880100	So he's implying that all races are equally good at running?
881100	884620	No, he's implying that doesn't mean that there would be,
884620	885820	okay, listen to this point.
885820	887500	This is actually a really good point
887500	889340	of somebody messing with you.
889340	890860	The argument that quote,
890860	892700	some races are better at running,
892700	896660	end quote, hence some inference about the brain is stale,
896660	898860	mental capacity is much more dimensional
898860	900580	and not defined in the same way,
900580	902260	running a hundred meter dashes.
903620	904940	What?
904940	907380	So what he's saying is that because this is a more
907380	909220	complicated thing to measure,
909220	912140	that it axiomatically doesn't vary
912140	913900	between different ethnic groups.
913900	915340	Oh, okay, right, right, right.
915340	916940	Because intelligence is harder to measure
916940	919580	and like nail down in this glommy weird thing.
919580	920940	It's just a hand wave.
920940	922660	Now there are reasons why,
922660	925180	and we have done videos on this,
925180	928180	why if you can measure anything in a group,
928180	929180	measure anything in a group.
929180	930780	And it's clear that he believes this
930780	933860	and this is why he is so sold on this point.
933860	937100	You can measure anything in a group like tennis ability.
937100	940580	You are going to find systemic differences between groups.
940580	942260	That's just natural.
942260	947260	The reason why IQ based race realism is irrelevant,
947420	948980	and we've done this before,
948980	952780	is because it changes so quickly in your generation.
952780	954180	If you look, like we were looking,
954180	956740	okay, we had 50 embryos, like just our family.
956740	958980	And we choose five embryos out of those 50
958980	962660	based on IQ, pure generation with existing technology.
962660	965060	And our kids only marry other families who did that.
965060	967060	Within just five generations,
967060	970380	the average member of our family would be three standard
970380	972300	deviations higher in IQ
972300	974300	than the average American citizen today.
974300	976420	And keep in mind that within the next 75 years,
976420	978020	we're likely looking at IQ dropping
978020	979060	by a standard deviation.
979060	982340	So for like just astronomically higher.
982340	985300	And what this shows is that it doesn't matter.
985300	987180	This would be true if we were black.
987180	989060	This would be true if we were Asian.
989980	992580	IQ doesn't matter not because it doesn't differ
992580	993540	between groups.
993540	994820	Everything, if you measure it,
994820	995740	if you can put a number to it,
995740	997060	it's going to differ between groups.
997060	998900	But any selective or evolutionary bottle,
998900	999980	like you're trying to say.
999980	1003060	It matters because it doesn't persistently differ between.
1003060	1004860	And it can quickly change.
1004860	1007620	And it matters a lot more what like family you come from
1007620	1008980	or what religion you come from.
1008980	1010220	Yeah, or what environment you're in
1010220	1011700	with the selective pressures are.
1011700	1012540	What small, yeah.
1012540	1014740	So that's why it doesn't matter.
1014740	1016780	But he hasn't thought of that argument.
1016780	1019380	And so he is just completely dedicated
1019380	1022020	because he knows the moment you could put,
1022020	1025580	and this becomes very clear later in his argumentation,
1025580	1029900	the moment you could put a number on general competence
1029900	1032900	that there would be differences between ethnic groups.
1032900	1035100	Because of course, I mean, they might be minor differences,
1035100	1037540	but people would still pick up on that.
1037540	1039780	And then that motivates racism.
1039780	1042780	And you can actually tell this is his core motivation
1042780	1044780	by, again, I say, what is he proposing
1044780	1046900	as the alternative to IQ, right?
1046900	1051500	So if he was being, I think, genuine,
1051500	1053300	I just think IQ tests are bad
1053300	1055420	and we could be measuring this better,
1055420	1057740	you would be proposing a way to measure it better.
1057740	1059340	But he doesn't propose a way to measure it better.
1059340	1060180	Yeah, that's true.
1060180	1061420	And we would respect that.
1061420	1063060	I mean, I think we inherently under,
1063060	1067020	we would agree with him that current measures of IQ,
1067220	1068740	they could definitely approve.
1068740	1071020	But let's, I want to read this.
1071020	1073700	If you want to detect how someone fares at a task,
1073700	1075820	say, loan sharking, tennis playing,
1075820	1079260	or a random matrix theory, make him or her do that task.
1079260	1082020	We don't need theoretical exams for real world function
1082020	1084940	by probability challenge psychologists.
1084940	1087060	So think about what this is saying
1087060	1089460	and how completely insane this is.
1089460	1091740	He is actually saying that I am unwilling
1091740	1093500	to have any sort of broad measure
1093500	1095100	of competence put on a person.
1095100	1097300	And the reason he has to take this position
1097300	1099940	is because whatever measure of competence he found,
1099940	1102580	you would find differences in it between groups.
1102580	1106300	So he needs there to be no standard measure of competence
1106300	1109460	given his world framing that he has laid out.
1109460	1111740	If you can put a measure on people's competence,
1111740	1113380	then it will differ between groups
1113380	1116460	that it can be used by racists to promote their agenda.
1116460	1118140	That is a core thing.
1118140	1120780	So going into this piece,
1120780	1124820	he's going into it with the world perspective
1124860	1127580	that if you could put any sort of broad measure
1127580	1131220	of competence on a group, that it will lead to racism.
1131220	1132940	And so we should not have that.
1132940	1135940	But think about how insane that would be for a society.
1135940	1138340	That would also mean, well, you can't have SATs.
1138340	1142340	You can't really have any sort of a broadly applicable test.
1142340	1144540	Every test that needs to only study
1144540	1146140	what a person is about to do.
1146140	1148100	But the problem is that we hire people
1148100	1150300	and we accept people into college.
1150300	1151700	Based on totally unrelated.
1151700	1154100	To do broad ranges of tasks.
1154100	1155860	One of the core places like he was using
1155860	1160700	as he mentioned in the piece, is in the military.
1160700	1163220	And that's because you need a broad spectrum of knowledge.
1163220	1164260	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1164260	1166260	Well, it doesn't seem to be predictive of outcome.
1166260	1169060	And again, we want to emphasize here that we're not,
1169060	1172020	we don't disagree with the basic argument he's making.
1172020	1174340	The school that we're designing,
1174340	1177420	whenever possible, tests people through natural assessments.
1177420	1180260	Hey, can you write content that audience,
1180260	1181660	like widespread audiences?
1181660	1183340	Okay, well, let's see if you can write a fan fiction
1183340	1184180	that a lot of people read.
1184180	1185900	Like we believe in natural assessments
1185900	1187380	and we believe that's the best way to tell
1187380	1188820	if someone's good at something,
1188820	1190980	but we also are practical.
1190980	1193500	Yeah, well, I think also at the same time,
1193500	1196940	we accept that some people are born
1196940	1199140	with an intellectual state that gives them
1199140	1202900	a huge systemic advantage over other people.
1202900	1204420	And this, again, it's not an ethic thing.
1204420	1205940	As we said, it changes so quickly
1205940	1208540	and it's irrelevant to tie this to ethnic groups.
1208540	1211940	But, and again, in most of these gene people,
1211940	1213820	you go to these genetics channels, right?
1213820	1214980	And they'll tell you on these channels,
1214980	1216780	yeah, it looks like in the developed world
1216780	1219820	in the next 75 years, IQ in the developed world
1219820	1222020	is going to drop by about one standard deviation.
1222020	1224180	And then they're also like complaining.
1224180	1226300	It's also, so the developed world is mostly white people.
1226300	1227860	That means white people on average
1227860	1228980	will be dumber than everyone else
1228980	1230300	because we're not seeing this effect
1230300	1231500	in the developing world.
1231500	1234060	So it's one of these things we're still play that game.
1234060	1235100	It's not, it's not.
1235100	1237300	If we were going to go back to the wealth analogy,
1237300	1239340	obviously like first, and we also agree,
1239340	1241620	having a super high IQ doesn't mean obviously
1241620	1242700	you're going to be super successful.
1242700	1244300	There are lots of people with crazy high IQs
1244300	1245340	who do absolutely nothing,
1245340	1247140	who do a lot of really dumb stuff.
1247140	1249940	However, when you have a really high IQ
1249940	1251620	and you also have a bunch of other factors,
1251620	1255140	like drive, ambition, values, a vision for something,
1255140	1257700	you are going to have a much easier time achieving things.
1257700	1259380	And it's just, it's similar to having a lot of wealth.
1259380	1260860	There are tons of billionaires and millionaires
1260860	1262540	who genuinely don't do anything very interesting.
1262540	1264580	Ignoring your privilege is not a virtue.
1264580	1265420	Yeah.
1265420	1267220	So I got to continue with the piece of them.
1267220	1270180	So the, so what you see here, first of all,
1270180	1273900	is that the solution he's arguing is impractical
1273900	1277740	and specifically caters to the reason he wrote the piece.
1277740	1281060	Now, another thing to note is you need to go through
1281060	1283780	and see, okay, where does he concede
1283780	1286140	that the other side makes a good point?
1286140	1287140	Never, never.
1287140	1287980	No, he does.
1287980	1288820	Oh, no, he does.
1288820	1291100	I guess when he says that basically like super low IQ
1291100	1292460	does have an impact, right?
1292460	1293300	He does admit that.
1293300	1294140	No, but he says something
1294140	1296180	that absolutely destroys the entire piece.
1296180	1297740	Really? I missed that.
1297740	1298940	Yes, I will read it
1298940	1301220	because he says it so dismissively
1301220	1303220	that you could miss what he's saying.
1303220	1304140	Okay.
1304140	1304980	Okay.
1306500	1309340	The best measure, charlatans.
1309340	1311700	IQ is reminiscent of risk charlatans
1311700	1314900	insisting on selling value at risk var
1314900	1318380	and risk metrics saying it's the best measure
1318380	1321900	that best measure being unreliable
1321900	1323500	blew them up many times.
1323500	1327160	Note the class of suckers for whom a bad measure
1327160	1329720	is better than no measure across domains.
1329720	1331040	Now, Simone, you just heard that
1331040	1332720	and you probably heard nothing
1332720	1334160	because when it was written poorly,
1334160	1335160	it was structured poorly.
1335160	1337000	It didn't really get across this point,
1337000	1338920	but it did make a concession.
1338920	1339760	Okay.
1339760	1341280	A very important concession
1341280	1345000	that IQ actually is the single best measure
1345000	1349440	that we have access to for adult success.
1349440	1351400	He conceded it's the best measure.
1351400	1354120	He just thinks even being the best measure,
1354120	1355560	it is not a good enough measure.
1355560	1356720	Because it isn't perfect.
1356720	1357880	Because it's imperfect.
1357880	1359720	And therefore we shouldn't use it at all.
1359720	1361840	But the fact that he has now conceded
1361840	1365000	that out of all conceivable measures ever developed,
1365000	1367080	it is the best one.
1367080	1369200	That kind of sinks everything else
1369200	1370680	that he's talking about.
1370680	1373080	Because what that means is that when you're dealing
1373080	1375400	with broad base science,
1375400	1377640	which regularly needs to use something like this,
1377640	1380200	like land in the water hurting a population,
1380200	1382800	or is this academic solution working or not working?
1382800	1384440	Or is IQ declining in a population?
1384440	1386600	Or is IQ increasing in a population?
1386600	1387560	In another part here,
1387560	1391120	he mentions the Flynn effect should warn us,
1391120	1393840	not just that IQ is somewhat environmentally dependent,
1393840	1396680	but that it is at least partially circular.
1396680	1400920	So he's saying he concedes when IQ measures
1400920	1402880	support his belief system.
1402880	1403880	Then they're real.
1403880	1404960	Then they're real.
1404960	1408640	Which is that IQ is nutritionally based to some extent
1408640	1410240	is shown by the Flynn effect.
1410240	1411280	And I had the reverse final thing,
1411280	1414240	but the Flynn effect means that the Flynn effect is real.
1414520	1418640	So he's willing to use it when it supports his worldview
1418640	1420480	and he distances himself from it
1420480	1421920	when it goes against his worldview.
1421920	1422880	Oh dear.
1422880	1425200	And then the final thing that I would say is,
1425200	1428120	and he fortunately does this for you, the reader,
1428120	1431320	is look at the actual data points the person is using.
1431320	1433760	He will put up data points and be like,
1433760	1436280	oh, look, the data points are all over the place.
1436280	1439400	And I'm gonna put them on the screen for the viewers here.
1439400	1442200	But if you actually look at these data points,
1442240	1444320	you could eyeball what it would look like
1444320	1446760	if you drew a line through this scatter plot.
1446760	1449000	It would look like a line going up into the right.
1449000	1452280	I know, but he seems to not understand,
1452280	1454240	I don't know, linear regression.
1454240	1458320	No, so he believes that because there is high variability
1458320	1461360	and keep in mind high variability once a person is rich.
1461360	1463080	So basically he concedes two things.
1463080	1466120	He concedes that low IQ matters and that IQ
1466120	1470080	is really highly determinant of how much money you make
1470080	1472120	under a certain amount of money.
1472200	1475880	However, anyone who even does believe in IQ,
1475880	1477200	like us would largely say, yeah,
1477200	1479840	but people who are earning like over a hundred K a year,
1479840	1483240	the amount that they earn is largely just luck-based.
1483240	1484680	It's not based on competence.
1484680	1486000	Anyone would tell you that.
1486000	1488080	But most people are earning under that amount.
1488080	1490280	And that is why we focus on things like IQ
1490280	1492360	because that's where it is determinant.
1492360	1496120	So, hold on, but this is just like more broadly.
1496120	1498340	The real key thing was a piece like this,
1498340	1499800	when you're going through it,
1499840	1502720	is to look for what they are conceding
1502720	1504320	because that can tell you the few things
1504320	1506320	that are really strongly true.
1506320	1509320	The points he concedes is that IQ is the best measure
1509320	1511040	we have available to us right now
1511040	1513560	of correlating with adult success.
1513560	1516280	He does concede that it works really well
1516280	1518400	for low paying jobs and that low IQ
1518400	1520280	does really seem to hurt people.
1520280	1522920	He does concede that it works really well
1522920	1524400	for things like the military.
1524400	1529360	He does concede that, so across all of these areas,
1529400	1531960	I think what you can see is that,
1531960	1534640	yeah, IQ probably is a really useful measure.
1534640	1536440	And all of this comes back to-
1536440	1538880	But you forgot, he also makes this argument
1538880	1540920	that it's immoral.
1540920	1542800	He cleans the concept as immoral.
1542800	1544520	He uses that word.
1544520	1545920	The concept of IQ is immoral.
1545920	1547160	And again, this comes to,
1547160	1550360	now this comes looking outside of a piece, right?
1550360	1553880	So, before I was like, okay, don't look outside the piece,
1553880	1555320	but you can just sanity test it.
1555320	1559120	Be like, okay, well, if IQ is a bad measure
1559120	1561560	of competence, right?
1561560	1563040	Does it correlate?
1563040	1564640	What other things do I correlate
1564640	1565720	with competence as an individual?
1565720	1567120	Or do the person think broadly,
1567120	1569160	I guess if I was trying to determine
1569160	1571240	how good a group would be at, say,
1571240	1572360	graduating from college,
1572360	1575920	because adults have a very big financial incentive
1575920	1577320	to be able to determine that.
1577320	1578680	Well, they don't use IQ tests.
1578680	1579520	What are they using?
1579520	1580480	They're using SMH to Google.
1580480	1583320	What's the correlation between IQ tests and SAQ?
1583320	1588320	0.84, like really high, like very high correlation.
1588560	1590840	And so this is the problem.
1590840	1593160	All sort of tests of intelligence,
1593160	1596040	because intelligence is cross-correlated across domains,
1596040	1597880	are going to correlate with each other.
1597880	1599280	If I was looking at a school,
1599280	1601080	and I was looking at people who were scoring well
1601080	1604880	on biology tests, I could broadly guess and bet
1604880	1607200	pretty effectively that they would also score better
1607200	1610720	than other students on history tests or on mass tests.
1610720	1612880	And this is why when you're looking at things like IQ,
1612880	1613880	but then what's interesting,
1613880	1615200	and a lot of people might not know this,
1615200	1617400	is that then you expand this to other domains.
1617440	1619080	You look at the probability of raping someone.
1619080	1620200	It's also a lot lower.
1620200	1621880	You look at their probability of being in jail.
1621880	1623000	It's also a lot lower.
1623000	1624520	You look at their probability of murdering someone.
1624520	1625480	It's also a lot lower.
1625480	1627280	You look at their probability of getting in a car accident.
1627280	1628520	It's also a lot lower.
1628520	1630360	Generally, within any of these things,
1630360	1632080	it's almost, I'm not gonna say it's irrelevant
1632080	1632920	what you're measuring,
1632920	1634920	because some are better measures than others,
1634920	1637600	but you're clearly measuring something
1637600	1639480	if it's cross-correlated against
1639480	1641360	all of these different domains.
1641360	1644360	And so I think a lot of people will try to like blow smoke
1644360	1645200	in your face,
1645200	1648000	and it's really good to be able to recognize
1648000	1649680	when they're doing that.
1649680	1652520	And for them, like I even think from his perspective,
1652520	1654480	ideologically, what's at stake for him?
1654480	1657280	One, he thinks if IQ can be proven to be real,
1657280	1659640	that means that racism is right, which it doesn't.
1659640	1662840	As we have copiously pointed out on this show,
1662840	1664640	it is not intergenerationally,
1664640	1667880	durably tied to an ethnic group enough to matter.
1667880	1670080	But anything that you can measure and put a number to
1670080	1673280	is obviously going to differ between population groups.
1673280	1676240	Duh, but that doesn't mean like one is better
1676240	1677360	or something like that.
1677360	1680000	It would, I guess, if it didn't change in between generations,
1680000	1682320	but it changes so, so, so quickly.
1682320	1687000	And then the second is that he ends up making an argument
1687000	1689280	that needs to say that he has achieved everything
1689280	1690840	that he has achieved in life
1690840	1692400	without systemic advantages.
1693400	1697480	He has just willed himself to this place that he is.
1697480	1701000	Simultaneously, while flaunting that systemic advantage.
1701840	1703720	In every sense, like to a fault,
1703720	1705520	like to a point of illegibility.
1707200	1708800	Yeah, and if you look at people like Simone and I,
1708800	1711400	I will admit that I, well, actually I don't think
1711400	1712240	I have a high IQ.
1712240	1713480	Well, I do have a high IQ.
1713480	1715040	I do have a high IQ when it's measured.
1715040	1717960	What I mean is that Simone might not mention this,
1717960	1719680	but she's in the top fraction of a percent.
1719680	1722120	She was measured recently for the autism exam,
1722120	1724640	but hold on Simone, I won't brag on you.
1724640	1728640	So what we do need to know is that the way that my brain
1728680	1731520	works when it comes to things is different enough
1731520	1733640	that it's not just like being smart.
1733640	1735480	Like typically when I start something,
1735480	1737160	I'm really bad at it.
1737160	1738320	Like when I started high school,
1738320	1740800	I was in the top, you know, half of my class.
1740800	1742880	I know I graduated obviously really near the top,
1742880	1744520	but I started bottom half.
1744520	1747280	When I went to SAT prep, I remember I almost got laughed
1747280	1748520	out of the room because I said I wanted to go
1748520	1749720	to Harvard or Stanford,
1749720	1751520	which obviously I did end up going to for MBA,
1751520	1752840	but they were like,
1752840	1754880	but you are the single lowest scores
1754880	1756480	in the entire prep class.
1756480	1757800	What are you talking about?
1757800	1759960	So I'm one of these people who always starts
1759960	1762440	like really lower than other people.
1762440	1764720	And then somehow ends up,
1764720	1766840	if I'm just persistent at something,
1766840	1768840	really sort of figuring out and getting it to click
1768840	1769680	at the end of the day.
1769680	1770640	But I think it might just be
1770640	1772360	because I see things differently,
1772360	1773840	but this seeing things differently
1773840	1775440	has to have some genetic component.
1775440	1778000	The advantages I have over other people,
1778000	1781440	I should never deny them
1781440	1784880	because that removes my ability to empathize
1784880	1786520	with an individual who tells me,
1786600	1787800	you don't understand.
1787800	1789320	I can't just do this thing
1789320	1790840	that you went out there and did.
1790840	1791680	Well, I wonder,
1791680	1794840	so one argument that Naseem Tileb makes also in his essay,
1794840	1796480	which we haven't, I think touched on a whole lot,
1796480	1799560	is like, you know, only pencil,
1799560	1801440	like paper pusher academic types
1801440	1804440	who to play with bureaucracy in follow direction
1804440	1806280	perform well on IQ tests.
1806280	1807560	And I mean, to your point, right?
1807560	1810960	You as actually a very anti-authoritarian anti-bureaucracy,
1810960	1813240	I'm not gonna fucking listen to you kind of person,
1813240	1815600	do really suck at a lot of IQ,
1815720	1818480	correlated whatever tests in the beginning,
1818480	1821160	but you also have the good sense and tenacity
1821160	1822320	to learn the system.
1822320	1823760	And I think a lot of what these tests
1823760	1826280	may also be measuring is people's willingness
1826280	1829200	to work with the system to their personal advantage.
1829200	1831280	And a lack of willingness to work with that system,
1831280	1833800	a lack of willingness to adapt and read directions
1833800	1836240	and listen is, you know,
1836240	1839120	regardless, they might not be measuring intelligence,
1839120	1840080	but it's measuring-
1840080	1841760	It's measuring willingness to learn
1841760	1844200	how to do what you need to do to get ahead in life.
1844200	1846640	And let's keep in mind what IQ is really measuring
1846640	1847680	because I think a lot of people miss this.
1847680	1851160	It is not, we use it as a quote unquote intelligence measure,
1851160	1853240	but it's really, it's claimed to fame
1853240	1855480	is that it has the highest corollatory factor
1855480	1858960	with life outcomes and that like economic outcomes mostly,
1858960	1859960	but other life outcomes.
1859960	1861200	And that's what we're looking at.
1861200	1863360	That's why we care about it as a statistic.
1863360	1865800	And I would say life outcomes were intelligence matters.
1865800	1867520	I would argue that the amount that you make
1867520	1870400	over 100K a year, your intelligence doesn't matter.
1870400	1871920	You're mostly dealing with luck at that point.
1871920	1873480	And so it does not surprise me at all
1873480	1875400	that it wouldn't be correlated at that point.
1875400	1877920	But in his world of, I guess, ultra smarty pants
1877920	1880160	who have made billions of dollars a year,
1880160	1882680	like that's where he's applying it
1882680	1884840	instead of at population levels.
1884840	1887560	Yeah, I think a lot of people like him,
1887560	1890600	people like him, I don't know if they, for years,
1890600	1892960	have even come into contact with people
1892960	1896440	who have an IQ like below 110, they just don't.
1896440	1899000	So I think it's also hard for them to even understand
1899000	1900840	like the true variance in IQ that's out there
1900840	1902200	and the effect that it has on people.
1902200	1904400	Yeah, and I would say the most important reason
1904400	1906920	why IQ matters right now and why people need
1906920	1909560	to be paying attention to IQ right now,
1910480	1912200	especially when he's, well, IQ only matters
1912200	1913560	when it's really low.
1913560	1916720	Well, if we're dealing with a quickly dropping IQ
1916720	1919960	for genetic reasons, which it looks like we are about,
1919960	1923160	again, one standard deviation drop in the next 75 years,
1923160	1925880	is what we see not just from IQ
1925880	1927600	being measured in developed countries,
1927600	1929680	we see this, the polygenic scores.
1929720	1932200	This is like the genetic makeups
1932200	1934640	as they are correlated to IQ.
1934640	1938040	We can see them appearing at a lower and lower frequency
1938040	1939960	in genetic banks over time.
1939960	1942960	We can then correlate the genes associated with a high IQ
1942960	1946120	and look at what other things they're highly tied to.
1946120	1948640	They are extremely highly tied
1948640	1951040	to a person's fertility success.
1951040	1954560	So the same genes that are correlated with IQ
1954560	1957000	are also correlated with low success in fertility situations.
1957000	1957840	Like you're looking at a car
1957880	1959880	and you can measure how fast it goes and predict that.
1959880	1962400	You can predict how fast it might go
1962400	1963720	by looking at its engineering.
1963720	1966440	You can read a report about how fast it's supposed to go
1966440	1968240	and all of these numbers correlate.
1968240	1970320	That's sort of what we're looking at with this IQ drop.
1970320	1974760	If it turns out that's real and we are ignoring that,
1974760	1977640	well, then IQ is really gonna fucking matter
1977640	1980200	because almost all of us in the developed world
1980200	1983800	are going to be at this incredibly low level of IQ
1983800	1986400	that even he says,
1986400	1989600	oh, this actually does have a very big effect.
1989600	1992920	And that's a problem that you ignore this
1992920	1994520	because it says something.
1994520	1995600	Yeah, it's kind of like being like,
1995600	1997160	well, money makes no difference
1997160	1998520	unless you're like impoverished.
1998520	2000640	And yet like humanity's moving in this direction
2000640	2002920	toward poverty and let's just ignore the issue though
2002920	2004680	because it doesn't matter at all.
2004680	2005520	Yeah.
2005520	2007240	And so, yeah, I just wanted to close out with that.
2007240	2009200	That is the number one reason
2009200	2011680	why we can't just ignore IQ right now,
2011800	2015200	even though it might be convenient to ignore IQ right now.
2015200	2018520	And it's a shame, but, and as we pointed out,
2018520	2021880	IQ being real does not support the racist positions
2021880	2023680	so long as you are actually familiar
2023680	2025000	with the genetics of IQ.
2025000	2027960	It is because IQ is so heritable
2027960	2030640	that it doesn't matter from an ethnic perspective
2030640	2033280	because it's extreme level of heritability
2033280	2036360	is what allows it to change so quickly intergenerationally.
2036360	2037200	Yeah, which thank goodness.
2037200	2039760	And how persistently tied to an individual's ethnicity.
2039760	2040680	Yeah.
2040680	2041960	I mean, and let's be clear,
2041960	2045240	we would prefer a world in which everyone had
2045240	2048160	the same potential for achievement on everything.
2048160	2050960	You know, like a blank slate world would be way cooler.
2050960	2052560	We would prefer to be in one.
2052560	2055400	But, you know, to pretend that is how it is
2055400	2057960	just because you feel like that's a more moral world
2057960	2059800	doesn't mean it's a more moral world, right?
2059800	2061680	You could be like, oh, death is immoral.
2061680	2062680	So I don't believe in it,
2062680	2064160	but that's not going to change the fact
2064160	2065000	that you're going to die.
2065000	2065840	So.
2065840	2067280	Well, and it can cause you to make decisions
2067280	2068480	that hurt a lot of people.
2068480	2071760	And that's what gets me the most about this.
2071760	2073600	You know, when you look at our prison system,
2073600	2076800	the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.
2076800	2080680	And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage
2080680	2081560	when compared to you,
2081560	2083760	when you tell people to throw that out,
2083760	2087600	that what you are taking the most vulnerable people
2087600	2090040	in our society who are in a situation
2090040	2093240	due to something they had no control over
2093240	2096960	and completely acting like they had the same advantages
2096960	2097800	you did in life.
2097800	2098720	It is sick.
2098720	2099840	It is sick.
2099840	2101280	It is not moral.
2101280	2103360	And you need to get your fucking shit together
2103360	2105120	and actually look at the data
2105120	2107640	instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.
2107640	2109920	So you can play your little virtue game, okay?
2109920	2113720	Because people are suffering for your bullshit.
2113720	2115600	And so you can feel like a hero
2115600	2120000	without having to challenge actual real world problems
2120000	2123160	and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages
2123160	2125560	that you were born with, which other people worked.
2126560	2128720	And there you have it.
2128720	2129560	I love you.
2129560	2130400	Yeah, there we have it.
2130400	2131240	Okay.
2131240	2132080	Have a good one, Simone.
2132080	2134280	You too, gorgeous.
2134280	2137000	For anyone who wants to go to that pronatalist conference
2137000	2139200	that's being held in Austin,
2139200	2140880	a few points of clarification.
2140880	2141960	We are not running it.
2141960	2143840	We have no control over who's going.
2143840	2145880	We don't make any money from it.
2145880	2148440	However, we will be speaking there and we will be there
2148440	2150280	and we would be happy to meet up with people
2150280	2152640	who watch our show if you happen to be in the area.
2152640	2154480	Might even put something together
2154480	2158160	if you guys reach out and we get a critical mass of people.
2158160	2161760	We have secured a discount code for our fans,
2161760	2164640	which is pronatalists all caps.
2164640	2167880	And it should get you about 30% off the price of a ticket
2167880	2169080	if you are going.
2169080	2171560	Again, this is not affiliated with the foundation,
2171560	2174280	but if we can make things cheaper for our fans,
2174280	2175440	we're gonna do it.
2175440	2176920	And if we can meet with people
2176920	2178760	who are interested in this topic
2178760	2182160	or further evangelize our brand of pronatalism,
2182160	2184960	we are very excited to take every opportunity
2184960	2186200	we can to do that.
