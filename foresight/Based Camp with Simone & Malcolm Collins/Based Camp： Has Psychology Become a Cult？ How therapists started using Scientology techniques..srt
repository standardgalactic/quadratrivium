1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
I was walking behind these three women,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,600
and one of the women turns to one of the other women

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,640
and goes, I would never date a guy who's not

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,800
seeing a psychologist.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,960
And then all of the other women were like, mm-hmm.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,560
Yes, I agree.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,440
And what I realized is that their psychologists

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,160
had accepted into all three of these women independently

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,640
and enough, and this is a common enough thing,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,720
that apparently women can just say

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,120
this within certain social circles

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,720
and assume that everyone will have the same brainwashing,

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,600
that you cannot be mentally healthy

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,440
without seeing a psychologist.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
That was what was implied was what was being said.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
That is the highest horror

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,040
of psychologically mispractice

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,800
that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,760
That a psychologist had convinced them

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,640
of largely two things.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,280
One is, you can't be psychologically healthy

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,800
without seeing a psychologist.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,480
And then two is, you can't be psychologically healthy

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
without continuing to see a psychologist.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,920
They were creating dependency in their patients

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,600
to get a recurring stream of revenue.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Now, what this cult of psychology does

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
is people go to a psychologist with a problem,

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
and they then say, oh, that problem is likely tied

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
to a trauma early in your life.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,160
Let's determine what this trauma is,

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,360
and then we can constantly meet about this trauma,

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,520
because if you don't have me acting as a constant bulwark

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,720
against this trauma, then it will fall upon you

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
And that's dependency.

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
This is actually the mechanisms

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
that Scientologists would use.

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
They would do a theme reading,

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
and they would ask you questions about things

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
like your parents or other things

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,680
that happened early in your life.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,800
And then they would say, ah, you have some trauma

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,200
with your mom or your trauma with your dad.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,680
And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
which is interesting to me that you have this one field

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,920
that is so vilified for milking people from their money

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,040
and creating dependency, which is Scientology.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,200
And then you have this other field,

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,240
which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
which is the psychologist,

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,240
but in a way it's because they're competing

53
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,600
for the same customers using the same mechanisms.

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,520
Oh, wow.

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
Why there is this fight here.

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Would you like to know more?

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Hello, gorgeous.

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
Hello, Simone.

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,720
It's wonderful to be here with you today.

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
What are we talking about?

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Psychology.

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,840
Are you ready?

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
So people may not know this.

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,280
I started my early career in neuroscience and psychology.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,280
So yes, I did some early work in brain-computer interface,

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
but before that, I was a psychologist

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
who focused on schizophrenia and stuff like that,

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,200
but also like more general psychology stuff.

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
And recently I have become horrified

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
and very disappointed in the field

71
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,880
because it seems to be turning into a cult.

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,360
And I mean that very literally

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,600
and as terrifyingly as it could possibly be interpreted.

74
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,000
So to people who don't know this about psychology,

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,320
one of the things that all young psychologists

76
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,340
are taught about when you're just starting out in psychology

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,340
is the horror of the fad that was hypnosis.

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,620
Because it turns out that when somebody comes to you

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,300
and you're in a position of authority over them,

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,020
it is very easy to implant memories in their mind

81
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,980
using specific procedures.

82
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,620
Many of those look like hypnosis,

83
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,500
but they also look like other things.

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,740
This is one of these big things

85
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,140
that they always teach you early in psychology.

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,460
It's that memories are not actually

87
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,580
that great a predictor of whether or not something

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,900
actually happened the way it's being remembered happened.

89
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,420
And this is all important for court psychologists

90
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,020
and stuff like that, but the real tragedy comes

91
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,380
when people go to a psychologist

92
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,420
to try to work out some problem they have.

93
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,300
And then that psychologist through mechanisms

94
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,460
that we now know can implant memories in a person's mind,

95
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,300
which is hypnosis, implant a bunch of memories of trauma

96
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,280
in someone's mind and then use those memories of trauma

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,320
to justify why that person is seeing a psychologist.

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,700
And then historically, there were many cases

99
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,160
of using those memories of trauma to cut the person off

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,120
from people who would have broken them out of the cult,

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
gotten them away from the psychologist.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,520
There's the famous case of a young girl

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,000
who accused her father of rape,

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,720
which it seems he almost certainly did not do.

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
And yet he went to trial over this and everything

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
really had damage to his life.

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,780
And when I'm doing editing,

108
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll find the name of the case and put it on screen here

109
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
because it's this really heartbreaking case

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
of how easy it is to accidentally brainwash someone

111
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
if they come to you as a psychologist.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
And so there was this moment not too long ago

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,720
where I was in a room of really high profile people.

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm talking about like top level people in our society,

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,640
controlling things and stuff like that.

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,800
And I was walking behind these three women

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,200
and one of the women turns to one of the other women

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,800
and goes, I would never date a guy

119
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,640
who's not seeing a psychologist.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
And then all of the other women were like,

121
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,760
mm-hmm, yes, I agree.

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,080
And what I realized is that their psychologists

123
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,760
had accepted into all three of these women independently

124
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,280
and enough, and this is a common enough thing

125
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,600
that apparently like women can just say this

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
was in certain social circles and assume

127
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,360
that everyone will have the same brainwashing,

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,200
that you cannot be mentally healthy

129
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,040
without seeing a psychologist.

130
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,560
That was what was implied was what was being said.

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,240
That is the highest horror

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,480
of psychologically mispractice

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,240
that a like same thinking psychologist could imagine.

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
That a psychologist had convinced them

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
of largely two things.

136
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,720
One is you can't be psychologically healthy

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,200
without seeing a psychologist.

138
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,880
And then two is you can't be psychologically healthy

139
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
without continuing to see a psychologist.

140
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,320
They were creating dependency in their patients

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,200
to get a recurring stream of revenue.

142
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
This doesn't come as a surprise, right?

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,200
Because when we talk about governance

144
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,680
and we talk about what makes people do what they're doing,

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,320
when you have a career in which you maintain clients

146
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
and have repeat clients

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,160
because they continue to need your services,

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,560
any psychologist, psychotherapist, therapist, whatever,

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
counselor who is really good at their job.

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
That is to say helping people not need counseling

151
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
or therapy or psychoanalysis or whatever anymore.

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,520
If you're really good at your job, you lose your customers.

153
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,840
If you are really good at creating dependency

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,520
and reinforcing someone's mental struggles,

155
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,000
then you have a thriving career and customer base,

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
especially if they think that they need you

157
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,160
and that you are somehow helping even while you're secretly

158
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,560
or subconsciously making things worse.

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,440
So there's this huge adverse incentive,

160
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,920
one that we also really complain about

161
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
in the nonprofit world where the nonprofits

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,560
that tend to stick around and survive

163
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,800
are those which raise money effectively,

164
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,760
not which solve their problem effectively.

165
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,440
So I guess we're seeing the same problem in psychology

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
as we are in the world of nonprofits,

167
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,560
which is the successful psychologists are those

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,200
that are very good at getting clients dependent on them.

169
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Correct?

170
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,240
So I think that this is a really critical point

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
that you've made Simone,

172
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,280
which is I don't think that anyone has really gone into this

173
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,880
or that many people have gone into this

174
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,680
with nefarious intentions,

175
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,280
nor do I think it's a problem in how psychologists are taught

176
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,400
because I was warned against this going into psychology.

177
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,560
The problem is that if you're a good psychologist,

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
you earn less money.

179
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,920
If you have less money, you have less room for advertising,

180
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,720
less money for advertising, less money for client acquisition,

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
and you have lower margins,

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
which mean you can get less high profile clients often.

183
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,440
So really what you're seeing,

184
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,000
and I think the reason you see this in the

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,880
quote unquote elite levels of psychology

186
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,600
more than I think the general psychological audience,

187
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,400
although I don't know how widespread this practice is,

188
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,520
is because of the people who either subconsciously

189
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,640
or accidentally fall into this practice

190
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,720
of accidentally brainwashing their patients

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,160
into thinking they need a psychologist constantly,

192
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,720
economically out-compete the psychologists

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,680
who aren't doing this practice.

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,640
And I think that this is one of those things

195
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,400
where no one is acting nefariously.

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
Nobody went into this saying,

197
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,520
I want to incept people with the idea

198
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,640
that they can't be mentally healthy without one

199
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,320
continuing to see me or two,

200
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,680
that they should cut themselves off

201
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,520
from everyone who's not seeing a psychologist

202
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,320
in terms of their sort of personal, emotional life.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,720
But that's also a really interesting thing.

204
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,800
If psychologists tell people,

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,880
also the people who you are engaged with in your life

206
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
need to see a psychologist,

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,960
that's additional customers, right?

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
If it's, oh, well, you should stop interacting

209
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,720
with your parents unless they're also seeing a psychologist.

210
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,360
By the way, here's my card.

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,720
By the way, you shouldn't date people

212
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,360
unless they're also seeing a psychologist.

213
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,080
By the way, here's my card.

214
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
And so there's many elements

215
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,240
of how this sort of cult accidentally can evolve.

216
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,080
And I think that some psychologists

217
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
have some of these practices and not others.

218
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
And some psychologists,

219
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm not saying all psychologists

220
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,000
are part of this cult movement.

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
What I'm saying is that it does exist

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
within the psychology movement.

223
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
And even when I talk to people with a psychology background

224
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
who aren't caught up in this,

225
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,800
they're like, oh God, yeah, I've definitely seen that.

226
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
And it's really scary.

227
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
So let's talk about the way

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
that psychology is generally supposed to work

229
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,520
when you go to see a psychologist.

230
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,960
And then we can contrast that

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,080
with the way you know you're dealing with probably

232
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,840
a bad psychologist or a psychologist

233
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,120
who is creating dependency.

234
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,480
It is typically you go to a psychologist

235
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,120
and you have some issue.

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
And what they are supposed to do

237
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
is help you rewrite your internal self-narrative

238
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,520
so that thing that is an issue

239
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,160
is either not an issue

240
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,960
or not debilitating to your daily life.

241
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,600
That is what a good psychologist does.

242
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,360
You might go to a psychologist

243
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,240
believing that you have some sort of a crippling problem

244
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,400
that you can't get out of

245
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,120
and they work with you to not have a crippling problem

246
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
that you can't get out of

247
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,560
and not have to see a psychologist anymore.

248
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,600
Now what a quote, unquote evil psychologist does,

249
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,360
this cult of psychology does

250
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,920
is people go to a psychologist with a problem.

251
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,240
And they then say,

252
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,120
oh, that problem is likely tied to a trauma

253
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,640
early in your life.

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Let's determine what this trauma is.

255
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,760
And then we can constantly meet about this trauma

256
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,120
because if you don't have me

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,680
acting as a constant bulwark against this trauma,

258
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,080
then it will fall upon you

259
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,360
and you won't be able to live a mentally healthy life.

260
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
And that's dependency

261
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
because they're saying without me acting

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,560
as this sort of bulwark.

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
And what is really fascinating is when I was younger,

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,200
I was interested in joining cults.

265
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,880
So like not, I didn't want to join a cult.

266
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
I was interested in how people could be convinced

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
to believe things.

268
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,680
It seemed obviously not true to me.

269
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,760
And one of the things I did is I went to a number

270
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
of like psychology recruitment sessions,

271
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,200
not psychology, Scientology.

272
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,440
Sorry, the brady and slip of the tongue there.

273
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,200
I went to Scientology recruitment sessions.

274
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,160
And this is actually the mechanisms

275
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,720
that Scientologists would use.

276
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
They would do a theme reading

277
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
and they would ask you questions about things

278
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
like your parents or something like that

279
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,080
or other things that happened early in your life.

280
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,760
And then the theme reading is basically

281
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
a galvanic spin response.

282
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
So they could tell when you would get nervous.

283
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
And then they would say,

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
ah, you have some trauma with your mom

285
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,400
or your trauma with your dad,

286
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,440
depending on how you reacted galvanic spin response wise

287
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,720
to their questions around this stuff.

288
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,240
And that's essentially what this cult of psychology is doing,

289
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,360
which is interesting to me that you have this one field

290
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,440
that is so vilified for milking people from their money

291
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,560
and creating dependency, which is Scientology.

292
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,720
And then you have this other field

293
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,760
which Scientology labels as like the highest evil,

294
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
which is psychologists.

295
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,760
But in a way, it's because they're competing

296
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,120
for the same customers using the same mechanisms.

297
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, wow.

298
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,080
Why there is this fight here.

299
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,880
And interesting when Scientology evolves,

300
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
that was during one of the periods

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
where this is one of those really interesting things.

302
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
So if you go back to Christian science,

303
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
a lot of people are like,

304
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
oh, isn't that ridiculous

305
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,840
that they don't want to use modern medicine?

306
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
However, actually, if you look at the time period

307
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,440
when Christian science evolved,

308
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,840
modern medicine might have actually lowered life expectancy

309
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,680
because that was back when they were doing leeches

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,880
and bone cuttings and everything.

311
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,000
And so it actually made sense during that time.

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,160
If you look at during the early evolution of Scientology,

313
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,000
this was happening during the hypnotherapy epidemic.

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,880
So they might have actually had a point

315
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,320
that their mechanisms that was actually interesting

316
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,280
is their mechanisms might have been prescient

317
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,880
of the direction psychology was going to go 30, 40 years

318
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,640
in the future, which is just fascinating to me

319
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
that we now see them as evil.

320
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,040
And yet they were just creating dependency

321
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,080
in the same way psychologists do.

322
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,520
Now, of course they didn't go as far.

323
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
And so what psychologists have

324
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
that the Scientologists didn't have

325
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,280
was certain regulatory organizations

326
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,480
which can just bar them and stuff like that

327
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,120
so that they couldn't go quite as far

328
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,520
with molesting people or something

329
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,720
or creating essential slaves or any of the other things

330
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
that of course, for legal reasons,

331
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm not saying Scientology has ever done any of these things.

332
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,280
But what I'm saying is that the tech,

333
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,160
if they might, because it's such a centralized organization,

334
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,360
they wouldn't have the same system

335
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,200
for preventing these kinds of extreme levels of abuse.

336
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,520
But that doesn't mean that the core techniques

337
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
that they're using aren't the same techniques,

338
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,720
that the field of psychology had allowed itself

339
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,600
or has allowed itself to drift into.

340
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,640
And this terrifies me.

341
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,800
Let me add another layer of complexity though,

342
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
because as much as this is terrifying

343
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,120
and as much as we frame this as like people unknowingly

344
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,680
entering into these relationships

345
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,800
where dependency is created and then turned into victims,

346
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,080
part of me wonders if this is an open secret

347
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
because we've had this conversation with friends,

348
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,280
we've had this conversation with people quite frankly

349
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,440
because we find it interesting.

350
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
And we've met many people

351
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,360
who have undergone really hard mental periods

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,080
that their lives most people have, I think,

353
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,920
who have ended up independent relationships with therapists

354
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,760
and just flat out told us,

355
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,640
yeah, I see a therapist a couple of times a week,

356
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,480
it's gotten to the point

357
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
where my insurance doesn't accept them anymore,

358
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
I'm paying out of pocket for this.

359
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,800
So this is obviously a big investment.

360
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,880
I know that this is a dependent relationship,

361
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,800
but also it's been a big help for me.

362
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,680
And even though I know that this is not right, I need this.

363
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,560
This is one of the problems with psychological biases

364
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,680
is you can know you have a psychological bias

365
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,360
and it doesn't help you get out of it.

366
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
You can know that you're in a culture,

367
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,000
in a dependent relationship,

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,160
but the psychologist has effectively created this dependency.

369
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,440
You can't easily leave it.

370
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,280
That's one of the problems.

371
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,080
You essentially need cult deprogramming to get out of this.

372
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
And does such a thing exist?

373
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,800
What can we say to our friends who are in those positions

374
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,280
or if someone's watching this video and they're like,

375
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,800
oh, wait, yeah, I am in a codependent relationship.

376
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm paying out of pocket for someone.

377
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,080
This is really, it's not sustainable.

378
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,280
And obviously my problem's not going away, right?

379
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,000
Like I still have crippling anxiety

380
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,920
or this terrible traumatic thing that's interrupting my life.

381
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,240
What would you say to them then?

382
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,640
There is no cult deprogramming for therapists.

383
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,000
I think that that's the key is solving it yourself.

384
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,400
If you don't, if whenever you give your mind,

385
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,800
your mental state to another person,

386
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,720
you create enormous personal vulnerability.

387
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,560
And so yes, it's harder to do it on your own.

388
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,360
But the truth is that the things that the psychologists

389
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
are taught about how to engage us,

390
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,400
someone are just not that complex.

391
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,680
They're gonna say they are, they really aren't.

392
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,040
It's just personal narrative building stuff,

393
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
which you can read about in the Pragment Just Guide to Life.

394
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,040
But if you aren't interested in that,

395
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
then try to find another psychologist,

396
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
interview them early on like you should a psychologist.

397
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,080
And I would say the big red flag is the more a psychologist

398
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,120
is focused on the concept of trauma,

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
especially trauma as an immutable thing,

400
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,720
as not a goal to get over,

401
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,760
then they are likely on the evil side

402
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,480
or the dependency creating side.

403
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
If they are focused on either not focused on trauma

404
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,240
or their focus on trauma is helping you overcome

405
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
the trauma entirely, then they are likely,

406
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
more likely to be on the positive side.

407
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,800
But what's interesting is I've noticed that these ideas

408
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,600
that have been incepted into people

409
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,160
have worked their way in a way

410
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
into mainstream progressive politics,

411
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,080
where people now define themselves by their traumas

412
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,880
and they see them as like a major part of their self identity.

413
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
And I think what's really interesting

414
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,640
is other religious movements used to have defenses against this.

415
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,880
And this is one of the things we talk about

416
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,840
in the Pragment Just Guide to Crafting Religion

417
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,640
is that a lot of religious movements

418
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,440
essentially had roles that were like psychologists.

419
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
I mean, of course they did, right?

420
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,400
This isn't a new need for people

421
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,040
to some extent within the Jewish community,

422
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
like that's what your rabbi would do.

423
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,160
And in the Mormon community, you know,

424
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
you have solutions to this.

425
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,080
And within these communities,

426
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,360
because they didn't use psychologists to recruit people

427
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,240
in the way that Scientologists did,

428
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,960
they were genuinely interested in mental health.

429
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,240
And one of the best mental health focused communities

430
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,440
or systems that evolved to do this

431
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,040
that I just have endless admiration for

432
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,920
is the Catholic system.

433
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,960
So what the Catholic system is, the confession system,

434
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
what it allows you to do is go to someone,

435
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,960
say, this is something bad I've done

436
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,040
or this is something I've done

437
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,680
that is causing mental trouble for me or something like that.

438
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,920
And what they don't say very importantly

439
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,920
is know that thing wasn't actually bad.

440
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
They don't say, oh no,

441
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,680
you're just automatically forgiven for it,

442
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,640
which is what the Bible says, you know, as you repent,

443
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
but it's actually a better system

444
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,040
than even what I think from a psychological standpoint,

445
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,120
is to say, yes, what you did is bad.

446
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,040
Here is a concrete list of things you can do

447
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,560
to atone for the bad thing you did.

448
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,800
So it's an acknowledgement of the badness

449
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
and then creating a self-narrative within the person

450
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,680
that they can overcome that

451
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
through following this list of things.

452
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,440
Now, of course, they're also creating dependency

453
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
to the church to some extent, right?

454
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,920
Oh, you need to keep going every time you do a bad thing.

455
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,880
But what's really admirable about the system they created

456
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
is it's a very difficult system to abuse,

457
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,760
either accidentally or on purpose.

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,480
The pseudo anonymity of the system

459
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,600
makes it harder for a person to form a dependency

460
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
on a single individual.

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
The high level of ethics around not talking about,

462
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
and this is like a really important thing

463
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,960
for Catholic periods,

464
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,080
you cannot say what was told to you in confession,

465
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,720
even if it could save someone's life

466
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,040
or it prevent a murder,

467
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,600
which is actually higher than the level of trust

468
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
you have with your psychologist.

469
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,320
If you go to a psychologist and you say something

470
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,040
that says just that you could kill someone else

471
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,800
or self-harm, they actually have a duty to report you,

472
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,120
like serious risk of your own life,

473
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,640
where the Catholic priest has a higher level of trust

474
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
in that.

475
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,960
And even if you have a dumb person

476
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,120
who could accidentally give a person bad advice,

477
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,880
they're actually working within a fairly narrow range

478
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,520
of answers they can give you.

479
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
And it's really hard for them to give an answer

480
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,880
that creates that much psychological damage.

481
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,200
So there are mechanisms for better systems in this.

482
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,560
The problem is that these mechanisms aren't available

483
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,000
to the masses or to the secular

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,720
or like religiously derived masses

485
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,400
that are no longer in these traditions

486
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
that offer services like this.

487
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,360
So I know you don't really like alcoholics anonymous,

488
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,720
for example, because what it has become

489
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
is actually quite corrupted

490
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
and it has various adverse incentives at play.

491
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,120
It's another example of an organization

492
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,240
that was started with good intent,

493
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,520
but essentially has become a cult,

494
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,560
but that's for a different video.

495
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,720
Right, that's for a different video.

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
And not all of it, factions of it.

497
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,800
I do want to ask you about their buddy system.

498
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,480
You know, that you, when you go into AA,

499
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,760
there's a lot of stuff that is whatever,

500
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
but one of the things that you do have,

501
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
rather than a therapist, rather than a priest

502
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,320
that you confess to, rather than a centralized authority,

503
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,400
you just have another one of the people of this group

504
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,240
who shares your struggle being your accountability buddy.

505
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
And it seems like sometimes these people have,

506
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,400
they've been through it more than you have,

507
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
but at least, so they're more advanced.

508
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,280
Yeah, so what are they really doing?

509
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,440
They're preventing you from leaving AA.

510
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,600
You could say they're preventing you

511
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,080
from getting back on alcohol,

512
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,520
but just as much of preventing you

513
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
from getting back on alcohol,

514
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,400
they consider a failure scenario two things.

515
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,960
You getting back on alcohol or you leaving AA.

516
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
What are your thoughts on, and we'll say-

517
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,640
And this is where the whole idea

518
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
to take a step aside here.

519
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,720
This is where the concept of a dry drunk within AA

520
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
comes from, if anybody doesn't believe me.

521
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,800
Look at this concept.

522
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,520
Many people in the cult version of AA

523
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
believe that quitting alcohol through a mechanism

524
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,120
other than AA is as bad as continuing to be an alcoholic,

525
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,440
which to me shows the point is staying in AA.

526
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,640
It's not getting off alcohol,

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,000
which is what I mean when I say this is a cult,

528
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
and it's not all of AA.

529
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
And the same way it's not all psychologists,

530
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,560
but the buddy system-

531
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,600
Let's return to mechanisms that people can turn to

532
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,080
if they don't turn to a therapist,

533
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,800
if they're not Catholic and they don't wanna go to confession.

534
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,440
Do you think a buddy system,

535
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,560
so someone maybe who's been through the same thing

536
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,760
that you have or someone that you really trust as a friend

537
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,480
is a good alternative to just figuring it out by yourself?

538
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,600
Cause I don't think everyone's really ready for that.

539
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,440
Just a side note,

540
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,400
as somebody who really studied cults and loves cults,

541
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
buddy systems are really common in cults.

542
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,360
It's one of the most common systems.

543
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
We love Mormons, we'll have a video on them in the future,

544
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
but Mormons due to an extent use a buddy system

545
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
during a person's mission trip

546
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,160
to prevent them from deconverting

547
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,680
so that they have somebody they can turn to constantly,

548
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,240
but that also is supervising them to an extent.

549
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,000
And when you look at cults,

550
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
actually one of the reasons why cults historically

551
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
use buddy systems is for converting people.

552
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,680
But what some cults found,

553
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,920
and there's some great research on that,

554
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,720
that was actually done by the cults themselves

555
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,960
because they kept records,

556
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,840
I think the Mooneys were the ones who did this,

557
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,320
is it was never approached somebody as an individual

558
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,400
because they'll think that it's like a sexual thing

559
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
or like you're hitting on them or something

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,560
or like it's weird.

561
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,920
But if you approach them with a buddy,

562
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,440
which is the smallest group you can do this with,

563
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,600
they have a much higher chance of not being afraid of you

564
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,640
and not seeing you as threatening.

565
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,400
So yes, buddy system is actually often a sign

566
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,440
that you're joining a cult.

567
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,040
And I need to stress, I don't think Mormonism is a cult,

568
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,840
they just, the buddy system is there to prevent deconversion.

569
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
But to the point that you were making,

570
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,200
can a buddy system be good?

571
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,440
It may be good,

572
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,360
but I really think the ultimate buddy system is a spouse.

573
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,840
And what you really have to type is spouse

574
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,560
that can help you work through these things for yourself,

575
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,120
which Simone does for me all the time,

576
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,400
I've been brainwashed by my spouse.

577
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,080
That's really what I'm saying here.

578
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
I've been brainwashed

579
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,400
into just having absolute mental dependency on my spouse.

580
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,160
Well, what I hear you saying is,

581
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,680
buddy systems are a viable therapy mechanism.

582
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,440
Isn't that what someone who had brainwashed me would say?

583
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,760
Hmm.

584
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,960
No, I know what I'm saying is buddy systems may work,

585
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
but they're not a terribly good system.

586
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
Well, I think a buddy system is a really good system

587
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,880
if you're trying to opt into someone's lifestyle or solution.

588
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,280
So if you think-

589
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,520
If the buddy system is managed by an organization

590
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,840
that you can have total trust,

591
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,720
has your best interest at heart.

592
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm referring to a friend.

593
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,080
I'm referring to a spouse.

594
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm referring to a mentor.

595
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm not referring to anything that's organizationally related.

596
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm referring to the dynamic of someone that you trust

597
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,240
helping you work through something.

598
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,800
Well, then you better have total trust in them

599
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
because you know what, that buddy,

600
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,440
there's a reason why there's all these rules

601
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,560
against sleeping with your psychologist and stuff like that.

602
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,200
If you're a female and that buddy's a male,

603
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,480
they're probably gonna try to sleep with you

604
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,680
unless you have like enormous trust in them or vice versa.

605
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,640
No, this is how people create dependency.

606
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,960
This is how I understand

607
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,560
if you have total trust in the person you're going with

608
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,680
in this buddy system, great.

609
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,240
But the problem is that you can often misjudge someone.

610
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,080
And when you use someone to be this kind of sounding board,

611
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,320
you outsource the keys to your mental kingdom

612
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,480
to someone else,

613
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,960
which puts you in a position

614
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,760
of enormous mental vulnerability.

615
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,280
But Malcolm, I think what you're missing

616
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,840
is when people are severely depressed,

617
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,440
when people are severely traumatized,

618
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,280
they may not have-

619
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,360
So the question should be solved

620
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
with pharmacological intervention

621
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,080
and potentially even more extreme interventions

622
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,320
like electroshock therapy

623
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,720
works really well for extreme depression.

624
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,520
There are solutions to the more extreme psychological problems.

625
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,960
This is same for things like schizophrenia

626
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,800
and stuff like that.

627
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,920
But those aren't psychologist problems.

628
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
Those are psychiatrist problems.

629
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,480
It's a different fricking degree, okay?

630
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,960
It's a different, it's a completely different level.

631
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,600
One prescribes things and the other doesn't.

632
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Go to the one that prescribes things

633
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
if that's what you're looking for.

634
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,040
If you're looking for solutions

635
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,600
that you can't come to yourself

636
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
or you can't come to with a buddy.

637
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,080
And I do agree, a buddy,

638
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,840
all I'm doing is highlighting the importance

639
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
of understanding that if you go to a buddy,

640
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,360
trust that buddy,

641
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,240
but the truth that you could probably trust a buddy

642
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
better than you can a random psychologist.

643
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
That is true.

644
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,240
Like the only thing you really have faith

645
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,680
that the psychologist isn't going to do,

646
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,440
is there likely not or less likely going to

647
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
do something that's just absolutely egregious to you.

648
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
But they are much more likely

649
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
to just create a generic dependency.

650
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
Whereas a buddy may have a slightly higher probability

651
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,720
of doing something absolutely egregious,

652
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,000
but a much lower probability

653
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
of creating general dependency.

654
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,360
So long as you prepped in with framing for this,

655
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,040
which the pragmatist got into life,

656
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,680
which is our shortest book by far

657
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,560
and sells for 99 cents and all the profits go to charity.

658
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,240
So like we created it actually when we wrote that book,

659
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,600
it was to try to create an alternative to CBT.

660
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
CBT is actually a great system.

661
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
We just wanted an alternative

662
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
that people with less training could use

663
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
was more reliability.

664
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,080
CBT standing for cognitive behavioral therapy.

665
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,200
But it was originally meant to be a

666
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,280
if then training manual for psychologists.

667
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,200
And actually an AI was going to be trained on it

668
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,080
to become a psychologist.

669
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,640
One AI team reached out to us after reading it.

670
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,760
If you read it and you're like,

671
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,640
this sounds like a psychologist training manual.

672
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
That's actually the way it was written.

673
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,440
And so it could actually help you in that scenario

674
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,040
to prevent the more extreme ways

675
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
you might engage with something,

676
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,720
but then also just self-reflection

677
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,400
with this very simple concept.

678
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,120
And I'll present the concept to you.

679
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
You have an internal self-narrative.

680
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Who you are, what your role is in the world,

681
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,400
what events have caused you trauma,

682
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
how you relate to those trauma.

683
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,720
This is all part of your self-narrative.

684
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,040
It's the narrative you tell yourself.

685
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,000
The core goal of this person you're going to

686
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,360
is for you to go to them,

687
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,120
say this is how I would like to rewrite my self-narrative

688
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,560
or this is my self-narrative today

689
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,720
and here's how it's causing me problems.

690
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,320
And to work with you in rewriting that self-narrative,

691
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,080
which is actually self-narratives are incredibly malleable.

692
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,800
Even though we pretend in society today

693
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,160
like they are this immutable part of who we are,

694
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,080
they are not.

695
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,280
It's very, like research shows are very malleable.

696
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,200
So you're going to this person to rewrite your self-narrative

697
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,160
into one that is less damaging to your daily life

698
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,920
or your goals for who you want to be or yourself.

699
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
And that's just a very doable thing.

700
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,360
You don't need to read the book,

701
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,240
just go into it with that concept.

702
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,000
We'll also understanding that this person

703
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,920
who's rewriting your self-narrative could rewrite it

704
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
to say, you absolutely need to keep seeing me

705
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,320
and giving me money and give me all your money.

706
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,040
And then do all these things I tell you to do

707
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,520
or you will never be mentally healthy.

708
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,160
And that's the danger.

709
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,120
So that's the red flag to look for.

710
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,280
Speaking of red flags,

711
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,040
we have to go get our kids from daycare.

712
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,120
So let's go run, run, run, get that.

713
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,200
And I will start dinner.

714
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,480
I love you so much, Malcolm.

715
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,440
I'll see you soon.
