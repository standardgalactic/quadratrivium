1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
When you look at our prison system,

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,620
the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,500
And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,380
when compared to you,

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,620
when you tell people to throw that out,

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,500
that what?

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,380
You are taking the most vulnerable people in our society

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,540
who are in a situation to do something

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,980
they had no control over and completely acting

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,380
like they had the same advantage as you did in life.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,600
It is sick.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,700
It is sick.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,140
It is not moral.

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,300
And you need to get your fucking shit together

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,060
and actually look at the data

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,580
instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.

17
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,860
So you can play your little virtue game, okay?

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,660
Because people are suffering for your bullshit.

19
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,540
And so you can feel like a hero

20
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,940
without having to challenge actual real world problems

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,100
and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,180
that you were born with, which other people worked.

23
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,740
He ends up making an argument that needs to say

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,020
that he has achieved everything

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,580
that he has achieved in life

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,020
without systemic advantages.

27
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,020
And he has just willed himself to this place that he is.

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,740
Simultaneously while flaunting that systemic advantage

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,460
right in every sense, like to a fault,

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,260
like to a point of illegibility.

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,340
Would you like to know more?

32
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,740
So Malcolm, what if I told you that obviously

33
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,700
wealth doesn't predict success

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,340
because there are tons of millionaires and billionaires

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,900
who just do nothing with their lives

36
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,780
and piss away all their money.

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,540
And obviously being like super, super poor,

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,460
like under the poverty line is a problem.

39
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,420
But above a certain level,

40
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,540
it really doesn't matter about how much money you have.

41
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,660
Oh, I think that would make a lot of sense.

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,380
I think that's exactly the type of thing

43
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,900
a wealthy person would argue.

44
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,300
Right, though.

45
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,060
So I got to talk about how we got on this topic.

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,700
We had a fan of the show stay over at our house

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,380
because they happened to be passing through the area.

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,620
And one of the things that they mentioned

49
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,220
because they were like, well, this is an area

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,140
where I question something that you guys talk about a lot.

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,980
Specifically, he believed that IQ didn't matter at all.

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,500
And the reason he believes this

53
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,700
is because another smart person who he looked up to

54
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,500
had argued this very passionately,

55
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,900
specifically Naseem Taleb.

56
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,940
He wrote this medium post about this

57
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,900
called IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle.

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,820
And I read this medium post

59
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,380
and I saw it as a really interesting opportunity

60
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,380
because self-contained within the post itself

61
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,300
was the proof that he was manipulating data

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,780
and essentially lying to the reader.

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,780
But what we want to try to do on this episode

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,700
is to not just show that, yes, IQ likely does matter,

65
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,300
but give you the tools necessary to,

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,660
even if you don't understand the scientific language

67
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,460
was which a person is arguing,

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,080
i.e. in this case advanced statistics,

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,980
even if you don't understand that,

70
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,980
understand the telltale signs that a person is lying to you

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
and be able to tell that they are lying to you

72
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,100
even if you don't understand what they are saying.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,100
And better than all of that, get to deeper truths

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
than you even could from reading an article

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,060
from the perspective of somebody who agreed

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,380
with what he is true or what you already believe.

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,860
And by that, what I mean is if somebody

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,260
who really believes in career is invested in IQ mattering,

79
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,220
writes an article that IQ matters,

80
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,780
well, they can't really trust it

81
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,180
even cause they might be lying with statistics as well.

82
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,780
If somebody who deeply believes IQ doesn't matter

83
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,740
or at least tries to argue that

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,900
has sprinkled throughout his article

85
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,820
little admissions to where IQ does matter,

86
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,580
you can know that at least in those areas

87
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,020
it definitely matters because he has everything at stake

88
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,380
in showing that it doesn't.

89
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,980
So that's why learning to read articles

90
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,580
in this way is really important.

91
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,260
Now, before we go further with this,

92
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,500
I wanna elaborate on the analogy

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,260
that Simone started the show is

94
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,660
because I think this is where we're going as a society.

95
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,780
And a lot of these people today

96
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,100
who were born with advantages over people,

97
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,580
born with usually really high IQs,

98
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
and then they pretend like they've achieved

99
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,420
everything that they've achieved on their own,

100
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,940
it is not the look that they think it is.

101
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,380
It's very much the new, I don't see race.

102
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,100
Pretending you don't see a systemic advantage

103
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,260
that you have had over other people your entire life

104
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,340
and taking credit being like,

105
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,220
well, I was starting from the same position they were

106
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,740
is not humble, okay?

107
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,740
It is dehumanizing and it is cruel and evil

108
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,340
and it prevents us as a society

109
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,180
from potentially solving systemic issues

110
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,140
for people who weren't born with your immense privilege.

111
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,460
I say this to Nassid because he is somebody

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,820
who was born with this immense privilege.

113
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,780
Yeah, he's clearly someone who is very smart

114
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,300
and who benefits from a high IQ.

115
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,060
And if he were to in good faith take an IQ test,

116
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,740
he would probably end up with a very high IQ score.

117
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,140
Like it's pretty apparent.

118
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I wanna start off too with some caveats that like,

119
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,820
you know, a lot of what he says is we agree with,

120
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,180
you know, IQ, like if you have a really high IQ,

121
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
it doesn't mean you're gonna be super successful,

122
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,380
obviously not, you know, this is why with our school

123
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,740
we select for I will as we say and not IQ

124
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,020
because, you know, being really smart

125
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,140
does not predict success, but he claims

126
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,380
that's what like IQ enthusiasts also claim,

127
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,100
which is not, it's just not true.

128
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,420
So he makes a lot of false claims on that.

129
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,900
I just wanna say that we agree.

130
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,540
He also says a really key thing with IQ is like it,

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,260
where it is most predictive and where it is the biggest deal

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,180
is where there's really low IQ, but he seems to like,

133
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,620
I don't know, just discount that.

134
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,260
That's not important when actually like,

135
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,300
it's been a really big deal.

136
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,220
This is why lead remediation, you know,

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,100
like reducing lead exposure for populations

138
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,700
has been such a big deal.

139
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,540
He also-

140
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,060
Which was caught and measured through IQ.

141
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,580
This is the place where IQ in public policy

142
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,180
has had a positive impact on the lives

143
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
of pretty much everyone living on earth today.

144
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
Yeah, because people were willing to admit that,

145
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,860
you know, the low IQ is a problem.

146
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,380
And then also he talks about, you know,

147
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,900
people misusing IQ often in very unsavory, disgusting ways.

148
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,700
You know, he points to racism a lot.

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,940
That's totally true.

150
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,540
But all sorts of messed up people use like misuse,

151
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,580
all sorts of science and pseudoscience

152
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,460
and other nonsense to forward their agendas.

153
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,820
Just because you see one idiot use something in a poor way,

154
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,340
doesn't mean it's not, you know,

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,900
it's not a relevant field in other ways.

156
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,740
So-

157
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,020
Before we go further with this,

158
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,780
I think we can break this down into a few core points

159
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,420
when you're analyzing an article like this.

160
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,260
Okay, okay.

161
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,460
Yeah, let's do it.

162
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,380
So one is you're looking for what the motivation is.

163
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,340
Then you want to look at the data sets that they present.

164
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,020
You want to look at what they think the alternatives are

165
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,860
that they're presenting.

166
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,900
If IQ doesn't matter, what are the alternatives?

167
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,180
You need to look at where they concede

168
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,660
that the other side has points.

169
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,300
And you need to look at what I call repeated hand flails.

170
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,740
A repeated hand flail is a really bad argument

171
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,980
that is used repeatedly

172
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,060
and that is obviously a bad argument,

173
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,260
but that at first glance can seem

174
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,500
like it's a really powerful argument.

175
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,020
So I'll start with a repeated hand flail

176
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,860
that he uses throughout the piece.

177
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,500
Because it's really obvious and it really got on my nerves.

178
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,540
Which was IQ doesn't matter

179
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,580
because the same individual,

180
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,420
if you test them again with an IQ test,

181
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,020
on average that test is going to differ

182
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,740
from their first score by about a third of standard deviation.

183
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,260
And that's a big difference.

184
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,220
And therefore that proves that IQ tests don't matter.

185
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,700
Now, I ask a person to just,

186
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,980
and this is how when you're hearing something like this

187
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,380
and you're like, okay, he's using a lot of words

188
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,060
like the standard deviation

189
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,540
and comparing this to different parts of the IQ stuff.

190
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,580
Ignore all of that.

191
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,660
Just use your common sense, okay?

192
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,900
So replace IQ test with a different test.

193
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,460
Like a biology test, right?

194
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,420
Like I'm taking a 10th grade biology test

195
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,700
and I am comparing my knowledge of biology

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,460
to the other students in the room's knowledge of biology.

197
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,100
Now, if I retake that test,

198
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,500
if you retake any test about,

199
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,140
you are going to differentiate from your previous results

200
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,980
by about a third of a standard deviation.

201
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,140
If it's like a really big test.

202
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,980
That's just normal.

203
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,820
Anyone should know,

204
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,180
you're not gonna get the same results

205
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,260
like every time you retake a test.

206
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,700
That's a normal function of tests.

207
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,740
However, that being the case,

208
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,980
that doesn't mean that biology test

209
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,660
isn't measuring anything

210
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,780
in terms of a student's knowledge of biology.

211
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,860
Interesting biology.

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,100
And so this is the first thing.

213
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,740
When they are criticizing something,

214
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,500
like if they're continually using an argument, think,

215
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,220
okay, but is there something else

216
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,660
that we all generally agree on?

217
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,620
That the bar is a good way

218
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,820
to measure how good a lawyer is doing

219
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,940
or that driver's exams are a good way to measure,

220
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,100
do these have different results

221
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,220
when a single individual retakes the test?

222
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,180
And the answer is yes.

223
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,100
Well, then why does he keep bringing this up?

224
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Why is it so important?

225
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
It is because, well,

226
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,740
it's just a weird rhetorical tactic

227
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,020
he keeps going back to.

228
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,540
Yeah, I think connected to this kind of

229
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,980
is at the very beginning,

230
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,100
and this was like a big trigger for me.

231
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,980
He says technical backbone,

232
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,020
like he links to a technical backbone

233
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,780
as here's just like at the top of his article,

234
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,740
here's my link to basically what he implies is,

235
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,900
oh, if you really wanna understand why I'm correct

236
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,660
and you wanna see it on a technical standpoint,

237
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,580
an academic peer reviewed standpoint,

238
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,100
this will explain everything.

239
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,060
And you click over to it and it's just a research journal

240
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,020
article pointing to examples

241
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,340
of people mistaking correlation with causation.

242
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,780
It isn't actually related to the arguments

243
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,300
he makes in his blog post.

244
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,740
And it's one of those things that really bothers me

245
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,260
because often people will link to something

246
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,700
and be like, oh, here's what backs up my argument.

247
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,220
And it, I mean, usually it's at least broadly related

248
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,060
to their argument.

249
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,660
This even wasn't really related to his argument.

250
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,780
He sometimes argued that, oh,

251
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,980
people don't understand correlation and causation.

252
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,580
But yeah, that really bothered me.

253
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,380
People are like, read this other thing.

254
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,300
You mentioned that I would note as well,

255
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,140
should be a big red flag with people.

256
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,460
Smart people can write in a way

257
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,660
that dumb people can understand.

258
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,540
Yes.

259
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,700
When we were right, people like who watch our channel

260
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,700
and stuff like that, they sometimes accuse us of talking,

261
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,020
like we have a theothorus in front of us.

262
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,860
Okay, whatever.

263
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,940
I don't think that we do that.

264
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,340
To me, I talk really plain

265
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,820
and that reminds me of that scene in Idiocracy

266
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,980
where they're like,

267
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,100
I think it might be because of these drugs the army put me on.

268
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,500
But if you could just get me well enough

269
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,660
to get back to base.

270
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,740
Right.

271
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,180
Kick ass.

272
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,540
Well, don't want to sound like a dick or nothing,

273
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,260
but it says on your chart that you're fucked up.

274
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,420
You talk like a fag and your shit's all retarded.

275
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,860
What I do is just saying thing.

276
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,100
Yeah, you know what I mean?

277
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,100
Like, no, I'm serious here.

278
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,980
I need help.

279
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,820
There's that fag talk we talked about.

280
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,900
But yeah, and there's that scene

281
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,660
where he's just trying to talk a normal

282
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,100
and the other person just from a different cultural group

283
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,220
here that is intentionally training to sound erudite.

284
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,580
Well, but he does really gatekeep throughout this essay.

285
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
For example, like in one sentence,

286
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,940
well, however, if you take up a perian,

287
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,500
havenky and view of intelligence in another sentence,

288
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,220
he's IQ doesn't detect convexity of mistakes.

289
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,980
Like, what?

290
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,220
So with the point being here is what I was saying,

291
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,620
is that for us, when we use words that sound,

292
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,380
I don't know, it's a somebody different from us

293
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,020
that we're using as the source or something,

294
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,700
they are still intelligible in context.

295
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,780
They are not intentionally meant to get a viewer

296
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,020
to disengage or sort of shut down

297
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,300
and just listen to the other one.

298
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,140
And be like, oh, I guess I'll have to take your word for it

299
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,380
because I don't understand this

300
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,900
and therefore you must be smarter than me.

301
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,580
So I'm just gonna assume that you're right.

302
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,420
Yeah.

303
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,780
And I would say that if you notice that happening in a piece

304
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,580
and never ever take away from that,

305
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,380
this person knows what they're talking about.

306
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,820
Yeah, but can you believe he's like literally

307
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,820
in an article that he's using to disprove IQ as like a thing,

308
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,540
he's using IQ correlated vocabulary nonsense.

309
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,900
Using SAT words.

310
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,340
Yeah, I'm like, the fuck, you know, he talks always,

311
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,380
he's like, you know, this isn't Gaussian.

312
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,700
And okay, you know what, honestly,

313
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,580
like I've been out of academia long enough

314
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,700
to have forgotten that Gaussian was in reference

315
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,060
to a normal distribution.

316
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,660
He could have just said normal distribution.

317
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,860
This man who apparently throughout his writing

318
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,900
makes it very clear that he really hates academia

319
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,260
uses a lot of academic speech,

320
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,860
which is also really interesting.

321
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,660
The techniques and I love the first point you mentioned,

322
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
which is a huge red flag.

323
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,740
If somebody says, here's a source

324
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,140
and the source has nothing to do

325
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,740
is what they're talking about really

326
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,900
or is really just meant to shit on academics.

327
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,500
That's all it was trying to do.

328
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,940
And he doesn't say that's what this is.

329
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,460
You need to be aware that at the very outside of this piece,

330
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,340
he's saying, I am willing to mislead you

331
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,060
to try to make my point.

332
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,340
That is what is being signaled here.

333
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,620
But first we gotta go back to this framework I set up.

334
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,100
Okay, so what is his motivation with this piece?

335
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,860
Because he cites his motivation

336
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,900
throughout the piece very plainly.

337
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,060
He cites very clearly that he believes

338
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,060
that if IQ is a real thing, then the racists are correct.

339
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,180
And racists will be able to implement racist policy,

340
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,420
which will hurt people if IQ is a real.

341
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,060
This is like second paragraph.

342
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,180
People bent on showing that some populations

343
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,940
have inferior mental abilities

344
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,220
based on IQ equals intelligence.

345
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,420
Those have been upset with me for robbing them

346
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
of this quote unquote scientific tool.

347
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,700
His goal right here, he lays it out.

348
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,180
Second paragraph, I am trying to rob racist of a tool.

349
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,300
Now see the way I read that section

350
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,980
is he gives a bulleted list

351
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,860
and he's like basically IQ was something championed by,

352
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,780
first he says racist and eugenicists,

353
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,380
and second he says psychometrics peddlers

354
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
looking for suckers.

355
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,820
And I thought what he was trying to do there

356
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,740
was basically associate this domain

357
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,260
with unsavory people and exploitative people.

358
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,740
I think he also uses the association to discredit

359
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,100
anyone who talks about IQ, but just saying they're racists.

360
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,740
Okay, so he's using it for two reasons.

361
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,420
But it is very clear from the piece

362
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,820
that he believes that if IQ is a real thing,

363
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,580
then the racists are right.

364
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,580
I get in the outro, the argument that quote unquote,

365
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,020
some races are better at running,

366
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,300
hence inference about the brain is stale,

367
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,540
mental capacity is much more,

368
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,140
he goes over this over and over.

369
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,980
It is very clear.

370
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,100
So he's implying that all races are equally good at running?

371
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,620
No, he's implying that doesn't mean that there would be,

372
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,820
okay, listen to this point.

373
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,500
This is actually a really good point

374
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,340
of somebody messing with you.

375
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,860
The argument that quote,

376
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,700
some races are better at running,

377
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,660
end quote, hence some inference about the brain is stale,

378
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,860
mental capacity is much more dimensional

379
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,580
and not defined in the same way,

380
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,260
running a hundred meter dashes.

381
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,940
What?

382
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,380
So what he's saying is that because this is a more

383
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,220
complicated thing to measure,

384
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,140
that it axiomatically doesn't vary

385
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,900
between different ethnic groups.

386
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh, okay, right, right, right.

387
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,940
Because intelligence is harder to measure

388
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,580
and like nail down in this glommy weird thing.

389
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,940
It's just a hand wave.

390
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,660
Now there are reasons why,

391
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,180
and we have done videos on this,

392
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,180
why if you can measure anything in a group,

393
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
measure anything in a group.

394
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,780
And it's clear that he believes this

395
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,860
and this is why he is so sold on this point.

396
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,100
You can measure anything in a group like tennis ability.

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,580
You are going to find systemic differences between groups.

398
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,260
That's just natural.

399
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,260
The reason why IQ based race realism is irrelevant,

400
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,980
and we've done this before,

401
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,780
is because it changes so quickly in your generation.

402
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,180
If you look, like we were looking,

403
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,740
okay, we had 50 embryos, like just our family.

404
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,980
And we choose five embryos out of those 50

405
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,660
based on IQ, pure generation with existing technology.

406
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,060
And our kids only marry other families who did that.

407
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,060
Within just five generations,

408
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,380
the average member of our family would be three standard

409
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,300
deviations higher in IQ

410
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
than the average American citizen today.

411
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,420
And keep in mind that within the next 75 years,

412
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,020
we're likely looking at IQ dropping

413
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,060
by a standard deviation.

414
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,340
So for like just astronomically higher.

415
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,300
And what this shows is that it doesn't matter.

416
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,180
This would be true if we were black.

417
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,060
This would be true if we were Asian.

418
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,580
IQ doesn't matter not because it doesn't differ

419
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
between groups.

420
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,820
Everything, if you measure it,

421
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,740
if you can put a number to it,

422
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,060
it's going to differ between groups.

423
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,900
But any selective or evolutionary bottle,

424
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,980
like you're trying to say.

425
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,060
It matters because it doesn't persistently differ between.

426
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,860
And it can quickly change.

427
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,620
And it matters a lot more what like family you come from

428
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,980
or what religion you come from.

429
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,220
Yeah, or what environment you're in

430
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,700
with the selective pressures are.

431
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,540
What small, yeah.

432
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,740
So that's why it doesn't matter.

433
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,780
But he hasn't thought of that argument.

434
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
And so he is just completely dedicated

435
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,020
because he knows the moment you could put,

436
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,580
and this becomes very clear later in his argumentation,

437
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,900
the moment you could put a number on general competence

438
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,900
that there would be differences between ethnic groups.

439
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,100
Because of course, I mean, they might be minor differences,

440
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,540
but people would still pick up on that.

441
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,780
And then that motivates racism.

442
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,780
And you can actually tell this is his core motivation

443
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
by, again, I say, what is he proposing

444
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,900
as the alternative to IQ, right?

445
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,500
So if he was being, I think, genuine,

446
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,300
I just think IQ tests are bad

447
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,420
and we could be measuring this better,

448
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,740
you would be proposing a way to measure it better.

449
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,340
But he doesn't propose a way to measure it better.

450
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,180
Yeah, that's true.

451
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,420
And we would respect that.

452
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,060
I mean, I think we inherently under,

453
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,020
we would agree with him that current measures of IQ,

454
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,740
they could definitely approve.

455
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,020
But let's, I want to read this.

456
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,700
If you want to detect how someone fares at a task,

457
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,820
say, loan sharking, tennis playing,

458
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,260
or a random matrix theory, make him or her do that task.

459
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,020
We don't need theoretical exams for real world function

460
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,940
by probability challenge psychologists.

461
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,060
So think about what this is saying

462
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,460
and how completely insane this is.

463
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,740
He is actually saying that I am unwilling

464
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,500
to have any sort of broad measure

465
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,100
of competence put on a person.

466
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,300
And the reason he has to take this position

467
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,940
is because whatever measure of competence he found,

468
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,580
you would find differences in it between groups.

469
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,300
So he needs there to be no standard measure of competence

470
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,460
given his world framing that he has laid out.

471
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,740
If you can put a measure on people's competence,

472
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,380
then it will differ between groups

473
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,460
that it can be used by racists to promote their agenda.

474
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,140
That is a core thing.

475
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,780
So going into this piece,

476
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,820
he's going into it with the world perspective

477
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,580
that if you could put any sort of broad measure

478
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,220
of competence on a group, that it will lead to racism.

479
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,940
And so we should not have that.

480
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,940
But think about how insane that would be for a society.

481
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,340
That would also mean, well, you can't have SATs.

482
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,340
You can't really have any sort of a broadly applicable test.

483
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,540
Every test that needs to only study

484
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,140
what a person is about to do.

485
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,100
But the problem is that we hire people

486
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,300
and we accept people into college.

487
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
Based on totally unrelated.

488
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,100
To do broad ranges of tasks.

489
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,860
One of the core places like he was using

490
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,700
as he mentioned in the piece, is in the military.

491
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,220
And that's because you need a broad spectrum of knowledge.

492
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Well, it doesn't seem to be predictive of outcome.

494
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,060
And again, we want to emphasize here that we're not,

495
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,020
we don't disagree with the basic argument he's making.

496
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,340
The school that we're designing,

497
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,420
whenever possible, tests people through natural assessments.

498
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,260
Hey, can you write content that audience,

499
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,660
like widespread audiences?

500
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,340
Okay, well, let's see if you can write a fan fiction

501
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,180
that a lot of people read.

502
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,900
Like we believe in natural assessments

503
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,380
and we believe that's the best way to tell

504
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,820
if someone's good at something,

505
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,980
but we also are practical.

506
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah, well, I think also at the same time,

507
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,940
we accept that some people are born

508
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,140
with an intellectual state that gives them

509
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,900
a huge systemic advantage over other people.

510
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,420
And this, again, it's not an ethic thing.

511
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,940
As we said, it changes so quickly

512
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,540
and it's irrelevant to tie this to ethnic groups.

513
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,940
But, and again, in most of these gene people,

514
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,820
you go to these genetics channels, right?

515
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,980
And they'll tell you on these channels,

516
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,780
yeah, it looks like in the developed world

517
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,820
in the next 75 years, IQ in the developed world

518
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,020
is going to drop by about one standard deviation.

519
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,180
And then they're also like complaining.

520
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,300
It's also, so the developed world is mostly white people.

521
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,860
That means white people on average

522
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,980
will be dumber than everyone else

523
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,300
because we're not seeing this effect

524
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,500
in the developing world.

525
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,060
So it's one of these things we're still play that game.

526
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,100
It's not, it's not.

527
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,300
If we were going to go back to the wealth analogy,

528
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,340
obviously like first, and we also agree,

529
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,620
having a super high IQ doesn't mean obviously

530
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,700
you're going to be super successful.

531
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,300
There are lots of people with crazy high IQs

532
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,340
who do absolutely nothing,

533
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,140
who do a lot of really dumb stuff.

534
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,940
However, when you have a really high IQ

535
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,620
and you also have a bunch of other factors,

536
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,140
like drive, ambition, values, a vision for something,

537
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,700
you are going to have a much easier time achieving things.

538
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,380
And it's just, it's similar to having a lot of wealth.

539
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,860
There are tons of billionaires and millionaires

540
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,540
who genuinely don't do anything very interesting.

541
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,580
Ignoring your privilege is not a virtue.

542
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,420
Yeah.

543
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,220
So I got to continue with the piece of them.

544
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,180
So the, so what you see here, first of all,

545
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,900
is that the solution he's arguing is impractical

546
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,740
and specifically caters to the reason he wrote the piece.

547
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,060
Now, another thing to note is you need to go through

548
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,780
and see, okay, where does he concede

549
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,140
that the other side makes a good point?

550
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Never, never.

551
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,980
No, he does.

552
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
Oh, no, he does.

553
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,100
I guess when he says that basically like super low IQ

554
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,460
does have an impact, right?

555
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,300
He does admit that.

556
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140
No, but he says something

557
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,180
that absolutely destroys the entire piece.

558
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,740
Really? I missed that.

559
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
Yes, I will read it

560
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,220
because he says it so dismissively

561
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
that you could miss what he's saying.

562
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,140
Okay.

563
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,980
Okay.

564
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,340
The best measure, charlatans.

565
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,700
IQ is reminiscent of risk charlatans

566
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,900
insisting on selling value at risk var

567
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,380
and risk metrics saying it's the best measure

568
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,900
that best measure being unreliable

569
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,500
blew them up many times.

570
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,160
Note the class of suckers for whom a bad measure

571
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
is better than no measure across domains.

572
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
Now, Simone, you just heard that

573
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,720
and you probably heard nothing

574
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
because when it was written poorly,

575
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
it was structured poorly.

576
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,000
It didn't really get across this point,

577
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
but it did make a concession.

578
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Okay.

579
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,280
A very important concession

580
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,000
that IQ actually is the single best measure

581
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,440
that we have access to for adult success.

582
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,400
He conceded it's the best measure.

583
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,120
He just thinks even being the best measure,

584
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
it is not a good enough measure.

585
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,720
Because it isn't perfect.

586
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,880
Because it's imperfect.

587
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
And therefore we shouldn't use it at all.

588
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,840
But the fact that he has now conceded

589
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,000
that out of all conceivable measures ever developed,

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,080
it is the best one.

591
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,200
That kind of sinks everything else

592
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,680
that he's talking about.

593
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,080
Because what that means is that when you're dealing

594
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,400
with broad base science,

595
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,640
which regularly needs to use something like this,

596
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,200
like land in the water hurting a population,

597
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
or is this academic solution working or not working?

598
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,440
Or is IQ declining in a population?

599
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,600
Or is IQ increasing in a population?

600
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
In another part here,

601
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,120
he mentions the Flynn effect should warn us,

602
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,840
not just that IQ is somewhat environmentally dependent,

603
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,680
but that it is at least partially circular.

604
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,920
So he's saying he concedes when IQ measures

605
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,880
support his belief system.

606
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Then they're real.

607
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,960
Then they're real.

608
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
Which is that IQ is nutritionally based to some extent

609
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
is shown by the Flynn effect.

610
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
And I had the reverse final thing,

611
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
but the Flynn effect means that the Flynn effect is real.

612
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,640
So he's willing to use it when it supports his worldview

613
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,480
and he distances himself from it

614
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,920
when it goes against his worldview.

615
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,880
Oh dear.

616
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
And then the final thing that I would say is,

617
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,120
and he fortunately does this for you, the reader,

618
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,320
is look at the actual data points the person is using.

619
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,760
He will put up data points and be like,

620
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,280
oh, look, the data points are all over the place.

621
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,400
And I'm gonna put them on the screen for the viewers here.

622
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,200
But if you actually look at these data points,

623
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
you could eyeball what it would look like

624
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,760
if you drew a line through this scatter plot.

625
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,000
It would look like a line going up into the right.

626
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,280
I know, but he seems to not understand,

627
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,240
I don't know, linear regression.

628
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,320
No, so he believes that because there is high variability

629
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
and keep in mind high variability once a person is rich.

630
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,080
So basically he concedes two things.

631
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,120
He concedes that low IQ matters and that IQ

632
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,080
is really highly determinant of how much money you make

633
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,120
under a certain amount of money.

634
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,880
However, anyone who even does believe in IQ,

635
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,200
like us would largely say, yeah,

636
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,840
but people who are earning like over a hundred K a year,

637
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,240
the amount that they earn is largely just luck-based.

638
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
It's not based on competence.

639
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Anyone would tell you that.

640
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,080
But most people are earning under that amount.

641
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,280
And that is why we focus on things like IQ

642
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,360
because that's where it is determinant.

643
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,120
So, hold on, but this is just like more broadly.

644
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,340
The real key thing was a piece like this,

645
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,800
when you're going through it,

646
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,720
is to look for what they are conceding

647
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
because that can tell you the few things

648
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
that are really strongly true.

649
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,320
The points he concedes is that IQ is the best measure

650
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,040
we have available to us right now

651
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,560
of correlating with adult success.

652
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,280
He does concede that it works really well

653
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,400
for low paying jobs and that low IQ

654
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,280
does really seem to hurt people.

655
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,920
He does concede that it works really well

656
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,400
for things like the military.

657
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,360
He does concede that, so across all of these areas,

658
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,960
I think what you can see is that,

659
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,640
yeah, IQ probably is a really useful measure.

660
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,440
And all of this comes back to-

661
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,880
But you forgot, he also makes this argument

662
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,920
that it's immoral.

663
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,800
He cleans the concept as immoral.

664
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,520
He uses that word.

665
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
The concept of IQ is immoral.

666
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,160
And again, this comes to,

667
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,360
now this comes looking outside of a piece, right?

668
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,880
So, before I was like, okay, don't look outside the piece,

669
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,320
but you can just sanity test it.

670
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,120
Be like, okay, well, if IQ is a bad measure

671
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,560
of competence, right?

672
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,040
Does it correlate?

673
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
What other things do I correlate

674
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,720
with competence as an individual?

675
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,120
Or do the person think broadly,

676
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,160
I guess if I was trying to determine

677
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,240
how good a group would be at, say,

678
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,360
graduating from college,

679
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,920
because adults have a very big financial incentive

680
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
to be able to determine that.

681
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,680
Well, they don't use IQ tests.

682
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,520
What are they using?

683
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
They're using SMH to Google.

684
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,320
What's the correlation between IQ tests and SAQ?

685
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
0.84, like really high, like very high correlation.

686
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,840
And so this is the problem.

687
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,160
All sort of tests of intelligence,

688
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,040
because intelligence is cross-correlated across domains,

689
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,880
are going to correlate with each other.

690
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,280
If I was looking at a school,

691
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,080
and I was looking at people who were scoring well

692
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,880
on biology tests, I could broadly guess and bet

693
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,200
pretty effectively that they would also score better

694
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,720
than other students on history tests or on mass tests.

695
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
And this is why when you're looking at things like IQ,

696
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
but then what's interesting,

697
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,200
and a lot of people might not know this,

698
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,400
is that then you expand this to other domains.

699
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,080
You look at the probability of raping someone.

700
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,200
It's also a lot lower.

701
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
You look at their probability of being in jail.

702
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,000
It's also a lot lower.

703
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,520
You look at their probability of murdering someone.

704
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,480
It's also a lot lower.

705
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,280
You look at their probability of getting in a car accident.

706
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,520
It's also a lot lower.

707
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,360
Generally, within any of these things,

708
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,080
it's almost, I'm not gonna say it's irrelevant

709
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,920
what you're measuring,

710
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
because some are better measures than others,

711
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,600
but you're clearly measuring something

712
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,480
if it's cross-correlated against

713
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
all of these different domains.

714
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,360
And so I think a lot of people will try to like blow smoke

715
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
in your face,

716
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
and it's really good to be able to recognize

717
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,680
when they're doing that.

718
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,520
And for them, like I even think from his perspective,

719
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,480
ideologically, what's at stake for him?

720
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,280
One, he thinks if IQ can be proven to be real,

721
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,640
that means that racism is right, which it doesn't.

722
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,840
As we have copiously pointed out on this show,

723
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,640
it is not intergenerationally,

724
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,880
durably tied to an ethnic group enough to matter.

725
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,080
But anything that you can measure and put a number to

726
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,280
is obviously going to differ between population groups.

727
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Duh, but that doesn't mean like one is better

728
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
or something like that.

729
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,000
It would, I guess, if it didn't change in between generations,

730
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,320
but it changes so, so, so quickly.

731
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,000
And then the second is that he ends up making an argument

732
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,280
that needs to say that he has achieved everything

733
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,840
that he has achieved in life

734
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,400
without systemic advantages.

735
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,480
He has just willed himself to this place that he is.

736
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,000
Simultaneously, while flaunting that systemic advantage.

737
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,720
In every sense, like to a fault,

738
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,520
like to a point of illegibility.

739
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah, and if you look at people like Simone and I,

740
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,400
I will admit that I, well, actually I don't think

741
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
I have a high IQ.

742
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,480
Well, I do have a high IQ.

743
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,040
I do have a high IQ when it's measured.

744
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,960
What I mean is that Simone might not mention this,

745
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,680
but she's in the top fraction of a percent.

746
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,120
She was measured recently for the autism exam,

747
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,640
but hold on Simone, I won't brag on you.

748
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,640
So what we do need to know is that the way that my brain

749
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,520
works when it comes to things is different enough

750
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,640
that it's not just like being smart.

751
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Like typically when I start something,

752
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm really bad at it.

753
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,320
Like when I started high school,

754
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,800
I was in the top, you know, half of my class.

755
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,880
I know I graduated obviously really near the top,

756
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,520
but I started bottom half.

757
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,280
When I went to SAT prep, I remember I almost got laughed

758
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,520
out of the room because I said I wanted to go

759
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,720
to Harvard or Stanford,

760
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
which obviously I did end up going to for MBA,

761
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,840
but they were like,

762
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,880
but you are the single lowest scores

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,480
in the entire prep class.

764
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,800
What are you talking about?

765
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,960
So I'm one of these people who always starts

766
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,440
like really lower than other people.

767
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,720
And then somehow ends up,

768
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,840
if I'm just persistent at something,

769
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
really sort of figuring out and getting it to click

770
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,680
at the end of the day.

771
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
But I think it might just be

772
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,360
because I see things differently,

773
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,840
but this seeing things differently

774
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
has to have some genetic component.

775
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
The advantages I have over other people,

776
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
I should never deny them

777
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,880
because that removes my ability to empathize

778
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,520
with an individual who tells me,

779
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,800
you don't understand.

780
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,320
I can't just do this thing

781
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,840
that you went out there and did.

782
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,680
Well, I wonder,

783
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,840
so one argument that Naseem Tileb makes also in his essay,

784
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,480
which we haven't, I think touched on a whole lot,

785
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,560
is like, you know, only pencil,

786
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,440
like paper pusher academic types

787
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
who to play with bureaucracy in follow direction

788
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,280
perform well on IQ tests.

789
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,560
And I mean, to your point, right?

790
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,960
You as actually a very anti-authoritarian anti-bureaucracy,

791
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,240
I'm not gonna fucking listen to you kind of person,

792
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,600
do really suck at a lot of IQ,

793
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,480
correlated whatever tests in the beginning,

794
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,160
but you also have the good sense and tenacity

795
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
to learn the system.

796
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
And I think a lot of what these tests

797
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,280
may also be measuring is people's willingness

798
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,200
to work with the system to their personal advantage.

799
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
And a lack of willingness to work with that system,

800
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,800
a lack of willingness to adapt and read directions

801
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,240
and listen is, you know,

802
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
regardless, they might not be measuring intelligence,

803
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,080
but it's measuring-

804
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
It's measuring willingness to learn

805
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,200
how to do what you need to do to get ahead in life.

806
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,640
And let's keep in mind what IQ is really measuring

807
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
because I think a lot of people miss this.

808
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,160
It is not, we use it as a quote unquote intelligence measure,

809
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,240
but it's really, it's claimed to fame

810
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,480
is that it has the highest corollatory factor

811
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,960
with life outcomes and that like economic outcomes mostly,

812
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
but other life outcomes.

813
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,200
And that's what we're looking at.

814
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
That's why we care about it as a statistic.

815
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,800
And I would say life outcomes were intelligence matters.

816
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,520
I would argue that the amount that you make

817
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,400
over 100K a year, your intelligence doesn't matter.

818
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
You're mostly dealing with luck at that point.

819
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,480
And so it does not surprise me at all

820
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,400
that it wouldn't be correlated at that point.

821
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,920
But in his world of, I guess, ultra smarty pants

822
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,160
who have made billions of dollars a year,

823
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,680
like that's where he's applying it

824
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,840
instead of at population levels.

825
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,560
Yeah, I think a lot of people like him,

826
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,600
people like him, I don't know if they, for years,

827
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,960
have even come into contact with people

828
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,440
who have an IQ like below 110, they just don't.

829
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,000
So I think it's also hard for them to even understand

830
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,840
like the true variance in IQ that's out there

831
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,200
and the effect that it has on people.

832
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,400
Yeah, and I would say the most important reason

833
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,920
why IQ matters right now and why people need

834
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,560
to be paying attention to IQ right now,

835
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,200
especially when he's, well, IQ only matters

836
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,560
when it's really low.

837
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,720
Well, if we're dealing with a quickly dropping IQ

838
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,960
for genetic reasons, which it looks like we are about,

839
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,160
again, one standard deviation drop in the next 75 years,

840
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,880
is what we see not just from IQ

841
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,600
being measured in developed countries,

842
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,680
we see this, the polygenic scores.

843
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,200
This is like the genetic makeups

844
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,640
as they are correlated to IQ.

845
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,040
We can see them appearing at a lower and lower frequency

846
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,960
in genetic banks over time.

847
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
We can then correlate the genes associated with a high IQ

848
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,120
and look at what other things they're highly tied to.

849
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,640
They are extremely highly tied

850
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
to a person's fertility success.

851
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,560
So the same genes that are correlated with IQ

852
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,000
are also correlated with low success in fertility situations.

853
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,840
Like you're looking at a car

854
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
and you can measure how fast it goes and predict that.

855
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,400
You can predict how fast it might go

856
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,720
by looking at its engineering.

857
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,440
You can read a report about how fast it's supposed to go

858
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,240
and all of these numbers correlate.

859
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,320
That's sort of what we're looking at with this IQ drop.

860
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,760
If it turns out that's real and we are ignoring that,

861
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,640
well, then IQ is really gonna fucking matter

862
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,200
because almost all of us in the developed world

863
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,800
are going to be at this incredibly low level of IQ

864
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,400
that even he says,

865
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,600
oh, this actually does have a very big effect.

866
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,920
And that's a problem that you ignore this

867
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
because it says something.

868
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, it's kind of like being like,

869
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,160
well, money makes no difference

870
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,520
unless you're like impoverished.

871
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,640
And yet like humanity's moving in this direction

872
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,920
toward poverty and let's just ignore the issue though

873
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,680
because it doesn't matter at all.

874
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,520
Yeah.

875
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,240
And so, yeah, I just wanted to close out with that.

876
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,200
That is the number one reason

877
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,680
why we can't just ignore IQ right now,

878
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,200
even though it might be convenient to ignore IQ right now.

879
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,520
And it's a shame, but, and as we pointed out,

880
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,880
IQ being real does not support the racist positions

881
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,680
so long as you are actually familiar

882
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,000
with the genetics of IQ.

883
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,960
It is because IQ is so heritable

884
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,640
that it doesn't matter from an ethnic perspective

885
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,280
because it's extreme level of heritability

886
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,360
is what allows it to change so quickly intergenerationally.

887
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,200
Yeah, which thank goodness.

888
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
And how persistently tied to an individual's ethnicity.

889
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,680
Yeah.

890
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,960
I mean, and let's be clear,

891
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,240
we would prefer a world in which everyone had

892
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,160
the same potential for achievement on everything.

893
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,960
You know, like a blank slate world would be way cooler.

894
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
We would prefer to be in one.

895
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,400
But, you know, to pretend that is how it is

896
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,960
just because you feel like that's a more moral world

897
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,800
doesn't mean it's a more moral world, right?

898
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,680
You could be like, oh, death is immoral.

899
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
So I don't believe in it,

900
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,160
but that's not going to change the fact

901
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,000
that you're going to die.

902
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
So.

903
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
Well, and it can cause you to make decisions

904
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
that hurt a lot of people.

905
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,760
And that's what gets me the most about this.

906
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,600
You know, when you look at our prison system,

907
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,800
the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.

908
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,680
And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage

909
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,560
when compared to you,

910
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,760
when you tell people to throw that out,

911
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,600
that what you are taking the most vulnerable people

912
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,040
in our society who are in a situation

913
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,240
due to something they had no control over

914
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,960
and completely acting like they had the same advantages

915
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,800
you did in life.

916
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,720
It is sick.

917
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,840
It is sick.

918
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
It is not moral.

919
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,360
And you need to get your fucking shit together

920
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,120
and actually look at the data

921
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,640
instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.

922
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,920
So you can play your little virtue game, okay?

923
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,720
Because people are suffering for your bullshit.

924
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,600
And so you can feel like a hero

925
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,000
without having to challenge actual real world problems

926
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,160
and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages

927
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,560
that you were born with, which other people worked.

928
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,720
And there you have it.

929
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,560
I love you.

930
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah, there we have it.

931
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,240
Okay.

932
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,080
Have a good one, Simone.

933
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,280
You too, gorgeous.

934
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,000
For anyone who wants to go to that pronatalist conference

935
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
that's being held in Austin,

936
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
a few points of clarification.

937
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,960
We are not running it.

938
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,840
We have no control over who's going.

939
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,880
We don't make any money from it.

940
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,440
However, we will be speaking there and we will be there

941
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,280
and we would be happy to meet up with people

942
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,640
who watch our show if you happen to be in the area.

943
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
Might even put something together

944
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,160
if you guys reach out and we get a critical mass of people.

945
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,760
We have secured a discount code for our fans,

946
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,640
which is pronatalists all caps.

947
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,880
And it should get you about 30% off the price of a ticket

948
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,080
if you are going.

949
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,560
Again, this is not affiliated with the foundation,

950
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,280
but if we can make things cheaper for our fans,

951
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,440
we're gonna do it.

952
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,920
And if we can meet with people

953
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,760
who are interested in this topic

954
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,160
or further evangelize our brand of pronatalism,

955
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,960
we are very excited to take every opportunity

956
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,200
we can to do that.
