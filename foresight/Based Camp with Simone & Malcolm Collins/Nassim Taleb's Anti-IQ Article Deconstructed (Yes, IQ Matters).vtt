00:00.000 --> 00:01.460
When you look at our prison system,

00:01.460 --> 00:04.620
the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.

00:04.620 --> 00:08.500
And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage

00:08.500 --> 00:09.380
when compared to you,

00:09.380 --> 00:11.620
when you tell people to throw that out,

00:11.620 --> 00:13.500
that what?

00:13.500 --> 00:16.380
You are taking the most vulnerable people in our society

00:16.380 --> 00:18.540
who are in a situation to do something

00:18.540 --> 00:22.980
they had no control over and completely acting

00:22.980 --> 00:25.380
like they had the same advantage as you did in life.

00:25.380 --> 00:26.600
It is sick.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.700
It is sick.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.140
It is not moral.

00:29.220 --> 00:31.300
And you need to get your fucking shit together

00:31.300 --> 00:33.060
and actually look at the data

00:33.060 --> 00:35.580
instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.860
So you can play your little virtue game, okay?

00:37.860 --> 00:41.660
Because people are suffering for your bullshit.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.540
And so you can feel like a hero

00:43.540 --> 00:47.940
without having to challenge actual real world problems

00:47.940 --> 00:51.100
and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages

00:51.100 --> 00:53.180
that you were born with, which other people worked.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.740
He ends up making an argument that needs to say

00:55.740 --> 00:57.020
that he has achieved everything

00:57.020 --> 00:58.580
that he has achieved in life

00:58.580 --> 01:00.020
without systemic advantages.

01:00.020 --> 01:05.020
And he has just willed himself to this place that he is.

01:05.220 --> 01:08.740
Simultaneously while flaunting that systemic advantage

01:08.740 --> 01:11.460
right in every sense, like to a fault,

01:11.460 --> 01:13.260
like to a point of illegibility.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.340
Would you like to know more?

01:16.340 --> 01:20.740
So Malcolm, what if I told you that obviously

01:20.740 --> 01:22.700
wealth doesn't predict success

01:22.700 --> 01:25.340
because there are tons of millionaires and billionaires

01:25.340 --> 01:26.900
who just do nothing with their lives

01:26.900 --> 01:28.780
and piss away all their money.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.540
And obviously being like super, super poor,

01:31.540 --> 01:33.460
like under the poverty line is a problem.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.420
But above a certain level,

01:35.420 --> 01:38.540
it really doesn't matter about how much money you have.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.660
Oh, I think that would make a lot of sense.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.380
I think that's exactly the type of thing

01:42.380 --> 01:43.900
a wealthy person would argue.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.300
Right, though.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.060
So I got to talk about how we got on this topic.

01:48.060 --> 01:50.700
We had a fan of the show stay over at our house

01:50.700 --> 01:52.380
because they happened to be passing through the area.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.620
And one of the things that they mentioned

01:53.620 --> 01:55.220
because they were like, well, this is an area

01:55.220 --> 01:58.140
where I question something that you guys talk about a lot.

01:58.140 --> 02:01.980
Specifically, he believed that IQ didn't matter at all.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.500
And the reason he believes this

02:03.500 --> 02:06.700
is because another smart person who he looked up to

02:06.700 --> 02:09.500
had argued this very passionately,

02:09.500 --> 02:11.900
specifically Naseem Taleb.

02:12.940 --> 02:14.940
He wrote this medium post about this

02:14.940 --> 02:18.900
called IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.820
And I read this medium post

02:20.820 --> 02:25.380
and I saw it as a really interesting opportunity

02:25.380 --> 02:30.380
because self-contained within the post itself

02:30.580 --> 02:34.300
was the proof that he was manipulating data

02:34.300 --> 02:36.780
and essentially lying to the reader.

02:36.780 --> 02:41.780
But what we want to try to do on this episode

02:41.940 --> 02:46.700
is to not just show that, yes, IQ likely does matter,

02:46.700 --> 02:50.300
but give you the tools necessary to,

02:50.300 --> 02:54.660
even if you don't understand the scientific language

02:54.660 --> 02:56.460
was which a person is arguing,

02:56.460 --> 02:59.080
i.e. in this case advanced statistics,

02:59.080 --> 03:00.980
even if you don't understand that,

03:00.980 --> 03:05.980
understand the telltale signs that a person is lying to you

03:06.540 --> 03:08.940
and be able to tell that they are lying to you

03:08.940 --> 03:11.100
even if you don't understand what they are saying.

03:11.100 --> 03:16.100
And better than all of that, get to deeper truths

03:16.260 --> 03:19.500
than you even could from reading an article

03:19.500 --> 03:23.060
from the perspective of somebody who agreed

03:23.060 --> 03:25.380
with what he is true or what you already believe.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.860
And by that, what I mean is if somebody

03:28.860 --> 03:32.260
who really believes in career is invested in IQ mattering,

03:32.260 --> 03:34.220
writes an article that IQ matters,

03:34.220 --> 03:35.780
well, they can't really trust it

03:35.780 --> 03:38.180
even cause they might be lying with statistics as well.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.780
If somebody who deeply believes IQ doesn't matter

03:40.780 --> 03:42.740
or at least tries to argue that

03:42.740 --> 03:44.900
has sprinkled throughout his article

03:44.900 --> 03:47.820
little admissions to where IQ does matter,

03:47.820 --> 03:49.580
you can know that at least in those areas

03:49.580 --> 03:53.020
it definitely matters because he has everything at stake

03:53.020 --> 03:54.380
in showing that it doesn't.

03:54.380 --> 03:56.980
So that's why learning to read articles

03:56.980 --> 03:58.580
in this way is really important.

03:58.580 --> 04:00.260
Now, before we go further with this,

04:00.260 --> 04:02.500
I wanna elaborate on the analogy

04:02.500 --> 04:04.260
that Simone started the show is

04:04.260 --> 04:06.660
because I think this is where we're going as a society.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.780
And a lot of these people today

04:08.780 --> 04:12.100
who were born with advantages over people,

04:12.100 --> 04:15.580
born with usually really high IQs,

04:15.580 --> 04:17.620
and then they pretend like they've achieved

04:17.620 --> 04:20.420
everything that they've achieved on their own,

04:20.420 --> 04:22.940
it is not the look that they think it is.

04:22.940 --> 04:26.380
It's very much the new, I don't see race.

04:26.380 --> 04:29.100
Pretending you don't see a systemic advantage

04:29.100 --> 04:32.260
that you have had over other people your entire life

04:32.260 --> 04:33.340
and taking credit being like,

04:33.340 --> 04:36.220
well, I was starting from the same position they were

04:36.220 --> 04:38.740
is not humble, okay?

04:38.740 --> 04:43.740
It is dehumanizing and it is cruel and evil

04:44.060 --> 04:46.340
and it prevents us as a society

04:46.340 --> 04:49.180
from potentially solving systemic issues

04:49.180 --> 04:53.140
for people who weren't born with your immense privilege.

04:53.140 --> 04:56.460
I say this to Nassid because he is somebody

04:56.460 --> 04:57.820
who was born with this immense privilege.

04:57.820 --> 05:00.780
Yeah, he's clearly someone who is very smart

05:00.780 --> 05:02.300
and who benefits from a high IQ.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.060
And if he were to in good faith take an IQ test,

05:06.060 --> 05:08.740
he would probably end up with a very high IQ score.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.140
Like it's pretty apparent.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.140
I wanna start off too with some caveats that like,

05:13.140 --> 05:15.820
you know, a lot of what he says is we agree with,

05:15.820 --> 05:18.180
you know, IQ, like if you have a really high IQ,

05:18.180 --> 05:20.180
it doesn't mean you're gonna be super successful,

05:20.180 --> 05:22.380
obviously not, you know, this is why with our school

05:22.380 --> 05:24.740
we select for I will as we say and not IQ

05:24.740 --> 05:26.020
because, you know, being really smart

05:26.020 --> 05:28.140
does not predict success, but he claims

05:28.140 --> 05:31.380
that's what like IQ enthusiasts also claim,

05:31.380 --> 05:33.100
which is not, it's just not true.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.420
So he makes a lot of false claims on that.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.900
I just wanna say that we agree.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.540
He also says a really key thing with IQ is like it,

05:38.540 --> 05:41.260
where it is most predictive and where it is the biggest deal

05:41.260 --> 05:44.180
is where there's really low IQ, but he seems to like,

05:44.180 --> 05:45.620
I don't know, just discount that.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.260
That's not important when actually like,

05:47.260 --> 05:48.300
it's been a really big deal.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.220
This is why lead remediation, you know,

05:50.220 --> 05:52.100
like reducing lead exposure for populations

05:52.100 --> 05:53.700
has been such a big deal.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.540
He also-

05:54.540 --> 05:58.060
Which was caught and measured through IQ.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.580
This is the place where IQ in public policy

06:00.580 --> 06:03.180
has had a positive impact on the lives

06:03.180 --> 06:05.460
of pretty much everyone living on earth today.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.020
Yeah, because people were willing to admit that,

06:07.020 --> 06:08.860
you know, the low IQ is a problem.

06:08.860 --> 06:11.380
And then also he talks about, you know,

06:11.380 --> 06:14.900
people misusing IQ often in very unsavory, disgusting ways.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.700
You know, he points to racism a lot.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.940
That's totally true.

06:17.940 --> 06:21.540
But all sorts of messed up people use like misuse,

06:21.540 --> 06:23.580
all sorts of science and pseudoscience

06:23.580 --> 06:26.460
and other nonsense to forward their agendas.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.820
Just because you see one idiot use something in a poor way,

06:29.820 --> 06:31.340
doesn't mean it's not, you know,

06:31.340 --> 06:33.900
it's not a relevant field in other ways.

06:33.900 --> 06:34.740
So-

06:34.740 --> 06:36.020
Before we go further with this,

06:36.020 --> 06:40.780
I think we can break this down into a few core points

06:40.780 --> 06:42.420
when you're analyzing an article like this.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.260
Okay, okay.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.460
Yeah, let's do it.

06:44.460 --> 06:48.380
So one is you're looking for what the motivation is.

06:48.380 --> 06:52.340
Then you want to look at the data sets that they present.

06:52.340 --> 06:57.020
You want to look at what they think the alternatives are

06:57.020 --> 06:57.860
that they're presenting.

06:57.860 --> 07:00.900
If IQ doesn't matter, what are the alternatives?

07:00.900 --> 07:03.180
You need to look at where they concede

07:03.180 --> 07:05.660
that the other side has points.

07:05.660 --> 07:10.300
And you need to look at what I call repeated hand flails.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.740
A repeated hand flail is a really bad argument

07:14.740 --> 07:16.980
that is used repeatedly

07:16.980 --> 07:19.060
and that is obviously a bad argument,

07:19.060 --> 07:22.260
but that at first glance can seem

07:22.260 --> 07:24.500
like it's a really powerful argument.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.020
So I'll start with a repeated hand flail

07:27.020 --> 07:28.860
that he uses throughout the piece.

07:28.860 --> 07:31.500
Because it's really obvious and it really got on my nerves.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.540
Which was IQ doesn't matter

07:34.540 --> 07:36.580
because the same individual,

07:36.580 --> 07:38.420
if you test them again with an IQ test,

07:38.420 --> 07:40.020
on average that test is going to differ

07:40.020 --> 07:43.740
from their first score by about a third of standard deviation.

07:43.740 --> 07:45.260
And that's a big difference.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.220
And therefore that proves that IQ tests don't matter.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.700
Now, I ask a person to just,

07:50.700 --> 07:52.980
and this is how when you're hearing something like this

07:52.980 --> 07:55.380
and you're like, okay, he's using a lot of words

07:55.380 --> 07:57.060
like the standard deviation

07:57.060 --> 08:00.540
and comparing this to different parts of the IQ stuff.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.580
Ignore all of that.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.660
Just use your common sense, okay?

08:03.660 --> 08:05.900
So replace IQ test with a different test.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.460
Like a biology test, right?

08:07.460 --> 08:11.420
Like I'm taking a 10th grade biology test

08:11.420 --> 08:13.700
and I am comparing my knowledge of biology

08:13.700 --> 08:16.460
to the other students in the room's knowledge of biology.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.100
Now, if I retake that test,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.500
if you retake any test about,

08:20.500 --> 08:24.140
you are going to differentiate from your previous results

08:24.140 --> 08:25.980
by about a third of a standard deviation.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.140
If it's like a really big test.

08:28.140 --> 08:28.980
That's just normal.

08:28.980 --> 08:29.820
Anyone should know,

08:29.820 --> 08:31.180
you're not gonna get the same results

08:31.180 --> 08:33.260
like every time you retake a test.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.700
That's a normal function of tests.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.740
However, that being the case,

08:37.740 --> 08:39.980
that doesn't mean that biology test

08:39.980 --> 08:41.660
isn't measuring anything

08:41.660 --> 08:43.780
in terms of a student's knowledge of biology.

08:43.780 --> 08:44.860
Interesting biology.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.100
And so this is the first thing.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.740
When they are criticizing something,

08:48.740 --> 08:51.500
like if they're continually using an argument, think,

08:51.500 --> 08:53.220
okay, but is there something else

08:53.220 --> 08:54.660
that we all generally agree on?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.620
That the bar is a good way

08:56.620 --> 08:58.820
to measure how good a lawyer is doing

08:58.820 --> 09:01.940
or that driver's exams are a good way to measure,

09:01.940 --> 09:04.100
do these have different results

09:04.100 --> 09:06.220
when a single individual retakes the test?

09:06.220 --> 09:08.180
And the answer is yes.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.100
Well, then why does he keep bringing this up?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.100
Why is it so important?

09:11.100 --> 09:12.540
It is because, well,

09:12.540 --> 09:14.740
it's just a weird rhetorical tactic

09:14.740 --> 09:16.020
he keeps going back to.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.540
Yeah, I think connected to this kind of

09:18.540 --> 09:19.980
is at the very beginning,

09:19.980 --> 09:22.100
and this was like a big trigger for me.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.980
He says technical backbone,

09:24.980 --> 09:27.020
like he links to a technical backbone

09:27.020 --> 09:28.780
as here's just like at the top of his article,

09:28.780 --> 09:31.740
here's my link to basically what he implies is,

09:31.740 --> 09:33.900
oh, if you really wanna understand why I'm correct

09:33.900 --> 09:35.660
and you wanna see it on a technical standpoint,

09:35.660 --> 09:37.580
an academic peer reviewed standpoint,

09:37.580 --> 09:39.100
this will explain everything.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.060
And you click over to it and it's just a research journal

09:43.060 --> 09:45.020
article pointing to examples

09:45.020 --> 09:48.340
of people mistaking correlation with causation.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.780
It isn't actually related to the arguments

09:50.780 --> 09:53.300
he makes in his blog post.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.740
And it's one of those things that really bothers me

09:54.740 --> 09:57.260
because often people will link to something

09:57.260 --> 09:59.700
and be like, oh, here's what backs up my argument.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.220
And it, I mean, usually it's at least broadly related

10:03.220 --> 10:04.060
to their argument.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.660
This even wasn't really related to his argument.

10:05.660 --> 10:06.780
He sometimes argued that, oh,

10:06.780 --> 10:08.980
people don't understand correlation and causation.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.580
But yeah, that really bothered me.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.380
People are like, read this other thing.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.300
You mentioned that I would note as well,

10:14.300 --> 10:16.140
should be a big red flag with people.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.460
Smart people can write in a way

10:18.460 --> 10:20.660
that dumb people can understand.

10:20.660 --> 10:21.540
Yes.

10:21.540 --> 10:24.700
When we were right, people like who watch our channel

10:24.700 --> 10:28.700
and stuff like that, they sometimes accuse us of talking,

10:28.700 --> 10:31.020
like we have a theothorus in front of us.

10:31.020 --> 10:31.860
Okay, whatever.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.940
I don't think that we do that.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.340
To me, I talk really plain

10:34.340 --> 10:36.820
and that reminds me of that scene in Idiocracy

10:36.820 --> 10:37.980
where they're like,

10:37.980 --> 10:41.100
I think it might be because of these drugs the army put me on.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.500
But if you could just get me well enough

10:43.500 --> 10:44.660
to get back to base.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.740
Right.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.180
Kick ass.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.540
Well, don't want to sound like a dick or nothing,

10:50.540 --> 10:54.260
but it says on your chart that you're fucked up.

10:54.260 --> 10:57.420
You talk like a fag and your shit's all retarded.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.860
What I do is just saying thing.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.100
Yeah, you know what I mean?

11:03.100 --> 11:07.100
Like, no, I'm serious here.

11:07.940 --> 11:08.980
I need help.

11:08.980 --> 11:10.820
There's that fag talk we talked about.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.900
But yeah, and there's that scene

11:12.900 --> 11:14.660
where he's just trying to talk a normal

11:14.660 --> 11:17.100
and the other person just from a different cultural group

11:17.100 --> 11:20.220
here that is intentionally training to sound erudite.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.580
Well, but he does really gatekeep throughout this essay.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.260
For example, like in one sentence,

11:25.260 --> 11:26.940
well, however, if you take up a perian,

11:26.940 --> 11:29.500
havenky and view of intelligence in another sentence,

11:29.500 --> 11:32.220
he's IQ doesn't detect convexity of mistakes.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.980
Like, what?

11:33.980 --> 11:37.220
So with the point being here is what I was saying,

11:37.220 --> 11:40.620
is that for us, when we use words that sound,

11:40.620 --> 11:42.380
I don't know, it's a somebody different from us

11:42.380 --> 11:44.020
that we're using as the source or something,

11:44.020 --> 11:46.700
they are still intelligible in context.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.780
They are not intentionally meant to get a viewer

11:50.780 --> 11:54.020
to disengage or sort of shut down

11:54.020 --> 11:55.300
and just listen to the other one.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.140
And be like, oh, I guess I'll have to take your word for it

11:57.140 --> 11:58.380
because I don't understand this

11:58.380 --> 11:59.900
and therefore you must be smarter than me.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.580
So I'm just gonna assume that you're right.

12:01.580 --> 12:02.420
Yeah.

12:02.420 --> 12:05.780
And I would say that if you notice that happening in a piece

12:05.780 --> 12:07.580
and never ever take away from that,

12:07.580 --> 12:09.380
this person knows what they're talking about.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.820
Yeah, but can you believe he's like literally

12:11.820 --> 12:16.820
in an article that he's using to disprove IQ as like a thing,

12:16.980 --> 12:21.540
he's using IQ correlated vocabulary nonsense.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.900
Using SAT words.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.340
Yeah, I'm like, the fuck, you know, he talks always,

12:25.340 --> 12:27.380
he's like, you know, this isn't Gaussian.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.700
And okay, you know what, honestly,

12:28.700 --> 12:30.580
like I've been out of academia long enough

12:30.580 --> 12:32.700
to have forgotten that Gaussian was in reference

12:32.700 --> 12:34.060
to a normal distribution.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.660
He could have just said normal distribution.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.860
This man who apparently throughout his writing

12:37.860 --> 12:39.900
makes it very clear that he really hates academia

12:39.900 --> 12:42.260
uses a lot of academic speech,

12:42.260 --> 12:43.860
which is also really interesting.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.660
The techniques and I love the first point you mentioned,

12:45.660 --> 12:46.660
which is a huge red flag.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.740
If somebody says, here's a source

12:48.740 --> 12:50.140
and the source has nothing to do

12:50.140 --> 12:51.740
is what they're talking about really

12:51.740 --> 12:53.900
or is really just meant to shit on academics.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.500
That's all it was trying to do.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.940
And he doesn't say that's what this is.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.460
You need to be aware that at the very outside of this piece,

13:02.460 --> 13:04.340
he's saying, I am willing to mislead you

13:04.340 --> 13:06.060
to try to make my point.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.340
That is what is being signaled here.

13:07.340 --> 13:09.620
But first we gotta go back to this framework I set up.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.100
Okay, so what is his motivation with this piece?

13:12.100 --> 13:13.860
Because he cites his motivation

13:13.860 --> 13:16.900
throughout the piece very plainly.

13:16.900 --> 13:20.060
He cites very clearly that he believes

13:20.060 --> 13:25.060
that if IQ is a real thing, then the racists are correct.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.180
And racists will be able to implement racist policy,

13:29.180 --> 13:31.420
which will hurt people if IQ is a real.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.060
This is like second paragraph.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.180
People bent on showing that some populations

13:35.180 --> 13:36.940
have inferior mental abilities

13:36.940 --> 13:39.220
based on IQ equals intelligence.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.420
Those have been upset with me for robbing them

13:41.420 --> 13:43.420
of this quote unquote scientific tool.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.700
His goal right here, he lays it out.

13:45.700 --> 13:50.180
Second paragraph, I am trying to rob racist of a tool.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.300
Now see the way I read that section

13:52.300 --> 13:53.980
is he gives a bulleted list

13:53.980 --> 13:56.860
and he's like basically IQ was something championed by,

13:56.860 --> 13:58.780
first he says racist and eugenicists,

13:58.780 --> 14:01.380
and second he says psychometrics peddlers

14:01.380 --> 14:02.380
looking for suckers.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.820
And I thought what he was trying to do there

14:03.820 --> 14:06.740
was basically associate this domain

14:06.740 --> 14:10.260
with unsavory people and exploitative people.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.740
I think he also uses the association to discredit

14:12.740 --> 14:16.100
anyone who talks about IQ, but just saying they're racists.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.740
Okay, so he's using it for two reasons.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.420
But it is very clear from the piece

14:20.420 --> 14:23.820
that he believes that if IQ is a real thing,

14:23.820 --> 14:25.580
then the racists are right.

14:25.580 --> 14:28.580
I get in the outro, the argument that quote unquote,

14:28.580 --> 14:30.020
some races are better at running,

14:30.020 --> 14:32.300
hence inference about the brain is stale,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.540
mental capacity is much more,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.140
he goes over this over and over.

14:35.140 --> 14:35.980
It is very clear.

14:35.980 --> 14:40.100
So he's implying that all races are equally good at running?

14:41.100 --> 14:44.620
No, he's implying that doesn't mean that there would be,

14:44.620 --> 14:45.820
okay, listen to this point.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.500
This is actually a really good point

14:47.500 --> 14:49.340
of somebody messing with you.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.860
The argument that quote,

14:50.860 --> 14:52.700
some races are better at running,

14:52.700 --> 14:56.660
end quote, hence some inference about the brain is stale,

14:56.660 --> 14:58.860
mental capacity is much more dimensional

14:58.860 --> 15:00.580
and not defined in the same way,

15:00.580 --> 15:02.260
running a hundred meter dashes.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.940
What?

15:04.940 --> 15:07.380
So what he's saying is that because this is a more

15:07.380 --> 15:09.220
complicated thing to measure,

15:09.220 --> 15:12.140
that it axiomatically doesn't vary

15:12.140 --> 15:13.900
between different ethnic groups.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.340
Oh, okay, right, right, right.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.940
Because intelligence is harder to measure

15:16.940 --> 15:19.580
and like nail down in this glommy weird thing.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.940
It's just a hand wave.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.660
Now there are reasons why,

15:22.660 --> 15:25.180
and we have done videos on this,

15:25.180 --> 15:28.180
why if you can measure anything in a group,

15:28.180 --> 15:29.180
measure anything in a group.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.780
And it's clear that he believes this

15:30.780 --> 15:33.860
and this is why he is so sold on this point.

15:33.860 --> 15:37.100
You can measure anything in a group like tennis ability.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.580
You are going to find systemic differences between groups.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.260
That's just natural.

15:42.260 --> 15:47.260
The reason why IQ based race realism is irrelevant,

15:47.420 --> 15:48.980
and we've done this before,

15:48.980 --> 15:52.780
is because it changes so quickly in your generation.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.180
If you look, like we were looking,

15:54.180 --> 15:56.740
okay, we had 50 embryos, like just our family.

15:56.740 --> 15:58.980
And we choose five embryos out of those 50

15:58.980 --> 16:02.660
based on IQ, pure generation with existing technology.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.060
And our kids only marry other families who did that.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.060
Within just five generations,

16:07.060 --> 16:10.380
the average member of our family would be three standard

16:10.380 --> 16:12.300
deviations higher in IQ

16:12.300 --> 16:14.300
than the average American citizen today.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.420
And keep in mind that within the next 75 years,

16:16.420 --> 16:18.020
we're likely looking at IQ dropping

16:18.020 --> 16:19.060
by a standard deviation.

16:19.060 --> 16:22.340
So for like just astronomically higher.

16:22.340 --> 16:25.300
And what this shows is that it doesn't matter.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.180
This would be true if we were black.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.060
This would be true if we were Asian.

16:29.980 --> 16:32.580
IQ doesn't matter not because it doesn't differ

16:32.580 --> 16:33.540
between groups.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.820
Everything, if you measure it,

16:34.820 --> 16:35.740
if you can put a number to it,

16:35.740 --> 16:37.060
it's going to differ between groups.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.900
But any selective or evolutionary bottle,

16:38.900 --> 16:39.980
like you're trying to say.

16:39.980 --> 16:43.060
It matters because it doesn't persistently differ between.

16:43.060 --> 16:44.860
And it can quickly change.

16:44.860 --> 16:47.620
And it matters a lot more what like family you come from

16:47.620 --> 16:48.980
or what religion you come from.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.220
Yeah, or what environment you're in

16:50.220 --> 16:51.700
with the selective pressures are.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.540
What small, yeah.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.740
So that's why it doesn't matter.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.780
But he hasn't thought of that argument.

16:56.780 --> 16:59.380
And so he is just completely dedicated

16:59.380 --> 17:02.020
because he knows the moment you could put,

17:02.020 --> 17:05.580
and this becomes very clear later in his argumentation,

17:05.580 --> 17:09.900
the moment you could put a number on general competence

17:09.900 --> 17:12.900
that there would be differences between ethnic groups.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.100
Because of course, I mean, they might be minor differences,

17:15.100 --> 17:17.540
but people would still pick up on that.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.780
And then that motivates racism.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.780
And you can actually tell this is his core motivation

17:22.780 --> 17:24.780
by, again, I say, what is he proposing

17:24.780 --> 17:26.900
as the alternative to IQ, right?

17:26.900 --> 17:31.500
So if he was being, I think, genuine,

17:31.500 --> 17:33.300
I just think IQ tests are bad

17:33.300 --> 17:35.420
and we could be measuring this better,

17:35.420 --> 17:37.740
you would be proposing a way to measure it better.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.340
But he doesn't propose a way to measure it better.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.180
Yeah, that's true.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.420
And we would respect that.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.060
I mean, I think we inherently under,

17:43.060 --> 17:47.020
we would agree with him that current measures of IQ,

17:47.220 --> 17:48.740
they could definitely approve.

17:48.740 --> 17:51.020
But let's, I want to read this.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.700
If you want to detect how someone fares at a task,

17:53.700 --> 17:55.820
say, loan sharking, tennis playing,

17:55.820 --> 17:59.260
or a random matrix theory, make him or her do that task.

17:59.260 --> 18:02.020
We don't need theoretical exams for real world function

18:02.020 --> 18:04.940
by probability challenge psychologists.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.060
So think about what this is saying

18:07.060 --> 18:09.460
and how completely insane this is.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.740
He is actually saying that I am unwilling

18:11.740 --> 18:13.500
to have any sort of broad measure

18:13.500 --> 18:15.100
of competence put on a person.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.300
And the reason he has to take this position

18:17.300 --> 18:19.940
is because whatever measure of competence he found,

18:19.940 --> 18:22.580
you would find differences in it between groups.

18:22.580 --> 18:26.300
So he needs there to be no standard measure of competence

18:26.300 --> 18:29.460
given his world framing that he has laid out.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.740
If you can put a measure on people's competence,

18:31.740 --> 18:33.380
then it will differ between groups

18:33.380 --> 18:36.460
that it can be used by racists to promote their agenda.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.140
That is a core thing.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.780
So going into this piece,

18:40.780 --> 18:44.820
he's going into it with the world perspective

18:44.860 --> 18:47.580
that if you could put any sort of broad measure

18:47.580 --> 18:51.220
of competence on a group, that it will lead to racism.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.940
And so we should not have that.

18:52.940 --> 18:55.940
But think about how insane that would be for a society.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.340
That would also mean, well, you can't have SATs.

18:58.340 --> 19:02.340
You can't really have any sort of a broadly applicable test.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.540
Every test that needs to only study

19:04.540 --> 19:06.140
what a person is about to do.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.100
But the problem is that we hire people

19:08.100 --> 19:10.300
and we accept people into college.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.700
Based on totally unrelated.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.100
To do broad ranges of tasks.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.860
One of the core places like he was using

19:15.860 --> 19:20.700
as he mentioned in the piece, is in the military.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.220
And that's because you need a broad spectrum of knowledge.

19:23.220 --> 19:24.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.260
Well, it doesn't seem to be predictive of outcome.

19:26.260 --> 19:29.060
And again, we want to emphasize here that we're not,

19:29.060 --> 19:32.020
we don't disagree with the basic argument he's making.

19:32.020 --> 19:34.340
The school that we're designing,

19:34.340 --> 19:37.420
whenever possible, tests people through natural assessments.

19:37.420 --> 19:40.260
Hey, can you write content that audience,

19:40.260 --> 19:41.660
like widespread audiences?

19:41.660 --> 19:43.340
Okay, well, let's see if you can write a fan fiction

19:43.340 --> 19:44.180
that a lot of people read.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.900
Like we believe in natural assessments

19:45.900 --> 19:47.380
and we believe that's the best way to tell

19:47.380 --> 19:48.820
if someone's good at something,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.980
but we also are practical.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.500
Yeah, well, I think also at the same time,

19:53.500 --> 19:56.940
we accept that some people are born

19:56.940 --> 19:59.140
with an intellectual state that gives them

19:59.140 --> 20:02.900
a huge systemic advantage over other people.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.420
And this, again, it's not an ethic thing.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.940
As we said, it changes so quickly

20:05.940 --> 20:08.540
and it's irrelevant to tie this to ethnic groups.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.940
But, and again, in most of these gene people,

20:11.940 --> 20:13.820
you go to these genetics channels, right?

20:13.820 --> 20:14.980
And they'll tell you on these channels,

20:14.980 --> 20:16.780
yeah, it looks like in the developed world

20:16.780 --> 20:19.820
in the next 75 years, IQ in the developed world

20:19.820 --> 20:22.020
is going to drop by about one standard deviation.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.180
And then they're also like complaining.

20:24.180 --> 20:26.300
It's also, so the developed world is mostly white people.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.860
That means white people on average

20:27.860 --> 20:28.980
will be dumber than everyone else

20:28.980 --> 20:30.300
because we're not seeing this effect

20:30.300 --> 20:31.500
in the developing world.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.060
So it's one of these things we're still play that game.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.100
It's not, it's not.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.300
If we were going to go back to the wealth analogy,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.340
obviously like first, and we also agree,

20:39.340 --> 20:41.620
having a super high IQ doesn't mean obviously

20:41.620 --> 20:42.700
you're going to be super successful.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.300
There are lots of people with crazy high IQs

20:44.300 --> 20:45.340
who do absolutely nothing,

20:45.340 --> 20:47.140
who do a lot of really dumb stuff.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.940
However, when you have a really high IQ

20:49.940 --> 20:51.620
and you also have a bunch of other factors,

20:51.620 --> 20:55.140
like drive, ambition, values, a vision for something,

20:55.140 --> 20:57.700
you are going to have a much easier time achieving things.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.380
And it's just, it's similar to having a lot of wealth.

20:59.380 --> 21:00.860
There are tons of billionaires and millionaires

21:00.860 --> 21:02.540
who genuinely don't do anything very interesting.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.580
Ignoring your privilege is not a virtue.

21:04.580 --> 21:05.420
Yeah.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.220
So I got to continue with the piece of them.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.180
So the, so what you see here, first of all,

21:10.180 --> 21:13.900
is that the solution he's arguing is impractical

21:13.900 --> 21:17.740
and specifically caters to the reason he wrote the piece.

21:17.740 --> 21:21.060
Now, another thing to note is you need to go through

21:21.060 --> 21:23.780
and see, okay, where does he concede

21:23.780 --> 21:26.140
that the other side makes a good point?

21:26.140 --> 21:27.140
Never, never.

21:27.140 --> 21:27.980
No, he does.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.820
Oh, no, he does.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.100
I guess when he says that basically like super low IQ

21:31.100 --> 21:32.460
does have an impact, right?

21:32.460 --> 21:33.300
He does admit that.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.140
No, but he says something

21:34.140 --> 21:36.180
that absolutely destroys the entire piece.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.740
Really? I missed that.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.940
Yes, I will read it

21:38.940 --> 21:41.220
because he says it so dismissively

21:41.220 --> 21:43.220
that you could miss what he's saying.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.140
Okay.

21:44.140 --> 21:44.980
Okay.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.340
The best measure, charlatans.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.700
IQ is reminiscent of risk charlatans

21:51.700 --> 21:54.900
insisting on selling value at risk var

21:54.900 --> 21:58.380
and risk metrics saying it's the best measure

21:58.380 --> 22:01.900
that best measure being unreliable

22:01.900 --> 22:03.500
blew them up many times.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.160
Note the class of suckers for whom a bad measure

22:07.160 --> 22:09.720
is better than no measure across domains.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.040
Now, Simone, you just heard that

22:11.040 --> 22:12.720
and you probably heard nothing

22:12.720 --> 22:14.160
because when it was written poorly,

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
it was structured poorly.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.000
It didn't really get across this point,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.920
but it did make a concession.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.760
Okay.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.280
A very important concession

22:21.280 --> 22:25.000
that IQ actually is the single best measure

22:25.000 --> 22:29.440
that we have access to for adult success.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.400
He conceded it's the best measure.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.120
He just thinks even being the best measure,

22:34.120 --> 22:35.560
it is not a good enough measure.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.720
Because it isn't perfect.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.880
Because it's imperfect.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.720
And therefore we shouldn't use it at all.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.840
But the fact that he has now conceded

22:41.840 --> 22:45.000
that out of all conceivable measures ever developed,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.080
it is the best one.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.200
That kind of sinks everything else

22:49.200 --> 22:50.680
that he's talking about.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.080
Because what that means is that when you're dealing

22:53.080 --> 22:55.400
with broad base science,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.640
which regularly needs to use something like this,

22:57.640 --> 23:00.200
like land in the water hurting a population,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.800
or is this academic solution working or not working?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.440
Or is IQ declining in a population?

23:04.440 --> 23:06.600
Or is IQ increasing in a population?

23:06.600 --> 23:07.560
In another part here,

23:07.560 --> 23:11.120
he mentions the Flynn effect should warn us,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.840
not just that IQ is somewhat environmentally dependent,

23:13.840 --> 23:16.680
but that it is at least partially circular.

23:16.680 --> 23:20.920
So he's saying he concedes when IQ measures

23:20.920 --> 23:22.880
support his belief system.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
Then they're real.

23:23.880 --> 23:24.960
Then they're real.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.640
Which is that IQ is nutritionally based to some extent

23:28.640 --> 23:30.240
is shown by the Flynn effect.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.280
And I had the reverse final thing,

23:31.280 --> 23:34.240
but the Flynn effect means that the Flynn effect is real.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.640
So he's willing to use it when it supports his worldview

23:38.640 --> 23:40.480
and he distances himself from it

23:40.480 --> 23:41.920
when it goes against his worldview.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.880
Oh dear.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.200
And then the final thing that I would say is,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.120
and he fortunately does this for you, the reader,

23:48.120 --> 23:51.320
is look at the actual data points the person is using.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.760
He will put up data points and be like,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.280
oh, look, the data points are all over the place.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.400
And I'm gonna put them on the screen for the viewers here.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.200
But if you actually look at these data points,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.320
you could eyeball what it would look like

24:04.320 --> 24:06.760
if you drew a line through this scatter plot.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.000
It would look like a line going up into the right.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.280
I know, but he seems to not understand,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.240
I don't know, linear regression.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.320
No, so he believes that because there is high variability

24:18.320 --> 24:21.360
and keep in mind high variability once a person is rich.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.080
So basically he concedes two things.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.120
He concedes that low IQ matters and that IQ

24:26.120 --> 24:30.080
is really highly determinant of how much money you make

24:30.080 --> 24:32.120
under a certain amount of money.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.880
However, anyone who even does believe in IQ,

24:35.880 --> 24:37.200
like us would largely say, yeah,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.840
but people who are earning like over a hundred K a year,

24:39.840 --> 24:43.240
the amount that they earn is largely just luck-based.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.680
It's not based on competence.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.000
Anyone would tell you that.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.080
But most people are earning under that amount.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.280
And that is why we focus on things like IQ

24:50.280 --> 24:52.360
because that's where it is determinant.

24:52.360 --> 24:56.120
So, hold on, but this is just like more broadly.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.340
The real key thing was a piece like this,

24:58.340 --> 24:59.800
when you're going through it,

24:59.840 --> 25:02.720
is to look for what they are conceding

25:02.720 --> 25:04.320
because that can tell you the few things

25:04.320 --> 25:06.320
that are really strongly true.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.320
The points he concedes is that IQ is the best measure

25:09.320 --> 25:11.040
we have available to us right now

25:11.040 --> 25:13.560
of correlating with adult success.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.280
He does concede that it works really well

25:16.280 --> 25:18.400
for low paying jobs and that low IQ

25:18.400 --> 25:20.280
does really seem to hurt people.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.920
He does concede that it works really well

25:22.920 --> 25:24.400
for things like the military.

25:24.400 --> 25:29.360
He does concede that, so across all of these areas,

25:29.400 --> 25:31.960
I think what you can see is that,

25:31.960 --> 25:34.640
yeah, IQ probably is a really useful measure.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.440
And all of this comes back to-

25:36.440 --> 25:38.880
But you forgot, he also makes this argument

25:38.880 --> 25:40.920
that it's immoral.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.800
He cleans the concept as immoral.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.520
He uses that word.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.920
The concept of IQ is immoral.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.160
And again, this comes to,

25:47.160 --> 25:50.360
now this comes looking outside of a piece, right?

25:50.360 --> 25:53.880
So, before I was like, okay, don't look outside the piece,

25:53.880 --> 25:55.320
but you can just sanity test it.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.120
Be like, okay, well, if IQ is a bad measure

25:59.120 --> 26:01.560
of competence, right?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.040
Does it correlate?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.640
What other things do I correlate

26:04.640 --> 26:05.720
with competence as an individual?

26:05.720 --> 26:07.120
Or do the person think broadly,

26:07.120 --> 26:09.160
I guess if I was trying to determine

26:09.160 --> 26:11.240
how good a group would be at, say,

26:11.240 --> 26:12.360
graduating from college,

26:12.360 --> 26:15.920
because adults have a very big financial incentive

26:15.920 --> 26:17.320
to be able to determine that.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.680
Well, they don't use IQ tests.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.520
What are they using?

26:19.520 --> 26:20.480
They're using SMH to Google.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.320
What's the correlation between IQ tests and SAQ?

26:23.320 --> 26:28.320
0.84, like really high, like very high correlation.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.840
And so this is the problem.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.160
All sort of tests of intelligence,

26:33.160 --> 26:36.040
because intelligence is cross-correlated across domains,

26:36.040 --> 26:37.880
are going to correlate with each other.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.280
If I was looking at a school,

26:39.280 --> 26:41.080
and I was looking at people who were scoring well

26:41.080 --> 26:44.880
on biology tests, I could broadly guess and bet

26:44.880 --> 26:47.200
pretty effectively that they would also score better

26:47.200 --> 26:50.720
than other students on history tests or on mass tests.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.880
And this is why when you're looking at things like IQ,

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
but then what's interesting,

26:53.880 --> 26:55.200
and a lot of people might not know this,

26:55.200 --> 26:57.400
is that then you expand this to other domains.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.080
You look at the probability of raping someone.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.200
It's also a lot lower.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.880
You look at their probability of being in jail.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.000
It's also a lot lower.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.520
You look at their probability of murdering someone.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.480
It's also a lot lower.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.280
You look at their probability of getting in a car accident.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.520
It's also a lot lower.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.360
Generally, within any of these things,

27:10.360 --> 27:12.080
it's almost, I'm not gonna say it's irrelevant

27:12.080 --> 27:12.920
what you're measuring,

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
because some are better measures than others,

27:14.920 --> 27:17.600
but you're clearly measuring something

27:17.600 --> 27:19.480
if it's cross-correlated against

27:19.480 --> 27:21.360
all of these different domains.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.360
And so I think a lot of people will try to like blow smoke

27:24.360 --> 27:25.200
in your face,

27:25.200 --> 27:28.000
and it's really good to be able to recognize

27:28.000 --> 27:29.680
when they're doing that.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.520
And for them, like I even think from his perspective,

27:32.520 --> 27:34.480
ideologically, what's at stake for him?

27:34.480 --> 27:37.280
One, he thinks if IQ can be proven to be real,

27:37.280 --> 27:39.640
that means that racism is right, which it doesn't.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.840
As we have copiously pointed out on this show,

27:42.840 --> 27:44.640
it is not intergenerationally,

27:44.640 --> 27:47.880
durably tied to an ethnic group enough to matter.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.080
But anything that you can measure and put a number to

27:50.080 --> 27:53.280
is obviously going to differ between population groups.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.240
Duh, but that doesn't mean like one is better

27:56.240 --> 27:57.360
or something like that.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.000
It would, I guess, if it didn't change in between generations,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.320
but it changes so, so, so quickly.

28:02.320 --> 28:07.000
And then the second is that he ends up making an argument

28:07.000 --> 28:09.280
that needs to say that he has achieved everything

28:09.280 --> 28:10.840
that he has achieved in life

28:10.840 --> 28:12.400
without systemic advantages.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.480
He has just willed himself to this place that he is.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.000
Simultaneously, while flaunting that systemic advantage.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.720
In every sense, like to a fault,

28:23.720 --> 28:25.520
like to a point of illegibility.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.800
Yeah, and if you look at people like Simone and I,

28:28.800 --> 28:31.400
I will admit that I, well, actually I don't think

28:31.400 --> 28:32.240
I have a high IQ.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.480
Well, I do have a high IQ.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.040
I do have a high IQ when it's measured.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.960
What I mean is that Simone might not mention this,

28:37.960 --> 28:39.680
but she's in the top fraction of a percent.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.120
She was measured recently for the autism exam,

28:42.120 --> 28:44.640
but hold on Simone, I won't brag on you.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.640
So what we do need to know is that the way that my brain

28:48.680 --> 28:51.520
works when it comes to things is different enough

28:51.520 --> 28:53.640
that it's not just like being smart.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.480
Like typically when I start something,

28:55.480 --> 28:57.160
I'm really bad at it.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.320
Like when I started high school,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.800
I was in the top, you know, half of my class.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.880
I know I graduated obviously really near the top,

29:02.880 --> 29:04.520
but I started bottom half.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.280
When I went to SAT prep, I remember I almost got laughed

29:07.280 --> 29:08.520
out of the room because I said I wanted to go

29:08.520 --> 29:09.720
to Harvard or Stanford,

29:09.720 --> 29:11.520
which obviously I did end up going to for MBA,

29:11.520 --> 29:12.840
but they were like,

29:12.840 --> 29:14.880
but you are the single lowest scores

29:14.880 --> 29:16.480
in the entire prep class.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.800
What are you talking about?

29:17.800 --> 29:19.960
So I'm one of these people who always starts

29:19.960 --> 29:22.440
like really lower than other people.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.720
And then somehow ends up,

29:24.720 --> 29:26.840
if I'm just persistent at something,

29:26.840 --> 29:28.840
really sort of figuring out and getting it to click

29:28.840 --> 29:29.680
at the end of the day.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.640
But I think it might just be

29:30.640 --> 29:32.360
because I see things differently,

29:32.360 --> 29:33.840
but this seeing things differently

29:33.840 --> 29:35.440
has to have some genetic component.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.000
The advantages I have over other people,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.440
I should never deny them

29:41.440 --> 29:44.880
because that removes my ability to empathize

29:44.880 --> 29:46.520
with an individual who tells me,

29:46.600 --> 29:47.800
you don't understand.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.320
I can't just do this thing

29:49.320 --> 29:50.840
that you went out there and did.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.680
Well, I wonder,

29:51.680 --> 29:54.840
so one argument that Naseem Tileb makes also in his essay,

29:54.840 --> 29:56.480
which we haven't, I think touched on a whole lot,

29:56.480 --> 29:59.560
is like, you know, only pencil,

29:59.560 --> 30:01.440
like paper pusher academic types

30:01.440 --> 30:04.440
who to play with bureaucracy in follow direction

30:04.440 --> 30:06.280
perform well on IQ tests.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.560
And I mean, to your point, right?

30:07.560 --> 30:10.960
You as actually a very anti-authoritarian anti-bureaucracy,

30:10.960 --> 30:13.240
I'm not gonna fucking listen to you kind of person,

30:13.240 --> 30:15.600
do really suck at a lot of IQ,

30:15.720 --> 30:18.480
correlated whatever tests in the beginning,

30:18.480 --> 30:21.160
but you also have the good sense and tenacity

30:21.160 --> 30:22.320
to learn the system.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.760
And I think a lot of what these tests

30:23.760 --> 30:26.280
may also be measuring is people's willingness

30:26.280 --> 30:29.200
to work with the system to their personal advantage.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.280
And a lack of willingness to work with that system,

30:31.280 --> 30:33.800
a lack of willingness to adapt and read directions

30:33.800 --> 30:36.240
and listen is, you know,

30:36.240 --> 30:39.120
regardless, they might not be measuring intelligence,

30:39.120 --> 30:40.080
but it's measuring-

30:40.080 --> 30:41.760
It's measuring willingness to learn

30:41.760 --> 30:44.200
how to do what you need to do to get ahead in life.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.640
And let's keep in mind what IQ is really measuring

30:46.640 --> 30:47.680
because I think a lot of people miss this.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.160
It is not, we use it as a quote unquote intelligence measure,

30:51.160 --> 30:53.240
but it's really, it's claimed to fame

30:53.240 --> 30:55.480
is that it has the highest corollatory factor

30:55.480 --> 30:58.960
with life outcomes and that like economic outcomes mostly,

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
but other life outcomes.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.200
And that's what we're looking at.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.360
That's why we care about it as a statistic.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.800
And I would say life outcomes were intelligence matters.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.520
I would argue that the amount that you make

31:07.520 --> 31:10.400
over 100K a year, your intelligence doesn't matter.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.920
You're mostly dealing with luck at that point.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.480
And so it does not surprise me at all

31:13.480 --> 31:15.400
that it wouldn't be correlated at that point.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.920
But in his world of, I guess, ultra smarty pants

31:17.920 --> 31:20.160
who have made billions of dollars a year,

31:20.160 --> 31:22.680
like that's where he's applying it

31:22.680 --> 31:24.840
instead of at population levels.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.560
Yeah, I think a lot of people like him,

31:27.560 --> 31:30.600
people like him, I don't know if they, for years,

31:30.600 --> 31:32.960
have even come into contact with people

31:32.960 --> 31:36.440
who have an IQ like below 110, they just don't.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.000
So I think it's also hard for them to even understand

31:39.000 --> 31:40.840
like the true variance in IQ that's out there

31:40.840 --> 31:42.200
and the effect that it has on people.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.400
Yeah, and I would say the most important reason

31:44.400 --> 31:46.920
why IQ matters right now and why people need

31:46.920 --> 31:49.560
to be paying attention to IQ right now,

31:50.480 --> 31:52.200
especially when he's, well, IQ only matters

31:52.200 --> 31:53.560
when it's really low.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.720
Well, if we're dealing with a quickly dropping IQ

31:56.720 --> 31:59.960
for genetic reasons, which it looks like we are about,

31:59.960 --> 32:03.160
again, one standard deviation drop in the next 75 years,

32:03.160 --> 32:05.880
is what we see not just from IQ

32:05.880 --> 32:07.600
being measured in developed countries,

32:07.600 --> 32:09.680
we see this, the polygenic scores.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.200
This is like the genetic makeups

32:12.200 --> 32:14.640
as they are correlated to IQ.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.040
We can see them appearing at a lower and lower frequency

32:18.040 --> 32:19.960
in genetic banks over time.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.960
We can then correlate the genes associated with a high IQ

32:22.960 --> 32:26.120
and look at what other things they're highly tied to.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.640
They are extremely highly tied

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
to a person's fertility success.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.560
So the same genes that are correlated with IQ

32:34.560 --> 32:37.000
are also correlated with low success in fertility situations.

32:37.000 --> 32:37.840
Like you're looking at a car

32:37.880 --> 32:39.880
and you can measure how fast it goes and predict that.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.400
You can predict how fast it might go

32:42.400 --> 32:43.720
by looking at its engineering.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.440
You can read a report about how fast it's supposed to go

32:46.440 --> 32:48.240
and all of these numbers correlate.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.320
That's sort of what we're looking at with this IQ drop.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.760
If it turns out that's real and we are ignoring that,

32:54.760 --> 32:57.640
well, then IQ is really gonna fucking matter

32:57.640 --> 33:00.200
because almost all of us in the developed world

33:00.200 --> 33:03.800
are going to be at this incredibly low level of IQ

33:03.800 --> 33:06.400
that even he says,

33:06.400 --> 33:09.600
oh, this actually does have a very big effect.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.920
And that's a problem that you ignore this

33:12.920 --> 33:14.520
because it says something.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.600
Yeah, it's kind of like being like,

33:15.600 --> 33:17.160
well, money makes no difference

33:17.160 --> 33:18.520
unless you're like impoverished.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.640
And yet like humanity's moving in this direction

33:20.640 --> 33:22.920
toward poverty and let's just ignore the issue though

33:22.920 --> 33:24.680
because it doesn't matter at all.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.520
Yeah.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.240
And so, yeah, I just wanted to close out with that.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.200
That is the number one reason

33:29.200 --> 33:31.680
why we can't just ignore IQ right now,

33:31.800 --> 33:35.200
even though it might be convenient to ignore IQ right now.

33:35.200 --> 33:38.520
And it's a shame, but, and as we pointed out,

33:38.520 --> 33:41.880
IQ being real does not support the racist positions

33:41.880 --> 33:43.680
so long as you are actually familiar

33:43.680 --> 33:45.000
with the genetics of IQ.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.960
It is because IQ is so heritable

33:47.960 --> 33:50.640
that it doesn't matter from an ethnic perspective

33:50.640 --> 33:53.280
because it's extreme level of heritability

33:53.280 --> 33:56.360
is what allows it to change so quickly intergenerationally.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.200
Yeah, which thank goodness.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.760
And how persistently tied to an individual's ethnicity.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.680
Yeah.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.960
I mean, and let's be clear,

34:01.960 --> 34:05.240
we would prefer a world in which everyone had

34:05.240 --> 34:08.160
the same potential for achievement on everything.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.960
You know, like a blank slate world would be way cooler.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.560
We would prefer to be in one.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.400
But, you know, to pretend that is how it is

34:15.400 --> 34:17.960
just because you feel like that's a more moral world

34:17.960 --> 34:19.800
doesn't mean it's a more moral world, right?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.680
You could be like, oh, death is immoral.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.680
So I don't believe in it,

34:22.680 --> 34:24.160
but that's not going to change the fact

34:24.160 --> 34:25.000
that you're going to die.

34:25.000 --> 34:25.840
So.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.280
Well, and it can cause you to make decisions

34:27.280 --> 34:28.480
that hurt a lot of people.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.760
And that's what gets me the most about this.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.600
You know, when you look at our prison system,

34:33.600 --> 34:36.800
the vast majority of people in it are at very low accused.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.680
And when you deny that they had a systemic disadvantage

34:40.680 --> 34:41.560
when compared to you,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.760
when you tell people to throw that out,

34:43.760 --> 34:47.600
that what you are taking the most vulnerable people

34:47.600 --> 34:50.040
in our society who are in a situation

34:50.040 --> 34:53.240
due to something they had no control over

34:53.240 --> 34:56.960
and completely acting like they had the same advantages

34:56.960 --> 34:57.800
you did in life.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.720
It is sick.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.840
It is sick.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.280
It is not moral.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.360
And you need to get your fucking shit together

35:03.360 --> 35:05.120
and actually look at the data

35:05.120 --> 35:07.640
instead of trying to blow smoke in people's faces.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.920
So you can play your little virtue game, okay?

35:09.920 --> 35:13.720
Because people are suffering for your bullshit.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.600
And so you can feel like a hero

35:15.600 --> 35:20.000
without having to challenge actual real world problems

35:20.000 --> 35:23.160
and fix them and take responsibility for the advantages

35:23.160 --> 35:25.560
that you were born with, which other people worked.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.720
And there you have it.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.560
I love you.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.400
Yeah, there we have it.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.240
Okay.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.080
Have a good one, Simone.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.280
You too, gorgeous.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.000
For anyone who wants to go to that pronatalist conference

35:37.000 --> 35:39.200
that's being held in Austin,

35:39.200 --> 35:40.880
a few points of clarification.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.960
We are not running it.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.840
We have no control over who's going.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.880
We don't make any money from it.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.440
However, we will be speaking there and we will be there

35:48.440 --> 35:50.280
and we would be happy to meet up with people

35:50.280 --> 35:52.640
who watch our show if you happen to be in the area.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.480
Might even put something together

35:54.480 --> 35:58.160
if you guys reach out and we get a critical mass of people.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.760
We have secured a discount code for our fans,

36:01.760 --> 36:04.640
which is pronatalists all caps.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.880
And it should get you about 30% off the price of a ticket

36:07.880 --> 36:09.080
if you are going.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.560
Again, this is not affiliated with the foundation,

36:11.560 --> 36:14.280
but if we can make things cheaper for our fans,

36:14.280 --> 36:15.440
we're gonna do it.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.920
And if we can meet with people

36:16.920 --> 36:18.760
who are interested in this topic

36:18.760 --> 36:22.160
or further evangelize our brand of pronatalism,

36:22.160 --> 36:24.960
we are very excited to take every opportunity

36:24.960 --> 36:26.200
we can to do that.
