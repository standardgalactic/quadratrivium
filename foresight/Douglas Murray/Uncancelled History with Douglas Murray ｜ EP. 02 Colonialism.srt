00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, I'm Douglas Murray and welcome to Uncancelled History.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, colonialism.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm joined by Professor Bruce Gilley.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Bruce Gilley is Professor of Political Science at Portland State University.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
His research focuses on topics including colonialism and Asian politics.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In 2018, he published an article, The Case for Colonialism,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which was first published in the Third World Quarterly.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It sparked enormous protests and nearly half of the journal's editorial board

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
resigned in protest.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The author of numerous articles and books, in 2021,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Gilley published his biography of Sir Alan Burns,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a 20th century British colonial officer.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today on Uncancelled History, Colonialism.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Case for Colonialism

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
First of all, thank you so much, Bruce, for joining me.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In recent years, colonialism has been shown to be portrayed as

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
one of the absolutely foundational sins of the West,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
perhaps along with slavery, racism.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Colonialism is one that has been most zoomed in on.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What is colonialism, first of all?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, I think if we take the biggest view, colonialism or imperialism,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
as it used to be called before that became a dirty word too,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is simply where one group of people with an established form of government

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
travels to a part of the world where their government doesn't currently rule

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and establishes its rule there.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And by that definition, all of world history is a history of imperialism and colonialism.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There is no people or no country today that has not at some point

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
been involved in imperialism and colonialism.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So nothing specifically unique or different about Europeans

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
doing exactly what everyone else did.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When people hear the term colonialism now,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
they zoom in on a very specific and small portion of the world of colonialism,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which is basically 19th century and early 20th century European colonialism

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
in what we now call the Third World.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Certainly in modern academia and perhaps the wider culture,

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
18th and 19th century European colonialism is now seen as being a sort of shorthand

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
for something that is unadulteratedly cruel, entirely racist.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What about this analysis in your view, full short?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, in part because it's either true by definition or it's patently false.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
True by definition because every group, up until very recently,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
was inherently racist towards other groups.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Cherokees of the Americas were racist towards other Native Americans.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The Bantu were racist towards all of the Black African tribes they conquered

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
as they imperialized Southern Africa.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Maori were racist towards other Pacific Asian tribes.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I mean, everyone was a racist if by that term we mean the assumptions by group A

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that the members of group B are inferior and deserve to be conquered if they can be.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's a universal human phenomena and it arises from evolutionary needs

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
for basically in group solidarity.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So racism is the standard default position for all peoples.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So to say that the Europeans were racist is just to state the obvious

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because all peoples were racist.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If it's not a statement of the obvious then it's patently false

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and by that I mean that if we were to judge the racism of the Europeans

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
vis-a-vis the places they conquered, compared to the racism of other groups at the time

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we would find the Europeans much less racist

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and if we were going to put it on a spectrum we would say the only anti-racists

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
in the whole world at the time of European colonials and we're the Europeans

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because they were the ones who went abroad and said these peoples have the capacity

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to be just like us.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
These people deserve freedom.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
These people deserve to be freed from slavery.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They deserve to be developed.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They deserve to be civilized, which of course is seen as a sort of great racist act

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but it's quite the opposite.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's the act of saying all peoples have the potential to be self-governing,

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to be flourishing, to have a written language, history, arts and culture.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This was the great anti-racist campaign that European colonialism represented.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So that's why I say it's either simply a statement of the obvious or it's patently false.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Roughly, what were other people at the time thinking?

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You mentioned these were attitudes that Europeans held

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but what would have been more normal attitudes at the time for the rest of the world about other groups?

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, the rest of the world, and this is true well into the 20th century,

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
basically that different groups saw themselves based on their ability to spread their rule

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and their culture and their institutions to others

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and they were more superior the more they were able to do that.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So this is why the Bantu expansion into southern Africa, the Buganda expansion throughout East Africa,

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the Fulani Slave Empire of West Africa, all of these groups saw themselves as inferior

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and saw those they conquered as not just moral inferiors but somehow subhuman.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In the sense that they weren't engaged in a civilizing action, they were engaged in a simple conquest.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And this was real racism in the sense of denying the humanity of those who were put under the subjugation

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
which is why these empires often were slave empires or simply genocidal empires.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Europeans were different, right?

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Not entirely, they had their brutal aspects, they had their old imperialist conquest aspects

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but the seed of the difference in the European case was this idea of civilization.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Civilization raises those that you conquer from the level of subhuman to being human

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
because why would you civilize farm animals?

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You civilize people who you tick to be your moral equals.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now in 2017 you caused something of an uproar.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You wrote a piece called The Case for Colonialism in which you made the claim that European colonialism

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
was indeed beneficial to colonized people.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can you tell us something about the backlash of attacks?

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What you said in that article, what happened as a result of it?

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because this was a proper firestorm in your area.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This was, I wrote the article of 2017, The Case for Colonialism

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
because I was starting work on my biography of Sir Alan Burns,

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
great British colonial administrator which became the last imperialist

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and I was trying to frame the basic case for colonialism that his life represented and he articulated.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And it went through peer review, got a split decision, the editor decided to run it,

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
kind of thinking it might be a good debate and literally within minutes of it appearing online

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
there were two online petitions started, one by a interpretive dance instructor in Britain

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and one by an English professor in Manitoba and a third by a professor in Syracuse University

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
who also wanted my PhD revoked.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So three petitions actually which eventually had about 30,000 signatures demanding the article be retracted,

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
saying that this was violence against brown and black people, saying that this was holocaust denial,

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
saying that this was a threat to the safety of my students.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So my university launched a diversity investigation claiming my article was an act of violence.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Eventually the editorial staff in London had death threats from nationalists in India.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They asked me could they please withdraw the article.

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I said of course, not a big deal to me, their safety was paramount.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It was reprinted in Academic Questions which is the House Journal of the National Association of Scholars.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I think thanks to the firestorm has attracted far more attention than it would have attracted

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
if it had simply been allowed to be read and disputed.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The original journal that it was published in then unpublished in just decided to pretend it hadn't happened?

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So this is the third world quarterly.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, they did things by the book.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They were not allowed to retract an article because of a political firestorm according to the ethics commission of the UK,

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which actually is stronger than the ethics commission in the US for publishing.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So they had to ask my request to withdraw it, not retract it, which I agreed to for their physical safety.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So it was withdrawn, not retracted.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So if you go to the website today, you'll see the withdrawal notice that states very clearly that they faced death threats.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And the funny thing is now the third world quarterly has allowed, now that all their editorial staff has been revamped with ultra woke academics,

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they're allowing their authors to cite the article again, but they're only citing the withdrawal notice.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They're not citing the actual article, but they're trying to kind of piggyback on the popularity of the article to generate metrics for their journal,

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but you can't actually read the article on it.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So there are three petitions against you, including the interpretive dance lady.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And she didn't presumably make her objection through the form of interpretive dance, did she?

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, she used the method of a petition.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And you might say, well, okay, it's a free world.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I do believe this.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think if you want to set up a petition and oppose something, be my guest.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But what was, I think, shocking to me was how many people signed that petition who were credentialed academics holding positions in universities in the UK and Canada and Australia and the United States,

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
universities which are by their very principles committed to the principle of academic freedom.

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so you have, I mean, okay, people signed petitions, but academics standing up very publicly and saying, I don't think this article deserves to be written.

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think academic freedom has certain limitations.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And when people say things that I think are racist or white supremacist, academic freedom has reached its limits.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It seemed to me that with that article, you had undoubtedly hit a tripwire in our day.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And the way I sort of thought of it in a way was perhaps there would have been a time maybe 100 years ago where to write, I mean, this isn't particularly the case,

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but to write only negative things about colonialism and everybody involved in colonial projects would have caused some kind of problem.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And that what had happened is that in our own day, to say actually the picture is a bit more nuanced, more rounded, is just unacceptable.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It has to be that colonialism is like the Holocaust, as one of your accusers said, that it's just, there is no context, it's just bad.

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Something like that, isn't it?

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There's just a unanimity that there's no texture to be added that if somebody like you or Professor Nigel Bigger at Oxford says,

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
hang on, it's a bit more complicated.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Effectively, you're seen as being an apologist for the worst successes of colonialism.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I actually think not because I think this idea that there was a time in European history or British history when it was nothing but daring,

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to glorification of colonialism and the empire is a myth.

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There was never a time in British history, in British education, in British newspapers where the imperial enterprise, where the colonies,

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
whether we're talking the American colonies, Australia or later Africa, where this was not subject to a constant debate,

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and where people who were critical of this were very free and very prolific in writing their criticism.

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I think this, you get this kind of, this narrative, especially in the UK that, well, at least we're not back in the days when it's all celebration of the empire.

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And there was never a time in British history where there was nothing but glorification and celebration of empire.

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Where do you think that idea comes from?

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think it's because the people think that they have a balanced perspective.

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And by being balanced, they try to set up this idea that, well, I'm not like those crazy old imperialists like that all day.

156
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think we need balance.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And so I'm not on the right side of the spectrum.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm a centrist.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In fact, there was never that perspective.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I think they're trying to make themselves feel like they're the centrists in the issue.

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Whereas, in fact, the arguments have always been about the critical and the contentious rollout of empire and what was happening.

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And so anti-colonialism didn't arise in response to some excessively positive account of empire that was dominating and that was hegemonic in the empire.

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It didn't, right?

164
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Because that's its false flag.

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It basically argues against a strawman, right?

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There was never that.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And so what the anti-colonials are trying to do is to suggest that they're just bringing balance to the argument, right?

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But they're not, right?

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In fact, what they're doing is disbalancing the argument entirely, taking it from what it used to be, which is you could say the case for colonialism or the case against colonialism

170
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and shut down the case for colonialism, say there's only one case to be made.

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Anti-colonialism is the only case to be made.

172
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And what you, Professor Nigel Bigger, a very small number of other academics have been doing is to be inserting this information into the debate, facts, interpretations of it,

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which seem just not to have been put in for a very long time, certainly not in the academic field.

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So you mentioned, I mean, there are sort of positives about colonialism.

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There are negatives.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What were the positives in your view for peoples in the countries that Europeans went to and ruled?

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, I think we need to start at a very high level of abstraction because the fundamental thing is this, is if you were in a society which had a stone age level of technological development,

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:43,000
had no fixed borders, had no institutionalized system of governance, had not yet discovered the wheel, or in some more advanced places nonetheless still lived in an essentially feudal system, right,

179
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
with a very entrenched elite and a very impoverished population.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And you had the opportunity to be ruled by an advanced European civilization, right?

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why would you not want that to happen, right?

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So just at the level of abstraction, like civilization A, which is superior to civilization B, and I have no problems using the term superior.

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm going to say lots of people, the moment you say superior, they're going to...

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Absolutely superior, right?

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because superior in the sense of better technology, better healthcare, better education, more accountable governance, more rights for marginalized communities,

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
especially women, urban development, technology, transportation, life-saving research and science, right?

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Those are the things I mean.

188
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is superior, right?

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And there's no objective definition, distinction between that and what's less.

190
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If you had that opportunity, what would your society do?

191
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Of course, they would jump at the opportunity, which is why so much of European imperialism spread with as much pull as it did push, right?

192
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Indeed, the pull factors are often the dominating ones.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The British went to Ghana, they said not much interested, left the Ghani kings, demanded that they come back, begged them to come back.

194
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Finally, they did sign the treaties.

195
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Why?

196
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because British Empire or other empires brought security, it brought stability, it brought opportunities.

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It brought an end to inter-tribal warfare, which in many cases, these kings and these tribal leaders recognized was destroying their societies, right?

198
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They needed essentially a hegemon.

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, it's an old Hobbesian story, but that's what they needed.

200
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So, you know, at a very high level of abstraction, right?

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think that the onus of proof is that colonialism didn't bring tremendous benefits, right?

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, just in the sense of the logic of a more superior, I mean, you don't need to use superior, more developed, right?

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
More advanced civilization, having an opportunity to rule a less advanced civilization is so patently obvious, right?

204
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That the burden of proof that this was not a good thing, I think lies upon those who say this somehow brought, bought harms.

205
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I think that's where we then have to get into, okay, so it's a good idea in general, right?

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Was it a good idea in practice, right?

207
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Now, this is where we need to talk about, like, how it rolled out.

208
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Places were better, places were worse, there were abuses here, not here.

209
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I mean, now we get into what used to be the debate on colonialism, which is let's talk about the practical opportunities, feasibility of things,

210
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
things that were done well, things were done badly in particular contexts.

211
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But, you know, this idea of a blanket condemnation is just not tenable.

212
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I suppose there's two things that the anti-colonialists say at this point, which is, first of all,

213
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
yes, there are maybe technical advances and so on, but that two things occur with colonialism.

214
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
One is the presumption that there are people who are sort of morally better, going into less morally developed societies.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And the other one would be something along the lines of you're instituting a form of inequality,

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and along the lines of that, along the way, you're also, for instance, eradicating local cultures, local norms.

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Replacing local norms with European norms.

218
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you say to those claims?

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All of them don't withstand scrutiny.

220
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Again, the idea of a moral superiority is one thing that was distinctly absent in the European mission.

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If you take the idea of the civilizing mission seriously, what it implies is the moral potential of those who are colonizing to be exactly like you.

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's very explicit, right?

223
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And in terms of life-saving medicines being morally superior to the absence of life-saving medicines,

224
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
yeah, I have no problems going to the mat and saying that's morally superior.

225
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's morally superior to save lives, to prevent people from being killed through violent conflicts,

226
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to give rights to people who are traditionally marginalized.

227
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's morally superior.

228
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have no problem with that.

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Most liberals would argue that, too, except when you talk about it in the context of colonialism.

230
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Second of all, in terms of foreign norms or alien norms, don't forget,

231
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
almost all the places that were colonized were already under alien rule.

232
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But it was indigenous alien rule, not European alien rule.

233
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And we're talking mainly here about Africa.

234
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, you know, most places, I mean, look at the Malay Peninsula, right?

235
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I mean, basically, the Malay Peninsula was a bunch of small fiefdoms, small sultanates, right?

236
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Those sultanates expanded or contracted based upon their power, right,

237
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and brought in people who had been under another sultanate.

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, I mean, the idea of like indigenous rule, I mean, what is indigenous rule in a context

239
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in which the world has always been organized by empire spreading as far as they can

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and when they weaken being subjugated by other empires?

241
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It is, you're right, most explicitly clear in Africa

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
because you can actually see what was happening at the time of European conquest.

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I mean, the Fulani Slave Empire, which was basically an Islamic caliphate

244
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
of the central part of the Sahara, was spreading towards West Africa when the British came in.

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The reason why it was so easy for the British to establish their control in northern Nigeria

246
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
was because those groups recognized the choice was British imperialism or the Fulani Slave Empire.

247
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And the British Empire started to look very attractive compared to that.

248
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Third point, destroying local cultures.

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
European imperialism was famous for its discovery and documentation and celebration of local cultures.

250
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Many of these languages would not have survived, usually not the colonial administrators,

251
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
but the explorers and linguists and academics and researchers who came with imperialism

252
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
gone and documented those languages.

253
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The U-language of Togo was essentially rescued by the Germans after they colonized it.

254
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And there was two or three German linguists who went out and documented those languages

255
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
before they were lost, created dictionaries, created study guides.

256
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I mean, the entire language would not exist but for German colonialism.

257
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's to say with James Princip and the language in India.

258
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The British rediscovery of Indian heritage is well known.

259
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I mean, I don't need to document it but the Asiatics and the Orientalists were the ones who rescued

260
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and saved these cultures from destruction either by an indigenous empire or just by the forces of modernization.

261
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Swihili was spreading in East Africa.

262
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It was going to be the hegemonic language.

263
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If the Germans had not documented those languages in the Mount Kilimanjaro area, those languages would have been lost.

264
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There is a presumption, I think. We've come across it in a number of cases.

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This presumption that if the Westerners, if the Europeans get it, go into a place,

266
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
they bring certain evils into an effectively Edenic society.

267
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The locals are otherwise living unbothered by modernity, by the vices of humankind.

268
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Obviously, this wasn't the case.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But it seems that people are very reluctant to recognize that there's a balance of things going on here, at the very least.

270
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, well, not only that the pre-colonial societies were not the Garden of Eden far from it

271
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and had any of those pre-colonial societies been literate or had record-keeping traditions,

272
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
we would have more information on that. We don't.

273
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So what do you turn to? You turn to the civilization that produced records and newspaper articles

274
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and parliamentary inquiries and academic researches and whatnot, which is the European civilization.

275
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The knowledge base is hugely biased towards the European colonial experience

276
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and in particular, because it comes with a self-critical tradition, a lot of that knowledge is critical.

277
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So this is somehow evidence that it was the Garden of Eden before European colonialism.

278
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's clearly not the case. Secondly, quite aside from that, the more significant question is,

279
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
okay, if the Europeans had said, right, we're not going into Africa,

280
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
we're going to have this kind of agreement among ourselves not to go in.

281
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So what would have happened?

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Well, trade is still going to happen. Missionaries are still going to go in there.

283
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Alcohol is going to go in there. The maximum machine gun is going to go in there.

284
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So what you get then is a kind of Yahoo explorers and claim-stakers among the Europeans,

285
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
allying themselves with local forces. Would that have been a better governing experience for Africa?

286
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So living in splendid isolation is not an option for Africa or the Middle East or Southeast Asia

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
or the Pacific at this time. Globalization is happening.

288
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Do you want globalization to be governed or do you want it to be ungoverned?

289
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And the ungoverned bits and pieces we have, such as the Congo Free State,

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
which actually was relatively well governed compared to some of the worst ones,

291
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but the private colonies and Liberia under the Firestone Company

292
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and some of the German trading companies in the Pacific,

293
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
obviously the East India Company before the Mutiny,

294
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
these private colonialism did not equip themselves very well.

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So that's the alternative. The alternative is not splendid isolation.

296
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The alternative is kind of these freelancers and mercenaries running these places,

297
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
which tended to be much worse because there was no accountability.

298
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
In 2020, you published your biography of Sir Alan Burns, The Last Imperialist.

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
First of all, before we get into the controversies around that,

300
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
perhaps you could explain who was Alan Burns and why was he somebody you wanted to write about?

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Burns was a colonial administrator born in the Caribbean,

302
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
went to West Africa on the eve of World War I, fought in the West Africa campaigns in the Cameroons

303
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and in Togo was then put on the Nigerian government,

304
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
became a colonial secretary in the Bahamas, became the governor of Belize,

305
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
or what was then the British Honduras, eventually became the governor of the Gold Coast,

306
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
which is now Ghana during World War II.

307
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And then after that, a very kind of storied colonial career was sent to the United Nations

308
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
in the 50s to basically stand up for the British Empire

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
when the United Nations was becoming a kind of decolonization machine, right?

310
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What interested me about Burns was he was an unapologetic defender of empire

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
way into the 20th century.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He dies in 1980.

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Right, so he is one of the few people who carries on the case for colonialism

314
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
well after most British have kind of retired in a kind of awkward, cringy feeling about,

315
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
well, that wasn't very nice, but long as I have my pension,

316
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and of course the 60s is the era of the great radical anti-colonial movements,

317
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
not only in the global system, but on campus, of course,

318
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and Burns is pushing the argument right to the end, right?

319
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And presently enough, because he lives through the 70s,

320
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
which is the great lost decade in the developing world, right,

321
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
where massacres and wars and humanitarian catastrophes that we didn't notice

322
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
because there's no white men involved.

323
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But I mean, this was the great lost decade of the Third World.

324
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Where are we talking about here?

325
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, we're talking about all of Africa, essentially.

326
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're talking about Indonesia.

327
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We're talking about the period of conflict in the Middle East.

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We're talking about India itself, the great, like, granddaddy of them all, right,

329
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
with stagnation, with communal violence, with an emergency and a suspension of democracy.

330
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Basically, every part of the Third World is falling apart

331
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and going into spiral in the 70s, right, and it slowly starts to recover by the 80s.

332
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But Burns is paying attention to this, right?

333
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Burns is paying attention to the massacres, the Biafra war, right,

334
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
is maybe the one that draws world attention,

335
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
because we're talking one to two million people killed in that.

336
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Of course, partition might have caused some misgivings

337
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
about this whole decolonization idea.

338
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But Burns is kind of arguing the case.

339
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
This is why we shouldn't have ended it so fast.

340
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is why the United Nations mishandled this whole issue, right?

341
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
They were so obsessed with getting the colonialists out

342
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
that they didn't pay attention to what was going to take over

343
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and who was going to fill the power vacuum

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and were these going to be stable states?

345
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So I wrote the biography because I found him a compelling figure.

346
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I also tracked down his family.

347
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I saw his papers sitting in an attic in Chelmsford.

348
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And, you know, classic kind of British thing.

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I mean, here's the guy who, in my mind,

350
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
is one of the greatest generation of the late colonial administrators

351
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
who are helping to get these countries ready for independence.

352
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And he's just kind of treated with this icy coldness.

353
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And there's his paper sitting in an attic in Chelmsford,

354
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you know, because you wouldn't want to write about this person, right?

355
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I mean, what an evil person this is.

356
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And yet he is a great...

357
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I mean, he's a hero of the British people, in my mind,

358
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
but the British were not interested in it.

359
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
By the way, before we come back to Bernadette,

360
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
one of the things that's always interested me about the post-colonial period

361
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
are the number of post-colonial writers who say

362
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
there is a form of Western colonialism that these countries,

363
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
particularly in Africa, have had to suffer under

364
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and that they must be returned to another state.

365
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Now, the obvious thing, it seems to me, is that you would argue

366
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that they should be returned to some pre-colonial state.

367
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But that argument seems to be quite uncommon.

368
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
A lot of the people I'm thinking of writers like Franz Fanon and others,

369
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
once the anti-colonialist movement gets going,

370
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
argue for Marxism for these societies.

371
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
In other words, they say Western imperialism has been the problem

372
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and that we must therefore return these societies

373
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and we must return them to Western Marxism.

374
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And there was always something...

375
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
There was always something specifically political going on that era as well, wasn't it?

376
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because we're talking about the 60s,

377
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
we're talking about still dreams of Marxism going on,

378
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and it seemed like the post-colonial developing world

379
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
could always be used as another experimenting place for that.

380
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Right, so the great myth of anti-colonialism

381
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
is that it represented indigenous forces

382
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and indigenous resistance to colonialism.

383
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And it didn't. It represented European intellectuals

384
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
exporting their ideologies to hapless brown and black people

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and finding people like Fanon or Amacal Cabral,

386
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
who spent most of their time hanging out in cafes in Paris and Lisbon,

387
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and sending them back as representatives of the people,

388
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
oppressed black people who needed to lead the fight against colonialism.

389
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But these people didn't represent anything in their societies.

390
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They barely had traveled.

391
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Most of them couldn't speak the languages of their own societies.

392
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What they brought back was not some indigenous response to colonialism.

393
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What they brought back was a bunch of half-assed ideologies from Europe.

394
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Most of them Marxist or Leninist or vaguely post-modernist as Fanon was.

395
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And what's interesting in terms of this decolonization process is

396
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the indigenous leaders in these societies saw that, right?

397
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They said to the Europeans,

398
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
don't you dare hand over power to these people, right?

399
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This was the great king of the Congo who was saying to the Belgians,

400
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
this guy, Patrice Lumumba, is a madman, right?

401
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't give in to them. Don't promise independence.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Don't hand over to these people because they're a bunch of loudmouths

403
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and they're the minority, right?

404
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We need you to stay, right? We're not ready for independence.

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Even Julius Nierere, who became the first prime minister of Tanzania

406
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and then president of Tanzania, was very explicit when he went to the United Nations

407
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and said, we're being pushed towards independence way faster than we'll be ready for it.

408
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Julius Nierere didn't think Tanzania would be ready for independence

409
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
until about the year 2000, right?

410
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But the momentum was, you have to resist colonialism.

411
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You have to go.

412
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And so these people who had no ability to hold these countries together

413
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and were bringing in not some indigenous wisdom of governance,

414
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
but half-baked Marxist theories were thrown into power

415
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
as representatives of the people against European colonialism.

416
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And this was because there was a perception of the winds of change.

417
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
There was just a historic moment. There was no point resisting it.

418
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's two things.

419
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
First of all, Europe is exhausted after World War II

420
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and European populations are lining up for bread.

421
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They have no heating. They have no electricity.

422
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The appetite for providing global public goods to foreign peoples was at an end, right?

423
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And one of the tragedies of World War I and World War II

424
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
was this loss of European willpower to maintain empires, right?

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So first of all, there's no support for colonialism on the home front.

426
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's the most fundamental reason for the end of colonialism.

427
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's not Gandhi standing up to the British Empire,

428
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you know, these virtuous George Washington's with black skin,

429
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
bringing down the pretensions of this strong imperialist.

430
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No, nonsense.

431
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The imperialists were brought down by the home front,

432
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
who said, we're done with colonialism.

433
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We can barely feed our families, right?

434
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And so the willpower on the home front evaporated.

435
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Later on top of that, you now have the Soviet Union,

436
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
styling itself as the liberator of black and brown people everywhere,

437
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
even as it's colonizing Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Baltics.

438
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But anyways, put that aside, they're liberators,

439
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and of course they'll bring democracy and prosperity everywhere they go.

440
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Well, now at the United Nations, you have this dance of the Soviet Union and the United States.

441
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The United States having its anti-colonial tradition,

442
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
but recognizing that this is not going to end well,

443
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
but not wanting to be outflanked by the Americans for the participation of these third world governments.

444
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So, loss of resources on the home front,

445
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the United Nations system pushing for decolonization,

446
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
it's an open door.

447
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Don't tell me that Gandhi brought down the British Empire.

448
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I mean, he's a complete flinty, silly man.

449
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He's pushing on an open door, right?

450
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
These doors open up very quickly and with grave consequences for these populations.

451
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Now, just to stick with Burns for a second, when your biography of Burns came out,

452
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
you were attacked from some perhaps predictable quarters for it.

453
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
One Marxist philosopher claimed that you were endorsing a white nationalist perspective.

454
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What do you say to people like that?

455
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
People who claim you're doing something wrong by just even writing about a figure like Alan Burns?

456
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, I think the criticism was that I was enabling white supremacy

457
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
by writing a positive biography of a British colonial official.

458
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah, you don't know where to start because in part because one of the things that attracted me to Burns

459
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
is how much he was loved among those where he governed, right?

460
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I mean, he was called the Sunshine Governor on the Gold Coast, right?

461
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They constantly told him that they wanted to extend his term and not just the kind of local elites, right?

462
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But I mean, he always would tell the story about, you know, he would go off on safari to visit some hill station

463
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and the only person he would have with him would be his orderly.

464
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Why? Because the British officials were never afraid of being murdered.

465
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
They were never afraid of being attacked.

466
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They were always welcomed wherever they went, right?

467
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So this supposedly evil person, but now we need a white Marxist in Toronto

468
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
to tell these stupid brown and black people who kept liking people like Burns that they were mistaken

469
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and they really needed to get their marching orders from white academics and philosophers in Western universities.

470
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I mean, to me, this is the real racism, right?

471
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The real racism is these white academics who tell brown and black people what they are

472
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and are not allowed to think about their own histories

473
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and what they should and should not think about those histories, right?

474
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is, I mean, I think it's Dr. N'Joyer, Juan Jiro N'Joyer, British legal professor, right,

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
who says this is the real imperialism, right?

476
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The real imperialism is these white academics trying to tell people in the former colonies

477
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
what they are and are not allowed to think about their own histories.

478
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Are there ways to ensure that academics like yourself who do write about this are able to do so

479
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
without being assailed in this way?

480
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I mean, there's fair criticism.

481
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Of course, nobody ever wants to stop that,

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
but the sort of, let's say, the demonization that's been seen

483
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
against you, against Nigel Bigwood Oxford,

484
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
saying that maybe we could try to look at colonialism in the round.

485
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Is there any way to protect academics to be able to continue such research without that kind of...

486
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
No, I think right now, if you're a young scholar or a young historian and you look at me,

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
the implications are very clear, right?

488
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No, you will not get a job, especially as a white academic,

489
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
unless you are more woke than the woke, right?

490
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And you need to be so virulently anti-colonial.

491
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You need to be practically insanely anti-colonial

492
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
in order to even have a thought of getting a job in academia.

493
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So no, the window has closed very narrowly

494
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and it's about to close even more firmly shut.

495
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So that's one thing.

496
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
My argument to the academy is something like this.

497
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If you were to produce a vaccine in a laboratory filled with bacteria

498
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and all sorts of hygienic conditions,

499
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
would you trust that vaccine in your patients?

500
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The argument would be no, right?

501
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Producing anti-colonial history in an environment in which only anti-colonial history is allowed

502
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
is essentially the equivalent of producing a tainted vaccine.

503
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There's no scientific reason to believe that that history is accurate

504
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because it's been produced in a laboratory that doesn't have adequate scientific conditions.

505
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And the most fundamental scientific condition for any social scientific claim

506
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
or historical claim is the possibility of dissent, the possibility of debate,

507
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the possibility of different perspectives being raised.

508
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And if you shut that down, everything you produce is by definition flawed, right?

509
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So I don't even need to read it.

510
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's produced in the modern academy.

511
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's not reliable without reading a single word of it.

512
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Just knowing the conditions of knowledge production in the academic setting are so flawed

513
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and so tainted that it would only be by fluke that it would produce anything of value.

514
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Now, one of the ways in which people do talk about colonialism now

515
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
is they do allow themselves to say, effectively, there were worse empires.

516
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
If there's an agreement that none were good, it was all wrong,

517
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but that there were some that were worse.

518
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And speaking of somebody born in Britain, I can say that even the most anti-colonial movements in Britain

519
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
do concede or console themselves with the idea that the Belgians were the worst.

520
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't know why this gives us so much pleasure, but it does.

521
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The one thing everyone knows in Britain is that King Leopold did the worst stuff,

522
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and at least we didn't have King Leopold.

523
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's just get on to that quickly.

524
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean, first of all, this perception that there were better and worse empires.

525
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Is it true?

526
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No, no, it's not.

527
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And I think that the British actually are probably one of the worst.

528
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And here's the reason is that the worst empires are the worst in conceding this.

529
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The worst of the empires.

530
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But I think the British are actually quite good, so I think they're all good.

531
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And the reason is this is that empires tended to take the easiest and the best stuff first.

532
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The British captured what was the most easy to govern and the most easily governed areas first,

533
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and the latecomers tended to get the worst stuff.

534
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The reason the Portuguese get such a bad rap is by the time the Portuguese were coming to colonize the African areas,

535
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and that was the only thing they had.

536
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
They were left with the bits and pieces, the places no one else wanted to govern.

537
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
The same is true of the Congo.

538
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now, a couple of things about the Congo.

539
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
First of all, the Congo-free state of King Leopold II was not a Belgian colony.

540
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I have to always remind people of that.

541
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It was not a Belgian colony.

542
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So it was a private estate of King Leopold II.

543
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It was not run by the Belgian government.

544
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The information was not shared with the Belgian government.

545
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There were no Belgian government officials there.

546
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It was a private undertaking by the king lasted until 1908.

547
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The Congo became a Belgian colony in 1908 after the problems and abuses of the free state were revealed.

548
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
From 1908 until its independence in 1960 was the only time the Congo has been well-governed,

549
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
so that Belgians actually have a lot to be proud of for their colonial period in the Congo, which began in 1908.

550
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The other places were Rwanda and Burundi, now Burundi,

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
which the Belgians were given as their spoils from World War I from Germany to Africa.

552
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Also, very successful governance in Rwanda and Burundi,

553
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
in terms of allowing essentially these feudal states to remain in rule,

554
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the Belgians recognized the problems, but were forced out by the United Nations system,

555
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
because these were trustee ships.

556
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
These weren't colonies per se.

557
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
These were UN trustee ships that the Belgians ran.

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The Belgians realized what would happen if sudden independence was given to them.

559
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Again, UN system comes in.

560
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I look at the Belgian experiences in those three places and say,

561
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
it's a tremendous achievement for the Belgians.

562
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's just one of these myths of the even evil Belgians.

563
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But pre-1908, it was...

564
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah, but pre-1908, it's not a colony.

565
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's basically a private estate run by a bunch of freelancers,

566
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
a bunch of military cast-offs,

567
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and Leopold's argument for the...

568
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And by the way, all the Adam Hothchild's book is a farrago of nonsense and misinterpretation.

569
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm writing a long takedown of it for its 25th anniversary next year.

570
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Is King Leopold's good?

571
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yes, 10 million dead, nonsense.

572
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Even as a mortality demographic decline figure, the 10 million is nonsense.

573
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Probably the best estimate is the population increased slightly under King Leopold's rule.

574
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
No 10 million dead, no 10 million murdered, which you'll see on Wikipedia.

575
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So it's just a lie, a bald lie.

576
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And it's a lie that Hothchild was aware of when he published the book and he chose not to include it.

577
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's basically the demographers who were looking at that, they realized that the miscalculation.

578
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Hothchild was aware that that was a lie, he didn't change the book.

579
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And he's never recanted it.

580
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So it's a big scandal to me.

581
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The popularity of that book is a scandal.

582
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Second of all, because Hothchild subtitles that book, a story of greed and terror in colonial Africa.

583
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Well, okay, colonial Africa, yes.

584
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But not in a colony, this was not a colony, right?

585
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This was a freelance enterprise being run.

586
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And what made the Congo so difficult for King Leopold was the fact that most of the center area was controlled by two notoriously brutal slave and rubber empires

587
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,000
who were Muslim Africans, sometimes called Arabs, but they were actually both Africans,

588
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
who had traditionally traded from the East End.

589
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
One was called Tipotip, who was famous for his brutality.

590
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The other was called Al-Zubur-Matir, who was these two competing kind of chieftains of the East End.

591
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And most of the brutalities happened in those areas.

592
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Now, yes, this was formally part of the Free State.

593
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And in theory, the King should have had a stronger military force to stamp that out.

594
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I mean, this is why the private colonialism didn't work well, because you don't have the resources.

595
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You don't have the security operations.

596
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You don't have the accountability mechanisms.

597
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But keep in mind what we're saying here.

598
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
What we're saying is the Free State didn't have enough colonialism.

599
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And what most people will say is colonialism caused the Free State.

600
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
No, it was the absence of colonialism that caused the Free State.

601
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
In fact, Edmund Moral, the famous lawyer who exposed the abuses, right?

602
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I mean, his whole argument was this place needs to be colonized.

603
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And he wanted the Germans to take it over, right?

604
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Because he thought the Germans were the best colonizers.

605
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, I mean, the mythology of this evil Belgian colony is A, wrong, because there wasn't a Belgian colony.

606
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
B, it misinterprets the problem as being too much colonialism when the problem was too little.

607
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Just shoot down one more of my British constellations.

608
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The Italians were especially bad.

609
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, the fascist colony of Italian Abyssinia is a bit of an oxymoron, because what is a fascist colony exactly?

610
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I mean, it's not a European colony in the sense of bringing European liberal civilization to Africa, in that case.

611
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I mean, Mussolini said, I'm going to oust this Christian king and replace him with a Muslim Islamic state,

612
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and I'm going to be the sword of Islam in Abyssinia.

613
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So, he was wildly popular, but he was popular because he was doing everything that European colonialism didn't do,

614
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
which was bring a liberal empire to Africa.

615
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I mean, he was explicit in saying, I'm going to build an Islamic fascist empire here, right?

616
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I mean, so he was celebrated.

617
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I mean, the Saudis and the Egyptians loved the Italian conquest of Abyssinia.

618
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
A, it overthrew a Christian king, so that was good.

619
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Replace it with an Islamic empire.

620
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
B, he promised to impose Sharia law, right?

621
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And so that made him popular.

622
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So, is that colonialism or is that fascism, right?

623
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I mean, for me, colonialism, as we describe it, is European liberal states expanding liberal governance to Africa.

624
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Mussolini's colony was really just an Islamofascist outpost, and when the people who visited there saw that,

625
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
they recoiled and they recognized that this is not some Italian colony, right?

626
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This doesn't represent Italian values, it represents Mussolini's fascism.

627
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Now, coming more up to date, in the discussion today about colonialism,

628
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:18,000
it seemed to a situation where some countries insist that, for instance, reparations need to be paid for colonialism.

629
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There must be large cash transfers, sometimes to the Swiss bank account of the relevant leader,

630
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
that some kind of compensation must be made.

631
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
One of the things that's very striking to me about this argument is that that argument is only heard, of course,

632
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
from states that have not worked well after the period of colonial rule,

633
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
whereas states, countries which have boomed in the last half-century are looking forward in this way.

634
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Is that true? Is it the case that now we hear about the crimes of colonialism

635
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and most just the places that just haven't worked for various reasons, you know, misgovernment,

636
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
misgovernance, corruption and much more.

637
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
There's a reason why Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe and Singapore is Singapore.

638
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, that's right, and let's face it, nobody takes reparations seriously other than a kind of shakedown

639
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and a kind of foreign aid dressed up with a moral cause.

640
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But the United Nations takes it seriously.

641
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, I know, but let's be honest.

642
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I mean, so where you have seen payments, right, is in alleged response to the victims of counterinsurgency operations,

643
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
like the Mao Mao, the Mao Mao, and in Namibia, right, to the Herrero and the Nama.

644
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Although in the case of the Herrero and the Nama, right, it was basically a payoff to the government,

645
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and the government is run by the Ova Mamboo, who are not Herrero or Nama,

646
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and so there's a big internal debate about where that money is going to end up.

647
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's going to end up in party cadres, pockets in Namibia.

648
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
People who were not the perpetrators gave money to people who weren't the victims.

649
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Right, well, the Germans, the Germans handed over, God knows how much,

650
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
$4 billion or something, $400 million or whatever it was last year, two years ago,

651
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to Namibia in reparation for the alleged genocide of Herrero, which is a myth, by the way,

652
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
which I'm going to document in my forthcoming book on German colonialism,

653
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
called In Defense of German Colonialism.

654
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
But I see another attempted cancellation coming up.

655
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, well, luckily, the publisher is not to be canceled.

656
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But what I will say is there is a kind of just shakedown culture, right,

657
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and they've become kind of like cargo cults, right, basically like let's, you know, really,

658
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
why not try and shake down the form of colonial power for some guilt money

659
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and spend our time in Berlin or Paris or London,

660
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
angling for legal compensation and being in the court cases.

661
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Because ultimately, if they ever give in, right, it's just like a bonanza, right?

662
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I mean, suddenly this free money comes in.

663
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And the Europeans being, ultimately, they don't really care about brown or black people.

664
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They care more about their moral guilt and their self-absorption

665
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and the ability to achieve moral transcendence and ultimately superiority through their guilt.

666
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You know, don't really care that dropping large wads of cash into communities

667
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is extremely harmful to their productive capacities, creates all kinds of malign impacts,

668
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
but they don't really care about that.

669
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So the Germans dropped this big wad of cash on the Namibian government two years ago

670
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
saying that's it, now we're done, right?

671
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Now we've atoned for our sins, right?

672
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It sets off a mad scramble, as you suggest, among the cadres for who's going to get this money.

673
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It doesn't achieve anything.

674
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That's the only form of reparations that actually works now,

675
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
which is identifying a clear set of alleged victims in a particular incident, right,

676
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
in which a clear harm was supposedly made.

677
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But the argument of reparations for colonialism itself, I mean, it's a non-starter as a moral question,

678
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
but it's also, I think, a non-starter as a practical question.

679
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Now as we start to wrap up, first of all, is colonialism worth reclaiming?

680
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
What are the aspects of it that could be applied if understood properly in the world today?

681
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Well, colonialism happens whether we like it or not

682
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:30,000
in the sense that dysfunctional governments have their governance capacities taken over by external actors.

683
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Often it's an IMF loan with conditions, or it's a World Bank loan with conditions about governance.

684
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You'd call that colonialism of a kind?

685
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's not colonialism, but it's external governance.

686
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And it draws much on colonial experiences in terms of how you can enhance indigenous capacity

687
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
by keeping some form of gatekeeping or tutelary role on the outside, right?

688
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But that's how colonialism was trying to develop self-government, right,

689
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
which is as much indigenous native government as possible, creating structures,

690
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
allowing the governor to veto acts, allowing the governor to appoint the district commissioner.

691
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I mean, that was the sort of what Lugard called the dual mandate, right,

692
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and sort of our mandate to the local government and the local government's mandate to its people,

693
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and that's how we're going to operate.

694
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
No, I don't like to use the word colonialism for that type of external governance,

695
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
because that's really just external governance, right?

696
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Now there are opportunities for actual colonialism.

697
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I mean, Paul Romer, who is the World Bank official economist, right,

698
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
a University of Chicago professor, proposed this idea of a charter city, right,

699
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
to take a piece of land in one of these countries, lease it from the government for a dollar a year, right,

700
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and put it under the formal rule of an external power, right?

701
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So a charter city would be kind of like what Hong Kong was, right?

702
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's basically a leased piece of land that is put under the sovereignty of a western government for a fixed amount of time,

703
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
during which its laws and its rule apply there.

704
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's allowed to trade, people are allowed to migrate, right?

705
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And what it does is it creates this little kind of dynamo of economic success

706
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
along the coast or in the territory that eventually can be handed back.

707
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean, Romer says that Hong Kong itself, given the number of people it positively affected in China,

708
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
because of its demonstration effects, because of how the Chinese learn from it,

709
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
can almost single-handedly be used to justify British colonialism just by the numbers, right?

710
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Because if it's responsible for China's economic boom, then it's a pretty big data point.

711
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So ideas like that.

712
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Now, it's tough to bring in the white man, mainly because the white man doesn't want to be there, right,

713
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
because of the opposition.

714
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But we do see, for example, non-white countries going in.

715
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So the South Koreans have created essentially a small colony in Bangladesh.

716
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It's basically an industrial zone.

717
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's run by the Korean Development Authority.

718
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's a walled city.

719
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's got factories.

720
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It's got schools.

721
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's got its own governments.

722
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's basically a little Korean colony in Bangladesh.

723
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Nobody notices it because they're all like brown and yellow and aren't they all just the same?

724
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And who cares about the Koreans colonizing Bangladesh?

725
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I think it's great.

726
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's a model.

727
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You've also seen some behavior like that in Yemen, in the north end of Yemen, where the Qataris and Saudis and the Turks

728
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
basically created a colony, a colony that's externally run.

729
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think that that's a great model to follow because the Yemenis can't stand up their own government.

730
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
This is all kind of beyond the New York Times' horizon of interest because they're all brown and black people,

731
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and there's no white man with a pith hat on to decry.

732
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
But it's actually working quite well.

733
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I think that type of colonialism has a lot of potential.

734
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
What about Chinese colonialism in Africa today?

735
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Would you call that colonialism?

736
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's not even external governance for the most part because the Chinese,

737
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
unlike the South Koreans, don't actually have a governance model that they can share.

738
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So the Chinese invest a lot.

739
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah, they create company towns.

740
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
They provide infrastructure, but they're not doing governance.

741
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
What's the difference in a town that you buy up and run?

742
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Well, because the Chinese still are not bringing in their own administrators.

743
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
They're not setting up their own special zone laws the way that, say, the Koreans did in Bangladesh.

744
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I mean, they're still relying on local police.

745
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They're still using local laws.

746
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I mean, they're not really trying to govern beyond just running their enterprises.

747
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Now, yeah, those enterprises are big, sprawling institutions,

748
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but they're still just like one company operation.

749
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So I don't see the Chinese doing it.

750
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The Chinese are smart enough to know that they can't do that, right?

751
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That they can't govern other peoples.

752
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Do they not want to?

753
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I don't think they want to.

754
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
They want their money.

755
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They want their investment.

756
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
They want their leverage over those governments in terms of the economic leverage.

757
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
But I don't think they see themselves as having an interest, even,

758
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
in spreading their governance model to other parts of the world.

759
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Indeed, their whole discourse is to each his own.

760
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's interesting that today when we talk about colonialism,

761
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
countries like America, Israel, and others,

762
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
the term is used sometimes of them as a sort of smear or a slander.

763
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Even there's nothing that America is doing that is colonial

764
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
by the terms that you've just laid out.

765
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yet, for some reason, it is still seen,

766
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
what is seen today as something that only, as you say, white people would be guilty of

767
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
or could be guilty of.

768
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Is that true?

769
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, it's trying to backcast the word to say any settlement

770
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
or expansion of one's territory makes you colonial.

771
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So if that's the case, virtually all of the Native American tribes are colonial as well.

772
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I mean, all of the lands claimed by the Cherokee are colonial takings from other tribes.

773
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
The Hawaiians who claim indigeneity in Hawaii arose from colonial processes

774
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
in the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific.

775
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So we're all colonial.

776
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So it's just a statement of the obvious, right?

777
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And to say that a place like Puerto Rico is colonial.

778
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Well, of course, the Puerto Ricans have never demanded independence, right?

779
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I mean, the independence movement is a flop in Puerto Rico

780
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
for reasons that they know well, right?

781
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Because it would be a disaster.

782
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I mean, they benefit from that connection.

783
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The little bits of colonies left around the world, the French pieces, the British pieces, right?

784
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
They have referendum.

785
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
There's a place that's related to the Norfolk Islands off New Zealand.

786
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I mean, they have referendum.

787
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They never achieve a necessary majority because these places know how much they benefit

788
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
from that colonial connection.

789
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
As we wrap up, I come back to where we started, the outrage, attempted cancellations of you

790
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and a few other academics who actually investigate research in these areas

791
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
without just coming to what seemed to be the preordained conclusions you're meant to come to.

792
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And just to return to that, as I see it,

793
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
the criticisms that have come towards you, the criticisms that have come to others in the same area,

794
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
it's almost as if there's an area of the past on this occasion, colonialism,

795
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
but there are others as well that's effectively behind crime scene tape,

796
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and you're not meant to go there.

797
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And as I see it, the reason that people don't want you to go there

798
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
is because they somehow think that if you do, we're going to do it again.

799
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You heard that a certain amount in recent years in Britain.

800
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
There were people who claimed that the Brexit vote was just the beginning of a new era

801
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
of British Empire building, and no member of the British government has at all expressed

802
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
an interest in going and taking over other parts of the world in the last six years,

803
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
very far from it.

804
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
They seem to be wanting to govern their own state as well or badly as they can,

805
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
but that seems to be a motif that has been emerging.

806
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Don't deal with this stuff.

807
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Don't even weigh up the pros and cons of colonialism,

808
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
because the moment you talk about the pros, we'll just be off again.

809
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Do you agree?

810
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah, and I think it's even bigger than that.

811
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I mean, it's true that they don't want to legitimate the idea of western control

812
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
or rule over any part of the world, even if people's in other parts of the world

813
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
would line up to be ruled by western countries.

814
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I think that's true, by the way, separate issue.

815
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But I think there's a bigger issue here, and it's part of what your book,

816
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The War on the West, is about, which is that colonialism is seen as kind of unambiguous bad

817
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
that can be chalked up on the negative side of western society

818
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and constantly used to bash it whenever it claims any right.

819
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And part of it's a response to the fact that as the world progresses,

820
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
the West is getting stronger, in my view.

821
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It is getting stronger.

822
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It is getting more dominant.

823
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It is getting more attractive.

824
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The rivals are falling by the wayside.

825
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The Chinese model is flat.

826
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The Russian model is over.

827
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
The Brazilian model is long dead.

828
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I mean, so I think there is this kind of resentment about the success of the West.

829
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And colonialism has become this kind of quiver of arrows.

830
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Let's say, whenever you talk about the West, let's not forget colonialism.

831
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And the requirement there is that that debate be not available for discussion.

832
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
That that's just an unambiguous bad, and you're supposed to bow your head and say,

833
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
yes, you're right, that's a bad part of it.

834
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So they hate the idea that this box, this Pandora's box of debate could be opened

835
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
because it weakens what to them is one of their key kind of charges in opposition to the rise of the West.

836
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Well, Professor Bruce Gilley, thank you very much.

837
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We've covered an enormous amount of terrain, but that was absolutely fascinating

838
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
and has certainly given us a new view on an old question of colonialism.

839
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Thank you.

840
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Thank you.

841
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Thank you.
