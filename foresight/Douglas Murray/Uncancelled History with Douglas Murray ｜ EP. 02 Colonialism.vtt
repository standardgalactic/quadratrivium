Hello, I'm Douglas Murray and welcome to Uncancelled History.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Today, colonialism.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm joined by Professor Bruce Gilley.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Bruce Gilley is Professor of Political Science at Portland State University.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
His research focuses on topics including colonialism and Asian politics.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
In 2018, he published an article, The Case for Colonialism,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
which was first published in the Third World Quarterly.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
It sparked enormous protests and nearly half of the journal's editorial board

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
resigned in protest.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
The author of numerous articles and books, in 2021,

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Gilley published his biography of Sir Alan Burns,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
a 20th century British colonial officer.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Today on Uncancelled History, Colonialism.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
The Case for Colonialism

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
First of all, thank you so much, Bruce, for joining me.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
In recent years, colonialism has been shown to be portrayed as

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
one of the absolutely foundational sins of the West,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
perhaps along with slavery, racism.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Colonialism is one that has been most zoomed in on.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
What is colonialism, first of all?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Well, I think if we take the biggest view, colonialism or imperialism,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
as it used to be called before that became a dirty word too,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
is simply where one group of people with an established form of government

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
travels to a part of the world where their government doesn't currently rule

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
and establishes its rule there.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
And by that definition, all of world history is a history of imperialism and colonialism.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
There is no people or no country today that has not at some point

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
been involved in imperialism and colonialism.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
So nothing specifically unique or different about Europeans

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
doing exactly what everyone else did.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
When people hear the term colonialism now,

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
they zoom in on a very specific and small portion of the world of colonialism,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
which is basically 19th century and early 20th century European colonialism

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
in what we now call the Third World.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Certainly in modern academia and perhaps the wider culture,

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
18th and 19th century European colonialism is now seen as being a sort of shorthand

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
for something that is unadulteratedly cruel, entirely racist.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
What about this analysis in your view, full short?

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, in part because it's either true by definition or it's patently false.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
True by definition because every group, up until very recently,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
was inherently racist towards other groups.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
The Cherokees of the Americas were racist towards other Native Americans.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
The Bantu were racist towards all of the Black African tribes they conquered

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
as they imperialized Southern Africa.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
The Maori were racist towards other Pacific Asian tribes.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
I mean, everyone was a racist if by that term we mean the assumptions by group A

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
that the members of group B are inferior and deserve to be conquered if they can be.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
That's a universal human phenomena and it arises from evolutionary needs

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
for basically in group solidarity.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
So racism is the standard default position for all peoples.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
So to say that the Europeans were racist is just to state the obvious

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
because all peoples were racist.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
If it's not a statement of the obvious then it's patently false

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
and by that I mean that if we were to judge the racism of the Europeans

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
vis-a-vis the places they conquered, compared to the racism of other groups at the time

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
we would find the Europeans much less racist

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
and if we were going to put it on a spectrum we would say the only anti-racists

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
in the whole world at the time of European colonials and we're the Europeans

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
because they were the ones who went abroad and said these peoples have the capacity

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
to be just like us.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
These people deserve freedom.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
These people deserve to be freed from slavery.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
They deserve to be developed.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
They deserve to be civilized, which of course is seen as a sort of great racist act

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
but it's quite the opposite.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
It's the act of saying all peoples have the potential to be self-governing,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
to be flourishing, to have a written language, history, arts and culture.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
This was the great anti-racist campaign that European colonialism represented.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
So that's why I say it's either simply a statement of the obvious or it's patently false.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Roughly, what were other people at the time thinking?

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
You mentioned these were attitudes that Europeans held

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
but what would have been more normal attitudes at the time for the rest of the world about other groups?

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, the rest of the world, and this is true well into the 20th century,

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
basically that different groups saw themselves based on their ability to spread their rule

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
and their culture and their institutions to others

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
and they were more superior the more they were able to do that.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
So this is why the Bantu expansion into southern Africa, the Buganda expansion throughout East Africa,

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
the Fulani Slave Empire of West Africa, all of these groups saw themselves as inferior

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
and saw those they conquered as not just moral inferiors but somehow subhuman.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
In the sense that they weren't engaged in a civilizing action, they were engaged in a simple conquest.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
And this was real racism in the sense of denying the humanity of those who were put under the subjugation

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
which is why these empires often were slave empires or simply genocidal empires.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
The Europeans were different, right?

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Not entirely, they had their brutal aspects, they had their old imperialist conquest aspects

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
but the seed of the difference in the European case was this idea of civilization.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Civilization raises those that you conquer from the level of subhuman to being human

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
because why would you civilize farm animals?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
You civilize people who you tick to be your moral equals.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Now in 2017 you caused something of an uproar.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
You wrote a piece called The Case for Colonialism in which you made the claim that European colonialism

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
was indeed beneficial to colonized people.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Can you tell us something about the backlash of attacks?

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
What you said in that article, what happened as a result of it?

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Because this was a proper firestorm in your area.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
This was, I wrote the article of 2017, The Case for Colonialism

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
because I was starting work on my biography of Sir Alan Burns,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
great British colonial administrator which became the last imperialist

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
and I was trying to frame the basic case for colonialism that his life represented and he articulated.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And it went through peer review, got a split decision, the editor decided to run it,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
kind of thinking it might be a good debate and literally within minutes of it appearing online

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
there were two online petitions started, one by a interpretive dance instructor in Britain

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
and one by an English professor in Manitoba and a third by a professor in Syracuse University

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
who also wanted my PhD revoked.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
So three petitions actually which eventually had about 30,000 signatures demanding the article be retracted,

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
saying that this was violence against brown and black people, saying that this was holocaust denial,

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
saying that this was a threat to the safety of my students.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
So my university launched a diversity investigation claiming my article was an act of violence.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Eventually the editorial staff in London had death threats from nationalists in India.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
They asked me could they please withdraw the article.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
I said of course, not a big deal to me, their safety was paramount.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
It was reprinted in Academic Questions which is the House Journal of the National Association of Scholars.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
And I think thanks to the firestorm has attracted far more attention than it would have attracted

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
if it had simply been allowed to be read and disputed.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
The original journal that it was published in then unpublished in just decided to pretend it hadn't happened?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So this is the third world quarterly.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
No, they did things by the book.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
They were not allowed to retract an article because of a political firestorm according to the ethics commission of the UK,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
which actually is stronger than the ethics commission in the US for publishing.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
So they had to ask my request to withdraw it, not retract it, which I agreed to for their physical safety.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So it was withdrawn, not retracted.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
So if you go to the website today, you'll see the withdrawal notice that states very clearly that they faced death threats.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
And the funny thing is now the third world quarterly has allowed, now that all their editorial staff has been revamped with ultra woke academics,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
they're allowing their authors to cite the article again, but they're only citing the withdrawal notice.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
They're not citing the actual article, but they're trying to kind of piggyback on the popularity of the article to generate metrics for their journal,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
but you can't actually read the article on it.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
So there are three petitions against you, including the interpretive dance lady.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
And she didn't presumably make her objection through the form of interpretive dance, did she?

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
No, she used the method of a petition.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
And you might say, well, okay, it's a free world.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
And I do believe this.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
I think if you want to set up a petition and oppose something, be my guest.

09:47.000 --> 10:02.000
But what was, I think, shocking to me was how many people signed that petition who were credentialed academics holding positions in universities in the UK and Canada and Australia and the United States,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
universities which are by their very principles committed to the principle of academic freedom.

10:07.000 --> 10:18.000
And so you have, I mean, okay, people signed petitions, but academics standing up very publicly and saying, I don't think this article deserves to be written.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I think academic freedom has certain limitations.

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
And when people say things that I think are racist or white supremacist, academic freedom has reached its limits.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
It seemed to me that with that article, you had undoubtedly hit a tripwire in our day.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
And the way I sort of thought of it in a way was perhaps there would have been a time maybe 100 years ago where to write, I mean, this isn't particularly the case,

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
but to write only negative things about colonialism and everybody involved in colonial projects would have caused some kind of problem.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
And that what had happened is that in our own day, to say actually the picture is a bit more nuanced, more rounded, is just unacceptable.

10:59.000 --> 11:09.000
It has to be that colonialism is like the Holocaust, as one of your accusers said, that it's just, there is no context, it's just bad.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Something like that, isn't it?

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
There's just a unanimity that there's no texture to be added that if somebody like you or Professor Nigel Bigger at Oxford says,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
hang on, it's a bit more complicated.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Effectively, you're seen as being an apologist for the worst successes of colonialism.

11:25.000 --> 11:37.000
So I actually think not because I think this idea that there was a time in European history or British history when it was nothing but daring,

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
to glorification of colonialism and the empire is a myth.

11:42.000 --> 11:53.000
There was never a time in British history, in British education, in British newspapers where the imperial enterprise, where the colonies,

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
whether we're talking the American colonies, Australia or later Africa, where this was not subject to a constant debate,

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
and where people who were critical of this were very free and very prolific in writing their criticism.

12:08.000 --> 12:18.000
So I think this, you get this kind of, this narrative, especially in the UK that, well, at least we're not back in the days when it's all celebration of the empire.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
And there was never a time in British history where there was nothing but glorification and celebration of empire.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Where do you think that idea comes from?

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I think it's because the people think that they have a balanced perspective.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
And by being balanced, they try to set up this idea that, well, I'm not like those crazy old imperialists like that all day.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I think we need balance.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And so I'm not on the right side of the spectrum.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm a centrist.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
In fact, there was never that perspective.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
So I think they're trying to make themselves feel like they're the centrists in the issue.

12:49.000 --> 13:00.000
Whereas, in fact, the arguments have always been about the critical and the contentious rollout of empire and what was happening.

13:00.000 --> 13:13.000
And so anti-colonialism didn't arise in response to some excessively positive account of empire that was dominating and that was hegemonic in the empire.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
It didn't, right?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Because that's its false flag.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
It basically argues against a strawman, right?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
There was never that.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
And so what the anti-colonials are trying to do is to suggest that they're just bringing balance to the argument, right?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
But they're not, right?

13:26.000 --> 13:36.000
In fact, what they're doing is disbalancing the argument entirely, taking it from what it used to be, which is you could say the case for colonialism or the case against colonialism

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
and shut down the case for colonialism, say there's only one case to be made.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Anti-colonialism is the only case to be made.

13:42.000 --> 13:55.000
And what you, Professor Nigel Bigger, a very small number of other academics have been doing is to be inserting this information into the debate, facts, interpretations of it,

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
which seem just not to have been put in for a very long time, certainly not in the academic field.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
So you mentioned, I mean, there are sort of positives about colonialism.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
There are negatives.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
What were the positives in your view for peoples in the countries that Europeans went to and ruled?

14:13.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, I think we need to start at a very high level of abstraction because the fundamental thing is this, is if you were in a society which had a stone age level of technological development,

14:28.000 --> 14:43.000
had no fixed borders, had no institutionalized system of governance, had not yet discovered the wheel, or in some more advanced places nonetheless still lived in an essentially feudal system, right,

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
with a very entrenched elite and a very impoverished population.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
And you had the opportunity to be ruled by an advanced European civilization, right?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Why would you not want that to happen, right?

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
So just at the level of abstraction, like civilization A, which is superior to civilization B, and I have no problems using the term superior.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm going to say lots of people, the moment you say superior, they're going to...

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Absolutely superior, right?

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
Because superior in the sense of better technology, better healthcare, better education, more accountable governance, more rights for marginalized communities,

15:21.000 --> 15:32.000
especially women, urban development, technology, transportation, life-saving research and science, right?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Those are the things I mean.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
This is superior, right?

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
And there's no objective definition, distinction between that and what's less.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
If you had that opportunity, what would your society do?

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
Of course, they would jump at the opportunity, which is why so much of European imperialism spread with as much pull as it did push, right?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Indeed, the pull factors are often the dominating ones.

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
The British went to Ghana, they said not much interested, left the Ghani kings, demanded that they come back, begged them to come back.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Finally, they did sign the treaties.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Why?

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
Because British Empire or other empires brought security, it brought stability, it brought opportunities.

16:11.000 --> 16:19.000
It brought an end to inter-tribal warfare, which in many cases, these kings and these tribal leaders recognized was destroying their societies, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
They needed essentially a hegemon.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I mean, it's an old Hobbesian story, but that's what they needed.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
So, you know, at a very high level of abstraction, right?

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
I think that the onus of proof is that colonialism didn't bring tremendous benefits, right?

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
I mean, just in the sense of the logic of a more superior, I mean, you don't need to use superior, more developed, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
More advanced civilization, having an opportunity to rule a less advanced civilization is so patently obvious, right?

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
That the burden of proof that this was not a good thing, I think lies upon those who say this somehow brought, bought harms.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
And I think that's where we then have to get into, okay, so it's a good idea in general, right?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Was it a good idea in practice, right?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Now, this is where we need to talk about, like, how it rolled out.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Places were better, places were worse, there were abuses here, not here.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
I mean, now we get into what used to be the debate on colonialism, which is let's talk about the practical opportunities, feasibility of things,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
things that were done well, things were done badly in particular contexts.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
But, you know, this idea of a blanket condemnation is just not tenable.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I suppose there's two things that the anti-colonialists say at this point, which is, first of all,

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
yes, there are maybe technical advances and so on, but that two things occur with colonialism.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
One is the presumption that there are people who are sort of morally better, going into less morally developed societies.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
And the other one would be something along the lines of you're instituting a form of inequality,

17:51.000 --> 18:00.000
and along the lines of that, along the way, you're also, for instance, eradicating local cultures, local norms.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Replacing local norms with European norms.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
What do you say to those claims?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
All of them don't withstand scrutiny.

18:08.000 --> 18:17.000
Again, the idea of a moral superiority is one thing that was distinctly absent in the European mission.

18:17.000 --> 18:27.000
If you take the idea of the civilizing mission seriously, what it implies is the moral potential of those who are colonizing to be exactly like you.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's very explicit, right?

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
And in terms of life-saving medicines being morally superior to the absence of life-saving medicines,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
yeah, I have no problems going to the mat and saying that's morally superior.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
It's morally superior to save lives, to prevent people from being killed through violent conflicts,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
to give rights to people who are traditionally marginalized.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
That's morally superior.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I have no problem with that.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Most liberals would argue that, too, except when you talk about it in the context of colonialism.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Second of all, in terms of foreign norms or alien norms, don't forget,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
almost all the places that were colonized were already under alien rule.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
But it was indigenous alien rule, not European alien rule.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
And we're talking mainly here about Africa.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, you know, most places, I mean, look at the Malay Peninsula, right?

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
I mean, basically, the Malay Peninsula was a bunch of small fiefdoms, small sultanates, right?

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
Those sultanates expanded or contracted based upon their power, right,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
and brought in people who had been under another sultanate.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
So, I mean, the idea of like indigenous rule, I mean, what is indigenous rule in a context

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
in which the world has always been organized by empire spreading as far as they can

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
and when they weaken being subjugated by other empires?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
It is, you're right, most explicitly clear in Africa

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
because you can actually see what was happening at the time of European conquest.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I mean, the Fulani Slave Empire, which was basically an Islamic caliphate

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
of the central part of the Sahara, was spreading towards West Africa when the British came in.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
The reason why it was so easy for the British to establish their control in northern Nigeria

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
was because those groups recognized the choice was British imperialism or the Fulani Slave Empire.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And the British Empire started to look very attractive compared to that.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Third point, destroying local cultures.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
European imperialism was famous for its discovery and documentation and celebration of local cultures.

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
Many of these languages would not have survived, usually not the colonial administrators,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
but the explorers and linguists and academics and researchers who came with imperialism

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
gone and documented those languages.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
The U-language of Togo was essentially rescued by the Germans after they colonized it.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
And there was two or three German linguists who went out and documented those languages

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
before they were lost, created dictionaries, created study guides.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
I mean, the entire language would not exist but for German colonialism.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
It's to say with James Princip and the language in India.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
The British rediscovery of Indian heritage is well known.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
I mean, I don't need to document it but the Asiatics and the Orientalists were the ones who rescued

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
and saved these cultures from destruction either by an indigenous empire or just by the forces of modernization.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Swihili was spreading in East Africa.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It was going to be the hegemonic language.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
If the Germans had not documented those languages in the Mount Kilimanjaro area, those languages would have been lost.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
There is a presumption, I think. We've come across it in a number of cases.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
This presumption that if the Westerners, if the Europeans get it, go into a place,

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
they bring certain evils into an effectively Edenic society.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
The locals are otherwise living unbothered by modernity, by the vices of humankind.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Obviously, this wasn't the case.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
But it seems that people are very reluctant to recognize that there's a balance of things going on here, at the very least.

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, well, not only that the pre-colonial societies were not the Garden of Eden far from it

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
and had any of those pre-colonial societies been literate or had record-keeping traditions,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
we would have more information on that. We don't.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
So what do you turn to? You turn to the civilization that produced records and newspaper articles

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
and parliamentary inquiries and academic researches and whatnot, which is the European civilization.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
The knowledge base is hugely biased towards the European colonial experience

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
and in particular, because it comes with a self-critical tradition, a lot of that knowledge is critical.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
So this is somehow evidence that it was the Garden of Eden before European colonialism.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
It's clearly not the case. Secondly, quite aside from that, the more significant question is,

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
okay, if the Europeans had said, right, we're not going into Africa,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
we're going to have this kind of agreement among ourselves not to go in.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
So what would have happened?

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Well, trade is still going to happen. Missionaries are still going to go in there.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
Alcohol is going to go in there. The maximum machine gun is going to go in there.

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
So what you get then is a kind of Yahoo explorers and claim-stakers among the Europeans,

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
allying themselves with local forces. Would that have been a better governing experience for Africa?

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
So living in splendid isolation is not an option for Africa or the Middle East or Southeast Asia

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
or the Pacific at this time. Globalization is happening.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Do you want globalization to be governed or do you want it to be ungoverned?

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And the ungoverned bits and pieces we have, such as the Congo Free State,

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
which actually was relatively well governed compared to some of the worst ones,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
but the private colonies and Liberia under the Firestone Company

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
and some of the German trading companies in the Pacific,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
obviously the East India Company before the Mutiny,

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
these private colonialism did not equip themselves very well.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
So that's the alternative. The alternative is not splendid isolation.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
The alternative is kind of these freelancers and mercenaries running these places,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
which tended to be much worse because there was no accountability.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
In 2020, you published your biography of Sir Alan Burns, The Last Imperialist.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
First of all, before we get into the controversies around that,

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
perhaps you could explain who was Alan Burns and why was he somebody you wanted to write about?

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Burns was a colonial administrator born in the Caribbean,

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
went to West Africa on the eve of World War I, fought in the West Africa campaigns in the Cameroons

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
and in Togo was then put on the Nigerian government,

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
became a colonial secretary in the Bahamas, became the governor of Belize,

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
or what was then the British Honduras, eventually became the governor of the Gold Coast,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
which is now Ghana during World War II.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
And then after that, a very kind of storied colonial career was sent to the United Nations

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
in the 50s to basically stand up for the British Empire

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
when the United Nations was becoming a kind of decolonization machine, right?

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
What interested me about Burns was he was an unapologetic defender of empire

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
way into the 20th century.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
He dies in 1980.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
Right, so he is one of the few people who carries on the case for colonialism

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
well after most British have kind of retired in a kind of awkward, cringy feeling about,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
well, that wasn't very nice, but long as I have my pension,

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
and of course the 60s is the era of the great radical anti-colonial movements,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
not only in the global system, but on campus, of course,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
and Burns is pushing the argument right to the end, right?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
And presently enough, because he lives through the 70s,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
which is the great lost decade in the developing world, right,

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
where massacres and wars and humanitarian catastrophes that we didn't notice

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
because there's no white men involved.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
But I mean, this was the great lost decade of the Third World.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Where are we talking about here?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Oh, we're talking about all of Africa, essentially.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
We're talking about Indonesia.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
We're talking about the period of conflict in the Middle East.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
We're talking about India itself, the great, like, granddaddy of them all, right,

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
with stagnation, with communal violence, with an emergency and a suspension of democracy.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Basically, every part of the Third World is falling apart

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
and going into spiral in the 70s, right, and it slowly starts to recover by the 80s.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
But Burns is paying attention to this, right?

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
Burns is paying attention to the massacres, the Biafra war, right,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
is maybe the one that draws world attention,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
because we're talking one to two million people killed in that.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Of course, partition might have caused some misgivings

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
about this whole decolonization idea.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
But Burns is kind of arguing the case.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
This is why we shouldn't have ended it so fast.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
This is why the United Nations mishandled this whole issue, right?

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
They were so obsessed with getting the colonialists out

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
that they didn't pay attention to what was going to take over

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and who was going to fill the power vacuum

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and were these going to be stable states?

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
So I wrote the biography because I found him a compelling figure.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I also tracked down his family.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I saw his papers sitting in an attic in Chelmsford.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And, you know, classic kind of British thing.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I mean, here's the guy who, in my mind,

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
is one of the greatest generation of the late colonial administrators

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
who are helping to get these countries ready for independence.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
And he's just kind of treated with this icy coldness.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
And there's his paper sitting in an attic in Chelmsford,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
you know, because you wouldn't want to write about this person, right?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I mean, what an evil person this is.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And yet he is a great...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I mean, he's a hero of the British people, in my mind,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
but the British were not interested in it.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
By the way, before we come back to Bernadette,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
one of the things that's always interested me about the post-colonial period

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
are the number of post-colonial writers who say

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
there is a form of Western colonialism that these countries,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
particularly in Africa, have had to suffer under

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
and that they must be returned to another state.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Now, the obvious thing, it seems to me, is that you would argue

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
that they should be returned to some pre-colonial state.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
But that argument seems to be quite uncommon.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
A lot of the people I'm thinking of writers like Franz Fanon and others,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
once the anti-colonialist movement gets going,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
argue for Marxism for these societies.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
In other words, they say Western imperialism has been the problem

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
and that we must therefore return these societies

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
and we must return them to Western Marxism.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
And there was always something...

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
There was always something specifically political going on that era as well, wasn't it?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because we're talking about the 60s,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
we're talking about still dreams of Marxism going on,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
and it seemed like the post-colonial developing world

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
could always be used as another experimenting place for that.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
Right, so the great myth of anti-colonialism

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
is that it represented indigenous forces

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
and indigenous resistance to colonialism.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
And it didn't. It represented European intellectuals

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
exporting their ideologies to hapless brown and black people

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
and finding people like Fanon or Amacal Cabral,

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
who spent most of their time hanging out in cafes in Paris and Lisbon,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
and sending them back as representatives of the people,

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
oppressed black people who needed to lead the fight against colonialism.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But these people didn't represent anything in their societies.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
They barely had traveled.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Most of them couldn't speak the languages of their own societies.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
What they brought back was not some indigenous response to colonialism.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
What they brought back was a bunch of half-assed ideologies from Europe.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
Most of them Marxist or Leninist or vaguely post-modernist as Fanon was.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
And what's interesting in terms of this decolonization process is

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
the indigenous leaders in these societies saw that, right?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
They said to the Europeans,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
don't you dare hand over power to these people, right?

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
This was the great king of the Congo who was saying to the Belgians,

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
this guy, Patrice Lumumba, is a madman, right?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Don't give in to them. Don't promise independence.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Don't hand over to these people because they're a bunch of loudmouths

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
and they're the minority, right?

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
We need you to stay, right? We're not ready for independence.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Even Julius Nierere, who became the first prime minister of Tanzania

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
and then president of Tanzania, was very explicit when he went to the United Nations

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
and said, we're being pushed towards independence way faster than we'll be ready for it.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Julius Nierere didn't think Tanzania would be ready for independence

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
until about the year 2000, right?

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
But the momentum was, you have to resist colonialism.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
You have to go.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
And so these people who had no ability to hold these countries together

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
and were bringing in not some indigenous wisdom of governance,

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
but half-baked Marxist theories were thrown into power

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
as representatives of the people against European colonialism.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
And this was because there was a perception of the winds of change.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
There was just a historic moment. There was no point resisting it.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It's two things.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
First of all, Europe is exhausted after World War II

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
and European populations are lining up for bread.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
They have no heating. They have no electricity.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
The appetite for providing global public goods to foreign peoples was at an end, right?

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
And one of the tragedies of World War I and World War II

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
was this loss of European willpower to maintain empires, right?

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
So first of all, there's no support for colonialism on the home front.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
That's the most fundamental reason for the end of colonialism.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
It's not Gandhi standing up to the British Empire,

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
you know, these virtuous George Washington's with black skin,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
bringing down the pretensions of this strong imperialist.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
No, nonsense.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
The imperialists were brought down by the home front,

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
who said, we're done with colonialism.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
We can barely feed our families, right?

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
And so the willpower on the home front evaporated.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Later on top of that, you now have the Soviet Union,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
styling itself as the liberator of black and brown people everywhere,

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
even as it's colonizing Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Baltics.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
But anyways, put that aside, they're liberators,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
and of course they'll bring democracy and prosperity everywhere they go.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Well, now at the United Nations, you have this dance of the Soviet Union and the United States.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
The United States having its anti-colonial tradition,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
but recognizing that this is not going to end well,

33:09.000 --> 33:17.000
but not wanting to be outflanked by the Americans for the participation of these third world governments.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
So, loss of resources on the home front,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
the United Nations system pushing for decolonization,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
it's an open door.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Don't tell me that Gandhi brought down the British Empire.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I mean, he's a complete flinty, silly man.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
He's pushing on an open door, right?

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
These doors open up very quickly and with grave consequences for these populations.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Now, just to stick with Burns for a second, when your biography of Burns came out,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
you were attacked from some perhaps predictable quarters for it.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
One Marxist philosopher claimed that you were endorsing a white nationalist perspective.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
What do you say to people like that?

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
People who claim you're doing something wrong by just even writing about a figure like Alan Burns?

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, I think the criticism was that I was enabling white supremacy

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
by writing a positive biography of a British colonial official.

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, you don't know where to start because in part because one of the things that attracted me to Burns

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
is how much he was loved among those where he governed, right?

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
I mean, he was called the Sunshine Governor on the Gold Coast, right?

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
They constantly told him that they wanted to extend his term and not just the kind of local elites, right?

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
But I mean, he always would tell the story about, you know, he would go off on safari to visit some hill station

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
and the only person he would have with him would be his orderly.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Why? Because the British officials were never afraid of being murdered.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
They were never afraid of being attacked.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
They were always welcomed wherever they went, right?

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
So this supposedly evil person, but now we need a white Marxist in Toronto

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
to tell these stupid brown and black people who kept liking people like Burns that they were mistaken

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
and they really needed to get their marching orders from white academics and philosophers in Western universities.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I mean, to me, this is the real racism, right?

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
The real racism is these white academics who tell brown and black people what they are

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
and are not allowed to think about their own histories

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
and what they should and should not think about those histories, right?

35:21.000 --> 35:28.000
This is, I mean, I think it's Dr. N'Joyer, Juan Jiro N'Joyer, British legal professor, right,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
who says this is the real imperialism, right?

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
The real imperialism is these white academics trying to tell people in the former colonies

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
what they are and are not allowed to think about their own histories.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
Are there ways to ensure that academics like yourself who do write about this are able to do so

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
without being assailed in this way?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I mean, there's fair criticism.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Of course, nobody ever wants to stop that,

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
but the sort of, let's say, the demonization that's been seen

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
against you, against Nigel Bigwood Oxford,

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
saying that maybe we could try to look at colonialism in the round.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
Is there any way to protect academics to be able to continue such research without that kind of...

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
No, I think right now, if you're a young scholar or a young historian and you look at me,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
the implications are very clear, right?

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
No, you will not get a job, especially as a white academic,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
unless you are more woke than the woke, right?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
And you need to be so virulently anti-colonial.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
You need to be practically insanely anti-colonial

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
in order to even have a thought of getting a job in academia.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
So no, the window has closed very narrowly

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
and it's about to close even more firmly shut.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So that's one thing.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
My argument to the academy is something like this.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
If you were to produce a vaccine in a laboratory filled with bacteria

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
and all sorts of hygienic conditions,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
would you trust that vaccine in your patients?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The argument would be no, right?

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
Producing anti-colonial history in an environment in which only anti-colonial history is allowed

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
is essentially the equivalent of producing a tainted vaccine.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
There's no scientific reason to believe that that history is accurate

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
because it's been produced in a laboratory that doesn't have adequate scientific conditions.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
And the most fundamental scientific condition for any social scientific claim

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
or historical claim is the possibility of dissent, the possibility of debate,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
the possibility of different perspectives being raised.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And if you shut that down, everything you produce is by definition flawed, right?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So I don't even need to read it.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's produced in the modern academy.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
It's not reliable without reading a single word of it.

37:47.000 --> 37:55.000
Just knowing the conditions of knowledge production in the academic setting are so flawed

37:55.000 --> 38:02.000
and so tainted that it would only be by fluke that it would produce anything of value.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
Now, one of the ways in which people do talk about colonialism now

38:07.000 --> 38:14.000
is they do allow themselves to say, effectively, there were worse empires.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
If there's an agreement that none were good, it was all wrong,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
but that there were some that were worse.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
And speaking of somebody born in Britain, I can say that even the most anti-colonial movements in Britain

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
do concede or console themselves with the idea that the Belgians were the worst.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
I don't know why this gives us so much pleasure, but it does.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
The one thing everyone knows in Britain is that King Leopold did the worst stuff,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and at least we didn't have King Leopold.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Let's just get on to that quickly.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
I mean, first of all, this perception that there were better and worse empires.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Is it true?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
No, no, it's not.

38:53.000 --> 39:01.000
And I think that the British actually are probably one of the worst.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
And here's the reason is that the worst empires are the worst in conceding this.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
The worst of the empires.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
But I think the British are actually quite good, so I think they're all good.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
And the reason is this is that empires tended to take the easiest and the best stuff first.

39:17.000 --> 39:27.000
The British captured what was the most easy to govern and the most easily governed areas first,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and the latecomers tended to get the worst stuff.

39:29.000 --> 39:36.000
The reason the Portuguese get such a bad rap is by the time the Portuguese were coming to colonize the African areas,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and that was the only thing they had.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
They were left with the bits and pieces, the places no one else wanted to govern.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
The same is true of the Congo.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Now, a couple of things about the Congo.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
First of all, the Congo-free state of King Leopold II was not a Belgian colony.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I have to always remind people of that.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
It was not a Belgian colony.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
So it was a private estate of King Leopold II.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
It was not run by the Belgian government.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
The information was not shared with the Belgian government.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
There were no Belgian government officials there.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
It was a private undertaking by the king lasted until 1908.

40:14.000 --> 40:22.000
The Congo became a Belgian colony in 1908 after the problems and abuses of the free state were revealed.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
From 1908 until its independence in 1960 was the only time the Congo has been well-governed,

40:28.000 --> 40:35.000
so that Belgians actually have a lot to be proud of for their colonial period in the Congo, which began in 1908.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
The other places were Rwanda and Burundi, now Burundi,

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
which the Belgians were given as their spoils from World War I from Germany to Africa.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
Also, very successful governance in Rwanda and Burundi,

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
in terms of allowing essentially these feudal states to remain in rule,

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
the Belgians recognized the problems, but were forced out by the United Nations system,

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
because these were trustee ships.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
These weren't colonies per se.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
These were UN trustee ships that the Belgians ran.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
The Belgians realized what would happen if sudden independence was given to them.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Again, UN system comes in.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
I look at the Belgian experiences in those three places and say,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
it's a tremendous achievement for the Belgians.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
It's just one of these myths of the even evil Belgians.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
But pre-1908, it was...

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Yeah, but pre-1908, it's not a colony.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
It's basically a private estate run by a bunch of freelancers,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
a bunch of military cast-offs,

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
and Leopold's argument for the...

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
And by the way, all the Adam Hothchild's book is a farrago of nonsense and misinterpretation.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
I'm writing a long takedown of it for its 25th anniversary next year.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Is King Leopold's good?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Yes, 10 million dead, nonsense.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
Even as a mortality demographic decline figure, the 10 million is nonsense.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
Probably the best estimate is the population increased slightly under King Leopold's rule.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
No 10 million dead, no 10 million murdered, which you'll see on Wikipedia.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
So it's just a lie, a bald lie.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
And it's a lie that Hothchild was aware of when he published the book and he chose not to include it.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
It's basically the demographers who were looking at that, they realized that the miscalculation.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Hothchild was aware that that was a lie, he didn't change the book.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And he's never recanted it.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
So it's a big scandal to me.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The popularity of that book is a scandal.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
Second of all, because Hothchild subtitles that book, a story of greed and terror in colonial Africa.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Well, okay, colonial Africa, yes.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
But not in a colony, this was not a colony, right?

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
This was a freelance enterprise being run.

42:44.000 --> 42:57.000
And what made the Congo so difficult for King Leopold was the fact that most of the center area was controlled by two notoriously brutal slave and rubber empires

42:57.000 --> 43:04.000
who were Muslim Africans, sometimes called Arabs, but they were actually both Africans,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
who had traditionally traded from the East End.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
One was called Tipotip, who was famous for his brutality.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
The other was called Al-Zubur-Matir, who was these two competing kind of chieftains of the East End.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And most of the brutalities happened in those areas.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Now, yes, this was formally part of the Free State.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
And in theory, the King should have had a stronger military force to stamp that out.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
I mean, this is why the private colonialism didn't work well, because you don't have the resources.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
You don't have the security operations.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
You don't have the accountability mechanisms.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But keep in mind what we're saying here.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
What we're saying is the Free State didn't have enough colonialism.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
And what most people will say is colonialism caused the Free State.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
No, it was the absence of colonialism that caused the Free State.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
In fact, Edmund Moral, the famous lawyer who exposed the abuses, right?

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
I mean, his whole argument was this place needs to be colonized.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And he wanted the Germans to take it over, right?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Because he thought the Germans were the best colonizers.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
So, I mean, the mythology of this evil Belgian colony is A, wrong, because there wasn't a Belgian colony.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
B, it misinterprets the problem as being too much colonialism when the problem was too little.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Just shoot down one more of my British constellations.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
The Italians were especially bad.

44:23.000 --> 44:35.000
Well, the fascist colony of Italian Abyssinia is a bit of an oxymoron, because what is a fascist colony exactly?

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
I mean, it's not a European colony in the sense of bringing European liberal civilization to Africa, in that case.

44:42.000 --> 44:50.000
I mean, Mussolini said, I'm going to oust this Christian king and replace him with a Muslim Islamic state,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
and I'm going to be the sword of Islam in Abyssinia.

44:53.000 --> 45:01.000
So, he was wildly popular, but he was popular because he was doing everything that European colonialism didn't do,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
which was bring a liberal empire to Africa.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
I mean, he was explicit in saying, I'm going to build an Islamic fascist empire here, right?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I mean, so he was celebrated.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
I mean, the Saudis and the Egyptians loved the Italian conquest of Abyssinia.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
A, it overthrew a Christian king, so that was good.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Replace it with an Islamic empire.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
B, he promised to impose Sharia law, right?

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And so that made him popular.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
So, is that colonialism or is that fascism, right?

45:34.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean, for me, colonialism, as we describe it, is European liberal states expanding liberal governance to Africa.

45:42.000 --> 45:51.000
Mussolini's colony was really just an Islamofascist outpost, and when the people who visited there saw that,

45:51.000 --> 45:58.000
they recoiled and they recognized that this is not some Italian colony, right?

45:58.000 --> 46:03.000
This doesn't represent Italian values, it represents Mussolini's fascism.

46:03.000 --> 46:10.000
Now, coming more up to date, in the discussion today about colonialism,

46:10.000 --> 46:18.000
it seemed to a situation where some countries insist that, for instance, reparations need to be paid for colonialism.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
There must be large cash transfers, sometimes to the Swiss bank account of the relevant leader,

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
that some kind of compensation must be made.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
One of the things that's very striking to me about this argument is that that argument is only heard, of course,

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
from states that have not worked well after the period of colonial rule,

46:39.000 --> 46:47.000
whereas states, countries which have boomed in the last half-century are looking forward in this way.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Is that true? Is it the case that now we hear about the crimes of colonialism

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
and most just the places that just haven't worked for various reasons, you know, misgovernment,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
misgovernance, corruption and much more.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
There's a reason why Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe and Singapore is Singapore.

47:06.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah, that's right, and let's face it, nobody takes reparations seriously other than a kind of shakedown

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
and a kind of foreign aid dressed up with a moral cause.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
But the United Nations takes it seriously.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah, I know, but let's be honest.

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
I mean, so where you have seen payments, right, is in alleged response to the victims of counterinsurgency operations,

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
like the Mao Mao, the Mao Mao, and in Namibia, right, to the Herrero and the Nama.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
Although in the case of the Herrero and the Nama, right, it was basically a payoff to the government,

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
and the government is run by the Ova Mamboo, who are not Herrero or Nama,

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
and so there's a big internal debate about where that money is going to end up.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
It's going to end up in party cadres, pockets in Namibia.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
People who were not the perpetrators gave money to people who weren't the victims.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Right, well, the Germans, the Germans handed over, God knows how much,

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
$4 billion or something, $400 million or whatever it was last year, two years ago,

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
to Namibia in reparation for the alleged genocide of Herrero, which is a myth, by the way,

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
which I'm going to document in my forthcoming book on German colonialism,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
called In Defense of German Colonialism.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
But I see another attempted cancellation coming up.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, well, luckily, the publisher is not to be canceled.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
But what I will say is there is a kind of just shakedown culture, right,

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
and they've become kind of like cargo cults, right, basically like let's, you know, really,

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
why not try and shake down the form of colonial power for some guilt money

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
and spend our time in Berlin or Paris or London,

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
angling for legal compensation and being in the court cases.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
Because ultimately, if they ever give in, right, it's just like a bonanza, right?

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I mean, suddenly this free money comes in.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
And the Europeans being, ultimately, they don't really care about brown or black people.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
They care more about their moral guilt and their self-absorption

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
and the ability to achieve moral transcendence and ultimately superiority through their guilt.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
You know, don't really care that dropping large wads of cash into communities

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
is extremely harmful to their productive capacities, creates all kinds of malign impacts,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
but they don't really care about that.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
So the Germans dropped this big wad of cash on the Namibian government two years ago

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
saying that's it, now we're done, right?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Now we've atoned for our sins, right?

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
It sets off a mad scramble, as you suggest, among the cadres for who's going to get this money.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It doesn't achieve anything.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
That's the only form of reparations that actually works now,

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
which is identifying a clear set of alleged victims in a particular incident, right,

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
in which a clear harm was supposedly made.

49:51.000 --> 49:58.000
But the argument of reparations for colonialism itself, I mean, it's a non-starter as a moral question,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
but it's also, I think, a non-starter as a practical question.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Now as we start to wrap up, first of all, is colonialism worth reclaiming?

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
What are the aspects of it that could be applied if understood properly in the world today?

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Well, colonialism happens whether we like it or not

50:19.000 --> 50:30.000
in the sense that dysfunctional governments have their governance capacities taken over by external actors.

50:30.000 --> 50:36.000
Often it's an IMF loan with conditions, or it's a World Bank loan with conditions about governance.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
You'd call that colonialism of a kind?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
It's not colonialism, but it's external governance.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
And it draws much on colonial experiences in terms of how you can enhance indigenous capacity

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
by keeping some form of gatekeeping or tutelary role on the outside, right?

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
But that's how colonialism was trying to develop self-government, right,

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
which is as much indigenous native government as possible, creating structures,

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
allowing the governor to veto acts, allowing the governor to appoint the district commissioner.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
I mean, that was the sort of what Lugard called the dual mandate, right,

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
and sort of our mandate to the local government and the local government's mandate to its people,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
and that's how we're going to operate.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
No, I don't like to use the word colonialism for that type of external governance,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
because that's really just external governance, right?

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Now there are opportunities for actual colonialism.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
I mean, Paul Romer, who is the World Bank official economist, right,

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
a University of Chicago professor, proposed this idea of a charter city, right,

51:38.000 --> 51:45.000
to take a piece of land in one of these countries, lease it from the government for a dollar a year, right,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
and put it under the formal rule of an external power, right?

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
So a charter city would be kind of like what Hong Kong was, right?

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
It's basically a leased piece of land that is put under the sovereignty of a western government for a fixed amount of time,

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
during which its laws and its rule apply there.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
It's allowed to trade, people are allowed to migrate, right?

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
And what it does is it creates this little kind of dynamo of economic success

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
along the coast or in the territory that eventually can be handed back.

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
I mean, Romer says that Hong Kong itself, given the number of people it positively affected in China,

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
because of its demonstration effects, because of how the Chinese learn from it,

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
can almost single-handedly be used to justify British colonialism just by the numbers, right?

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
Because if it's responsible for China's economic boom, then it's a pretty big data point.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
So ideas like that.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
Now, it's tough to bring in the white man, mainly because the white man doesn't want to be there, right,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
because of the opposition.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
But we do see, for example, non-white countries going in.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
So the South Koreans have created essentially a small colony in Bangladesh.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
It's basically an industrial zone.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
It's run by the Korean Development Authority.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
It's a walled city.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's got factories.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
It's got schools.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's got its own governments.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's basically a little Korean colony in Bangladesh.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
Nobody notices it because they're all like brown and yellow and aren't they all just the same?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
And who cares about the Koreans colonizing Bangladesh?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I think it's great.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
It's a model.

53:20.000 --> 53:30.000
You've also seen some behavior like that in Yemen, in the north end of Yemen, where the Qataris and Saudis and the Turks

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
basically created a colony, a colony that's externally run.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
I think that that's a great model to follow because the Yemenis can't stand up their own government.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
This is all kind of beyond the New York Times' horizon of interest because they're all brown and black people,

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
and there's no white man with a pith hat on to decry.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
But it's actually working quite well.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
And I think that type of colonialism has a lot of potential.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
What about Chinese colonialism in Africa today?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Would you call that colonialism?

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
It's not even external governance for the most part because the Chinese,

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
unlike the South Koreans, don't actually have a governance model that they can share.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So the Chinese invest a lot.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Yeah, they create company towns.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
They provide infrastructure, but they're not doing governance.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
What's the difference in a town that you buy up and run?

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
Well, because the Chinese still are not bringing in their own administrators.

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
They're not setting up their own special zone laws the way that, say, the Koreans did in Bangladesh.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I mean, they're still relying on local police.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
They're still using local laws.

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
I mean, they're not really trying to govern beyond just running their enterprises.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Now, yeah, those enterprises are big, sprawling institutions,

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
but they're still just like one company operation.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
So I don't see the Chinese doing it.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
The Chinese are smart enough to know that they can't do that, right?

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
That they can't govern other peoples.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Do they not want to?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I don't think they want to.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
They want their money.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
They want their investment.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
They want their leverage over those governments in terms of the economic leverage.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
But I don't think they see themselves as having an interest, even,

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
in spreading their governance model to other parts of the world.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Indeed, their whole discourse is to each his own.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
It's interesting that today when we talk about colonialism,

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
countries like America, Israel, and others,

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
the term is used sometimes of them as a sort of smear or a slander.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
Even there's nothing that America is doing that is colonial

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
by the terms that you've just laid out.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Yet, for some reason, it is still seen,

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
what is seen today as something that only, as you say, white people would be guilty of

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
or could be guilty of.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Is that true?

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
Yeah, it's trying to backcast the word to say any settlement

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
or expansion of one's territory makes you colonial.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
So if that's the case, virtually all of the Native American tribes are colonial as well.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
I mean, all of the lands claimed by the Cherokee are colonial takings from other tribes.

56:10.000 --> 56:17.000
The Hawaiians who claim indigeneity in Hawaii arose from colonial processes

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
in the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So we're all colonial.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
So it's just a statement of the obvious, right?

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
And to say that a place like Puerto Rico is colonial.

56:28.000 --> 56:33.000
Well, of course, the Puerto Ricans have never demanded independence, right?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
I mean, the independence movement is a flop in Puerto Rico

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
for reasons that they know well, right?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Because it would be a disaster.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I mean, they benefit from that connection.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
The little bits of colonies left around the world, the French pieces, the British pieces, right?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
They have referendum.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
There's a place that's related to the Norfolk Islands off New Zealand.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
I mean, they have referendum.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
They never achieve a necessary majority because these places know how much they benefit

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
from that colonial connection.

57:01.000 --> 57:08.000
As we wrap up, I come back to where we started, the outrage, attempted cancellations of you

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
and a few other academics who actually investigate research in these areas

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
without just coming to what seemed to be the preordained conclusions you're meant to come to.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
And just to return to that, as I see it,

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
the criticisms that have come towards you, the criticisms that have come to others in the same area,

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
it's almost as if there's an area of the past on this occasion, colonialism,

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
but there are others as well that's effectively behind crime scene tape,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
and you're not meant to go there.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
And as I see it, the reason that people don't want you to go there

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
is because they somehow think that if you do, we're going to do it again.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
You heard that a certain amount in recent years in Britain.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
There were people who claimed that the Brexit vote was just the beginning of a new era

57:58.000 --> 58:05.000
of British Empire building, and no member of the British government has at all expressed

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
an interest in going and taking over other parts of the world in the last six years,

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
very far from it.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
They seem to be wanting to govern their own state as well or badly as they can,

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
but that seems to be a motif that has been emerging.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Don't deal with this stuff.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Don't even weigh up the pros and cons of colonialism,

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
because the moment you talk about the pros, we'll just be off again.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Do you agree?

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah, and I think it's even bigger than that.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
I mean, it's true that they don't want to legitimate the idea of western control

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
or rule over any part of the world, even if people's in other parts of the world

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
would line up to be ruled by western countries.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I think that's true, by the way, separate issue.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
But I think there's a bigger issue here, and it's part of what your book,

58:54.000 --> 59:00.000
The War on the West, is about, which is that colonialism is seen as kind of unambiguous bad

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
that can be chalked up on the negative side of western society

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
and constantly used to bash it whenever it claims any right.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
And part of it's a response to the fact that as the world progresses,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
the West is getting stronger, in my view.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
It is getting stronger.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
It is getting more dominant.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
It is getting more attractive.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
The rivals are falling by the wayside.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
The Chinese model is flat.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
The Russian model is over.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
The Brazilian model is long dead.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
I mean, so I think there is this kind of resentment about the success of the West.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
And colonialism has become this kind of quiver of arrows.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
Let's say, whenever you talk about the West, let's not forget colonialism.

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
And the requirement there is that that debate be not available for discussion.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
That that's just an unambiguous bad, and you're supposed to bow your head and say,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
yes, you're right, that's a bad part of it.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So they hate the idea that this box, this Pandora's box of debate could be opened

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000
because it weakens what to them is one of their key kind of charges in opposition to the rise of the West.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well, Professor Bruce Gilley, thank you very much.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
We've covered an enormous amount of terrain, but that was absolutely fascinating

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
and has certainly given us a new view on an old question of colonialism.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Thank you.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Thank you.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Thank you.
