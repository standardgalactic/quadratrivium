0	5000	Hello, I'm Douglas Murray and welcome to Uncancelled History.
5000	8000	Today, colonialism.
8000	11000	I'm joined by Professor Bruce Gilley.
11000	17000	Bruce Gilley is Professor of Political Science at Portland State University.
17000	22000	His research focuses on topics including colonialism and Asian politics.
22000	26000	In 2018, he published an article, The Case for Colonialism,
26000	29000	which was first published in the Third World Quarterly.
29000	34000	It sparked enormous protests and nearly half of the journal's editorial board
34000	36000	resigned in protest.
36000	42000	The author of numerous articles and books, in 2021,
42000	46000	Gilley published his biography of Sir Alan Burns,
46000	49000	a 20th century British colonial officer.
49000	54000	Today on Uncancelled History, Colonialism.
59000	64000	The Case for Colonialism
64000	67000	First of all, thank you so much, Bruce, for joining me.
67000	72000	In recent years, colonialism has been shown to be portrayed as
72000	76000	one of the absolutely foundational sins of the West,
76000	79000	perhaps along with slavery, racism.
79000	83000	Colonialism is one that has been most zoomed in on.
83000	86000	What is colonialism, first of all?
86000	91000	Well, I think if we take the biggest view, colonialism or imperialism,
91000	94000	as it used to be called before that became a dirty word too,
94000	100000	is simply where one group of people with an established form of government
100000	106000	travels to a part of the world where their government doesn't currently rule
106000	108000	and establishes its rule there.
108000	114000	And by that definition, all of world history is a history of imperialism and colonialism.
114000	119000	There is no people or no country today that has not at some point
119000	122000	been involved in imperialism and colonialism.
122000	125000	So nothing specifically unique or different about Europeans
125000	128000	doing exactly what everyone else did.
128000	131000	When people hear the term colonialism now,
131000	139000	they zoom in on a very specific and small portion of the world of colonialism,
139000	144000	which is basically 19th century and early 20th century European colonialism
144000	146000	in what we now call the Third World.
146000	149000	Certainly in modern academia and perhaps the wider culture,
149000	155000	18th and 19th century European colonialism is now seen as being a sort of shorthand
155000	161000	for something that is unadulteratedly cruel, entirely racist.
161000	165000	What about this analysis in your view, full short?
165000	172000	Well, in part because it's either true by definition or it's patently false.
172000	177000	True by definition because every group, up until very recently,
177000	179000	was inherently racist towards other groups.
179000	183000	The Cherokees of the Americas were racist towards other Native Americans.
183000	188000	The Bantu were racist towards all of the Black African tribes they conquered
188000	191000	as they imperialized Southern Africa.
191000	195000	The Maori were racist towards other Pacific Asian tribes.
195000	200000	I mean, everyone was a racist if by that term we mean the assumptions by group A
200000	206000	that the members of group B are inferior and deserve to be conquered if they can be.
206000	210000	That's a universal human phenomena and it arises from evolutionary needs
210000	212000	for basically in group solidarity.
212000	217000	So racism is the standard default position for all peoples.
217000	221000	So to say that the Europeans were racist is just to state the obvious
221000	223000	because all peoples were racist.
223000	227000	If it's not a statement of the obvious then it's patently false
227000	232000	and by that I mean that if we were to judge the racism of the Europeans
232000	237000	vis-a-vis the places they conquered, compared to the racism of other groups at the time
237000	239000	we would find the Europeans much less racist
239000	243000	and if we were going to put it on a spectrum we would say the only anti-racists
243000	246000	in the whole world at the time of European colonials and we're the Europeans
246000	251000	because they were the ones who went abroad and said these peoples have the capacity
251000	252000	to be just like us.
252000	254000	These people deserve freedom.
254000	256000	These people deserve to be freed from slavery.
256000	258000	They deserve to be developed.
258000	262000	They deserve to be civilized, which of course is seen as a sort of great racist act
262000	263000	but it's quite the opposite.
263000	267000	It's the act of saying all peoples have the potential to be self-governing,
267000	271000	to be flourishing, to have a written language, history, arts and culture.
271000	276000	This was the great anti-racist campaign that European colonialism represented.
276000	281000	So that's why I say it's either simply a statement of the obvious or it's patently false.
281000	284000	Roughly, what were other people at the time thinking?
284000	289000	You mentioned these were attitudes that Europeans held
289000	294000	but what would have been more normal attitudes at the time for the rest of the world about other groups?
294000	300000	Well, the rest of the world, and this is true well into the 20th century,
300000	308000	basically that different groups saw themselves based on their ability to spread their rule
308000	311000	and their culture and their institutions to others
311000	314000	and they were more superior the more they were able to do that.
314000	322000	So this is why the Bantu expansion into southern Africa, the Buganda expansion throughout East Africa,
322000	328000	the Fulani Slave Empire of West Africa, all of these groups saw themselves as inferior
328000	333000	and saw those they conquered as not just moral inferiors but somehow subhuman.
333000	339000	In the sense that they weren't engaged in a civilizing action, they were engaged in a simple conquest.
339000	348000	And this was real racism in the sense of denying the humanity of those who were put under the subjugation
349000	354000	which is why these empires often were slave empires or simply genocidal empires.
354000	356000	The Europeans were different, right?
356000	362000	Not entirely, they had their brutal aspects, they had their old imperialist conquest aspects
362000	368000	but the seed of the difference in the European case was this idea of civilization.
368000	373000	Civilization raises those that you conquer from the level of subhuman to being human
373000	376000	because why would you civilize farm animals?
377000	380000	You civilize people who you tick to be your moral equals.
380000	383000	Now in 2017 you caused something of an uproar.
383000	389000	You wrote a piece called The Case for Colonialism in which you made the claim that European colonialism
389000	392000	was indeed beneficial to colonized people.
392000	395000	Can you tell us something about the backlash of attacks?
395000	399000	What you said in that article, what happened as a result of it?
399000	404000	Because this was a proper firestorm in your area.
404000	409000	This was, I wrote the article of 2017, The Case for Colonialism
409000	413000	because I was starting work on my biography of Sir Alan Burns,
413000	417000	great British colonial administrator which became the last imperialist
417000	423000	and I was trying to frame the basic case for colonialism that his life represented and he articulated.
423000	428000	And it went through peer review, got a split decision, the editor decided to run it,
428000	433000	kind of thinking it might be a good debate and literally within minutes of it appearing online
433000	439000	there were two online petitions started, one by a interpretive dance instructor in Britain
439000	447000	and one by an English professor in Manitoba and a third by a professor in Syracuse University
447000	449000	who also wanted my PhD revoked.
449000	456000	So three petitions actually which eventually had about 30,000 signatures demanding the article be retracted,
456000	462000	saying that this was violence against brown and black people, saying that this was holocaust denial,
462000	468000	saying that this was a threat to the safety of my students.
468000	474000	So my university launched a diversity investigation claiming my article was an act of violence.
474000	480000	Eventually the editorial staff in London had death threats from nationalists in India.
480000	483000	They asked me could they please withdraw the article.
483000	488000	I said of course, not a big deal to me, their safety was paramount.
488000	493000	It was reprinted in Academic Questions which is the House Journal of the National Association of Scholars.
493000	499000	And I think thanks to the firestorm has attracted far more attention than it would have attracted
499000	502000	if it had simply been allowed to be read and disputed.
502000	509000	The original journal that it was published in then unpublished in just decided to pretend it hadn't happened?
509000	511000	So this is the third world quarterly.
511000	514000	No, they did things by the book.
514000	521000	They were not allowed to retract an article because of a political firestorm according to the ethics commission of the UK,
521000	525000	which actually is stronger than the ethics commission in the US for publishing.
525000	532000	So they had to ask my request to withdraw it, not retract it, which I agreed to for their physical safety.
532000	534000	So it was withdrawn, not retracted.
534000	539000	So if you go to the website today, you'll see the withdrawal notice that states very clearly that they faced death threats.
539000	547000	And the funny thing is now the third world quarterly has allowed, now that all their editorial staff has been revamped with ultra woke academics,
547000	552000	they're allowing their authors to cite the article again, but they're only citing the withdrawal notice.
552000	560000	They're not citing the actual article, but they're trying to kind of piggyback on the popularity of the article to generate metrics for their journal,
560000	562000	but you can't actually read the article on it.
563000	567000	So there are three petitions against you, including the interpretive dance lady.
567000	572000	And she didn't presumably make her objection through the form of interpretive dance, did she?
572000	577000	No, she used the method of a petition.
577000	581000	And you might say, well, okay, it's a free world.
581000	582000	And I do believe this.
582000	587000	I think if you want to set up a petition and oppose something, be my guest.
587000	602000	But what was, I think, shocking to me was how many people signed that petition who were credentialed academics holding positions in universities in the UK and Canada and Australia and the United States,
602000	607000	universities which are by their very principles committed to the principle of academic freedom.
607000	618000	And so you have, I mean, okay, people signed petitions, but academics standing up very publicly and saying, I don't think this article deserves to be written.
618000	621000	I think academic freedom has certain limitations.
621000	629000	And when people say things that I think are racist or white supremacist, academic freedom has reached its limits.
629000	635000	It seemed to me that with that article, you had undoubtedly hit a tripwire in our day.
635000	643000	And the way I sort of thought of it in a way was perhaps there would have been a time maybe 100 years ago where to write, I mean, this isn't particularly the case,
643000	651000	but to write only negative things about colonialism and everybody involved in colonial projects would have caused some kind of problem.
651000	659000	And that what had happened is that in our own day, to say actually the picture is a bit more nuanced, more rounded, is just unacceptable.
659000	669000	It has to be that colonialism is like the Holocaust, as one of your accusers said, that it's just, there is no context, it's just bad.
669000	671000	Something like that, isn't it?
671000	679000	There's just a unanimity that there's no texture to be added that if somebody like you or Professor Nigel Bigger at Oxford says,
679000	681000	hang on, it's a bit more complicated.
681000	685000	Effectively, you're seen as being an apologist for the worst successes of colonialism.
685000	697000	So I actually think not because I think this idea that there was a time in European history or British history when it was nothing but daring,
697000	702000	to glorification of colonialism and the empire is a myth.
702000	713000	There was never a time in British history, in British education, in British newspapers where the imperial enterprise, where the colonies,
713000	721000	whether we're talking the American colonies, Australia or later Africa, where this was not subject to a constant debate,
721000	728000	and where people who were critical of this were very free and very prolific in writing their criticism.
728000	738000	So I think this, you get this kind of, this narrative, especially in the UK that, well, at least we're not back in the days when it's all celebration of the empire.
738000	744000	And there was never a time in British history where there was nothing but glorification and celebration of empire.
744000	746000	Where do you think that idea comes from?
746000	751000	I think it's because the people think that they have a balanced perspective.
751000	758000	And by being balanced, they try to set up this idea that, well, I'm not like those crazy old imperialists like that all day.
758000	759000	I think we need balance.
759000	762000	And so I'm not on the right side of the spectrum.
762000	763000	I'm a centrist.
763000	766000	In fact, there was never that perspective.
766000	769000	So I think they're trying to make themselves feel like they're the centrists in the issue.
769000	780000	Whereas, in fact, the arguments have always been about the critical and the contentious rollout of empire and what was happening.
780000	793000	And so anti-colonialism didn't arise in response to some excessively positive account of empire that was dominating and that was hegemonic in the empire.
793000	794000	It didn't, right?
794000	795000	Because that's its false flag.
795000	798000	It basically argues against a strawman, right?
798000	799000	There was never that.
799000	805000	And so what the anti-colonials are trying to do is to suggest that they're just bringing balance to the argument, right?
805000	806000	But they're not, right?
806000	816000	In fact, what they're doing is disbalancing the argument entirely, taking it from what it used to be, which is you could say the case for colonialism or the case against colonialism
816000	820000	and shut down the case for colonialism, say there's only one case to be made.
820000	822000	Anti-colonialism is the only case to be made.
822000	835000	And what you, Professor Nigel Bigger, a very small number of other academics have been doing is to be inserting this information into the debate, facts, interpretations of it,
835000	840000	which seem just not to have been put in for a very long time, certainly not in the academic field.
840000	843000	So you mentioned, I mean, there are sort of positives about colonialism.
843000	845000	There are negatives.
845000	853000	What were the positives in your view for peoples in the countries that Europeans went to and ruled?
853000	868000	Well, I think we need to start at a very high level of abstraction because the fundamental thing is this, is if you were in a society which had a stone age level of technological development,
868000	883000	had no fixed borders, had no institutionalized system of governance, had not yet discovered the wheel, or in some more advanced places nonetheless still lived in an essentially feudal system, right,
883000	890000	with a very entrenched elite and a very impoverished population.
890000	896000	And you had the opportunity to be ruled by an advanced European civilization, right?
896000	899000	Why would you not want that to happen, right?
899000	907000	So just at the level of abstraction, like civilization A, which is superior to civilization B, and I have no problems using the term superior.
907000	911000	I'm going to say lots of people, the moment you say superior, they're going to...
911000	912000	Absolutely superior, right?
912000	921000	Because superior in the sense of better technology, better healthcare, better education, more accountable governance, more rights for marginalized communities,
921000	932000	especially women, urban development, technology, transportation, life-saving research and science, right?
932000	933000	Those are the things I mean.
933000	934000	This is superior, right?
934000	939000	And there's no objective definition, distinction between that and what's less.
939000	942000	If you had that opportunity, what would your society do?
942000	949000	Of course, they would jump at the opportunity, which is why so much of European imperialism spread with as much pull as it did push, right?
949000	952000	Indeed, the pull factors are often the dominating ones.
952000	961000	The British went to Ghana, they said not much interested, left the Ghani kings, demanded that they come back, begged them to come back.
961000	963000	Finally, they did sign the treaties.
963000	964000	Why?
964000	970000	Because British Empire or other empires brought security, it brought stability, it brought opportunities.
971000	979000	It brought an end to inter-tribal warfare, which in many cases, these kings and these tribal leaders recognized was destroying their societies, right?
979000	981000	They needed essentially a hegemon.
981000	984000	I mean, it's an old Hobbesian story, but that's what they needed.
984000	988000	So, you know, at a very high level of abstraction, right?
988000	995000	I think that the onus of proof is that colonialism didn't bring tremendous benefits, right?
995000	1002000	I mean, just in the sense of the logic of a more superior, I mean, you don't need to use superior, more developed, right?
1002000	1008000	More advanced civilization, having an opportunity to rule a less advanced civilization is so patently obvious, right?
1008000	1015000	That the burden of proof that this was not a good thing, I think lies upon those who say this somehow brought, bought harms.
1015000	1022000	And I think that's where we then have to get into, okay, so it's a good idea in general, right?
1022000	1024000	Was it a good idea in practice, right?
1024000	1027000	Now, this is where we need to talk about, like, how it rolled out.
1027000	1031000	Places were better, places were worse, there were abuses here, not here.
1031000	1039000	I mean, now we get into what used to be the debate on colonialism, which is let's talk about the practical opportunities, feasibility of things,
1039000	1042000	things that were done well, things were done badly in particular contexts.
1042000	1047000	But, you know, this idea of a blanket condemnation is just not tenable.
1047000	1052000	I suppose there's two things that the anti-colonialists say at this point, which is, first of all,
1052000	1058000	yes, there are maybe technical advances and so on, but that two things occur with colonialism.
1058000	1064000	One is the presumption that there are people who are sort of morally better, going into less morally developed societies.
1064000	1071000	And the other one would be something along the lines of you're instituting a form of inequality,
1071000	1080000	and along the lines of that, along the way, you're also, for instance, eradicating local cultures, local norms.
1080000	1083000	Replacing local norms with European norms.
1083000	1085000	What do you say to those claims?
1085000	1088000	All of them don't withstand scrutiny.
1088000	1097000	Again, the idea of a moral superiority is one thing that was distinctly absent in the European mission.
1097000	1107000	If you take the idea of the civilizing mission seriously, what it implies is the moral potential of those who are colonizing to be exactly like you.
1107000	1109000	That's very explicit, right?
1109000	1116000	And in terms of life-saving medicines being morally superior to the absence of life-saving medicines,
1116000	1119000	yeah, I have no problems going to the mat and saying that's morally superior.
1119000	1125000	It's morally superior to save lives, to prevent people from being killed through violent conflicts,
1125000	1128000	to give rights to people who are traditionally marginalized.
1128000	1129000	That's morally superior.
1129000	1130000	I have no problem with that.
1130000	1134000	Most liberals would argue that, too, except when you talk about it in the context of colonialism.
1134000	1138000	Second of all, in terms of foreign norms or alien norms, don't forget,
1138000	1142000	almost all the places that were colonized were already under alien rule.
1142000	1145000	But it was indigenous alien rule, not European alien rule.
1145000	1148000	And we're talking mainly here about Africa.
1148000	1155000	Well, you know, most places, I mean, look at the Malay Peninsula, right?
1155000	1162000	I mean, basically, the Malay Peninsula was a bunch of small fiefdoms, small sultanates, right?
1162000	1167000	Those sultanates expanded or contracted based upon their power, right,
1167000	1170000	and brought in people who had been under another sultanate.
1170000	1175000	So, I mean, the idea of like indigenous rule, I mean, what is indigenous rule in a context
1175000	1180000	in which the world has always been organized by empire spreading as far as they can
1180000	1184000	and when they weaken being subjugated by other empires?
1184000	1188000	It is, you're right, most explicitly clear in Africa
1188000	1192000	because you can actually see what was happening at the time of European conquest.
1192000	1196000	I mean, the Fulani Slave Empire, which was basically an Islamic caliphate
1196000	1203000	of the central part of the Sahara, was spreading towards West Africa when the British came in.
1203000	1208000	The reason why it was so easy for the British to establish their control in northern Nigeria
1208000	1215000	was because those groups recognized the choice was British imperialism or the Fulani Slave Empire.
1215000	1219000	And the British Empire started to look very attractive compared to that.
1219000	1222000	Third point, destroying local cultures.
1222000	1228000	European imperialism was famous for its discovery and documentation and celebration of local cultures.
1228000	1235000	Many of these languages would not have survived, usually not the colonial administrators,
1235000	1239000	but the explorers and linguists and academics and researchers who came with imperialism
1239000	1242000	gone and documented those languages.
1242000	1249000	The U-language of Togo was essentially rescued by the Germans after they colonized it.
1249000	1254000	And there was two or three German linguists who went out and documented those languages
1254000	1259000	before they were lost, created dictionaries, created study guides.
1259000	1263000	I mean, the entire language would not exist but for German colonialism.
1263000	1267000	It's to say with James Princip and the language in India.
1267000	1273000	The British rediscovery of Indian heritage is well known.
1273000	1280000	I mean, I don't need to document it but the Asiatics and the Orientalists were the ones who rescued
1280000	1286000	and saved these cultures from destruction either by an indigenous empire or just by the forces of modernization.
1286000	1290000	Swihili was spreading in East Africa.
1290000	1292000	It was going to be the hegemonic language.
1292000	1299000	If the Germans had not documented those languages in the Mount Kilimanjaro area, those languages would have been lost.
1299000	1303000	There is a presumption, I think. We've come across it in a number of cases.
1303000	1308000	This presumption that if the Westerners, if the Europeans get it, go into a place,
1308000	1313000	they bring certain evils into an effectively Edenic society.
1313000	1321000	The locals are otherwise living unbothered by modernity, by the vices of humankind.
1321000	1325000	Obviously, this wasn't the case.
1325000	1331000	But it seems that people are very reluctant to recognize that there's a balance of things going on here, at the very least.
1331000	1338000	Yeah, well, not only that the pre-colonial societies were not the Garden of Eden far from it
1338000	1345000	and had any of those pre-colonial societies been literate or had record-keeping traditions,
1345000	1348000	we would have more information on that. We don't.
1348000	1353000	So what do you turn to? You turn to the civilization that produced records and newspaper articles
1353000	1359000	and parliamentary inquiries and academic researches and whatnot, which is the European civilization.
1359000	1364000	The knowledge base is hugely biased towards the European colonial experience
1364000	1369000	and in particular, because it comes with a self-critical tradition, a lot of that knowledge is critical.
1369000	1373000	So this is somehow evidence that it was the Garden of Eden before European colonialism.
1373000	1380000	It's clearly not the case. Secondly, quite aside from that, the more significant question is,
1380000	1384000	okay, if the Europeans had said, right, we're not going into Africa,
1384000	1387000	we're going to have this kind of agreement among ourselves not to go in.
1387000	1388000	So what would have happened?
1388000	1393000	Well, trade is still going to happen. Missionaries are still going to go in there.
1393000	1399000	Alcohol is going to go in there. The maximum machine gun is going to go in there.
1399000	1408000	So what you get then is a kind of Yahoo explorers and claim-stakers among the Europeans,
1408000	1414000	allying themselves with local forces. Would that have been a better governing experience for Africa?
1415000	1422000	So living in splendid isolation is not an option for Africa or the Middle East or Southeast Asia
1422000	1425000	or the Pacific at this time. Globalization is happening.
1425000	1430000	Do you want globalization to be governed or do you want it to be ungoverned?
1430000	1435000	And the ungoverned bits and pieces we have, such as the Congo Free State,
1435000	1441000	which actually was relatively well governed compared to some of the worst ones,
1441000	1446000	but the private colonies and Liberia under the Firestone Company
1446000	1451000	and some of the German trading companies in the Pacific,
1451000	1455000	obviously the East India Company before the Mutiny,
1455000	1460000	these private colonialism did not equip themselves very well.
1460000	1465000	So that's the alternative. The alternative is not splendid isolation.
1465000	1470000	The alternative is kind of these freelancers and mercenaries running these places,
1470000	1473000	which tended to be much worse because there was no accountability.
1473000	1478000	In 2020, you published your biography of Sir Alan Burns, The Last Imperialist.
1478000	1482000	First of all, before we get into the controversies around that,
1482000	1487000	perhaps you could explain who was Alan Burns and why was he somebody you wanted to write about?
1487000	1492000	Burns was a colonial administrator born in the Caribbean,
1492000	1498000	went to West Africa on the eve of World War I, fought in the West Africa campaigns in the Cameroons
1498000	1503000	and in Togo was then put on the Nigerian government,
1503000	1509000	became a colonial secretary in the Bahamas, became the governor of Belize,
1509000	1513000	or what was then the British Honduras, eventually became the governor of the Gold Coast,
1513000	1515000	which is now Ghana during World War II.
1515000	1521000	And then after that, a very kind of storied colonial career was sent to the United Nations
1521000	1524000	in the 50s to basically stand up for the British Empire
1524000	1529000	when the United Nations was becoming a kind of decolonization machine, right?
1529000	1536000	What interested me about Burns was he was an unapologetic defender of empire
1536000	1538000	way into the 20th century.
1538000	1540000	He dies in 1980.
1540000	1546000	Right, so he is one of the few people who carries on the case for colonialism
1546000	1552000	well after most British have kind of retired in a kind of awkward, cringy feeling about,
1552000	1555000	well, that wasn't very nice, but long as I have my pension,
1555000	1560000	and of course the 60s is the era of the great radical anti-colonial movements,
1560000	1564000	not only in the global system, but on campus, of course,
1564000	1567000	and Burns is pushing the argument right to the end, right?
1567000	1570000	And presently enough, because he lives through the 70s,
1570000	1573000	which is the great lost decade in the developing world, right,
1573000	1577000	where massacres and wars and humanitarian catastrophes that we didn't notice
1577000	1579000	because there's no white men involved.
1579000	1581000	But I mean, this was the great lost decade of the Third World.
1581000	1583000	Where are we talking about here?
1583000	1585000	Oh, we're talking about all of Africa, essentially.
1585000	1588000	We're talking about Indonesia.
1588000	1594000	We're talking about the period of conflict in the Middle East.
1594000	1600000	We're talking about India itself, the great, like, granddaddy of them all, right,
1600000	1606000	with stagnation, with communal violence, with an emergency and a suspension of democracy.
1606000	1610000	Basically, every part of the Third World is falling apart
1610000	1615000	and going into spiral in the 70s, right, and it slowly starts to recover by the 80s.
1615000	1618000	But Burns is paying attention to this, right?
1618000	1623000	Burns is paying attention to the massacres, the Biafra war, right,
1623000	1625000	is maybe the one that draws world attention,
1625000	1629000	because we're talking one to two million people killed in that.
1629000	1634000	Of course, partition might have caused some misgivings
1634000	1637000	about this whole decolonization idea.
1637000	1639000	But Burns is kind of arguing the case.
1639000	1641000	This is why we shouldn't have ended it so fast.
1641000	1646000	This is why the United Nations mishandled this whole issue, right?
1646000	1649000	They were so obsessed with getting the colonialists out
1649000	1652000	that they didn't pay attention to what was going to take over
1652000	1654000	and who was going to fill the power vacuum
1654000	1656000	and were these going to be stable states?
1656000	1660000	So I wrote the biography because I found him a compelling figure.
1660000	1662000	I also tracked down his family.
1662000	1666000	I saw his papers sitting in an attic in Chelmsford.
1666000	1668000	And, you know, classic kind of British thing.
1668000	1670000	I mean, here's the guy who, in my mind,
1670000	1675000	is one of the greatest generation of the late colonial administrators
1675000	1678000	who are helping to get these countries ready for independence.
1678000	1683000	And he's just kind of treated with this icy coldness.
1683000	1686000	And there's his paper sitting in an attic in Chelmsford,
1686000	1689000	you know, because you wouldn't want to write about this person, right?
1689000	1691000	I mean, what an evil person this is.
1691000	1693000	And yet he is a great...
1693000	1695000	I mean, he's a hero of the British people, in my mind,
1695000	1697000	but the British were not interested in it.
1697000	1699000	By the way, before we come back to Bernadette,
1699000	1702000	one of the things that's always interested me about the post-colonial period
1702000	1705000	are the number of post-colonial writers who say
1705000	1708000	there is a form of Western colonialism that these countries,
1708000	1711000	particularly in Africa, have had to suffer under
1711000	1714000	and that they must be returned to another state.
1714000	1717000	Now, the obvious thing, it seems to me, is that you would argue
1717000	1720000	that they should be returned to some pre-colonial state.
1720000	1722000	But that argument seems to be quite uncommon.
1722000	1726000	A lot of the people I'm thinking of writers like Franz Fanon and others,
1726000	1729000	once the anti-colonialist movement gets going,
1729000	1732000	argue for Marxism for these societies.
1732000	1737000	In other words, they say Western imperialism has been the problem
1737000	1740000	and that we must therefore return these societies
1740000	1744000	and we must return them to Western Marxism.
1744000	1746000	And there was always something...
1746000	1750000	There was always something specifically political going on that era as well, wasn't it?
1750000	1752000	Because we're talking about the 60s,
1752000	1755000	we're talking about still dreams of Marxism going on,
1755000	1758000	and it seemed like the post-colonial developing world
1758000	1763000	could always be used as another experimenting place for that.
1763000	1768000	Right, so the great myth of anti-colonialism
1768000	1771000	is that it represented indigenous forces
1771000	1774000	and indigenous resistance to colonialism.
1774000	1779000	And it didn't. It represented European intellectuals
1779000	1784000	exporting their ideologies to hapless brown and black people
1784000	1788000	and finding people like Fanon or Amacal Cabral,
1788000	1793000	who spent most of their time hanging out in cafes in Paris and Lisbon,
1793000	1796000	and sending them back as representatives of the people,
1796000	1800000	oppressed black people who needed to lead the fight against colonialism.
1800000	1802000	But these people didn't represent anything in their societies.
1802000	1803000	They barely had traveled.
1803000	1806000	Most of them couldn't speak the languages of their own societies.
1806000	1810000	What they brought back was not some indigenous response to colonialism.
1810000	1814000	What they brought back was a bunch of half-assed ideologies from Europe.
1814000	1821000	Most of them Marxist or Leninist or vaguely post-modernist as Fanon was.
1821000	1826000	And what's interesting in terms of this decolonization process is
1826000	1830000	the indigenous leaders in these societies saw that, right?
1830000	1832000	They said to the Europeans,
1832000	1835000	don't you dare hand over power to these people, right?
1835000	1841000	This was the great king of the Congo who was saying to the Belgians,
1841000	1845000	this guy, Patrice Lumumba, is a madman, right?
1845000	1848000	Don't give in to them. Don't promise independence.
1848000	1851000	Don't hand over to these people because they're a bunch of loudmouths
1851000	1853000	and they're the minority, right?
1853000	1856000	We need you to stay, right? We're not ready for independence.
1856000	1860000	Even Julius Nierere, who became the first prime minister of Tanzania
1860000	1864000	and then president of Tanzania, was very explicit when he went to the United Nations
1864000	1869000	and said, we're being pushed towards independence way faster than we'll be ready for it.
1869000	1873000	Julius Nierere didn't think Tanzania would be ready for independence
1873000	1875000	until about the year 2000, right?
1875000	1879000	But the momentum was, you have to resist colonialism.
1879000	1881000	You have to go.
1881000	1886000	And so these people who had no ability to hold these countries together
1886000	1889000	and were bringing in not some indigenous wisdom of governance,
1889000	1893000	but half-baked Marxist theories were thrown into power
1893000	1896000	as representatives of the people against European colonialism.
1896000	1899000	And this was because there was a perception of the winds of change.
1899000	1902000	There was just a historic moment. There was no point resisting it.
1902000	1904000	It's two things.
1904000	1906000	First of all, Europe is exhausted after World War II
1906000	1911000	and European populations are lining up for bread.
1911000	1914000	They have no heating. They have no electricity.
1914000	1921000	The appetite for providing global public goods to foreign peoples was at an end, right?
1921000	1925000	And one of the tragedies of World War I and World War II
1925000	1930000	was this loss of European willpower to maintain empires, right?
1930000	1935000	So first of all, there's no support for colonialism on the home front.
1935000	1938000	That's the most fundamental reason for the end of colonialism.
1938000	1941000	It's not Gandhi standing up to the British Empire,
1941000	1945000	you know, these virtuous George Washington's with black skin,
1945000	1948000	bringing down the pretensions of this strong imperialist.
1948000	1950000	No, nonsense.
1950000	1953000	The imperialists were brought down by the home front,
1953000	1956000	who said, we're done with colonialism.
1956000	1958000	We can barely feed our families, right?
1958000	1961000	And so the willpower on the home front evaporated.
1961000	1964000	Later on top of that, you now have the Soviet Union,
1964000	1968000	styling itself as the liberator of black and brown people everywhere,
1968000	1972000	even as it's colonizing Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Baltics.
1972000	1974000	But anyways, put that aside, they're liberators,
1974000	1977000	and of course they'll bring democracy and prosperity everywhere they go.
1977000	1982000	Well, now at the United Nations, you have this dance of the Soviet Union and the United States.
1982000	1986000	The United States having its anti-colonial tradition,
1986000	1989000	but recognizing that this is not going to end well,
1989000	1997000	but not wanting to be outflanked by the Americans for the participation of these third world governments.
1997000	2001000	So, loss of resources on the home front,
2001000	2004000	the United Nations system pushing for decolonization,
2004000	2005000	it's an open door.
2005000	2008000	Don't tell me that Gandhi brought down the British Empire.
2008000	2010000	I mean, he's a complete flinty, silly man.
2010000	2013000	He's pushing on an open door, right?
2013000	2018000	These doors open up very quickly and with grave consequences for these populations.
2018000	2022000	Now, just to stick with Burns for a second, when your biography of Burns came out,
2022000	2026000	you were attacked from some perhaps predictable quarters for it.
2026000	2033000	One Marxist philosopher claimed that you were endorsing a white nationalist perspective.
2033000	2035000	What do you say to people like that?
2035000	2041000	People who claim you're doing something wrong by just even writing about a figure like Alan Burns?
2041000	2046000	Yeah, I think the criticism was that I was enabling white supremacy
2046000	2050000	by writing a positive biography of a British colonial official.
2050000	2058000	Yeah, you don't know where to start because in part because one of the things that attracted me to Burns
2058000	2064000	is how much he was loved among those where he governed, right?
2064000	2068000	I mean, he was called the Sunshine Governor on the Gold Coast, right?
2068000	2074000	They constantly told him that they wanted to extend his term and not just the kind of local elites, right?
2074000	2079000	But I mean, he always would tell the story about, you know, he would go off on safari to visit some hill station
2079000	2082000	and the only person he would have with him would be his orderly.
2082000	2085000	Why? Because the British officials were never afraid of being murdered.
2085000	2087000	They were never afraid of being attacked.
2087000	2089000	They were always welcomed wherever they went, right?
2089000	2095000	So this supposedly evil person, but now we need a white Marxist in Toronto
2095000	2101000	to tell these stupid brown and black people who kept liking people like Burns that they were mistaken
2101000	2106000	and they really needed to get their marching orders from white academics and philosophers in Western universities.
2106000	2108000	I mean, to me, this is the real racism, right?
2108000	2114000	The real racism is these white academics who tell brown and black people what they are
2114000	2117000	and are not allowed to think about their own histories
2117000	2121000	and what they should and should not think about those histories, right?
2121000	2128000	This is, I mean, I think it's Dr. N'Joyer, Juan Jiro N'Joyer, British legal professor, right,
2128000	2130000	who says this is the real imperialism, right?
2130000	2135000	The real imperialism is these white academics trying to tell people in the former colonies
2135000	2138000	what they are and are not allowed to think about their own histories.
2138000	2144000	Are there ways to ensure that academics like yourself who do write about this are able to do so
2144000	2146000	without being assailed in this way?
2146000	2148000	I mean, there's fair criticism.
2148000	2150000	Of course, nobody ever wants to stop that,
2150000	2155000	but the sort of, let's say, the demonization that's been seen
2155000	2157000	against you, against Nigel Bigwood Oxford,
2157000	2162000	saying that maybe we could try to look at colonialism in the round.
2162000	2168000	Is there any way to protect academics to be able to continue such research without that kind of...
2168000	2174000	No, I think right now, if you're a young scholar or a young historian and you look at me,
2174000	2177000	the implications are very clear, right?
2177000	2182000	No, you will not get a job, especially as a white academic,
2182000	2185000	unless you are more woke than the woke, right?
2185000	2188000	And you need to be so virulently anti-colonial.
2188000	2191000	You need to be practically insanely anti-colonial
2191000	2195000	in order to even have a thought of getting a job in academia.
2195000	2199000	So no, the window has closed very narrowly
2199000	2202000	and it's about to close even more firmly shut.
2202000	2204000	So that's one thing.
2204000	2209000	My argument to the academy is something like this.
2209000	2214000	If you were to produce a vaccine in a laboratory filled with bacteria
2214000	2217000	and all sorts of hygienic conditions,
2217000	2220000	would you trust that vaccine in your patients?
2220000	2222000	The argument would be no, right?
2222000	2229000	Producing anti-colonial history in an environment in which only anti-colonial history is allowed
2229000	2233000	is essentially the equivalent of producing a tainted vaccine.
2233000	2238000	There's no scientific reason to believe that that history is accurate
2238000	2242000	because it's been produced in a laboratory that doesn't have adequate scientific conditions.
2242000	2247000	And the most fundamental scientific condition for any social scientific claim
2247000	2251000	or historical claim is the possibility of dissent, the possibility of debate,
2251000	2254000	the possibility of different perspectives being raised.
2254000	2258000	And if you shut that down, everything you produce is by definition flawed, right?
2258000	2260000	So I don't even need to read it.
2260000	2262000	It's produced in the modern academy.
2262000	2267000	It's not reliable without reading a single word of it.
2267000	2275000	Just knowing the conditions of knowledge production in the academic setting are so flawed
2275000	2282000	and so tainted that it would only be by fluke that it would produce anything of value.
2282000	2287000	Now, one of the ways in which people do talk about colonialism now
2287000	2294000	is they do allow themselves to say, effectively, there were worse empires.
2294000	2298000	If there's an agreement that none were good, it was all wrong,
2298000	2300000	but that there were some that were worse.
2300000	2307000	And speaking of somebody born in Britain, I can say that even the most anti-colonial movements in Britain
2307000	2312000	do concede or console themselves with the idea that the Belgians were the worst.
2312000	2316000	I don't know why this gives us so much pleasure, but it does.
2316000	2320000	The one thing everyone knows in Britain is that King Leopold did the worst stuff,
2320000	2322000	and at least we didn't have King Leopold.
2322000	2324000	Let's just get on to that quickly.
2324000	2329000	I mean, first of all, this perception that there were better and worse empires.
2329000	2331000	Is it true?
2331000	2333000	No, no, it's not.
2333000	2341000	And I think that the British actually are probably one of the worst.
2341000	2346000	And here's the reason is that the worst empires are the worst in conceding this.
2346000	2348000	The worst of the empires.
2348000	2352000	But I think the British are actually quite good, so I think they're all good.
2352000	2357000	And the reason is this is that empires tended to take the easiest and the best stuff first.
2357000	2367000	The British captured what was the most easy to govern and the most easily governed areas first,
2367000	2369000	and the latecomers tended to get the worst stuff.
2369000	2376000	The reason the Portuguese get such a bad rap is by the time the Portuguese were coming to colonize the African areas,
2376000	2378000	and that was the only thing they had.
2378000	2382000	They were left with the bits and pieces, the places no one else wanted to govern.
2382000	2384000	The same is true of the Congo.
2384000	2386000	Now, a couple of things about the Congo.
2386000	2392000	First of all, the Congo-free state of King Leopold II was not a Belgian colony.
2392000	2394000	I have to always remind people of that.
2394000	2397000	It was not a Belgian colony.
2397000	2401000	So it was a private estate of King Leopold II.
2401000	2404000	It was not run by the Belgian government.
2404000	2406000	The information was not shared with the Belgian government.
2406000	2408000	There were no Belgian government officials there.
2408000	2414000	It was a private undertaking by the king lasted until 1908.
2414000	2422000	The Congo became a Belgian colony in 1908 after the problems and abuses of the free state were revealed.
2422000	2428000	From 1908 until its independence in 1960 was the only time the Congo has been well-governed,
2428000	2435000	so that Belgians actually have a lot to be proud of for their colonial period in the Congo, which began in 1908.
2435000	2439000	The other places were Rwanda and Burundi, now Burundi,
2439000	2445000	which the Belgians were given as their spoils from World War I from Germany to Africa.
2445000	2450000	Also, very successful governance in Rwanda and Burundi,
2450000	2454000	in terms of allowing essentially these feudal states to remain in rule,
2454000	2459000	the Belgians recognized the problems, but were forced out by the United Nations system,
2459000	2460000	because these were trustee ships.
2460000	2462000	These weren't colonies per se.
2462000	2464000	These were UN trustee ships that the Belgians ran.
2464000	2468000	The Belgians realized what would happen if sudden independence was given to them.
2468000	2470000	Again, UN system comes in.
2471000	2474000	I look at the Belgian experiences in those three places and say,
2474000	2477000	it's a tremendous achievement for the Belgians.
2477000	2480000	It's just one of these myths of the even evil Belgians.
2480000	2483000	But pre-1908, it was...
2483000	2485000	Yeah, but pre-1908, it's not a colony.
2485000	2489000	It's basically a private estate run by a bunch of freelancers,
2489000	2492000	a bunch of military cast-offs,
2492000	2496000	and Leopold's argument for the...
2496000	2502000	And by the way, all the Adam Hothchild's book is a farrago of nonsense and misinterpretation.
2502000	2506000	I'm writing a long takedown of it for its 25th anniversary next year.
2506000	2508000	Is King Leopold's good?
2508000	2511000	Yes, 10 million dead, nonsense.
2511000	2516000	Even as a mortality demographic decline figure, the 10 million is nonsense.
2516000	2521000	Probably the best estimate is the population increased slightly under King Leopold's rule.
2521000	2525000	No 10 million dead, no 10 million murdered, which you'll see on Wikipedia.
2525000	2527000	So it's just a lie, a bald lie.
2527000	2533000	And it's a lie that Hothchild was aware of when he published the book and he chose not to include it.
2533000	2538000	It's basically the demographers who were looking at that, they realized that the miscalculation.
2538000	2542000	Hothchild was aware that that was a lie, he didn't change the book.
2542000	2544000	And he's never recanted it.
2544000	2546000	So it's a big scandal to me.
2546000	2548000	The popularity of that book is a scandal.
2548000	2554000	Second of all, because Hothchild subtitles that book, a story of greed and terror in colonial Africa.
2554000	2557000	Well, okay, colonial Africa, yes.
2557000	2560000	But not in a colony, this was not a colony, right?
2560000	2564000	This was a freelance enterprise being run.
2564000	2577000	And what made the Congo so difficult for King Leopold was the fact that most of the center area was controlled by two notoriously brutal slave and rubber empires
2577000	2584000	who were Muslim Africans, sometimes called Arabs, but they were actually both Africans,
2584000	2586000	who had traditionally traded from the East End.
2586000	2590000	One was called Tipotip, who was famous for his brutality.
2590000	2596000	The other was called Al-Zubur-Matir, who was these two competing kind of chieftains of the East End.
2596000	2599000	And most of the brutalities happened in those areas.
2599000	2602000	Now, yes, this was formally part of the Free State.
2602000	2607000	And in theory, the King should have had a stronger military force to stamp that out.
2607000	2612000	I mean, this is why the private colonialism didn't work well, because you don't have the resources.
2612000	2614000	You don't have the security operations.
2614000	2616000	You don't have the accountability mechanisms.
2616000	2618000	But keep in mind what we're saying here.
2618000	2623000	What we're saying is the Free State didn't have enough colonialism.
2623000	2627000	And what most people will say is colonialism caused the Free State.
2627000	2630000	No, it was the absence of colonialism that caused the Free State.
2630000	2635000	In fact, Edmund Moral, the famous lawyer who exposed the abuses, right?
2635000	2639000	I mean, his whole argument was this place needs to be colonized.
2639000	2641000	And he wanted the Germans to take it over, right?
2641000	2644000	Because he thought the Germans were the best colonizers.
2644000	2650000	So, I mean, the mythology of this evil Belgian colony is A, wrong, because there wasn't a Belgian colony.
2650000	2656000	B, it misinterprets the problem as being too much colonialism when the problem was too little.
2656000	2660000	Just shoot down one more of my British constellations.
2660000	2663000	The Italians were especially bad.
2663000	2675000	Well, the fascist colony of Italian Abyssinia is a bit of an oxymoron, because what is a fascist colony exactly?
2675000	2682000	I mean, it's not a European colony in the sense of bringing European liberal civilization to Africa, in that case.
2682000	2690000	I mean, Mussolini said, I'm going to oust this Christian king and replace him with a Muslim Islamic state,
2690000	2693000	and I'm going to be the sword of Islam in Abyssinia.
2693000	2701000	So, he was wildly popular, but he was popular because he was doing everything that European colonialism didn't do,
2701000	2704000	which was bring a liberal empire to Africa.
2704000	2710000	I mean, he was explicit in saying, I'm going to build an Islamic fascist empire here, right?
2710000	2712000	I mean, so he was celebrated.
2712000	2717000	I mean, the Saudis and the Egyptians loved the Italian conquest of Abyssinia.
2717000	2721000	A, it overthrew a Christian king, so that was good.
2721000	2723000	Replace it with an Islamic empire.
2723000	2727000	B, he promised to impose Sharia law, right?
2727000	2729000	And so that made him popular.
2729000	2734000	So, is that colonialism or is that fascism, right?
2734000	2742000	I mean, for me, colonialism, as we describe it, is European liberal states expanding liberal governance to Africa.
2742000	2751000	Mussolini's colony was really just an Islamofascist outpost, and when the people who visited there saw that,
2751000	2758000	they recoiled and they recognized that this is not some Italian colony, right?
2758000	2763000	This doesn't represent Italian values, it represents Mussolini's fascism.
2763000	2770000	Now, coming more up to date, in the discussion today about colonialism,
2770000	2778000	it seemed to a situation where some countries insist that, for instance, reparations need to be paid for colonialism.
2778000	2784000	There must be large cash transfers, sometimes to the Swiss bank account of the relevant leader,
2784000	2789000	that some kind of compensation must be made.
2789000	2793000	One of the things that's very striking to me about this argument is that that argument is only heard, of course,
2793000	2799000	from states that have not worked well after the period of colonial rule,
2799000	2807000	whereas states, countries which have boomed in the last half-century are looking forward in this way.
2807000	2812000	Is that true? Is it the case that now we hear about the crimes of colonialism
2812000	2818000	and most just the places that just haven't worked for various reasons, you know, misgovernment,
2818000	2821000	misgovernance, corruption and much more.
2821000	2826000	There's a reason why Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe and Singapore is Singapore.
2826000	2832000	Yeah, that's right, and let's face it, nobody takes reparations seriously other than a kind of shakedown
2832000	2838000	and a kind of foreign aid dressed up with a moral cause.
2838000	2840000	But the United Nations takes it seriously.
2840000	2842000	Yeah, I know, but let's be honest.
2842000	2851000	I mean, so where you have seen payments, right, is in alleged response to the victims of counterinsurgency operations,
2851000	2856000	like the Mao Mao, the Mao Mao, and in Namibia, right, to the Herrero and the Nama.
2856000	2862000	Although in the case of the Herrero and the Nama, right, it was basically a payoff to the government,
2862000	2866000	and the government is run by the Ova Mamboo, who are not Herrero or Nama,
2866000	2870000	and so there's a big internal debate about where that money is going to end up.
2870000	2873000	It's going to end up in party cadres, pockets in Namibia.
2873000	2876000	People who were not the perpetrators gave money to people who weren't the victims.
2876000	2881000	Right, well, the Germans, the Germans handed over, God knows how much,
2881000	2886000	$4 billion or something, $400 million or whatever it was last year, two years ago,
2886000	2891000	to Namibia in reparation for the alleged genocide of Herrero, which is a myth, by the way,
2891000	2895000	which I'm going to document in my forthcoming book on German colonialism,
2895000	2897000	called In Defense of German Colonialism.
2897000	2901000	But I see another attempted cancellation coming up.
2901000	2904000	Yeah, well, luckily, the publisher is not to be canceled.
2904000	2908000	But what I will say is there is a kind of just shakedown culture, right,
2908000	2915000	and they've become kind of like cargo cults, right, basically like let's, you know, really,
2915000	2920000	why not try and shake down the form of colonial power for some guilt money
2920000	2923000	and spend our time in Berlin or Paris or London,
2923000	2927000	angling for legal compensation and being in the court cases.
2927000	2932000	Because ultimately, if they ever give in, right, it's just like a bonanza, right?
2932000	2934000	I mean, suddenly this free money comes in.
2934000	2940000	And the Europeans being, ultimately, they don't really care about brown or black people.
2940000	2945000	They care more about their moral guilt and their self-absorption
2945000	2950000	and the ability to achieve moral transcendence and ultimately superiority through their guilt.
2950000	2955000	You know, don't really care that dropping large wads of cash into communities
2955000	2960000	is extremely harmful to their productive capacities, creates all kinds of malign impacts,
2960000	2962000	but they don't really care about that.
2962000	2967000	So the Germans dropped this big wad of cash on the Namibian government two years ago
2967000	2969000	saying that's it, now we're done, right?
2969000	2971000	Now we've atoned for our sins, right?
2971000	2976000	It sets off a mad scramble, as you suggest, among the cadres for who's going to get this money.
2976000	2978000	It doesn't achieve anything.
2978000	2983000	That's the only form of reparations that actually works now,
2983000	2988000	which is identifying a clear set of alleged victims in a particular incident, right,
2988000	2991000	in which a clear harm was supposedly made.
2991000	2998000	But the argument of reparations for colonialism itself, I mean, it's a non-starter as a moral question,
2998000	3001000	but it's also, I think, a non-starter as a practical question.
3001000	3006000	Now as we start to wrap up, first of all, is colonialism worth reclaiming?
3006000	3014000	What are the aspects of it that could be applied if understood properly in the world today?
3014000	3019000	Well, colonialism happens whether we like it or not
3019000	3030000	in the sense that dysfunctional governments have their governance capacities taken over by external actors.
3030000	3036000	Often it's an IMF loan with conditions, or it's a World Bank loan with conditions about governance.
3036000	3038000	You'd call that colonialism of a kind?
3038000	3041000	It's not colonialism, but it's external governance.
3042000	3050000	And it draws much on colonial experiences in terms of how you can enhance indigenous capacity
3050000	3055000	by keeping some form of gatekeeping or tutelary role on the outside, right?
3055000	3058000	But that's how colonialism was trying to develop self-government, right,
3058000	3064000	which is as much indigenous native government as possible, creating structures,
3064000	3068000	allowing the governor to veto acts, allowing the governor to appoint the district commissioner.
3068000	3073000	I mean, that was the sort of what Lugard called the dual mandate, right,
3073000	3078000	and sort of our mandate to the local government and the local government's mandate to its people,
3078000	3080000	and that's how we're going to operate.
3080000	3083000	No, I don't like to use the word colonialism for that type of external governance,
3083000	3085000	because that's really just external governance, right?
3085000	3088000	Now there are opportunities for actual colonialism.
3088000	3094000	I mean, Paul Romer, who is the World Bank official economist, right,
3094000	3098000	a University of Chicago professor, proposed this idea of a charter city, right,
3098000	3105000	to take a piece of land in one of these countries, lease it from the government for a dollar a year, right,
3105000	3109000	and put it under the formal rule of an external power, right?
3109000	3112000	So a charter city would be kind of like what Hong Kong was, right?
3112000	3119000	It's basically a leased piece of land that is put under the sovereignty of a western government for a fixed amount of time,
3119000	3123000	during which its laws and its rule apply there.
3123000	3126000	It's allowed to trade, people are allowed to migrate, right?
3126000	3131000	And what it does is it creates this little kind of dynamo of economic success
3131000	3136000	along the coast or in the territory that eventually can be handed back.
3136000	3143000	I mean, Romer says that Hong Kong itself, given the number of people it positively affected in China,
3143000	3147000	because of its demonstration effects, because of how the Chinese learn from it,
3147000	3152000	can almost single-handedly be used to justify British colonialism just by the numbers, right?
3152000	3158000	Because if it's responsible for China's economic boom, then it's a pretty big data point.
3158000	3160000	So ideas like that.
3160000	3164000	Now, it's tough to bring in the white man, mainly because the white man doesn't want to be there, right,
3164000	3166000	because of the opposition.
3166000	3170000	But we do see, for example, non-white countries going in.
3170000	3175000	So the South Koreans have created essentially a small colony in Bangladesh.
3175000	3177000	It's basically an industrial zone.
3177000	3180000	It's run by the Korean Development Authority.
3180000	3182000	It's a walled city.
3182000	3184000	It's got factories.
3184000	3185000	It's got schools.
3185000	3187000	It's got its own governments.
3187000	3189000	It's basically a little Korean colony in Bangladesh.
3189000	3195000	Nobody notices it because they're all like brown and yellow and aren't they all just the same?
3195000	3198000	And who cares about the Koreans colonizing Bangladesh?
3198000	3199000	I think it's great.
3199000	3200000	It's a model.
3200000	3210000	You've also seen some behavior like that in Yemen, in the north end of Yemen, where the Qataris and Saudis and the Turks
3210000	3215000	basically created a colony, a colony that's externally run.
3215000	3220000	I think that that's a great model to follow because the Yemenis can't stand up their own government.
3220000	3227000	This is all kind of beyond the New York Times' horizon of interest because they're all brown and black people,
3227000	3231000	and there's no white man with a pith hat on to decry.
3231000	3233000	But it's actually working quite well.
3233000	3236000	And I think that type of colonialism has a lot of potential.
3236000	3240000	What about Chinese colonialism in Africa today?
3240000	3242000	Would you call that colonialism?
3242000	3246000	It's not even external governance for the most part because the Chinese,
3246000	3251000	unlike the South Koreans, don't actually have a governance model that they can share.
3251000	3253000	So the Chinese invest a lot.
3253000	3255000	Yeah, they create company towns.
3255000	3259000	They provide infrastructure, but they're not doing governance.
3259000	3263000	What's the difference in a town that you buy up and run?
3263000	3268000	Well, because the Chinese still are not bringing in their own administrators.
3268000	3274000	They're not setting up their own special zone laws the way that, say, the Koreans did in Bangladesh.
3274000	3276000	I mean, they're still relying on local police.
3276000	3278000	They're still using local laws.
3278000	3283000	I mean, they're not really trying to govern beyond just running their enterprises.
3283000	3287000	Now, yeah, those enterprises are big, sprawling institutions,
3287000	3290000	but they're still just like one company operation.
3290000	3292000	So I don't see the Chinese doing it.
3292000	3295000	The Chinese are smart enough to know that they can't do that, right?
3295000	3297000	That they can't govern other peoples.
3297000	3299000	Do they not want to?
3299000	3301000	I don't think they want to.
3301000	3302000	They want their money.
3302000	3303000	They want their investment.
3303000	3307000	They want their leverage over those governments in terms of the economic leverage.
3307000	3313000	But I don't think they see themselves as having an interest, even,
3313000	3317000	in spreading their governance model to other parts of the world.
3317000	3320000	Indeed, their whole discourse is to each his own.
3320000	3324000	It's interesting that today when we talk about colonialism,
3324000	3328000	countries like America, Israel, and others,
3328000	3334000	the term is used sometimes of them as a sort of smear or a slander.
3334000	3339000	Even there's nothing that America is doing that is colonial
3339000	3342000	by the terms that you've just laid out.
3342000	3344000	Yet, for some reason, it is still seen,
3344000	3349000	what is seen today as something that only, as you say, white people would be guilty of
3349000	3351000	or could be guilty of.
3351000	3352000	Is that true?
3352000	3356000	Yeah, it's trying to backcast the word to say any settlement
3356000	3359000	or expansion of one's territory makes you colonial.
3359000	3365000	So if that's the case, virtually all of the Native American tribes are colonial as well.
3365000	3370000	I mean, all of the lands claimed by the Cherokee are colonial takings from other tribes.
3370000	3377000	The Hawaiians who claim indigeneity in Hawaii arose from colonial processes
3377000	3379000	in the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific.
3379000	3381000	So we're all colonial.
3381000	3383000	So it's just a statement of the obvious, right?
3383000	3388000	And to say that a place like Puerto Rico is colonial.
3388000	3393000	Well, of course, the Puerto Ricans have never demanded independence, right?
3393000	3396000	I mean, the independence movement is a flop in Puerto Rico
3396000	3398000	for reasons that they know well, right?
3398000	3399000	Because it would be a disaster.
3399000	3401000	I mean, they benefit from that connection.
3401000	3407000	The little bits of colonies left around the world, the French pieces, the British pieces, right?
3407000	3408000	They have referendum.
3408000	3413000	There's a place that's related to the Norfolk Islands off New Zealand.
3413000	3414000	I mean, they have referendum.
3414000	3419000	They never achieve a necessary majority because these places know how much they benefit
3419000	3421000	from that colonial connection.
3421000	3428000	As we wrap up, I come back to where we started, the outrage, attempted cancellations of you
3428000	3433000	and a few other academics who actually investigate research in these areas
3433000	3438000	without just coming to what seemed to be the preordained conclusions you're meant to come to.
3438000	3442000	And just to return to that, as I see it,
3442000	3447000	the criticisms that have come towards you, the criticisms that have come to others in the same area,
3447000	3452000	it's almost as if there's an area of the past on this occasion, colonialism,
3452000	3456000	but there are others as well that's effectively behind crime scene tape,
3456000	3458000	and you're not meant to go there.
3458000	3463000	And as I see it, the reason that people don't want you to go there
3463000	3468000	is because they somehow think that if you do, we're going to do it again.
3468000	3473000	You heard that a certain amount in recent years in Britain.
3473000	3478000	There were people who claimed that the Brexit vote was just the beginning of a new era
3478000	3485000	of British Empire building, and no member of the British government has at all expressed
3485000	3489000	an interest in going and taking over other parts of the world in the last six years,
3489000	3490000	very far from it.
3490000	3495000	They seem to be wanting to govern their own state as well or badly as they can,
3495000	3500000	but that seems to be a motif that has been emerging.
3500000	3502000	Don't deal with this stuff.
3502000	3505000	Don't even weigh up the pros and cons of colonialism,
3505000	3511000	because the moment you talk about the pros, we'll just be off again.
3511000	3512000	Do you agree?
3512000	3516000	Yeah, and I think it's even bigger than that.
3516000	3521000	I mean, it's true that they don't want to legitimate the idea of western control
3521000	3525000	or rule over any part of the world, even if people's in other parts of the world
3525000	3529000	would line up to be ruled by western countries.
3529000	3531000	I think that's true, by the way, separate issue.
3531000	3534000	But I think there's a bigger issue here, and it's part of what your book,
3534000	3540000	The War on the West, is about, which is that colonialism is seen as kind of unambiguous bad
3540000	3544000	that can be chalked up on the negative side of western society
3544000	3548000	and constantly used to bash it whenever it claims any right.
3548000	3553000	And part of it's a response to the fact that as the world progresses,
3553000	3556000	the West is getting stronger, in my view.
3556000	3557000	It is getting stronger.
3557000	3559000	It is getting more dominant.
3559000	3561000	It is getting more attractive.
3561000	3564000	The rivals are falling by the wayside.
3564000	3567000	The Chinese model is flat.
3567000	3568000	The Russian model is over.
3568000	3571000	The Brazilian model is long dead.
3571000	3576000	I mean, so I think there is this kind of resentment about the success of the West.
3576000	3580000	And colonialism has become this kind of quiver of arrows.
3580000	3584000	Let's say, whenever you talk about the West, let's not forget colonialism.
3584000	3589000	And the requirement there is that that debate be not available for discussion.
3589000	3592000	That that's just an unambiguous bad, and you're supposed to bow your head and say,
3592000	3594000	yes, you're right, that's a bad part of it.
3594000	3602000	So they hate the idea that this box, this Pandora's box of debate could be opened
3602000	3609000	because it weakens what to them is one of their key kind of charges in opposition to the rise of the West.
3609000	3612000	Well, Professor Bruce Gilley, thank you very much.
3612000	3616000	We've covered an enormous amount of terrain, but that was absolutely fascinating
3616000	3621000	and has certainly given us a new view on an old question of colonialism.
3621000	3622000	Thank you.
3622000	3623000	Thank you.
3632000	3634000	Thank you.
