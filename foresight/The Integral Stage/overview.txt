The conversation highlighted the significance of integrating past, present, and future in a balanced way, drawing from both Western psychological approaches and authentic wisdom traditions.

2. **Acceptance and Detachment**: The concept of acceptance as part of calm mo (calm mind) was discussed, emphasizing the importance of detachment and distress tolerance as bridges to presence and being. This approach aligns with developmental transitions across different scales, from individual to community levels.

The discussion suggested that understanding the interplay between time, space, and knowledge can lead to different patterns of self-systems.

4. **TSK (Time Space Knowledge)**: A brief mention of TSK as an orientation towards understanding the world through time, space, and knowledge was made. This tradition might offer a unique perspective on how these elements shape our experiences and conceptions of reality.

5. **Appreciation and Enrichment**: There was a shared sentiment of gratitude for the rich and thought-provoking conversation. The speakers expressed appreciation for each other's insights and the value of creating spaces that allow for an integrated, pluralistic, and wise way of being.

6. **Hope for Collective Flourishing**: The conversation concluded with a hopeful outlook on the future, emphasizing the potential for collective flowering and positive outcomes if we can navigate this century effectively.

7. **Personal Connections**: Despite the constraints of virtual interaction, personal connections were made, and there was an expressed desire to continue the dialogue and collaborate in person in the future.

In essence, the discussion revolved around the nuanced understanding of time and its impact on our experiences, the importance of integrating various perspectives from different traditions, and the shared hope for a future where wisdom and information come together to create a more integrated, pluralistic society.
