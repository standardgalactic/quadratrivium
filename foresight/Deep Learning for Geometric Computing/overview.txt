1. **Challenge of High-Dimensional Data in Shape Learning**: In biomedical imaging, we often deal with high-dimensional data representing shapes which are inherently low-dimensional manifolds within this space. This makes it computationally expensive and challenging to learn from such data.

2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: VAEs are a type of generative model used in deep learning for learning complex distributions of data. They consist of an encoder that maps input data to a latent space representation and a decoder that reconstructs the input from this representation. The training process is guided by a loss function called the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

3. **Generalizing VAEs to Manifolds**: To apply VAEs to manifolds, which are intrinsic low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional spaces, we need to generalize two components: the generative model and the ELBO loss function. The generalization involves:
   - Replacing vector space operations like addition with geometric operations like the exponential map on manifolds for the generative model.
   - Modifying the ELBO to account for the manifold structure, using geometrical interpretations of addition and distance metrics.

4. **Manifold Variational Autoencoders (mVAEs)**: The result of this generalization is the Manifold Variational Autoencoder (mVAE), which can learn non-linear sub-manifolds of a given manifold without relying on Monte Carlo methods for sampling the posterior distribution.

5. **Insights from Geometric Analysis of VAEs**: A study by Chao Edel in 2018 showed that VAEs tend to represent data as manifolds with surprisingly little curvature. This can be explained through a geometric analysis of VAEs, which indicates that the flatness observed is a result of the VAE architecture and training process.

6. **Application in Shape Learning**: In the context of shape learning in biomedical imaging, mVAEs provide a powerful framework to model complex shapes efficiently. The ability to learn sub-manifolds allows for the capture of subtle variations in shapes, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

7. **Funding and Collaboration**: The research on applying mVAEs to shape learning in biomedical imaging is conducted at UCSB, with support from various funding sources.

In summary, by generalizing VAEs to work on manifolds (mVAEs), we can effectively learn the shapes present in high-dimensional biomedical imaging data, which is a significant advancement in shape learning and has implications for many fields, including biomedicine.
