0	9520	Which is the story of man, for the thoughts, the aspirations, the affections of long generations
9520	18280	of humanity are woven into the fabric of human speech.
18280	26920	That's the way it begins, the story of language all over the world, sounds of human speech
26920	32640	like the very air we breathe, or something most of us take just for granted.
32640	34640	When did you hide the paper?
34640	39320	Now David, you read right up the stairs and watch, and don't forget to brush your teeth.
39320	43480	You'd hardly think of our everyday speech as being a specimen for scientists to take
43480	52040	apart piece by piece, to study, to analyze, but this is a science, a science of linguistics.
52040	55080	There are perhaps many ways to tell this story.
55080	59480	We've chosen to tell it through the imagination of the young lady who lives in this house.
59480	65480	Now as you will see, she's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she
65480	66480	might call it...
66480	76480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
96480	116480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
116480	136480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
136480	156480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
156480	176480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
176480	196480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
196480	216480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
216480	236480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
236480	256480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
256480	276480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
276480	296480	She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...
296480	308480	Why do you take care of the capital, I suppose? You may take care of the little ones.
312480	314480	Hello, Judy!
320480	322480	Who's he?
322480	324480	He's a professor of linguistics.
324480	326480	Linguistic?
326480	329480	Well, Judy, what are you doing?
329480	331480	We're going to do away with the alphabet.
333480	336480	Then I can murder the language.
338480	343480	Which one? There are at least 5,000 different languages in the world.
343480	347480	There are a few of the dictionaries. Where would you like to start?
348480	351480	What do you do? Speak all kinds of languages?
351480	354480	He does just speak them. He's a scientist of language.
354480	356480	A science of language?
356480	362480	Oh, yes. He studies the insides of language. Sounds and words and alphabets.
362480	365480	Alphabets? Is he for them or against them?
365480	368480	Well, there's some things to be said in favor of alphabets.
368480	372480	Name one. The alphabet is the basis of writing for one.
372480	375480	Then let's get the man who invented the alphabet.
375480	377480	Yes, I'd like to meet him.
377480	382480	I'm afraid that would be a bit difficult, because people have been writing for 5 or 6,000 years.
382480	384480	Well, that's centuries.
384480	388480	Yes, Judy, it is. The people have been talking for a long time.
388480	396480	If this ruler represents the time man has been talking, he's been writing only this long.
396480	403480	But even today, in many areas of the earth, large numbers of people, millions of them, still get along without writing.
403480	406480	Hope they get along. Why should they buy good news?
406480	411480	Well, they can't learn to write most of them because they have no alphabet.
411480	413480	No alphabet.
413480	420480	But as civilization began to spread over the earth, people realized spoken language alone has its limits.
420480	423480	They were learning so much they couldn't remember at all.
423480	427480	You might say, Judy, that's why writing was invented.
427480	430480	Then that must be why we have whole libraries full of books,
430480	434480	because people want to write down for other people what they've gotten, what they did.
434480	440480	Pity. People were talking to each other long before there was anything like civilization.
440480	443480	Scientists don't know exactly how it all got started.
443480	449480	But once on the move, speech grew like a great tree, with branches joining at limbs,
449480	455480	branches growing out of other branches, branches running up into twigs.
455480	459480	Each a spoken language that was the source of still other languages,
459480	465480	and each changing as it went along and developed until the end of time.
466480	469480	Even now, languages are continually changing.
469480	473480	New ones springing from old ones, sometimes several from a single source.
473480	475480	Latin was very important, wasn't it?
475480	477480	Oh, yes, it certainly was.
477480	483480	What we call the romance languages are branched off from the great trunk of Latin.
483480	486480	There's Italian, Sardinian, and Latin.
486480	490480	And there's Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin.
490480	493480	It's branched off from the great trunk of Latin.
493480	502480	There's Italian, Sardinian, Spanish and Portuguese, Dalmatian and Romanian,
502480	509480	Catalan and French Proven√ßal, Rito Romance.
509480	512480	And if you listen, you'll hear a certain similarity.
512480	513480	Padre?
513480	514480	Yes.
514480	515480	Papa?
515480	516480	Papa?
516480	518480	Papa?
518480	520480	Well, did talk something right?
520480	523480	Well, Judy, would you be interested to know?
523480	528480	At a certain time of their lives, babies all over the world speak the same language.
528480	529480	Oh, just a moment.
529480	530480	I know better than that.
530480	535480	What about Chinese babies and Indian babies, German babies, French babies and American babies?
535480	540480	Well, now just listen to the language that all those babies speak.
540480	543480	Now, here's a typical baby.
543480	545480	Is it just from that young talk?
545480	551480	All babies in the world have the same, well, baby language to start with.
551480	553480	The same babbling, if you like.
553480	558480	But this babbling includes the sounds needed to make any language.
558480	561480	I didn't think baby talk really meant anything.
561480	564480	Oh, baby babbling is very important.
564480	569480	When a baby first comes into the world, the speech areas of his brain are like a clean slate
569480	574480	ready to be written upon from the very moment of birth.
575480	583480	With every sound a baby makes he is producing, you might almost say practicing the basic sounds of speech.
583480	587480	Then he learns to talk just by practicing.
587480	589480	Not entirely.
589480	596480	Through the first year, the child listens to his parents and copies as closely as he can what he hears,
596480	599480	winning their approval when he makes the right sounds.
599480	602480	Then the sounds begin to take shape.
602480	606480	And by the age of six, the speech pattern is complete.
609480	610480	It's Daddy!
610480	611480	Hello, Daddy.
614480	618480	Babies all start with the same sounds and then they just keep the ones that fit their language.
618480	620480	I think I'll make a note of that.
620480	623480	You might also make a note that we have a conspiracy to get out of here.
623480	625480	Shall we go?
625480	629480	Oh, yes, that conspiracy to do away with the alphabet.
629480	630480	May I ask a question?
630480	631480	What is it?
631480	633480	Why do you want to get rid of the alphabet?
633480	635480	It's language we're after, really.
635480	640480	And the letters of the alphabet are the building blocks of language.
640480	642480	That's a beautiful statement.
642480	643480	Thank you, Judy.
643480	647480	Very well put for hardly scientific professional jealousy.
647480	651480	If I wanted to do away with language, what I would go after would be sounds,
651480	654480	because sounds are the basis of any language.
654480	655480	Sounds.
655480	656480	Make a note of that.
656480	660480	I suppose the next thing you're going to say is there's a science of sound.
660480	662480	Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
662480	668480	For a long time, scientists have been curious about how our human sounds are actually made.
668480	674480	In the course of such a study, Professor Wolfgang von Kempelen invented the world's first talking machine.
674480	677480	Make a note again from Kempelen.
678480	682480	That was in the 18th century, around 1780.
682480	685480	Cross him off with too late.
685480	690480	Here's a drawing of von Kempelen's machine when the professor completed it.
690480	695480	I wouldn't even know how to begin to build a talking machine.
695480	697480	What are you doing, Judy?
697480	701480	I'm trying to imagine how the professor could get it all out.
702480	705480	Before a talking machine could be built,
705480	711480	the professor had to do a scientific study of just how the human speech mechanism works.
711480	726480	Lungs, vocal cords, mouth, palate, nasal cavities.
726480	738480	For speech, you need air.
738480	742480	The chest muscles, acting as a bellows,
742480	747480	operate to fill our internal bagpipe, the lungs, with air.
747480	754480	Next, you need a noise.
754480	759480	Read from a bagpipe. That will do.
759480	762480	Now we build the machine.
762480	768480	While our friend is busy, let's look at some recent motion pictures of the human vocal cords in action.
768480	775480	These films were made by the Gould Foundation Voice Research Laboratory at North Thames.
775480	780480	You see, human noise is produced by the vocal cords.
780480	786480	In case in the larynx or Adam's apple, air from the lungs is released through a space between the cords,
786480	790480	causing them to flap apart and slap together.
790480	793480	These vibrations set up sound waves.
793480	797480	Now by slowing down the action with high-speed photography,
797480	804480	we can see that the pitch of sound is varied by tightening or relaxing the pull on the vocal cords.
804480	811480	Tightening them raises the pitch.
811480	817480	Relaxing them lowers it.
817480	822480	Effective as they are, the vocal cords are only the source of noise.
822480	827480	It's the rest of the speech mechanism that shapes the sound into meaningful words.
827480	830480	Now what the professor had to understand to make his machine work
830480	836480	was precisely how the tongue, teeth, lips, and so forth operate.
836480	845480	A-E-O-Vowels.
845480	848480	And now, consonants.
848480	854480	B-B-B-Z-N.
854480	859480	The breath explodes, it buzzes, it hums.
859480	864480	The machine is finished.
864480	869480	And now, demonstration.
869480	878480	That's for my me.
878480	882480	Why, the machine spoke French. Did you all my friends?
882480	886480	Fun Campbell's machine was quite remarkable for 1780,
886480	890480	for it was the world's first successful talking machine.
890480	898480	Scientists today have the benefit of techniques undreamed of in von Kempelten's time.
898480	902480	In these x-ray films of the human speech mechanism in action,
902480	906480	you can see the tongue and lips assuming various positions
906480	910480	to form cavities that modify the sound by resonance.
910480	916480	Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?
916480	921480	The sound of the different vowels depends on the height to which the tongue is raised in the mouth.
921480	927480	High, mid, or low.
927480	933480	It also depends on the position of the tongue in the front or back of the mouth.
933480	937480	Consonants are shaped by tongue, lips, teeth.
937480	943480	Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?
943480	947480	This has been very educational, Jabba. We don't have to bother with the alphabet.
947480	952480	All we've got to do is get rid of those vowels and consonants and our job is done.
952480	959480	I hate to disappoint you, fellas, with what really come out of the human speech mechanism are phonemes.
959480	964480	P-H-O-N-E-M-E-S phonemes.
964480	966480	The basic sounds of speech.
966480	970480	Don't even make a note of that, Judy. He's just trying to throw us off the track.
970480	975480	Come on, Jabba. We've got plans to make.
975480	980480	It is confusing. I guess I better ask you. What is a phoneme?
980480	982480	Phoneme is a sound.
982480	984480	Like A, B, C?
984480	987480	No, they're letters of the alphabet. They're units of writing.
987480	992480	No alphabet for any language truly represents the sounds of that language.
992480	994480	Let me borrow your pad.
994480	996480	Sit down. I'll show you.
996480	1000480	Now, let's take this word.
1000480	1002480	Either?
1002480	1004480	Now, this word has five phonemes.
1004480	1007480	If I say it slowly,
1007480	1011480	D-E-N-E-R,
1011480	1013480	you can hear the five parts.
1013480	1015480	Some people say either.
1015480	1017480	Can you say either, either, or either?
1017480	1019480	Either, either, or either.
1019480	1023480	As your friend the Hatter has already said, the alphabet can be very confusing.
1023480	1026480	Different pronunciations are sometimes spelled in the same way.
1026480	1030480	That's why scientists had to develop more accurate symbols.
1030480	1034480	Now, in phonemes, either is written this way.
1034480	1043480	D-E-N-E-R.
1043480	1046480	And either is written like this.
1046480	1054480	A-E-R.
1054480	1057480	The difference is the first little phonemes.
1057480	1061480	Now, scientists such as Ferdinand de Soussure in France
1061480	1065480	discovered that out of the thousands of speech sounds a human being can make,
1065480	1068480	each language has picked its own set of phonemes.
1068480	1071480	English, for instance, has 45.
1071480	1075480	The most little phoneme sounds must really be the building blocks of language.
1075480	1078480	I'd better make a note of that for the Hatter.
1078480	1081480	But for myself, I'd better just stick to the alphabet.
1088480	1089480	We have a proposal.
1089480	1094480	If we can prove that it's possible to communicate without words to say nothing of phonemes,
1094480	1099480	will you give up your linguistic obsession and join our conspiracy?
1099480	1102480	Science is always open to experimental evidence.
1102480	1103480	Good.
1103480	1119480	One, two, buckle my shoe.
1119480	1124480	Three, four, shut the door.
1124480	1134480	Five, I understood you perfectly.
1134480	1138480	If we can win over science, the alphabet is good as dead.
1138480	1142480	Well, Dr. Linguistic, do you concede that we have made a point?
1142480	1143480	Yes, indeed.
1143480	1147480	As a matter of fact, I think we can substantiate your point further.
1147480	1150480	I think you'll find this very interesting.
1150480	1160480	Science.
1160480	1165480	This is one of the Canary Islands, La Gomera, off the west coast of North Africa,
1165480	1167480	a land of rugged terrain.
1167480	1172480	In the sparsely populated areas, people found it difficult to communicate with one another
1172480	1174480	across the deep gorges.
1174480	1179480	So go, the Gomeras contrived an extraordinary form of telephonic speech, whistling,
1179480	1198480	which can be understood over a distance of frequencies in pitch.
1198480	1202480	This whistling language is of great interest to linguistic scientists
1202480	1207480	because it makes use of only one feature of normal speech, pitch.
1207480	1213480	It does with all the variations of tone quality that Professor von Kemplen was so concerned about.
1213480	1220480	Now, whereas this canary, another ingenious form of language, was invented in the North American plains.
1220480	1222480	Indian Sign Language.
1222480	1227480	When tribes met on the trail, hunted buffalo together, or met in council,
1227480	1232480	it wasn't time enough to learn one another's spoken language, so they used Sign of Washington.
1232480	1242480	The white soldiers told the Indians, beside the river, called the Lodgepole River.
1242480	1255480	Before the snow, there'd be no more fighting, and that made all the Indians very happy.
1255480	1257480	Excuse me, Frinterit.
1257480	1261480	I was just wondering how the Indians managed to talk with their hands in the dark.
1261480	1265480	Well, they couldn't, Judy. As you can see, all of these methods
1265480	1272480	giving man limitless possibilities for expressing his ideas, his concepts of science and technology,
1272480	1283480	his day-by-day thoughts, his feelings, his emotions, love.
1283480	1289480	Don't be taken by those scientific sophistries. Do animals have alphabets? Do they have words?
1289480	1294480	And animals can, without any words at all, quote, communicate from the moment of birth.
1294480	1298480	And they've got no words without any words at all, haven't they?
1298480	1302480	Oh, yes, indeed. That's the would-you-hollows-please-applies.
1302480	1306480	Now, look.
1306480	1308480	There's a crow.
1308480	1312480	When man invades the forest, he's the first to shout, beat it.
1313480	1319480	And all the other birds, animals, pass on the alarm.
1319480	1324480	Not only birds and animals get along without words, but insects as well.
1324480	1328480	The most incredible of all is the dance of the honeybee.
1328480	1332480	When a worker bee finds a flower full of nectar, it flops.
1332480	1336480	This urgent message is communicated by performing a dance.
1336480	1341480	The pattern of the dance indicates the direction of the flowers in relation to the sun.
1341480	1345480	The speed of the dance tells the distance from the hive.
1345480	1347480	The other bees all take notice.
1347480	1350480	They touch the dancer where they discover the scent of the flowers.
1350480	1354480	Then they all fly out to the source of the nectar.
1354480	1358480	Animals and insects have many ingenious ways of communicating.
1358480	1361480	Sound, smells, with motion.
1361480	1366480	We find in all this communication that the animal mind operates almost automatically.
1366480	1372480	It receives messages from the outside through its sense organs and reacts instinctively.
1393480	1395480	Hello. Hello.
1395480	1399480	Why, Jabber, that's very good. You're improving.
1399480	1400480	Hello.
1400480	1402480	Oh, it was the parrot.
1402480	1405480	Beware the jab-bub talking bird.
1405480	1408480	But parrots just imitate what people say.
1408480	1414480	Yes, that's because they are not able to associate a given sound or word with a specific meaning.
1414480	1417480	It's curious, though, that they sound like people.
1417480	1422480	Some animals, such as apes, do have a larynx and the rest of our vocal apparatus.
1422480	1427480	The speech mechanism of the chimpanzee is the closest to that of a human being.
1427480	1429480	Will you please?
1432480	1437480	Research psychologist Dr. Keith Hayes and his wife raised a chimp named Vicki.
1437480	1444480	After constant training, Vicki had learned to speak only three human words by the time she was three years old.
1444480	1447480	Like human babies, she babbled at first.
1447480	1451480	Later, she was rewarded when she made the right sound.
1451480	1456480	Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.
1456480	1461480	The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.
1461480	1466480	Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.
1466480	1472480	Now who am I? Papa? Papa?
1472480	1475480	Papa? Papa?
1475480	1480480	You say whether she was rewarded when she made the right sound.
1480480	1485480	Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.
1485480	1490480	The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.
1490480	1495480	Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.
1495480	1501480	Now who am I? Papa? Papa?
1501480	1506480	You say what this is?
1506480	1511480	By the age of six, Vicki's spoken vocabulary consisted of seven words.
1511480	1516480	Whereas human children are using hundreds of words by the time they're only two years old.
1516480	1522480	Chimpanzees, orangutans, and other mammals may have larynxes in the rest of the speech mechanism,
1522480	1527480	but it takes more than that. It takes brain power.
1528480	1534480	Well, for the present, we must conclude that man is the only one of Earth's creatures with true language.
1534480	1540480	Because the animals can't manage to combine their cries, calls, their signals,
1540480	1547480	form the infinite variety of meaning that we achieve when we arrange words and sounds into sentences.
1547480	1551480	So, Judy, shouldn't surprise you that some people have argued
1551480	1555480	that what distinguishes man from beast is grammar.
1555480	1560480	I knew it, I knew it. I suspected it from the moment he started building up this so-called
1560480	1564480	science of linguistics, and all these pretentious words are just a cover-up from grammar.
1564480	1569480	So, Judy, the sooner we get on with our conspiracy, the sooner we get rid of grammar.
1569480	1577480	It would be a lovely world without subjects and predicates and split infinitives and the conjugation of verbs.
1577480	1580480	But, Judy, grammar isn't just a bunch of rules.
1580480	1584480	I know. It's the building blocks of language.
1584480	1587480	No, it's more like the architect's plan for the building.
1587480	1592480	Well, if you'll pardon me, Professor, I've got some plans for that plan.
1594480	1600480	Then grammar is the plan of how we talk. It sounds important, but rather hard to understand.
1600480	1610480	Judy, it's simply this. The way words are arranged into sentences is as important a meaning as the separate words themselves.
1610480	1615480	Judy, did you know that your brain was unconsciously using grammar long before you started the school?
1615480	1620480	You mean my head's been full of subjects and predicates, and I didn't even know it.
1620480	1624480	Yes, of course. Have you ever tried to make your mind completely blank?
1624480	1631480	You can. If your mind goes on talking to itself and in language, that's what we call thinking.
1631480	1637480	For language puts not only words into our mouths, but into our heads, too.
1637480	1642480	Well, that's another trouble with words. Maybe the header is right.
1642480	1647480	Oh, but Judy, before you go, let me say that words themselves aren't to blame.
1647480	1653480	They were developed through the ages to express the vital experiences of people everywhere.
1653480	1659480	In a sense, people live in different worlds, worlds reflected in their languages.
1659480	1663480	We could understand these many languages. We might hear the people say,
1663480	1671480	We Eskimo must live with snow. It shapes our lives. We have a dozen special words to tell about snow.
1671480	1675480	It's far too important to be dismissed with one word.
1675480	1681480	To us, living in the Trobriam Islands, our very existence depend on raising our crops.
1681480	1684480	We have more than a hundred names for yams.
1684480	1690480	Arabic gives us more than 6,000 different words for camel, its parts and equipment.
1691480	1695480	When language expresses our various ways of life, it is indeed our servant.
1695480	1700480	Some scholars have wondered if language is not at times our master.
1700480	1704480	People use words. Do words use people?
1704480	1711480	In most of the Oriental world, our various social classes speak one to the other in traditional ways.
1711480	1718480	Does our language then determine our behavior, dictating for each person the way in which he acts towards his equals,
1718480	1721480	his inferiors, his superiors?
1721480	1727480	Our Hopi language has no grammatical way to express past, present or future.
1727480	1734480	So far as our language is concerned, one might conclude that the world is without time altogether.
1734480	1740480	Scientists too are pondering such questions. Does our language shape our whole philosophy of life?
1740480	1746480	Is it true that some ideas that are clear in one language may be very difficult to say?
1746480	1750480	Maybe even difficult to think in another language.
1750480	1757480	Even so-called primitive peoples have developed languages that admirably express their cultures, their ways of life.
1757480	1763480	But scientists have discovered that there are no primitive languages on the face of the earth.
1763480	1770480	These languages used with ease by the crudest savages are just as complex as other tongues.
1770480	1777480	In fact, it sometimes requires the lifetime study of our greatest scholars to figure them out.
1777480	1786480	Anthropologists like France Boas, who pioneered in American Indian languages, sought to discover in each language its own system.
1786480	1792480	Following Boas, Leonard Bloomfield began collecting materials on American Indian languages.
1792480	1797480	By this and other work, he set the stage for modern descriptive linguistics.
1797480	1807480	Others, such as Edward Sapir, an expert on many Indian tongues, studied languages as related to cultures and total ways of life.
1807480	1812480	All the languages now being spoken, only a few have been studied scientifically.
1812480	1820480	And today, linguistic scientists all over the world are concentrating upon small speech communities that are rapidly dying out
1820480	1825480	to prevent their languages from being forever lost to the study of man.
1825480	1832480	As we understand each new language, we learn more about the way human beings communicate with one another.
1832480	1843480	Oh, look! There's an envelope. I think there's a letter inside. It's an invitation.
1843480	1851480	Matt Hatter says we're invited to a mad tea party. He's going to prove that language is madness.
1851480	1855480	And the guest of honor is to be Dr. Linguistics.
1855480	1860480	A fish, whiffle, gyre, and gimbal. It'll be right over.
1860480	1866480	My goodness. Tea and linguistics. What a curious combination.
1882480	1885480	The mad tea party is about to commence.
1885480	1886480	Who's coming?
1886480	1895480	Well, I've invited a cowboy from the southwest to theatrical publicity, ma'am, and some other guests.
1895480	1898480	How do you do, Shorty?
1898480	1899480	Scammy, ma'am.
1899480	1904480	Judy, this is Shorty Rogers, famous jazz trumpeter and composer.
1904480	1905480	Hey there, Judy.
1905480	1906480	How do you do?
1906480	1907480	Crazy.
1907480	1911480	Shorty, you're going to meet a very distinguished professor of linguistics.
1911480	1915480	Is this cap tool square or way out?
1915480	1920480	Well, I'm not sure that I follow you, but this should prove a very amusing encounter.
1920480	1923480	They won't understand each other at all.
1923480	1930480	Shorty, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the very distinguished Dr. Linguistics.
1930480	1933480	Doctor, this is Shorty Rogers.
1933480	1936480	I'm very happy to make your acquaintance, Doctor.
1936480	1938480	Scammy, ma'am.
1938480	1941480	Ma'am, you're really weathered. What's the bet here?
1941480	1946480	Well, a hat here's been trying to bug me on this ABC jazz.
1946480	1948480	Crazy made the scene, ma'am. Crazy.
1948480	1951480	Hey, you're a real live aspirin.
1951480	1954480	Well, I have to split now. So long.
1957480	1959480	Keep cool.
1959480	1962480	They seem to understand each other, but I couldn't.
1962480	1964480	Mimsie, too. Me either.
1964480	1967480	Well, waitly meets my next guest.
1967480	1972480	Oh, Doctor L, I'd like you to meet a theatrical publicity man.
1972480	1974480	How do you do?
1974480	1976480	Hi. Looks as if you already have a story.
1976480	1978480	Yep. Here's my lead.
1978480	1983480	Tongue's wag is wag's gag, but hot hat cools as Doc clicks on rhetoric tricks.
1983480	1986480	Well, that's just about ball points the hat's check.
1986480	1988480	Like a fat bat.
1988480	1991480	Well, I gotta run now, Doc. This batch is a bop.
1991480	1994480	Some sock yawks packed them at Flax Cracks.
1994480	1997480	Flax Cracks ban just next to me.
1997480	2000480	You're right. They do understand each other.
2000480	2003480	Perhaps this next guest will confuse him.
2005480	2007480	Enjoying yourself?
2007480	2010480	Well, now, I don't want to sound like I've raised on sour milk,
2010480	2014480	but I just can't drink enough of this yellow gargoyle to get a token load.
2014480	2017480	You see, these dunes give me broke fever.
2017480	2021480	I get my spurs all tangled and I'm just playing old hog tide
2021480	2024480	when it comes to making chin music with a pack of strangers.
2024480	2026480	Well, Doctor Linguist...
2026480	2028480	Well, Doctor Linguist, it's...
2028480	2030480	Well, it was all quite simple.
2030480	2032480	He said he wasn't mouthy.
2032480	2034480	He's fresh out of the tongue oil.
2034480	2036480	This wing ding shortens his stake rope,
2036480	2038480	makes him feel like he's got his leg tied up.
2038480	2041480	Say, partner, you sat at my lingo.
2041480	2043480	You'll do to ride the river with.
2043480	2046480	Well, I gotta roll my wheels.
2046480	2047480	Long, Doc.
2047480	2050480	So long, amigo.
2050480	2054480	Him and me is made of the same leather.
2054480	2056480	Well, so much for linguistics.
2056480	2060480	Now, do let us have some tea.
2060480	2065480	Judy, after that variety of verbal vocalizing,
2065480	2068480	surely you would agree that language is a mixed up mix.
2068480	2072480	But Doctor Linguist didn't seem to think the tea party was so mad.
2072480	2075480	No, actually, I thought it was quite sensible.
2075480	2078480	With everyone speaking a different language.
2078480	2080480	Different dialect, if you please.
2080480	2084480	Now, these dialects and occupational vocabularies
2084480	2087480	are what make any language interesting, colorful.
2087480	2089480	They're part of our humor.
2089480	2092480	But they're also the subject of scholarly research.
2092480	2095480	Well, Doctor Linguist, I'm afraid that you and I
2095480	2098480	are not made of the same leather.
2098480	2101480	Well, thanks for the tea and linguistics.
2101480	2104480	It was very pleasant.
2104480	2109480	Judy, did you care to join me in a little research project
2109480	2113480	in American dialect geography?
2118480	2121480	The way a man talks tells us where he comes from.
2121480	2124480	Like in Brooklyn. Some people call a bird a blight.
2124480	2127480	Yes, it's not only what people say,
2127480	2129480	it's the way they say it that gives us clues
2129480	2131480	where they were brought up.
2131480	2133480	Clues. That sounds like a mystery.
2133480	2135480	It is, rather.
2135480	2139480	You could look at it as a kind of detective story.
2139480	2141480	First, we'll need a suspect.
2141480	2143480	And a private eye.
2143480	2145480	Let's make it two.
2150480	2153480	Now, for the last time, are you going to tell us where you're from?
2155480	2157480	Oh, you won't, eh?
2157480	2159480	Well, we have ways of finding out.
2159480	2161480	Read this.
2163480	2167480	Mary, Mary, Mary.
2167480	2169480	Aha!
2169480	2172480	West of the Alleghenes, they pronounce the words alike.
2172480	2175480	He pronounces them all differently.
2175480	2177480	Yeah, that's right.
2177480	2180480	Clue number one puts him east of the Alleghenes.
2180480	2183480	All right now, read this.
2183480	2189480	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.
2190480	2192480	Gleasy.
2192480	2196480	Hear that? He said greasy, not greasy.
2196480	2199480	That puts you north of Philadelphia.
2199480	2202480	Ha! Read this.
2202480	2204480	Park.
2204480	2207480	He said park, not park.
2207480	2209480	Yeah, yeah, I heard it.
2209480	2211480	That eliminates coastal New England.
2211480	2213480	Read.
2213480	2215480	Wash, water.
2215480	2218480	Hear that? Not wash and water,
2218480	2221480	but wash and water.
2221480	2223480	The rest of New England is out.
2223480	2225480	Must be Central Atlantic states and where.
2234480	2236480	Father.
2236480	2238480	Father? That senses him.
2238480	2241480	I'll put him within a 30-mile radius of Times Square.
2241480	2243480	Right?
2243480	2245480	Yeah.
2245480	2247480	That's right.
2252480	2255480	What a amusing parlor game, Dr. Linguisty.
2255480	2257480	Something like 20 questions.
2257480	2261480	Well, a dialect geographer using a list of only 30 words
2261480	2265480	can usually place a person within 20 miles of his home locality
2265480	2269480	so long as he lives in the eastern part of the United States.
2269480	2274480	Dialect geographers began charting their monumental linguistic atlas
2274480	2276480	in the east in 1929
2276480	2279480	and have been painstakingly working their way to the west.
2279480	2282480	Dr. Hans Kurath of the University of Michigan
2282480	2284480	has conducted a good part of this research.
2284480	2287480	He and his dialect experts are traveling around the country
2287480	2289480	for the past 25 years,
2289480	2292480	asking people what words they use for all sorts of things.
2292480	2295480	They've recorded dialect differences in words
2295480	2297480	and how they're pronounced.
2297480	2301480	Perhaps Dr. Kurath will show us how the atlas is put together.
2301480	2307480	Well, you see, the atlas contains hundreds of maps showing speech differences
2307480	2311480	and their geographical boundaries, which we call isoglosses.
2311480	2315480	May I show you a few examples?
2316480	2324480	This isogloss sets off the area in which riddle cakes are called fritter.
2324480	2330480	This here around Philadelphia shows the area where they call them hotcakes.
2330480	2337480	Over here they're called flannertakes to the south of it, batter cakes.
2337480	2345480	It is on the basis of isoglosses like these that we establish the dialect ban.
2345480	2348480	Thank you, Dr. Kurath.
2348480	2351480	Man takes his speech ways with him wherever he goes.
2351480	2355480	As the dialects flowed westward the way our population did,
2355480	2358480	the strands unraveled and began to overlap.
2358480	2360480	Here's how they traveled.
2360480	2363480	Western New England accents,
2363480	2366480	coast speech,
2366480	2368480	southern mountain accents,
2368480	2370480	plantation speech,
2370480	2372480	Texas accents,
2372480	2377480	but down east talk in the state of Maine has stayed put.
2377480	2380480	This research has revealed the paths people have taken
2380480	2383480	when they migrated from one part of the country to another,
2383480	2387480	shown the changes going on in American speech patterns.
2387480	2391480	This research has unearthed hitherto unrecorded dialects.
2391480	2394480	There's also marked off areas where big cities have influenced
2394480	2397480	the speech ways of neighboring localities.
2397480	2400480	This atlas is a most impressive achievement
2400480	2404480	at one branch of the science of linguistics, Dr. L.
2404480	2406480	It may be linguistics, it may be impressive,
2406480	2408480	it may even be an achievement in one branch,
2408480	2411480	but don't try to convince me that it's a science.
2411480	2414480	A science is test tubes, telescopes,
2414480	2417480	microscopes, and chromium-plated machines.
2417480	2420480	Actually, linguistics has its own share of hardware.
2420480	2421480	Hardware?
2421480	2424480	Yes, that's what scientists call their machines.
2424480	2426480	Before you can build a piece of hardware,
2426480	2429480	you have to know exactly what you want it to do.
2429480	2434480	That calls for research, imagination, would you please?
2437480	2441480	The kind of imagination that led to Bell's telephone.
2442480	2445480	To Edison's phonograph.
2446480	2449480	To Marconi's wireless.
2449480	2453480	And to the first all-talking picture.
2453480	2455480	Didn't movies always talk?
2455480	2458480	No, Judy, when I was your age, films were silent.
2460480	2462480	How do movies talk?
2462480	2465480	Well, only along the side of our film is the soundtrack.
2465480	2468480	I wonder whatever it looks like.
2468480	2471480	Well, we might ask the soundtrack to move in a bit.
2474480	2476480	Is that what makes a picture talk?
2476480	2479480	It's just a routine matter of technology.
2479480	2483480	Routine matter of technology, indeed.
2483480	2486480	You surely wouldn't make light of the magic of physics,
2486480	2490480	converting sound into electrical impulses.
2490480	2495480	Why, electronic machines are nothing short of miraculous.
2495480	2497480	You'll see.
2499480	2505480	Example, the sound spectrograph turns speech into pictures.
2505480	2509480	First, the scientist speaks into the machine.
2509480	2512480	Never kill a snake with your bare hands.
2512480	2515480	It is impressive, but what is it doing?
2515480	2519480	The machine separates all sounds into two things,
2519480	2521480	pitch and loudness.
2521480	2524480	The phrase, never kill a snake with your bare hands,
2524480	2527480	comes out looking like this.
2527480	2529480	Is it a new kind of alphabet?
2529480	2532480	Looks more like a fuzzy kind of shorthand.
2532480	2535480	These patterns of light show pitch and loudness
2535480	2537480	in each instant of sound.
2537480	2539480	That gave the scientist an idea.
2539480	2542480	Why not just create speech artificially
2542480	2545480	by painting these patterns on clear plastic with a brush?
2545480	2547480	And when they feed this hand-painted speech
2547480	2551480	into the playback machine, here's how it sounds.
2551480	2555480	Never kill a snake with your bare hands.
2555480	2556480	It talks by hand.
2556480	2559480	Yes, the sound spectrograph allows linguistic scientists
2559480	2562480	to make very rapid studies of speech sounds.
2562480	2565480	And among other things, some deaf people
2565480	2567480	have been taught to see speech.
2567480	2572480	For example, they learn to recognize this pattern as five.
2572480	2574480	They hear with their eyes.
2574480	2578480	Precisely, they see pictures of speech.
2578480	2581480	Oh, we've got machines that talk to man
2581480	2584480	and even machines that can listen.
2584480	2588480	Audrey, that's a machine that listens to spoken numbers
2588480	2591480	like a telephone operator and obeys orders.
2591480	2593480	Four.
2593480	2595480	Four.
2595480	2599480	Yes, Audrey, the automatic digit recognizer
2599480	2602480	can identify numbers spoken into a telephone.
2602480	2605480	And how about the voice typewriter?
2605480	2609480	He takes dictation and types words as they are spoken.
2609480	2611480	See.
2613480	2618480	You read it.
2618480	2621480	It's like a secretary who never makes a mistake.
2621480	2624480	No, they're easily confused by different voices
2624480	2626480	and different accents.
2626480	2628480	Voice typewriters are still pretty crude.
2628480	2632480	What about machines that talk to each other?
2632480	2635480	Yes, electronic computing machines
2635480	2637480	can transmit data to each other
2637480	2639480	over ordinary telephone circuits.
2639480	2641480	Those machines will soon learn that it's a lot easier
2641480	2643480	to get into this talking business
2643480	2644480	than it is to get out of it.
2644480	2646480	Out of it.
2646480	2649480	I never dreamed machines could be so smart.
2649480	2651480	I'd have a tea party conversation with a machine.
2651480	2654480	I'm afraid you find the conversation rather dull.
2654480	2658480	You see, Judy, machines have no minds of their own.
2658480	2660480	I thought they had electronic brains.
2660480	2663480	It's the brain of man that tells them what to do.
2663480	2666480	I give up you and your scientific attitude.
2666480	2669480	Magic is just matter of fact to you.
2669480	2674480	Every miracle has to have its qualifications, reservations, footnotes.
2674480	2677480	Goodbye.
2677480	2680480	I hope the soundtrack didn't go away mad.
2680480	2682480	Soundtrack's an impetuous fellow.
2682480	2685480	He was in such a hurry, he neglected to even mention
2685480	2688480	an automatic translator.
2688480	2690480	You see, Judy, for a long time now,
2690480	2693480	scientists have been working toward the realization of machines
2693480	2696480	that will translate one language into another.
2696480	2698480	Here's a machine that's helping them.
2698480	2700480	It's called the Johnny Act.
2700480	2703480	Machine translation will need a dictionary and a grammar book,
2703480	2714480	a plan of the language, designed for the machines to use.
2714480	2716480	There's still a lot to be done, though.
2716480	2719480	One of the linguistic scientists working on the problem
2719480	2721480	is Professor Kenneth Harper.
2722480	2725480	His students from the University of California at Los Angeles
2725480	2726480	are also helping.
2726480	2728480	Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a machine
2728480	2730480	that could translate languages
2730480	2733480	so that everybody could understand everybody else?
2733480	2736480	Yes, Judy, it would, unfortunately.
2736480	2739480	Translating words from one language to another
2739480	2741480	is not the same as understanding that language.
2741480	2743480	But if we knew what the words meant...
2743480	2746480	Well, word for word translation
2746480	2748480	can never quite communicate to us
2748480	2750480	the thinking, the overtones
2750480	2753480	that convey true meaning in any language.
2753480	2755480	A linguistic scientist, by finding new ways
2755480	2757480	of teaching other languages
2757480	2759480	and making them easier to learn,
2759480	2762480	are helping us to break down old barriers.
2763480	2765480	Judy, differences in language
2765480	2767480	have been one of the greatest barriers
2767480	2769480	to a meeting of minds among men.
2769480	2772480	One expression of the desire for greater understanding
2772480	2774480	is the United Nations.
2779480	2783480	As Tertullian of Carthage in 200 A.D. wrote,
2783480	2787480	Man is the one name belonging to every nation on Earth.
2787480	2790480	There is one soul and many tongues,
2790480	2793480	one spirit and many sounds.
2793480	2795480	Every country has its own speech,
2795480	2799480	but the subjects of speech are common to all.
2799480	2802480	Yes, the subjects of speech.
2802480	2805480	Day-to-day talk.
2806480	2809480	The chatter of small talk.
2809480	2812480	The exchange of pleasantries, news.
2814480	2816480	Gossip.
2817480	2820480	Conversation among friends.
2820480	2823480	And with strangers who speak different languages,
2823480	2826480	but find ways of understanding each other.
2829480	2831480	Language and speech.
2831480	2833480	The basis for communication.
2833480	2835480	Tools for learning.
2835480	2838480	For broadening horizons of the mind.
2838480	2840480	For developing new ideas.
2840480	2842480	For exchanging knowledge.
2842480	2845480	Exploring new frontiers of science.
2846480	2848480	Gift of speech.
2848480	2851480	A universal quality that links each man
2851480	2853480	to the world of men.
2853480	2855480	Language, the pattern of speech,
2855480	2857480	may one day be the instrument
2857480	2859480	that will bring compatibility
2859480	2862480	and understanding to human beings everywhere.
2864480	2866480	Music
2885480	2887480	Soon I shall be immortalized
2887480	2890480	as the man who freed people from words.
2890480	2893480	But you're already immortal, huh?
2893480	2896480	Even if your alphabet conspiracy succeeds
2896480	2898480	and you destroy the books,
2898480	2901480	you mad hatter and you too, Jabberwock,
2901480	2904480	will always live on in the minds of men.
2904480	2907480	It's because they were created out of words.
2907480	2910480	Yet you're both very alive to me.
2910480	2913480	Well, I'm very alive to myself.
2913480	2916480	And so are you, Jabber.
2916480	2919480	I'm beginning to feel it.
2919480	2921480	Immortality.
2921480	2923480	Come on, Jabber.
2923480	2926480	I believe Alice is expecting us.
2926480	2928480	Music
2950480	2952480	Music
2960480	2962480	Music
2970480	2972480	Hello there, Judy.
2972480	2974480	Having trouble with your homework?
2976480	2978480	You see, there's so much I don't understand.
2978480	2991920	much I don't understand and I'd like to understand. Perhaps I can help. Just as men
2991920	2998120	of science explore the atom, the gene, the universe, so also do they study the
2998120	3005720	living breath of human speech, expressing the needs, affections, joys, hopes,
3005720	3012440	tragedy. They act the very spirit of men's deepest nature.
3035720	3049640	The Bell system is grateful to the many distinguished scientists who helped to
3049640	3054880	prepare this story of language. Our thanks to the special advisors who supplied
3054880	3059160	and checked the scientific material for this program. Our thanks also to the
3059160	3063800	advisory board which reviews the scientific aspects of these programs.
3063800	3070000	Its members represent the broad range of men science including biology and
3070000	3082160	genetics, medicine, bacteriology and botany, chemistry, geophysics, physics,
3082160	3095680	anthropology, electronics and acoustics, mathematics, engineering. To all these men
3095680	3100920	and to many institutions, the Bell system is embedded for the support they
3100920	3106720	have given this venture in education through entertainment.
3112160	3114980	you
