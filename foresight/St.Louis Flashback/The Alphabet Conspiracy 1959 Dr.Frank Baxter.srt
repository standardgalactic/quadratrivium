1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
Which is the story of man, for the thoughts, the aspirations, the affections of long generations

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:18,280
of humanity are woven into the fabric of human speech.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:26,920
That's the way it begins, the story of language all over the world, sounds of human speech

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,640
like the very air we breathe, or something most of us take just for granted.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
When did you hide the paper?

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,320
Now David, you read right up the stairs and watch, and don't forget to brush your teeth.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,480
You'd hardly think of our everyday speech as being a specimen for scientists to take

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:52,040
apart piece by piece, to study, to analyze, but this is a science, a science of linguistics.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,080
There are perhaps many ways to tell this story.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,480
We've chosen to tell it through the imagination of the young lady who lives in this house.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Now as you will see, she's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
might call it...

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:16,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:56,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:16,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:36,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:56,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

18
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:16,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

19
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:36,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

20
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:56,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

21
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:16,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

22
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:36,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

23
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:56,480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

24
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Why do you take care of the capital, I suppose? You may take care of the little ones.

25
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Hello, Judy!

26
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Who's he?

27
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
He's a professor of linguistics.

28
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Linguistic?

29
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Well, Judy, what are you doing?

30
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
We're going to do away with the alphabet.

31
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Then I can murder the language.

32
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Which one? There are at least 5,000 different languages in the world.

33
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,480
There are a few of the dictionaries. Where would you like to start?

34
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,480
What do you do? Speak all kinds of languages?

35
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
He does just speak them. He's a scientist of language.

36
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
A science of language?

37
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh, yes. He studies the insides of language. Sounds and words and alphabets.

38
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Alphabets? Is he for them or against them?

39
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Well, there's some things to be said in favor of alphabets.

40
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Name one. The alphabet is the basis of writing for one.

41
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Then let's get the man who invented the alphabet.

42
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Yes, I'd like to meet him.

43
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm afraid that would be a bit difficult, because people have been writing for 5 or 6,000 years.

44
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Well, that's centuries.

45
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Yes, Judy, it is. The people have been talking for a long time.

46
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,480
If this ruler represents the time man has been talking, he's been writing only this long.

47
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,480
But even today, in many areas of the earth, large numbers of people, millions of them, still get along without writing.

48
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Hope they get along. Why should they buy good news?

49
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Well, they can't learn to write most of them because they have no alphabet.

50
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
No alphabet.

51
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,480
But as civilization began to spread over the earth, people realized spoken language alone has its limits.

52
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
They were learning so much they couldn't remember at all.

53
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
You might say, Judy, that's why writing was invented.

54
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Then that must be why we have whole libraries full of books,

55
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,480
because people want to write down for other people what they've gotten, what they did.

56
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Pity. People were talking to each other long before there was anything like civilization.

57
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Scientists don't know exactly how it all got started.

58
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,480
But once on the move, speech grew like a great tree, with branches joining at limbs,

59
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,480
branches growing out of other branches, branches running up into twigs.

60
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Each a spoken language that was the source of still other languages,

61
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,480
and each changing as it went along and developed until the end of time.

62
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Even now, languages are continually changing.

63
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,480
New ones springing from old ones, sometimes several from a single source.

64
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Latin was very important, wasn't it?

65
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Oh, yes, it certainly was.

66
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,480
What we call the romance languages are branched off from the great trunk of Latin.

67
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
There's Italian, Sardinian, and Latin.

68
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
And there's Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin.

69
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,480
It's branched off from the great trunk of Latin.

70
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:22,480
There's Italian, Sardinian, Spanish and Portuguese, Dalmatian and Romanian,

71
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Catalan and French ProvenÃ§al, Rito Romance.

72
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
And if you listen, you'll hear a certain similarity.

73
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Padre?

74
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Yes.

75
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Papa?

76
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Papa?

77
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Papa?

78
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Well, did talk something right?

79
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Well, Judy, would you be interested to know?

80
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,480
At a certain time of their lives, babies all over the world speak the same language.

81
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Oh, just a moment.

82
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I know better than that.

83
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,480
What about Chinese babies and Indian babies, German babies, French babies and American babies?

84
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Well, now just listen to the language that all those babies speak.

85
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Now, here's a typical baby.

86
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Is it just from that young talk?

87
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,480
All babies in the world have the same, well, baby language to start with.

88
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
The same babbling, if you like.

89
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
But this babbling includes the sounds needed to make any language.

90
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
I didn't think baby talk really meant anything.

91
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Oh, baby babbling is very important.

92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,480
When a baby first comes into the world, the speech areas of his brain are like a clean slate

93
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,480
ready to be written upon from the very moment of birth.

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,480
With every sound a baby makes he is producing, you might almost say practicing the basic sounds of speech.

95
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Then he learns to talk just by practicing.

96
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Not entirely.

97
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Through the first year, the child listens to his parents and copies as closely as he can what he hears,

98
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
winning their approval when he makes the right sounds.

99
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Then the sounds begin to take shape.

100
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
And by the age of six, the speech pattern is complete.

101
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
It's Daddy!

102
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Hello, Daddy.

103
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Babies all start with the same sounds and then they just keep the ones that fit their language.

104
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I think I'll make a note of that.

105
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
You might also make a note that we have a conspiracy to get out of here.

106
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Shall we go?

107
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Oh, yes, that conspiracy to do away with the alphabet.

108
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
May I ask a question?

109
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
What is it?

110
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Why do you want to get rid of the alphabet?

111
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
It's language we're after, really.

112
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,480
And the letters of the alphabet are the building blocks of language.

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
That's a beautiful statement.

114
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Thank you, Judy.

115
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Very well put for hardly scientific professional jealousy.

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,480
If I wanted to do away with language, what I would go after would be sounds,

117
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
because sounds are the basis of any language.

118
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Sounds.

119
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Make a note of that.

120
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I suppose the next thing you're going to say is there's a science of sound.

121
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.

122
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,480
For a long time, scientists have been curious about how our human sounds are actually made.

123
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,480
In the course of such a study, Professor Wolfgang von Kempelen invented the world's first talking machine.

124
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Make a note again from Kempelen.

125
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
That was in the 18th century, around 1780.

126
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Cross him off with too late.

127
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Here's a drawing of von Kempelen's machine when the professor completed it.

128
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,480
I wouldn't even know how to begin to build a talking machine.

129
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
What are you doing, Judy?

130
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm trying to imagine how the professor could get it all out.

131
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Before a talking machine could be built,

132
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,480
the professor had to do a scientific study of just how the human speech mechanism works.

133
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Lungs, vocal cords, mouth, palate, nasal cavities.

134
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:18,480
For speech, you need air.

135
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
The chest muscles, acting as a bellows,

136
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,480
operate to fill our internal bagpipe, the lungs, with air.

137
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Next, you need a noise.

138
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Read from a bagpipe. That will do.

139
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Now we build the machine.

140
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,480
While our friend is busy, let's look at some recent motion pictures of the human vocal cords in action.

141
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,480
These films were made by the Gould Foundation Voice Research Laboratory at North Thames.

142
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,480
You see, human noise is produced by the vocal cords.

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,480
In case in the larynx or Adam's apple, air from the lungs is released through a space between the cords,

144
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
causing them to flap apart and slap together.

145
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
These vibrations set up sound waves.

146
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Now by slowing down the action with high-speed photography,

147
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,480
we can see that the pitch of sound is varied by tightening or relaxing the pull on the vocal cords.

148
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Tightening them raises the pitch.

149
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Relaxing them lowers it.

150
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Effective as they are, the vocal cords are only the source of noise.

151
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,480
It's the rest of the speech mechanism that shapes the sound into meaningful words.

152
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Now what the professor had to understand to make his machine work

153
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,480
was precisely how the tongue, teeth, lips, and so forth operate.

154
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:05,480
A-E-O-Vowels.

155
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
And now, consonants.

156
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,480
B-B-B-Z-N.

157
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,480
The breath explodes, it buzzes, it hums.

158
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,480
The machine is finished.

159
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,480
And now, demonstration.

160
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:38,480
That's for my me.

161
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Why, the machine spoke French. Did you all my friends?

162
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Fun Campbell's machine was quite remarkable for 1780,

163
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,480
for it was the world's first successful talking machine.

164
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Scientists today have the benefit of techniques undreamed of in von Kempelten's time.

165
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
In these x-ray films of the human speech mechanism in action,

166
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
you can see the tongue and lips assuming various positions

167
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
to form cavities that modify the sound by resonance.

168
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?

169
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,480
The sound of the different vowels depends on the height to which the tongue is raised in the mouth.

170
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,480
High, mid, or low.

171
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,480
It also depends on the position of the tongue in the front or back of the mouth.

172
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Consonants are shaped by tongue, lips, teeth.

173
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?

174
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
This has been very educational, Jabba. We don't have to bother with the alphabet.

175
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,480
All we've got to do is get rid of those vowels and consonants and our job is done.

176
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,480
I hate to disappoint you, fellas, with what really come out of the human speech mechanism are phonemes.

177
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,480
P-H-O-N-E-M-E-S phonemes.

178
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
The basic sounds of speech.

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Don't even make a note of that, Judy. He's just trying to throw us off the track.

180
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Come on, Jabba. We've got plans to make.

181
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,480
It is confusing. I guess I better ask you. What is a phoneme?

182
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Phoneme is a sound.

183
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Like A, B, C?

184
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
No, they're letters of the alphabet. They're units of writing.

185
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,480
No alphabet for any language truly represents the sounds of that language.

186
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Let me borrow your pad.

187
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Sit down. I'll show you.

188
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Now, let's take this word.

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Either?

190
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Now, this word has five phonemes.

191
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
If I say it slowly,

192
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,480
D-E-N-E-R,

193
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
you can hear the five parts.

194
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Some people say either.

195
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
Can you say either, either, or either?

196
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Either, either, or either.

197
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,480
As your friend the Hatter has already said, the alphabet can be very confusing.

198
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Different pronunciations are sometimes spelled in the same way.

199
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
That's why scientists had to develop more accurate symbols.

200
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Now, in phonemes, either is written this way.

201
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:23,480
D-E-N-E-R.

202
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
And either is written like this.

203
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:34,480
A-E-R.

204
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
The difference is the first little phonemes.

205
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Now, scientists such as Ferdinand de Soussure in France

206
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,480
discovered that out of the thousands of speech sounds a human being can make,

207
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
each language has picked its own set of phonemes.

208
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,480
English, for instance, has 45.

209
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,480
The most little phoneme sounds must really be the building blocks of language.

210
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I'd better make a note of that for the Hatter.

211
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
But for myself, I'd better just stick to the alphabet.

212
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
We have a proposal.

213
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,480
If we can prove that it's possible to communicate without words to say nothing of phonemes,

214
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,480
will you give up your linguistic obsession and join our conspiracy?

215
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Science is always open to experimental evidence.

216
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Good.

217
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:39,480
One, two, buckle my shoe.

218
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Three, four, shut the door.

219
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Five, I understood you perfectly.

220
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
If we can win over science, the alphabet is good as dead.

221
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Well, Dr. Linguistic, do you concede that we have made a point?

222
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Yes, indeed.

223
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,480
As a matter of fact, I think we can substantiate your point further.

224
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I think you'll find this very interesting.

225
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Science.

226
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,480
This is one of the Canary Islands, La Gomera, off the west coast of North Africa,

227
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
a land of rugged terrain.

228
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,480
In the sparsely populated areas, people found it difficult to communicate with one another

229
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
across the deep gorges.

230
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,480
So go, the Gomeras contrived an extraordinary form of telephonic speech, whistling,

231
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:58,480
which can be understood over a distance of frequencies in pitch.

232
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
This whistling language is of great interest to linguistic scientists

233
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,480
because it makes use of only one feature of normal speech, pitch.

234
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,480
It does with all the variations of tone quality that Professor von Kemplen was so concerned about.

235
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Now, whereas this canary, another ingenious form of language, was invented in the North American plains.

236
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Indian Sign Language.

237
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,480
When tribes met on the trail, hunted buffalo together, or met in council,

238
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
it wasn't time enough to learn one another's spoken language, so they used Sign of Washington.

239
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:42,480
The white soldiers told the Indians, beside the river, called the Lodgepole River.

240
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Before the snow, there'd be no more fighting, and that made all the Indians very happy.

241
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Excuse me, Frinterit.

242
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I was just wondering how the Indians managed to talk with their hands in the dark.

243
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Well, they couldn't, Judy. As you can see, all of these methods

244
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,480
giving man limitless possibilities for expressing his ideas, his concepts of science and technology,

245
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:23,480
his day-by-day thoughts, his feelings, his emotions, love.

246
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Don't be taken by those scientific sophistries. Do animals have alphabets? Do they have words?

247
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,480
And animals can, without any words at all, quote, communicate from the moment of birth.

248
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
And they've got no words without any words at all, haven't they?

249
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Oh, yes, indeed. That's the would-you-hollows-please-applies.

250
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Now, look.

251
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
There's a crow.

252
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
When man invades the forest, he's the first to shout, beat it.

253
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,480
And all the other birds, animals, pass on the alarm.

254
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Not only birds and animals get along without words, but insects as well.

255
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
The most incredible of all is the dance of the honeybee.

256
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,480
When a worker bee finds a flower full of nectar, it flops.

257
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
This urgent message is communicated by performing a dance.

258
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,480
The pattern of the dance indicates the direction of the flowers in relation to the sun.

259
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,480
The speed of the dance tells the distance from the hive.

260
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
The other bees all take notice.

261
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,480
They touch the dancer where they discover the scent of the flowers.

262
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Then they all fly out to the source of the nectar.

263
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Animals and insects have many ingenious ways of communicating.

264
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Sound, smells, with motion.

265
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,480
We find in all this communication that the animal mind operates almost automatically.

266
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,480
It receives messages from the outside through its sense organs and reacts instinctively.

267
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Hello. Hello.

268
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Why, Jabber, that's very good. You're improving.

269
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Hello.

270
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Oh, it was the parrot.

271
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Beware the jab-bub talking bird.

272
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,480
But parrots just imitate what people say.

273
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Yes, that's because they are not able to associate a given sound or word with a specific meaning.

274
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,480
It's curious, though, that they sound like people.

275
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Some animals, such as apes, do have a larynx and the rest of our vocal apparatus.

276
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,480
The speech mechanism of the chimpanzee is the closest to that of a human being.

277
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Will you please?

278
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Research psychologist Dr. Keith Hayes and his wife raised a chimp named Vicki.

279
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,480
After constant training, Vicki had learned to speak only three human words by the time she was three years old.

280
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Like human babies, she babbled at first.

281
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Later, she was rewarded when she made the right sound.

282
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.

283
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,480
The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.

284
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.

285
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Now who am I? Papa? Papa?

286
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Papa? Papa?

287
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
You say whether she was rewarded when she made the right sound.

288
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.

289
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,480
The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.

290
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.

291
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Now who am I? Papa? Papa?

292
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
You say what this is?

293
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,480
By the age of six, Vicki's spoken vocabulary consisted of seven words.

294
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Whereas human children are using hundreds of words by the time they're only two years old.

295
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Chimpanzees, orangutans, and other mammals may have larynxes in the rest of the speech mechanism,

296
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,480
but it takes more than that. It takes brain power.

297
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Well, for the present, we must conclude that man is the only one of Earth's creatures with true language.

298
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Because the animals can't manage to combine their cries, calls, their signals,

299
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,480
form the infinite variety of meaning that we achieve when we arrange words and sounds into sentences.

300
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,480
So, Judy, shouldn't surprise you that some people have argued

301
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,480
that what distinguishes man from beast is grammar.

302
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I knew it, I knew it. I suspected it from the moment he started building up this so-called

303
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
science of linguistics, and all these pretentious words are just a cover-up from grammar.

304
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,480
So, Judy, the sooner we get on with our conspiracy, the sooner we get rid of grammar.

305
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,480
It would be a lovely world without subjects and predicates and split infinitives and the conjugation of verbs.

306
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
But, Judy, grammar isn't just a bunch of rules.

307
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I know. It's the building blocks of language.

308
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
No, it's more like the architect's plan for the building.

309
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Well, if you'll pardon me, Professor, I've got some plans for that plan.

310
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Then grammar is the plan of how we talk. It sounds important, but rather hard to understand.

311
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Judy, it's simply this. The way words are arranged into sentences is as important a meaning as the separate words themselves.

312
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Judy, did you know that your brain was unconsciously using grammar long before you started the school?

313
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,480
You mean my head's been full of subjects and predicates, and I didn't even know it.

314
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Yes, of course. Have you ever tried to make your mind completely blank?

315
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,480
You can. If your mind goes on talking to itself and in language, that's what we call thinking.

316
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,480
For language puts not only words into our mouths, but into our heads, too.

317
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Well, that's another trouble with words. Maybe the header is right.

318
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Oh, but Judy, before you go, let me say that words themselves aren't to blame.

319
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,480
They were developed through the ages to express the vital experiences of people everywhere.

320
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,480
In a sense, people live in different worlds, worlds reflected in their languages.

321
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,480
We could understand these many languages. We might hear the people say,

322
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,480
We Eskimo must live with snow. It shapes our lives. We have a dozen special words to tell about snow.

323
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,480
It's far too important to be dismissed with one word.

324
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,480
To us, living in the Trobriam Islands, our very existence depend on raising our crops.

325
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
We have more than a hundred names for yams.

326
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Arabic gives us more than 6,000 different words for camel, its parts and equipment.

327
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,480
When language expresses our various ways of life, it is indeed our servant.

328
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Some scholars have wondered if language is not at times our master.

329
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,480
People use words. Do words use people?

330
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,480
In most of the Oriental world, our various social classes speak one to the other in traditional ways.

331
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Does our language then determine our behavior, dictating for each person the way in which he acts towards his equals,

332
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,480
his inferiors, his superiors?

333
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Our Hopi language has no grammatical way to express past, present or future.

334
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:54,480
So far as our language is concerned, one might conclude that the world is without time altogether.

335
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Scientists too are pondering such questions. Does our language shape our whole philosophy of life?

336
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Is it true that some ideas that are clear in one language may be very difficult to say?

337
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Maybe even difficult to think in another language.

338
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Even so-called primitive peoples have developed languages that admirably express their cultures, their ways of life.

339
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,480
But scientists have discovered that there are no primitive languages on the face of the earth.

340
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,480
These languages used with ease by the crudest savages are just as complex as other tongues.

341
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,480
In fact, it sometimes requires the lifetime study of our greatest scholars to figure them out.

342
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Anthropologists like France Boas, who pioneered in American Indian languages, sought to discover in each language its own system.

343
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Following Boas, Leonard Bloomfield began collecting materials on American Indian languages.

344
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,480
By this and other work, he set the stage for modern descriptive linguistics.

345
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Others, such as Edward Sapir, an expert on many Indian tongues, studied languages as related to cultures and total ways of life.

346
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,480
All the languages now being spoken, only a few have been studied scientifically.

347
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:20,480
And today, linguistic scientists all over the world are concentrating upon small speech communities that are rapidly dying out

348
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,480
to prevent their languages from being forever lost to the study of man.

349
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,480
As we understand each new language, we learn more about the way human beings communicate with one another.

350
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Oh, look! There's an envelope. I think there's a letter inside. It's an invitation.

351
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Matt Hatter says we're invited to a mad tea party. He's going to prove that language is madness.

352
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,480
And the guest of honor is to be Dr. Linguistics.

353
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,480
A fish, whiffle, gyre, and gimbal. It'll be right over.

354
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,480
My goodness. Tea and linguistics. What a curious combination.

355
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
The mad tea party is about to commence.

356
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Who's coming?

357
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Well, I've invited a cowboy from the southwest to theatrical publicity, ma'am, and some other guests.

358
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
How do you do, Shorty?

359
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Scammy, ma'am.

360
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Judy, this is Shorty Rogers, famous jazz trumpeter and composer.

361
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Hey there, Judy.

362
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
How do you do?

363
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Crazy.

364
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Shorty, you're going to meet a very distinguished professor of linguistics.

365
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Is this cap tool square or way out?

366
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Well, I'm not sure that I follow you, but this should prove a very amusing encounter.

367
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
They won't understand each other at all.

368
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Shorty, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the very distinguished Dr. Linguistics.

369
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Doctor, this is Shorty Rogers.

370
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance, Doctor.

371
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Scammy, ma'am.

372
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Ma'am, you're really weathered. What's the bet here?

373
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Well, a hat here's been trying to bug me on this ABC jazz.

374
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Crazy made the scene, ma'am. Crazy.

375
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Hey, you're a real live aspirin.

376
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Well, I have to split now. So long.

377
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Keep cool.

378
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,480
They seem to understand each other, but I couldn't.

379
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Mimsie, too. Me either.

380
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Well, waitly meets my next guest.

381
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Oh, Doctor L, I'd like you to meet a theatrical publicity man.

382
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
How do you do?

383
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Hi. Looks as if you already have a story.

384
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Yep. Here's my lead.

385
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Tongue's wag is wag's gag, but hot hat cools as Doc clicks on rhetoric tricks.

386
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Well, that's just about ball points the hat's check.

387
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Like a fat bat.

388
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Well, I gotta run now, Doc. This batch is a bop.

389
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Some sock yawks packed them at Flax Cracks.

390
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Flax Cracks ban just next to me.

391
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
You're right. They do understand each other.

392
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Perhaps this next guest will confuse him.

393
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Enjoying yourself?

394
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Well, now, I don't want to sound like I've raised on sour milk,

395
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,480
but I just can't drink enough of this yellow gargoyle to get a token load.

396
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
You see, these dunes give me broke fever.

397
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I get my spurs all tangled and I'm just playing old hog tide

398
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,480
when it comes to making chin music with a pack of strangers.

399
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Well, Doctor Linguist...

400
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Well, Doctor Linguist, it's...

401
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Well, it was all quite simple.

402
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
He said he wasn't mouthy.

403
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
He's fresh out of the tongue oil.

404
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
This wing ding shortens his stake rope,

405
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
makes him feel like he's got his leg tied up.

406
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Say, partner, you sat at my lingo.

407
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
You'll do to ride the river with.

408
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Well, I gotta roll my wheels.

409
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Long, Doc.

410
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,480
So long, amigo.

411
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Him and me is made of the same leather.

412
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Well, so much for linguistics.

413
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Now, do let us have some tea.

414
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Judy, after that variety of verbal vocalizing,

415
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,480
surely you would agree that language is a mixed up mix.

416
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,480
But Doctor Linguist didn't seem to think the tea party was so mad.

417
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,480
No, actually, I thought it was quite sensible.

418
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
With everyone speaking a different language.

419
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Different dialect, if you please.

420
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Now, these dialects and occupational vocabularies

421
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
are what make any language interesting, colorful.

422
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
They're part of our humor.

423
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,480
But they're also the subject of scholarly research.

424
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Well, Doctor Linguist, I'm afraid that you and I

425
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,480
are not made of the same leather.

426
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Well, thanks for the tea and linguistics.

427
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,480
It was very pleasant.

428
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Judy, did you care to join me in a little research project

429
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,480
in American dialect geography?

430
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
The way a man talks tells us where he comes from.

431
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Like in Brooklyn. Some people call a bird a blight.

432
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Yes, it's not only what people say,

433
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
it's the way they say it that gives us clues

434
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
where they were brought up.

435
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Clues. That sounds like a mystery.

436
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
It is, rather.

437
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,480
You could look at it as a kind of detective story.

438
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
First, we'll need a suspect.

439
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
And a private eye.

440
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Let's make it two.

441
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Now, for the last time, are you going to tell us where you're from?

442
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Oh, you won't, eh?

443
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Well, we have ways of finding out.

444
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
Read this.

445
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Mary, Mary, Mary.

446
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Aha!

447
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
West of the Alleghenes, they pronounce the words alike.

448
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
He pronounces them all differently.

449
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Yeah, that's right.

450
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Clue number one puts him east of the Alleghenes.

451
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,480
All right now, read this.

452
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.

453
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Gleasy.

454
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Hear that? He said greasy, not greasy.

455
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,480
That puts you north of Philadelphia.

456
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Ha! Read this.

457
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Park.

458
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
He said park, not park.

459
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

460
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
That eliminates coastal New England.

461
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Read.

462
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Wash, water.

463
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Hear that? Not wash and water,

464
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,480
but wash and water.

465
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
The rest of New England is out.

466
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Must be Central Atlantic states and where.

467
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Father.

468
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Father? That senses him.

469
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'll put him within a 30-mile radius of Times Square.

470
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Right?

471
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Yeah.

472
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
That's right.

473
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
What a amusing parlor game, Dr. Linguisty.

474
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Something like 20 questions.

475
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Well, a dialect geographer using a list of only 30 words

476
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,480
can usually place a person within 20 miles of his home locality

477
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,480
so long as he lives in the eastern part of the United States.

478
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Dialect geographers began charting their monumental linguistic atlas

479
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
in the east in 1929

480
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,480
and have been painstakingly working their way to the west.

481
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Dr. Hans Kurath of the University of Michigan

482
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
has conducted a good part of this research.

483
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,480
He and his dialect experts are traveling around the country

484
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
for the past 25 years,

485
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
asking people what words they use for all sorts of things.

486
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
They've recorded dialect differences in words

487
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
and how they're pronounced.

488
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Perhaps Dr. Kurath will show us how the atlas is put together.

489
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Well, you see, the atlas contains hundreds of maps showing speech differences

490
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,480
and their geographical boundaries, which we call isoglosses.

491
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,480
May I show you a few examples?

492
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:44,480
This isogloss sets off the area in which riddle cakes are called fritter.

493
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,480
This here around Philadelphia shows the area where they call them hotcakes.

494
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Over here they're called flannertakes to the south of it, batter cakes.

495
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:05,480
It is on the basis of isoglosses like these that we establish the dialect ban.

496
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Thank you, Dr. Kurath.

497
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Man takes his speech ways with him wherever he goes.

498
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,480
As the dialects flowed westward the way our population did,

499
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,480
the strands unraveled and began to overlap.

500
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Here's how they traveled.

501
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Western New England accents,

502
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,480
coast speech,

503
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
southern mountain accents,

504
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
plantation speech,

505
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Texas accents,

506
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,480
but down east talk in the state of Maine has stayed put.

507
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,480
This research has revealed the paths people have taken

508
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,480
when they migrated from one part of the country to another,

509
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,480
shown the changes going on in American speech patterns.

510
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,480
This research has unearthed hitherto unrecorded dialects.

511
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,480
There's also marked off areas where big cities have influenced

512
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,480
the speech ways of neighboring localities.

513
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,480
This atlas is a most impressive achievement

514
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,480
at one branch of the science of linguistics, Dr. L.

515
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
It may be linguistics, it may be impressive,

516
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
it may even be an achievement in one branch,

517
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
but don't try to convince me that it's a science.

518
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,480
A science is test tubes, telescopes,

519
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
microscopes, and chromium-plated machines.

520
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Actually, linguistics has its own share of hardware.

521
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Hardware?

522
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Yes, that's what scientists call their machines.

523
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Before you can build a piece of hardware,

524
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,480
you have to know exactly what you want it to do.

525
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,480
That calls for research, imagination, would you please?

526
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,480
The kind of imagination that led to Bell's telephone.

527
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,480
To Edison's phonograph.

528
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,480
To Marconi's wireless.

529
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,480
And to the first all-talking picture.

530
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Didn't movies always talk?

531
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,480
No, Judy, when I was your age, films were silent.

532
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
How do movies talk?

533
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Well, only along the side of our film is the soundtrack.

534
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I wonder whatever it looks like.

535
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Well, we might ask the soundtrack to move in a bit.

536
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Is that what makes a picture talk?

537
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,480
It's just a routine matter of technology.

538
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Routine matter of technology, indeed.

539
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,480
You surely wouldn't make light of the magic of physics,

540
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,480
converting sound into electrical impulses.

541
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Why, electronic machines are nothing short of miraculous.

542
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
You'll see.

543
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Example, the sound spectrograph turns speech into pictures.

544
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,480
First, the scientist speaks into the machine.

545
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Never kill a snake with your bare hands.

546
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
It is impressive, but what is it doing?

547
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,480
The machine separates all sounds into two things,

548
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
pitch and loudness.

549
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,480
The phrase, never kill a snake with your bare hands,

550
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
comes out looking like this.

551
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Is it a new kind of alphabet?

552
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,480
Looks more like a fuzzy kind of shorthand.

553
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,480
These patterns of light show pitch and loudness

554
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
in each instant of sound.

555
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
That gave the scientist an idea.

556
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Why not just create speech artificially

557
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,480
by painting these patterns on clear plastic with a brush?

558
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
And when they feed this hand-painted speech

559
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
into the playback machine, here's how it sounds.

560
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Never kill a snake with your bare hands.

561
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
It talks by hand.

562
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Yes, the sound spectrograph allows linguistic scientists

563
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,480
to make very rapid studies of speech sounds.

564
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,480
And among other things, some deaf people

565
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
have been taught to see speech.

566
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,480
For example, they learn to recognize this pattern as five.

567
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
They hear with their eyes.

568
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Precisely, they see pictures of speech.

569
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Oh, we've got machines that talk to man

570
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,480
and even machines that can listen.

571
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Audrey, that's a machine that listens to spoken numbers

572
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,480
like a telephone operator and obeys orders.

573
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Four.

574
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Four.

575
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Yes, Audrey, the automatic digit recognizer

576
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,480
can identify numbers spoken into a telephone.

577
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,480
And how about the voice typewriter?

578
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,480
He takes dictation and types words as they are spoken.

579
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
See.

580
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,480
You read it.

581
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,480
It's like a secretary who never makes a mistake.

582
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,480
No, they're easily confused by different voices

583
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
and different accents.

584
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Voice typewriters are still pretty crude.

585
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,480
What about machines that talk to each other?

586
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Yes, electronic computing machines

587
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
can transmit data to each other

588
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,480
over ordinary telephone circuits.

589
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Those machines will soon learn that it's a lot easier

590
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
to get into this talking business

591
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
than it is to get out of it.

592
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
Out of it.

593
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I never dreamed machines could be so smart.

594
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I'd have a tea party conversation with a machine.

595
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I'm afraid you find the conversation rather dull.

596
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,480
You see, Judy, machines have no minds of their own.

597
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
I thought they had electronic brains.

598
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
It's the brain of man that tells them what to do.

599
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I give up you and your scientific attitude.

600
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
Magic is just matter of fact to you.

601
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Every miracle has to have its qualifications, reservations, footnotes.

602
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Goodbye.

603
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,480
I hope the soundtrack didn't go away mad.

604
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Soundtrack's an impetuous fellow.

605
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,480
He was in such a hurry, he neglected to even mention

606
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
an automatic translator.

607
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
You see, Judy, for a long time now,

608
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
scientists have been working toward the realization of machines

609
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
that will translate one language into another.

610
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Here's a machine that's helping them.

611
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
It's called the Johnny Act.

612
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Machine translation will need a dictionary and a grammar book,

613
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:14,480
a plan of the language, designed for the machines to use.

614
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
There's still a lot to be done, though.

615
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,480
One of the linguistic scientists working on the problem

616
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
is Professor Kenneth Harper.

617
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,480
His students from the University of California at Los Angeles

618
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
are also helping.

619
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a machine

620
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
that could translate languages

621
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,480
so that everybody could understand everybody else?

622
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Yes, Judy, it would, unfortunately.

623
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Translating words from one language to another

624
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
is not the same as understanding that language.

625
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
But if we knew what the words meant...

626
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Well, word for word translation

627
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
can never quite communicate to us

628
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
the thinking, the overtones

629
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,480
that convey true meaning in any language.

630
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
A linguistic scientist, by finding new ways

631
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,480
of teaching other languages

632
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,480
and making them easier to learn,

633
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,480
are helping us to break down old barriers.

634
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Judy, differences in language

635
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,480
have been one of the greatest barriers

636
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,480
to a meeting of minds among men.

637
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,480
One expression of the desire for greater understanding

638
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
is the United Nations.

639
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,480
As Tertullian of Carthage in 200 A.D. wrote,

640
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Man is the one name belonging to every nation on Earth.

641
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,480
There is one soul and many tongues,

642
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
one spirit and many sounds.

643
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Every country has its own speech,

644
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,480
but the subjects of speech are common to all.

645
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,480
Yes, the subjects of speech.

646
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,480
Day-to-day talk.

647
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,480
The chatter of small talk.

648
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,480
The exchange of pleasantries, news.

649
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Gossip.

650
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Conversation among friends.

651
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
And with strangers who speak different languages,

652
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
but find ways of understanding each other.

653
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,480
Language and speech.

654
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
The basis for communication.

655
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Tools for learning.

656
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,480
For broadening horizons of the mind.

657
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
For developing new ideas.

658
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
For exchanging knowledge.

659
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Exploring new frontiers of science.

660
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Gift of speech.

661
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,480
A universal quality that links each man

662
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,480
to the world of men.

663
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,480
Language, the pattern of speech,

664
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
may one day be the instrument

665
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
that will bring compatibility

666
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,480
and understanding to human beings everywhere.

667
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Music

668
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Soon I shall be immortalized

669
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,480
as the man who freed people from words.

670
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,480
But you're already immortal, huh?

671
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Even if your alphabet conspiracy succeeds

672
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
and you destroy the books,

673
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
you mad hatter and you too, Jabberwock,

674
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,480
will always live on in the minds of men.

675
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,480
It's because they were created out of words.

676
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Yet you're both very alive to me.

677
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Well, I'm very alive to myself.

678
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,480
And so are you, Jabber.

679
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,480
I'm beginning to feel it.

680
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Immortality.

681
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Come on, Jabber.

682
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,480
I believe Alice is expecting us.

683
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Music

684
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
Music

685
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Music

686
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
Hello there, Judy.

687
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,480
Having trouble with your homework?

688
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
You see, there's so much I don't understand.

689
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:51,920
much I don't understand and I'd like to understand. Perhaps I can help. Just as men

690
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,120
of science explore the atom, the gene, the universe, so also do they study the

691
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,720
living breath of human speech, expressing the needs, affections, joys, hopes,

692
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,440
tragedy. They act the very spirit of men's deepest nature.

693
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:49,640
The Bell system is grateful to the many distinguished scientists who helped to

694
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,880
prepare this story of language. Our thanks to the special advisors who supplied

695
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,160
and checked the scientific material for this program. Our thanks also to the

696
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,800
advisory board which reviews the scientific aspects of these programs.

697
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:10,000
Its members represent the broad range of men science including biology and

698
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:22,160
genetics, medicine, bacteriology and botany, chemistry, geophysics, physics,

699
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:35,680
anthropology, electronics and acoustics, mathematics, engineering. To all these men

700
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,920
and to many institutions, the Bell system is embedded for the support they

701
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,720
have given this venture in education through entertainment.

702
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,980
you
