WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
Which is the story of man, for the thoughts, the aspirations, the affections of long generations

00:09.520 --> 00:18.280
of humanity are woven into the fabric of human speech.

00:18.280 --> 00:26.920
That's the way it begins, the story of language all over the world, sounds of human speech

00:26.920 --> 00:32.640
like the very air we breathe, or something most of us take just for granted.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.640
When did you hide the paper?

00:34.640 --> 00:39.320
Now David, you read right up the stairs and watch, and don't forget to brush your teeth.

00:39.320 --> 00:43.480
You'd hardly think of our everyday speech as being a specimen for scientists to take

00:43.480 --> 00:52.040
apart piece by piece, to study, to analyze, but this is a science, a science of linguistics.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.080
There are perhaps many ways to tell this story.

00:55.080 --> 00:59.480
We've chosen to tell it through the imagination of the young lady who lives in this house.

00:59.480 --> 01:05.480
Now as you will see, she's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
might call it...

01:06.480 --> 01:16.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

01:36.480 --> 01:56.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

01:56.480 --> 02:16.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

02:16.480 --> 02:36.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

02:36.480 --> 02:56.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

02:56.480 --> 03:16.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

03:16.480 --> 03:36.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

03:36.480 --> 03:56.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

03:56.480 --> 04:16.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

04:16.480 --> 04:36.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

04:36.480 --> 04:56.480
She's head over heels in linguistic problems of her own, and she might call it...

04:56.480 --> 05:08.480
Why do you take care of the capital, I suppose? You may take care of the little ones.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.480
Hello, Judy!

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
Who's he?

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
He's a professor of linguistics.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.480
Linguistic?

05:26.480 --> 05:29.480
Well, Judy, what are you doing?

05:29.480 --> 05:31.480
We're going to do away with the alphabet.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.480
Then I can murder the language.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.480
Which one? There are at least 5,000 different languages in the world.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.480
There are a few of the dictionaries. Where would you like to start?

05:48.480 --> 05:51.480
What do you do? Speak all kinds of languages?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
He does just speak them. He's a scientist of language.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
A science of language?

05:56.480 --> 06:02.480
Oh, yes. He studies the insides of language. Sounds and words and alphabets.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.480
Alphabets? Is he for them or against them?

06:05.480 --> 06:08.480
Well, there's some things to be said in favor of alphabets.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.480
Name one. The alphabet is the basis of writing for one.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.480
Then let's get the man who invented the alphabet.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.480
Yes, I'd like to meet him.

06:17.480 --> 06:22.480
I'm afraid that would be a bit difficult, because people have been writing for 5 or 6,000 years.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
Well, that's centuries.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.480
Yes, Judy, it is. The people have been talking for a long time.

06:28.480 --> 06:36.480
If this ruler represents the time man has been talking, he's been writing only this long.

06:36.480 --> 06:43.480
But even today, in many areas of the earth, large numbers of people, millions of them, still get along without writing.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.480
Hope they get along. Why should they buy good news?

06:46.480 --> 06:51.480
Well, they can't learn to write most of them because they have no alphabet.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.480
No alphabet.

06:53.480 --> 07:00.480
But as civilization began to spread over the earth, people realized spoken language alone has its limits.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.480
They were learning so much they couldn't remember at all.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.480
You might say, Judy, that's why writing was invented.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.480
Then that must be why we have whole libraries full of books,

07:10.480 --> 07:14.480
because people want to write down for other people what they've gotten, what they did.

07:14.480 --> 07:20.480
Pity. People were talking to each other long before there was anything like civilization.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.480
Scientists don't know exactly how it all got started.

07:23.480 --> 07:29.480
But once on the move, speech grew like a great tree, with branches joining at limbs,

07:29.480 --> 07:35.480
branches growing out of other branches, branches running up into twigs.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.480
Each a spoken language that was the source of still other languages,

07:39.480 --> 07:45.480
and each changing as it went along and developed until the end of time.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.480
Even now, languages are continually changing.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.480
New ones springing from old ones, sometimes several from a single source.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.480
Latin was very important, wasn't it?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
Oh, yes, it certainly was.

07:57.480 --> 08:03.480
What we call the romance languages are branched off from the great trunk of Latin.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.480
There's Italian, Sardinian, and Latin.

08:06.480 --> 08:10.480
And there's Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin, Latin.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.480
It's branched off from the great trunk of Latin.

08:13.480 --> 08:22.480
There's Italian, Sardinian, Spanish and Portuguese, Dalmatian and Romanian,

08:22.480 --> 08:29.480
Catalan and French ProvenÃ§al, Rito Romance.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.480
And if you listen, you'll hear a certain similarity.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
Padre?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.480
Yes.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.480
Papa?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.480
Papa?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.480
Papa?

08:38.480 --> 08:40.480
Well, did talk something right?

08:40.480 --> 08:43.480
Well, Judy, would you be interested to know?

08:43.480 --> 08:48.480
At a certain time of their lives, babies all over the world speak the same language.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.480
Oh, just a moment.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
I know better than that.

08:50.480 --> 08:55.480
What about Chinese babies and Indian babies, German babies, French babies and American babies?

08:55.480 --> 09:00.480
Well, now just listen to the language that all those babies speak.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.480
Now, here's a typical baby.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.480
Is it just from that young talk?

09:05.480 --> 09:11.480
All babies in the world have the same, well, baby language to start with.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.480
The same babbling, if you like.

09:13.480 --> 09:18.480
But this babbling includes the sounds needed to make any language.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.480
I didn't think baby talk really meant anything.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.480
Oh, baby babbling is very important.

09:24.480 --> 09:29.480
When a baby first comes into the world, the speech areas of his brain are like a clean slate

09:29.480 --> 09:34.480
ready to be written upon from the very moment of birth.

09:35.480 --> 09:43.480
With every sound a baby makes he is producing, you might almost say practicing the basic sounds of speech.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.480
Then he learns to talk just by practicing.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.480
Not entirely.

09:49.480 --> 09:56.480
Through the first year, the child listens to his parents and copies as closely as he can what he hears,

09:56.480 --> 09:59.480
winning their approval when he makes the right sounds.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.480
Then the sounds begin to take shape.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.480
And by the age of six, the speech pattern is complete.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
It's Daddy!

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Hello, Daddy.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.480
Babies all start with the same sounds and then they just keep the ones that fit their language.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.480
I think I'll make a note of that.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.480
You might also make a note that we have a conspiracy to get out of here.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.480
Shall we go?

10:25.480 --> 10:29.480
Oh, yes, that conspiracy to do away with the alphabet.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.480
May I ask a question?

10:30.480 --> 10:31.480
What is it?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.480
Why do you want to get rid of the alphabet?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.480
It's language we're after, really.

10:35.480 --> 10:40.480
And the letters of the alphabet are the building blocks of language.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
That's a beautiful statement.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
Thank you, Judy.

10:43.480 --> 10:47.480
Very well put for hardly scientific professional jealousy.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.480
If I wanted to do away with language, what I would go after would be sounds,

10:51.480 --> 10:54.480
because sounds are the basis of any language.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.480
Sounds.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.480
Make a note of that.

10:56.480 --> 11:00.480
I suppose the next thing you're going to say is there's a science of sound.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.480
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.

11:02.480 --> 11:08.480
For a long time, scientists have been curious about how our human sounds are actually made.

11:08.480 --> 11:14.480
In the course of such a study, Professor Wolfgang von Kempelen invented the world's first talking machine.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.480
Make a note again from Kempelen.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.480
That was in the 18th century, around 1780.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.480
Cross him off with too late.

11:25.480 --> 11:30.480
Here's a drawing of von Kempelen's machine when the professor completed it.

11:30.480 --> 11:35.480
I wouldn't even know how to begin to build a talking machine.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.480
What are you doing, Judy?

11:37.480 --> 11:41.480
I'm trying to imagine how the professor could get it all out.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.480
Before a talking machine could be built,

11:45.480 --> 11:51.480
the professor had to do a scientific study of just how the human speech mechanism works.

11:51.480 --> 12:06.480
Lungs, vocal cords, mouth, palate, nasal cavities.

12:06.480 --> 12:18.480
For speech, you need air.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.480
The chest muscles, acting as a bellows,

12:22.480 --> 12:27.480
operate to fill our internal bagpipe, the lungs, with air.

12:27.480 --> 12:34.480
Next, you need a noise.

12:34.480 --> 12:39.480
Read from a bagpipe. That will do.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.480
Now we build the machine.

12:42.480 --> 12:48.480
While our friend is busy, let's look at some recent motion pictures of the human vocal cords in action.

12:48.480 --> 12:55.480
These films were made by the Gould Foundation Voice Research Laboratory at North Thames.

12:55.480 --> 13:00.480
You see, human noise is produced by the vocal cords.

13:00.480 --> 13:06.480
In case in the larynx or Adam's apple, air from the lungs is released through a space between the cords,

13:06.480 --> 13:10.480
causing them to flap apart and slap together.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.480
These vibrations set up sound waves.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.480
Now by slowing down the action with high-speed photography,

13:17.480 --> 13:24.480
we can see that the pitch of sound is varied by tightening or relaxing the pull on the vocal cords.

13:24.480 --> 13:31.480
Tightening them raises the pitch.

13:31.480 --> 13:37.480
Relaxing them lowers it.

13:37.480 --> 13:42.480
Effective as they are, the vocal cords are only the source of noise.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.480
It's the rest of the speech mechanism that shapes the sound into meaningful words.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.480
Now what the professor had to understand to make his machine work

13:50.480 --> 13:56.480
was precisely how the tongue, teeth, lips, and so forth operate.

13:56.480 --> 14:05.480
A-E-O-Vowels.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.480
And now, consonants.

14:08.480 --> 14:14.480
B-B-B-Z-N.

14:14.480 --> 14:19.480
The breath explodes, it buzzes, it hums.

14:19.480 --> 14:24.480
The machine is finished.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.480
And now, demonstration.

14:29.480 --> 14:38.480
That's for my me.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.480
Why, the machine spoke French. Did you all my friends?

14:42.480 --> 14:46.480
Fun Campbell's machine was quite remarkable for 1780,

14:46.480 --> 14:50.480
for it was the world's first successful talking machine.

14:50.480 --> 14:58.480
Scientists today have the benefit of techniques undreamed of in von Kempelten's time.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.480
In these x-ray films of the human speech mechanism in action,

15:02.480 --> 15:06.480
you can see the tongue and lips assuming various positions

15:06.480 --> 15:10.480
to form cavities that modify the sound by resonance.

15:10.480 --> 15:16.480
Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?

15:16.480 --> 15:21.480
The sound of the different vowels depends on the height to which the tongue is raised in the mouth.

15:21.480 --> 15:27.480
High, mid, or low.

15:27.480 --> 15:33.480
It also depends on the position of the tongue in the front or back of the mouth.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.480
Consonants are shaped by tongue, lips, teeth.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.480
Who will give a needle, a mouse, a cat, and a bird to my father?

15:43.480 --> 15:47.480
This has been very educational, Jabba. We don't have to bother with the alphabet.

15:47.480 --> 15:52.480
All we've got to do is get rid of those vowels and consonants and our job is done.

15:52.480 --> 15:59.480
I hate to disappoint you, fellas, with what really come out of the human speech mechanism are phonemes.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.480
P-H-O-N-E-M-E-S phonemes.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.480
The basic sounds of speech.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.480
Don't even make a note of that, Judy. He's just trying to throw us off the track.

16:10.480 --> 16:15.480
Come on, Jabba. We've got plans to make.

16:15.480 --> 16:20.480
It is confusing. I guess I better ask you. What is a phoneme?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.480
Phoneme is a sound.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
Like A, B, C?

16:24.480 --> 16:27.480
No, they're letters of the alphabet. They're units of writing.

16:27.480 --> 16:32.480
No alphabet for any language truly represents the sounds of that language.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.480
Let me borrow your pad.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
Sit down. I'll show you.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.480
Now, let's take this word.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.480
Either?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.480
Now, this word has five phonemes.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.480
If I say it slowly,

16:47.480 --> 16:51.480
D-E-N-E-R,

16:51.480 --> 16:53.480
you can hear the five parts.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.480
Some people say either.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.480
Can you say either, either, or either?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.480
Either, either, or either.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.480
As your friend the Hatter has already said, the alphabet can be very confusing.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.480
Different pronunciations are sometimes spelled in the same way.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.480
That's why scientists had to develop more accurate symbols.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.480
Now, in phonemes, either is written this way.

17:14.480 --> 17:23.480
D-E-N-E-R.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.480
And either is written like this.

17:26.480 --> 17:34.480
A-E-R.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.480
The difference is the first little phonemes.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.480
Now, scientists such as Ferdinand de Soussure in France

17:41.480 --> 17:45.480
discovered that out of the thousands of speech sounds a human being can make,

17:45.480 --> 17:48.480
each language has picked its own set of phonemes.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.480
English, for instance, has 45.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.480
The most little phoneme sounds must really be the building blocks of language.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.480
I'd better make a note of that for the Hatter.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.480
But for myself, I'd better just stick to the alphabet.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.480
We have a proposal.

18:09.480 --> 18:14.480
If we can prove that it's possible to communicate without words to say nothing of phonemes,

18:14.480 --> 18:19.480
will you give up your linguistic obsession and join our conspiracy?

18:19.480 --> 18:22.480
Science is always open to experimental evidence.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.480
Good.

18:23.480 --> 18:39.480
One, two, buckle my shoe.

18:39.480 --> 18:44.480
Three, four, shut the door.

18:44.480 --> 18:54.480
Five, I understood you perfectly.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.480
If we can win over science, the alphabet is good as dead.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.480
Well, Dr. Linguistic, do you concede that we have made a point?

19:02.480 --> 19:03.480
Yes, indeed.

19:03.480 --> 19:07.480
As a matter of fact, I think we can substantiate your point further.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.480
I think you'll find this very interesting.

19:10.480 --> 19:20.480
Science.

19:20.480 --> 19:25.480
This is one of the Canary Islands, La Gomera, off the west coast of North Africa,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.480
a land of rugged terrain.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.480
In the sparsely populated areas, people found it difficult to communicate with one another

19:32.480 --> 19:34.480
across the deep gorges.

19:34.480 --> 19:39.480
So go, the Gomeras contrived an extraordinary form of telephonic speech, whistling,

19:39.480 --> 19:58.480
which can be understood over a distance of frequencies in pitch.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.480
This whistling language is of great interest to linguistic scientists

20:02.480 --> 20:07.480
because it makes use of only one feature of normal speech, pitch.

20:07.480 --> 20:13.480
It does with all the variations of tone quality that Professor von Kemplen was so concerned about.

20:13.480 --> 20:20.480
Now, whereas this canary, another ingenious form of language, was invented in the North American plains.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.480
Indian Sign Language.

20:22.480 --> 20:27.480
When tribes met on the trail, hunted buffalo together, or met in council,

20:27.480 --> 20:32.480
it wasn't time enough to learn one another's spoken language, so they used Sign of Washington.

20:32.480 --> 20:42.480
The white soldiers told the Indians, beside the river, called the Lodgepole River.

20:42.480 --> 20:55.480
Before the snow, there'd be no more fighting, and that made all the Indians very happy.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.480
Excuse me, Frinterit.

20:57.480 --> 21:01.480
I was just wondering how the Indians managed to talk with their hands in the dark.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.480
Well, they couldn't, Judy. As you can see, all of these methods

21:05.480 --> 21:12.480
giving man limitless possibilities for expressing his ideas, his concepts of science and technology,

21:12.480 --> 21:23.480
his day-by-day thoughts, his feelings, his emotions, love.

21:23.480 --> 21:29.480
Don't be taken by those scientific sophistries. Do animals have alphabets? Do they have words?

21:29.480 --> 21:34.480
And animals can, without any words at all, quote, communicate from the moment of birth.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.480
And they've got no words without any words at all, haven't they?

21:38.480 --> 21:42.480
Oh, yes, indeed. That's the would-you-hollows-please-applies.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.480
Now, look.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.480
There's a crow.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.480
When man invades the forest, he's the first to shout, beat it.

21:53.480 --> 21:59.480
And all the other birds, animals, pass on the alarm.

21:59.480 --> 22:04.480
Not only birds and animals get along without words, but insects as well.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.480
The most incredible of all is the dance of the honeybee.

22:08.480 --> 22:12.480
When a worker bee finds a flower full of nectar, it flops.

22:12.480 --> 22:16.480
This urgent message is communicated by performing a dance.

22:16.480 --> 22:21.480
The pattern of the dance indicates the direction of the flowers in relation to the sun.

22:21.480 --> 22:25.480
The speed of the dance tells the distance from the hive.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.480
The other bees all take notice.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.480
They touch the dancer where they discover the scent of the flowers.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.480
Then they all fly out to the source of the nectar.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.480
Animals and insects have many ingenious ways of communicating.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.480
Sound, smells, with motion.

22:41.480 --> 22:46.480
We find in all this communication that the animal mind operates almost automatically.

22:46.480 --> 22:52.480
It receives messages from the outside through its sense organs and reacts instinctively.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.480
Hello. Hello.

23:15.480 --> 23:19.480
Why, Jabber, that's very good. You're improving.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.480
Hello.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
Oh, it was the parrot.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.480
Beware the jab-bub talking bird.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.480
But parrots just imitate what people say.

23:28.480 --> 23:34.480
Yes, that's because they are not able to associate a given sound or word with a specific meaning.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.480
It's curious, though, that they sound like people.

23:37.480 --> 23:42.480
Some animals, such as apes, do have a larynx and the rest of our vocal apparatus.

23:42.480 --> 23:47.480
The speech mechanism of the chimpanzee is the closest to that of a human being.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.480
Will you please?

23:52.480 --> 23:57.480
Research psychologist Dr. Keith Hayes and his wife raised a chimp named Vicki.

23:57.480 --> 24:04.480
After constant training, Vicki had learned to speak only three human words by the time she was three years old.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.480
Like human babies, she babbled at first.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.480
Later, she was rewarded when she made the right sound.

24:11.480 --> 24:16.480
Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.480
The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.

24:21.480 --> 24:26.480
Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.

24:26.480 --> 24:32.480
Now who am I? Papa? Papa?

24:32.480 --> 24:35.480
Papa? Papa?

24:35.480 --> 24:40.480
You say whether she was rewarded when she made the right sound.

24:40.480 --> 24:45.480
Mrs. Hayes would shape Vicki's lips to help her pronounce the word mama.

24:45.480 --> 24:50.480
The age of two and a half, she could say papa and cup.

24:50.480 --> 24:55.480
Now she has learned to use all three of her words appropriately in solicitation.

24:55.480 --> 25:01.480
Now who am I? Papa? Papa?

25:01.480 --> 25:06.480
You say what this is?

25:06.480 --> 25:11.480
By the age of six, Vicki's spoken vocabulary consisted of seven words.

25:11.480 --> 25:16.480
Whereas human children are using hundreds of words by the time they're only two years old.

25:16.480 --> 25:22.480
Chimpanzees, orangutans, and other mammals may have larynxes in the rest of the speech mechanism,

25:22.480 --> 25:27.480
but it takes more than that. It takes brain power.

25:28.480 --> 25:34.480
Well, for the present, we must conclude that man is the only one of Earth's creatures with true language.

25:34.480 --> 25:40.480
Because the animals can't manage to combine their cries, calls, their signals,

25:40.480 --> 25:47.480
form the infinite variety of meaning that we achieve when we arrange words and sounds into sentences.

25:47.480 --> 25:51.480
So, Judy, shouldn't surprise you that some people have argued

25:51.480 --> 25:55.480
that what distinguishes man from beast is grammar.

25:55.480 --> 26:00.480
I knew it, I knew it. I suspected it from the moment he started building up this so-called

26:00.480 --> 26:04.480
science of linguistics, and all these pretentious words are just a cover-up from grammar.

26:04.480 --> 26:09.480
So, Judy, the sooner we get on with our conspiracy, the sooner we get rid of grammar.

26:09.480 --> 26:17.480
It would be a lovely world without subjects and predicates and split infinitives and the conjugation of verbs.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.480
But, Judy, grammar isn't just a bunch of rules.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.480
I know. It's the building blocks of language.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.480
No, it's more like the architect's plan for the building.

26:27.480 --> 26:32.480
Well, if you'll pardon me, Professor, I've got some plans for that plan.

26:34.480 --> 26:40.480
Then grammar is the plan of how we talk. It sounds important, but rather hard to understand.

26:40.480 --> 26:50.480
Judy, it's simply this. The way words are arranged into sentences is as important a meaning as the separate words themselves.

26:50.480 --> 26:55.480
Judy, did you know that your brain was unconsciously using grammar long before you started the school?

26:55.480 --> 27:00.480
You mean my head's been full of subjects and predicates, and I didn't even know it.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.480
Yes, of course. Have you ever tried to make your mind completely blank?

27:04.480 --> 27:11.480
You can. If your mind goes on talking to itself and in language, that's what we call thinking.

27:11.480 --> 27:17.480
For language puts not only words into our mouths, but into our heads, too.

27:17.480 --> 27:22.480
Well, that's another trouble with words. Maybe the header is right.

27:22.480 --> 27:27.480
Oh, but Judy, before you go, let me say that words themselves aren't to blame.

27:27.480 --> 27:33.480
They were developed through the ages to express the vital experiences of people everywhere.

27:33.480 --> 27:39.480
In a sense, people live in different worlds, worlds reflected in their languages.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.480
We could understand these many languages. We might hear the people say,

27:43.480 --> 27:51.480
We Eskimo must live with snow. It shapes our lives. We have a dozen special words to tell about snow.

27:51.480 --> 27:55.480
It's far too important to be dismissed with one word.

27:55.480 --> 28:01.480
To us, living in the Trobriam Islands, our very existence depend on raising our crops.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.480
We have more than a hundred names for yams.

28:04.480 --> 28:10.480
Arabic gives us more than 6,000 different words for camel, its parts and equipment.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.480
When language expresses our various ways of life, it is indeed our servant.

28:15.480 --> 28:20.480
Some scholars have wondered if language is not at times our master.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.480
People use words. Do words use people?

28:24.480 --> 28:31.480
In most of the Oriental world, our various social classes speak one to the other in traditional ways.

28:31.480 --> 28:38.480
Does our language then determine our behavior, dictating for each person the way in which he acts towards his equals,

28:38.480 --> 28:41.480
his inferiors, his superiors?

28:41.480 --> 28:47.480
Our Hopi language has no grammatical way to express past, present or future.

28:47.480 --> 28:54.480
So far as our language is concerned, one might conclude that the world is without time altogether.

28:54.480 --> 29:00.480
Scientists too are pondering such questions. Does our language shape our whole philosophy of life?

29:00.480 --> 29:06.480
Is it true that some ideas that are clear in one language may be very difficult to say?

29:06.480 --> 29:10.480
Maybe even difficult to think in another language.

29:10.480 --> 29:17.480
Even so-called primitive peoples have developed languages that admirably express their cultures, their ways of life.

29:17.480 --> 29:23.480
But scientists have discovered that there are no primitive languages on the face of the earth.

29:23.480 --> 29:30.480
These languages used with ease by the crudest savages are just as complex as other tongues.

29:30.480 --> 29:37.480
In fact, it sometimes requires the lifetime study of our greatest scholars to figure them out.

29:37.480 --> 29:46.480
Anthropologists like France Boas, who pioneered in American Indian languages, sought to discover in each language its own system.

29:46.480 --> 29:52.480
Following Boas, Leonard Bloomfield began collecting materials on American Indian languages.

29:52.480 --> 29:57.480
By this and other work, he set the stage for modern descriptive linguistics.

29:57.480 --> 30:07.480
Others, such as Edward Sapir, an expert on many Indian tongues, studied languages as related to cultures and total ways of life.

30:07.480 --> 30:12.480
All the languages now being spoken, only a few have been studied scientifically.

30:12.480 --> 30:20.480
And today, linguistic scientists all over the world are concentrating upon small speech communities that are rapidly dying out

30:20.480 --> 30:25.480
to prevent their languages from being forever lost to the study of man.

30:25.480 --> 30:32.480
As we understand each new language, we learn more about the way human beings communicate with one another.

30:32.480 --> 30:43.480
Oh, look! There's an envelope. I think there's a letter inside. It's an invitation.

30:43.480 --> 30:51.480
Matt Hatter says we're invited to a mad tea party. He's going to prove that language is madness.

30:51.480 --> 30:55.480
And the guest of honor is to be Dr. Linguistics.

30:55.480 --> 31:00.480
A fish, whiffle, gyre, and gimbal. It'll be right over.

31:00.480 --> 31:06.480
My goodness. Tea and linguistics. What a curious combination.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.480
The mad tea party is about to commence.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.480
Who's coming?

31:26.480 --> 31:35.480
Well, I've invited a cowboy from the southwest to theatrical publicity, ma'am, and some other guests.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.480
How do you do, Shorty?

31:38.480 --> 31:39.480
Scammy, ma'am.

31:39.480 --> 31:44.480
Judy, this is Shorty Rogers, famous jazz trumpeter and composer.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
Hey there, Judy.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.480
How do you do?

31:46.480 --> 31:47.480
Crazy.

31:47.480 --> 31:51.480
Shorty, you're going to meet a very distinguished professor of linguistics.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.480
Is this cap tool square or way out?

31:55.480 --> 32:00.480
Well, I'm not sure that I follow you, but this should prove a very amusing encounter.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.480
They won't understand each other at all.

32:03.480 --> 32:10.480
Shorty, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the very distinguished Dr. Linguistics.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.480
Doctor, this is Shorty Rogers.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.480
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance, Doctor.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
Scammy, ma'am.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.480
Ma'am, you're really weathered. What's the bet here?

32:21.480 --> 32:26.480
Well, a hat here's been trying to bug me on this ABC jazz.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.480
Crazy made the scene, ma'am. Crazy.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.480
Hey, you're a real live aspirin.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.480
Well, I have to split now. So long.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.480
Keep cool.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.480
They seem to understand each other, but I couldn't.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.480
Mimsie, too. Me either.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.480
Well, waitly meets my next guest.

32:47.480 --> 32:52.480
Oh, Doctor L, I'd like you to meet a theatrical publicity man.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.480
How do you do?

32:54.480 --> 32:56.480
Hi. Looks as if you already have a story.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.480
Yep. Here's my lead.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.480
Tongue's wag is wag's gag, but hot hat cools as Doc clicks on rhetoric tricks.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.480
Well, that's just about ball points the hat's check.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.480
Like a fat bat.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.480
Well, I gotta run now, Doc. This batch is a bop.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.480
Some sock yawks packed them at Flax Cracks.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.480
Flax Cracks ban just next to me.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.480
You're right. They do understand each other.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.480
Perhaps this next guest will confuse him.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.480
Enjoying yourself?

33:27.480 --> 33:30.480
Well, now, I don't want to sound like I've raised on sour milk,

33:30.480 --> 33:34.480
but I just can't drink enough of this yellow gargoyle to get a token load.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.480
You see, these dunes give me broke fever.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.480
I get my spurs all tangled and I'm just playing old hog tide

33:41.480 --> 33:44.480
when it comes to making chin music with a pack of strangers.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.480
Well, Doctor Linguist...

33:46.480 --> 33:48.480
Well, Doctor Linguist, it's...

33:48.480 --> 33:50.480
Well, it was all quite simple.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.480
He said he wasn't mouthy.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.480
He's fresh out of the tongue oil.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.480
This wing ding shortens his stake rope,

33:56.480 --> 33:58.480
makes him feel like he's got his leg tied up.

33:58.480 --> 34:01.480
Say, partner, you sat at my lingo.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.480
You'll do to ride the river with.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.480
Well, I gotta roll my wheels.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.480
Long, Doc.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.480
So long, amigo.

34:10.480 --> 34:14.480
Him and me is made of the same leather.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
Well, so much for linguistics.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.480
Now, do let us have some tea.

34:20.480 --> 34:25.480
Judy, after that variety of verbal vocalizing,

34:25.480 --> 34:28.480
surely you would agree that language is a mixed up mix.

34:28.480 --> 34:32.480
But Doctor Linguist didn't seem to think the tea party was so mad.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.480
No, actually, I thought it was quite sensible.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.480
With everyone speaking a different language.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.480
Different dialect, if you please.

34:40.480 --> 34:44.480
Now, these dialects and occupational vocabularies

34:44.480 --> 34:47.480
are what make any language interesting, colorful.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.480
They're part of our humor.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.480
But they're also the subject of scholarly research.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.480
Well, Doctor Linguist, I'm afraid that you and I

34:55.480 --> 34:58.480
are not made of the same leather.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.480
Well, thanks for the tea and linguistics.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.480
It was very pleasant.

35:04.480 --> 35:09.480
Judy, did you care to join me in a little research project

35:09.480 --> 35:13.480
in American dialect geography?

35:18.480 --> 35:21.480
The way a man talks tells us where he comes from.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.480
Like in Brooklyn. Some people call a bird a blight.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.480
Yes, it's not only what people say,

35:27.480 --> 35:29.480
it's the way they say it that gives us clues

35:29.480 --> 35:31.480
where they were brought up.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.480
Clues. That sounds like a mystery.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.480
It is, rather.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.480
You could look at it as a kind of detective story.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.480
First, we'll need a suspect.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.480
And a private eye.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.480
Let's make it two.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.480
Now, for the last time, are you going to tell us where you're from?

35:55.480 --> 35:57.480
Oh, you won't, eh?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.480
Well, we have ways of finding out.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.480
Read this.

36:03.480 --> 36:07.480
Mary, Mary, Mary.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.480
Aha!

36:09.480 --> 36:12.480
West of the Alleghenes, they pronounce the words alike.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.480
He pronounces them all differently.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.480
Yeah, that's right.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.480
Clue number one puts him east of the Alleghenes.

36:20.480 --> 36:23.480
All right now, read this.

36:23.480 --> 36:29.480
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
Gleasy.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.480
Hear that? He said greasy, not greasy.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.480
That puts you north of Philadelphia.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.480
Ha! Read this.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.480
Park.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.480
He said park, not park.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.480
That eliminates coastal New England.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.480
Read.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.480
Wash, water.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.480
Hear that? Not wash and water,

36:58.480 --> 37:01.480
but wash and water.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.480
The rest of New England is out.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
Must be Central Atlantic states and where.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.480
Father.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.480
Father? That senses him.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.480
I'll put him within a 30-mile radius of Times Square.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
Right?

37:23.480 --> 37:25.480
Yeah.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.480
That's right.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.480
What a amusing parlor game, Dr. Linguisty.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.480
Something like 20 questions.

37:37.480 --> 37:41.480
Well, a dialect geographer using a list of only 30 words

37:41.480 --> 37:45.480
can usually place a person within 20 miles of his home locality

37:45.480 --> 37:49.480
so long as he lives in the eastern part of the United States.

37:49.480 --> 37:54.480
Dialect geographers began charting their monumental linguistic atlas

37:54.480 --> 37:56.480
in the east in 1929

37:56.480 --> 37:59.480
and have been painstakingly working their way to the west.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.480
Dr. Hans Kurath of the University of Michigan

38:02.480 --> 38:04.480
has conducted a good part of this research.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.480
He and his dialect experts are traveling around the country

38:07.480 --> 38:09.480
for the past 25 years,

38:09.480 --> 38:12.480
asking people what words they use for all sorts of things.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.480
They've recorded dialect differences in words

38:15.480 --> 38:17.480
and how they're pronounced.

38:17.480 --> 38:21.480
Perhaps Dr. Kurath will show us how the atlas is put together.

38:21.480 --> 38:27.480
Well, you see, the atlas contains hundreds of maps showing speech differences

38:27.480 --> 38:31.480
and their geographical boundaries, which we call isoglosses.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.480
May I show you a few examples?

38:36.480 --> 38:44.480
This isogloss sets off the area in which riddle cakes are called fritter.

38:44.480 --> 38:50.480
This here around Philadelphia shows the area where they call them hotcakes.

38:50.480 --> 38:57.480
Over here they're called flannertakes to the south of it, batter cakes.

38:57.480 --> 39:05.480
It is on the basis of isoglosses like these that we establish the dialect ban.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.480
Thank you, Dr. Kurath.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.480
Man takes his speech ways with him wherever he goes.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.480
As the dialects flowed westward the way our population did,

39:15.480 --> 39:18.480
the strands unraveled and began to overlap.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
Here's how they traveled.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.480
Western New England accents,

39:23.480 --> 39:26.480
coast speech,

39:26.480 --> 39:28.480
southern mountain accents,

39:28.480 --> 39:30.480
plantation speech,

39:30.480 --> 39:32.480
Texas accents,

39:32.480 --> 39:37.480
but down east talk in the state of Maine has stayed put.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.480
This research has revealed the paths people have taken

39:40.480 --> 39:43.480
when they migrated from one part of the country to another,

39:43.480 --> 39:47.480
shown the changes going on in American speech patterns.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.480
This research has unearthed hitherto unrecorded dialects.

39:51.480 --> 39:54.480
There's also marked off areas where big cities have influenced

39:54.480 --> 39:57.480
the speech ways of neighboring localities.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.480
This atlas is a most impressive achievement

40:00.480 --> 40:04.480
at one branch of the science of linguistics, Dr. L.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.480
It may be linguistics, it may be impressive,

40:06.480 --> 40:08.480
it may even be an achievement in one branch,

40:08.480 --> 40:11.480
but don't try to convince me that it's a science.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.480
A science is test tubes, telescopes,

40:14.480 --> 40:17.480
microscopes, and chromium-plated machines.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.480
Actually, linguistics has its own share of hardware.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
Hardware?

40:21.480 --> 40:24.480
Yes, that's what scientists call their machines.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.480
Before you can build a piece of hardware,

40:26.480 --> 40:29.480
you have to know exactly what you want it to do.

40:29.480 --> 40:34.480
That calls for research, imagination, would you please?

40:37.480 --> 40:41.480
The kind of imagination that led to Bell's telephone.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.480
To Edison's phonograph.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.480
To Marconi's wireless.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.480
And to the first all-talking picture.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.480
Didn't movies always talk?

40:55.480 --> 40:58.480
No, Judy, when I was your age, films were silent.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.480
How do movies talk?

41:02.480 --> 41:05.480
Well, only along the side of our film is the soundtrack.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.480
I wonder whatever it looks like.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.480
Well, we might ask the soundtrack to move in a bit.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.480
Is that what makes a picture talk?

41:16.480 --> 41:19.480
It's just a routine matter of technology.

41:19.480 --> 41:23.480
Routine matter of technology, indeed.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.480
You surely wouldn't make light of the magic of physics,

41:26.480 --> 41:30.480
converting sound into electrical impulses.

41:30.480 --> 41:35.480
Why, electronic machines are nothing short of miraculous.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.480
You'll see.

41:39.480 --> 41:45.480
Example, the sound spectrograph turns speech into pictures.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.480
First, the scientist speaks into the machine.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.480
Never kill a snake with your bare hands.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.480
It is impressive, but what is it doing?

41:55.480 --> 41:59.480
The machine separates all sounds into two things,

41:59.480 --> 42:01.480
pitch and loudness.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.480
The phrase, never kill a snake with your bare hands,

42:04.480 --> 42:07.480
comes out looking like this.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.480
Is it a new kind of alphabet?

42:09.480 --> 42:12.480
Looks more like a fuzzy kind of shorthand.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.480
These patterns of light show pitch and loudness

42:15.480 --> 42:17.480
in each instant of sound.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.480
That gave the scientist an idea.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.480
Why not just create speech artificially

42:22.480 --> 42:25.480
by painting these patterns on clear plastic with a brush?

42:25.480 --> 42:27.480
And when they feed this hand-painted speech

42:27.480 --> 42:31.480
into the playback machine, here's how it sounds.

42:31.480 --> 42:35.480
Never kill a snake with your bare hands.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
It talks by hand.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.480
Yes, the sound spectrograph allows linguistic scientists

42:39.480 --> 42:42.480
to make very rapid studies of speech sounds.

42:42.480 --> 42:45.480
And among other things, some deaf people

42:45.480 --> 42:47.480
have been taught to see speech.

42:47.480 --> 42:52.480
For example, they learn to recognize this pattern as five.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.480
They hear with their eyes.

42:54.480 --> 42:58.480
Precisely, they see pictures of speech.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.480
Oh, we've got machines that talk to man

43:01.480 --> 43:04.480
and even machines that can listen.

43:04.480 --> 43:08.480
Audrey, that's a machine that listens to spoken numbers

43:08.480 --> 43:11.480
like a telephone operator and obeys orders.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.480
Four.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.480
Four.

43:15.480 --> 43:19.480
Yes, Audrey, the automatic digit recognizer

43:19.480 --> 43:22.480
can identify numbers spoken into a telephone.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.480
And how about the voice typewriter?

43:25.480 --> 43:29.480
He takes dictation and types words as they are spoken.

43:29.480 --> 43:31.480
See.

43:33.480 --> 43:38.480
You read it.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.480
It's like a secretary who never makes a mistake.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.480
No, they're easily confused by different voices

43:44.480 --> 43:46.480
and different accents.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.480
Voice typewriters are still pretty crude.

43:48.480 --> 43:52.480
What about machines that talk to each other?

43:52.480 --> 43:55.480
Yes, electronic computing machines

43:55.480 --> 43:57.480
can transmit data to each other

43:57.480 --> 43:59.480
over ordinary telephone circuits.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.480
Those machines will soon learn that it's a lot easier

44:01.480 --> 44:03.480
to get into this talking business

44:03.480 --> 44:04.480
than it is to get out of it.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.480
Out of it.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.480
I never dreamed machines could be so smart.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.480
I'd have a tea party conversation with a machine.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.480
I'm afraid you find the conversation rather dull.

44:14.480 --> 44:18.480
You see, Judy, machines have no minds of their own.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.480
I thought they had electronic brains.

44:20.480 --> 44:23.480
It's the brain of man that tells them what to do.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.480
I give up you and your scientific attitude.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.480
Magic is just matter of fact to you.

44:29.480 --> 44:34.480
Every miracle has to have its qualifications, reservations, footnotes.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.480
Goodbye.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.480
I hope the soundtrack didn't go away mad.

44:40.480 --> 44:42.480
Soundtrack's an impetuous fellow.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.480
He was in such a hurry, he neglected to even mention

44:45.480 --> 44:48.480
an automatic translator.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.480
You see, Judy, for a long time now,

44:50.480 --> 44:53.480
scientists have been working toward the realization of machines

44:53.480 --> 44:56.480
that will translate one language into another.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.480
Here's a machine that's helping them.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.480
It's called the Johnny Act.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.480
Machine translation will need a dictionary and a grammar book,

45:03.480 --> 45:14.480
a plan of the language, designed for the machines to use.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.480
There's still a lot to be done, though.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.480
One of the linguistic scientists working on the problem

45:19.480 --> 45:21.480
is Professor Kenneth Harper.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.480
His students from the University of California at Los Angeles

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
are also helping.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.480
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a machine

45:28.480 --> 45:30.480
that could translate languages

45:30.480 --> 45:33.480
so that everybody could understand everybody else?

45:33.480 --> 45:36.480
Yes, Judy, it would, unfortunately.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.480
Translating words from one language to another

45:39.480 --> 45:41.480
is not the same as understanding that language.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.480
But if we knew what the words meant...

45:43.480 --> 45:46.480
Well, word for word translation

45:46.480 --> 45:48.480
can never quite communicate to us

45:48.480 --> 45:50.480
the thinking, the overtones

45:50.480 --> 45:53.480
that convey true meaning in any language.

45:53.480 --> 45:55.480
A linguistic scientist, by finding new ways

45:55.480 --> 45:57.480
of teaching other languages

45:57.480 --> 45:59.480
and making them easier to learn,

45:59.480 --> 46:02.480
are helping us to break down old barriers.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.480
Judy, differences in language

46:05.480 --> 46:07.480
have been one of the greatest barriers

46:07.480 --> 46:09.480
to a meeting of minds among men.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.480
One expression of the desire for greater understanding

46:12.480 --> 46:14.480
is the United Nations.

46:19.480 --> 46:23.480
As Tertullian of Carthage in 200 A.D. wrote,

46:23.480 --> 46:27.480
Man is the one name belonging to every nation on Earth.

46:27.480 --> 46:30.480
There is one soul and many tongues,

46:30.480 --> 46:33.480
one spirit and many sounds.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.480
Every country has its own speech,

46:35.480 --> 46:39.480
but the subjects of speech are common to all.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.480
Yes, the subjects of speech.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.480
Day-to-day talk.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.480
The chatter of small talk.

46:49.480 --> 46:52.480
The exchange of pleasantries, news.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.480
Gossip.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.480
Conversation among friends.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.480
And with strangers who speak different languages,

47:03.480 --> 47:06.480
but find ways of understanding each other.

47:09.480 --> 47:11.480
Language and speech.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.480
The basis for communication.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.480
Tools for learning.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.480
For broadening horizons of the mind.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.480
For developing new ideas.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.480
For exchanging knowledge.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.480
Exploring new frontiers of science.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.480
Gift of speech.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.480
A universal quality that links each man

47:31.480 --> 47:33.480
to the world of men.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.480
Language, the pattern of speech,

47:35.480 --> 47:37.480
may one day be the instrument

47:37.480 --> 47:39.480
that will bring compatibility

47:39.480 --> 47:42.480
and understanding to human beings everywhere.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.480
Music

48:05.480 --> 48:07.480
Soon I shall be immortalized

48:07.480 --> 48:10.480
as the man who freed people from words.

48:10.480 --> 48:13.480
But you're already immortal, huh?

48:13.480 --> 48:16.480
Even if your alphabet conspiracy succeeds

48:16.480 --> 48:18.480
and you destroy the books,

48:18.480 --> 48:21.480
you mad hatter and you too, Jabberwock,

48:21.480 --> 48:24.480
will always live on in the minds of men.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.480
It's because they were created out of words.

48:27.480 --> 48:30.480
Yet you're both very alive to me.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.480
Well, I'm very alive to myself.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.480
And so are you, Jabber.

48:36.480 --> 48:39.480
I'm beginning to feel it.

48:39.480 --> 48:41.480
Immortality.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.480
Come on, Jabber.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.480
I believe Alice is expecting us.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.480
Music

49:10.480 --> 49:12.480
Music

49:20.480 --> 49:22.480
Music

49:30.480 --> 49:32.480
Hello there, Judy.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.480
Having trouble with your homework?

49:36.480 --> 49:38.480
You see, there's so much I don't understand.

49:38.480 --> 49:51.920
much I don't understand and I'd like to understand. Perhaps I can help. Just as men

49:51.920 --> 49:58.120
of science explore the atom, the gene, the universe, so also do they study the

49:58.120 --> 50:05.720
living breath of human speech, expressing the needs, affections, joys, hopes,

50:05.720 --> 50:12.440
tragedy. They act the very spirit of men's deepest nature.

50:35.720 --> 50:49.640
The Bell system is grateful to the many distinguished scientists who helped to

50:49.640 --> 50:54.880
prepare this story of language. Our thanks to the special advisors who supplied

50:54.880 --> 50:59.160
and checked the scientific material for this program. Our thanks also to the

50:59.160 --> 51:03.800
advisory board which reviews the scientific aspects of these programs.

51:03.800 --> 51:10.000
Its members represent the broad range of men science including biology and

51:10.000 --> 51:22.160
genetics, medicine, bacteriology and botany, chemistry, geophysics, physics,

51:22.160 --> 51:35.680
anthropology, electronics and acoustics, mathematics, engineering. To all these men

51:35.680 --> 51:40.920
and to many institutions, the Bell system is embedded for the support they

51:40.920 --> 51:46.720
have given this venture in education through entertainment.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.980
you
