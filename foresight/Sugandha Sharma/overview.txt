 In this session, Sue Moon discusses her research on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition, focusing on grid cells and place cells in the hippocampus. She presents a mechanistic model that integrates experimental findings and computational approaches to explain how these cells can exhibit both spatial and temporal coding properties. The model uses Hebbian learning to create connections from place cells to grid cells, allowing for the reconstruction of spatial patterns even when they are perturbed by noise. This process is exponential in nature, meaning that as more place cells are added, the system's capacity to remember and reconstruct spatial patterns grows exponentially.

Sue Moon emphasizes that the objective of these algorithms is not solely accurate prediction but also encompasses other aspects that could drive the evolution of such neural representations. She acknowledges the potential role of reward in shaping these representations, although her current focus is on exploring the theoretical properties and capacities of these circuits. Her work aims to understand how grid and place cells can form local sub-maps of environments, which is a step towards comprehending the larger scale remapping in space.

The discussion also touches on the potential for these neural networks to learn sequences and the capacity they have for information storage. The model allows for the reconstruction of noisy spatial patterns, suggesting that the brain might use similar learning structures for structure learning, even without explicit reward signals.

Overall, Sue Moon's research contributes to our understanding of how the brain processes and remembers spatial information, with implications for both fundamental neuroscience and the development of artificial systems capable of sophisticated spatial reasoning.
