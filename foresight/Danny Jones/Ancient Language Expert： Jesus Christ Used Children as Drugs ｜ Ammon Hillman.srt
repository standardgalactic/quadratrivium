1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I don't even know where to begin with this episode.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,680
The following guest, Dr. Hillman,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,800
has a master's degree in bacteriology,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,160
a master's degree in classics,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,680
as well as a PhD in classics,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,880
until he was eventually investigated

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,600
by the Catholic Church for demon possession,

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,120
which led to him being ejected by his university.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,680
Now, although I did read his book,

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,920
The Chemical Muse, before we recorded this podcast,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,520
it quickly became clear that I was not prepared

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,440
for what was coming.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
And I'm still trying to process this conversation

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,800
weeks after we recorded it.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,360
Due to the provocative and unsettling nature

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,320
of this episode,

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,120
it has been heavily censored with parts redacted.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,800
However, we posted the full uncensored version

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,480
in its entirety on Patreon if you want it.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,680
You better buckle up, folks.

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,120
All right, Mr. Ommon Hillman,

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
you are a quite the controversial figure

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,760
when it comes to religion, classics, ancient texts.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,280
You're a linguist, you're a classicist.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,080
What is your official title?

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
Hail Satan, Danny.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
It's nice to be here, by the way.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Thank you so much for your invitation.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,160
Are you a Satanist?

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,640
Am I a Satanist?

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
Oh, God.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Those people bother me so much.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,840
No, I can't be a Satanist, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
They bother you.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
What bothers you about them?

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,160
The whole religious side of things.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
Yeah, no, no, no.

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
What am I?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,840
Well, you are a religious scholar, right?

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,680
No, I'm a classicist.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,960
Religious scholars, no, we eat those for breakfast.

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,800
No, no, I'm a classicist.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
What I do is...

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,200
What is a classicist?

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
It's somebody who is a specialist

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
in the translation of ancient Greek.

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Some people do Latin, too,

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,480
but Latin was for hot dwelling Romans, you know what I mean?

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,640
It's just not to the level that the Greek is.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,600
The unique word, can alone, is off the chart for Greek.

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,600
It is a superior language, devoured languages in antiquity.

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
It just ate them up, boom, boom.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
And this is normal in any language over time.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,560
Any language over time, right?

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Some become strong and they become dominant,

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
others die out.

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,080
The Greek was the behemoth.

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
It was the dragon of antiquity.

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
Modern Greek is nothing like it.

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,960
How long have you been studying and reading

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
and translating Greek?

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,280
For 30 years now, for 30 years now.

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,280
And every classicist knows it's our honor and duty

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,840
to guard the muse and to keep those ancient documents

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
within the flow, within time itself.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,440
So we're dragons, man.

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
That's what classicists were there.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,160
Unfortunately, most classicists today,

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,160
they're focused on things that are more to build careers

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
and garbage, essentially.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,160
So a lot of texts, a lot of these ancient texts

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,360
that we've got, they aren't translated even.

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
I've got an entire book that I brought to show to you

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
that is from the 1800s, it's Galen.

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,400
And these things are untranslated.

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,320
It's all in Greek.

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,160
I have the physical copies sitting in my bag.

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,040
So what pushed you in the direction

81
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,240
to be interested in this stuff?

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,360
Did you have a religious childhood

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,080
or a religious upbringing?

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Or what got you into this?

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,360
Jesus got me into this.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
Yeah, I actually-

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
When you were how old?

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh, God, when I was like 13.

89
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
When you were 13.

90
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah, no.

91
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,280
So you were religious when you were a child.

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
Oh, yes, I was born again.

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
Love Jesus Christ.

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,080
Oh, Jesus.

95
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,880
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,480
I used to teach you to mission.

97
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
Are you kidding me?

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
I used to convert people.

99
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,840
I used to have mostly drunks, mostly drunks.

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,480
And I don't know, we were like a place for them to go

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,880
and to sober up, but they had to listen to my crap.

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, excuse me.

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,440
They had to listen to my sermon in order to get that meal.

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Cause that's how we spread, brother.

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
Do you understand?

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,680
I converted souls into mission.

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
You converted souls to Christianity when you were 13?

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
No, I started doing that when I was like 17.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,960
When you were 17.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
Yeah.

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,880
I was teaching Sunday school class too,

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,040
cause their Sunday school teachers sucked.

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Really?

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
Yeah.

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,200
How does a 17 year old get to start teaching Sunday school?

116
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,440
Did your parents get you into this stuff?

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,680
Oh, of course, you know, you know,

118
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,520
through the family and through some very intelligent teachers

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
like Dr. J. Vernon McKee.

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,240
Oh God, beloved Dallas theologian.

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
You know what I mean?

122
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,560
Dallas Theological Seminary.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I went there for three months

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
and their Greek program was so bad.

125
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,400
I said, I went to the president of the university.

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,160
I said, hey, it's not up to stuff.

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,440
His name was Walbert, John Walbert.

128
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,960
I said, your program isn't up to snuff.

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,200
What's the, your Greek program is terrible, right?

130
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,640
So I went on to university to get a PhD and...

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,160
So going back to the early childhood stuff.

132
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
When you were in your teens,

134
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,240
you said you were teaching Sunday school.

135
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,480
What particularly were you teaching

137
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,920
and was there some point in your life

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,120
that led you to question?

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,480
The teachings of the Bible

140
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,040
and the teachings of the church

141
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
and everything you knew when you were young?

142
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
I got there through Aristotle.

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
So I saw, here's what happened.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,280
I saw how bad the standards were

145
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,680
on the Christian side for ancient Greek.

146
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,000
And I said, I've got to follow a track

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,080
to be able to get there.

148
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,560
And it went through the sciences.

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,040
It went through the sciences.

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,320
And I think what happened was

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,560
when I was 21, I just cracked.

152
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,800
I was reading Aristotle.

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,800
And the pure, unadulterated glory of his reason.

154
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,720
And you're talking about Greek, you're reading Greek?

155
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
Yeah.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
What?

157
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Yeah.

158
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
So how did you learn Greek at 21?

159
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,680
Because I went to a special high school, first of all.

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Okay.

161
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,600
Shout out to the people from special projects.

162
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Special projects?

163
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,640
That was its first name.

164
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,160
Everybody, you had a test to get into it, right?

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Uh-huh.

166
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,880
Everybody that I was around is somehow involved

167
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,880
in military, government, stuff like that.

168
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,720
We won the chess championship two years in a row.

169
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,800
National chess championship, right?

170
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Bunch of nerds, right?

171
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Total nerds.

172
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
So I knew I would be going to learn about Jesus

173
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,360
at a seminary someday, because that was my bent.

174
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,200
I saved people, you know?

175
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
And you said when you were saving people,

176
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,320
you were saving alcoholics, drunks, rather?

177
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,280
They were the easy peckins.

178
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,960
So what did they do?

179
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
They just came to you?

180
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
They said, my life is terrible?

181
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
No, it's a mission.

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,440
So they check in for the evening.

183
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,960
They're gonna sit and listen to us preach.

184
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
Then they give them dinner.

185
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,000
They're mostly there to get fed, you know?

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Right.

187
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,240
You know, charity, so to speak.

188
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,760
But I was the one who was saving souls.

189
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,200
That was my thing.

190
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,160
It was delicious.

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,800
Have you never saved a soul?

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
Probably not, no.

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
No?

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,200
Oh, you should try.

195
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Well, I'll have to learn.

196
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
It's yummy.

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,240
Okay, so you're doing this in your early teens,

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,880
saving souls in a mission, it's called a mission.

199
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,320
Okay.

200
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,080
And then you decide in your early 20s,

201
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,840
you're gonna learn Greek at the high school you're at.

202
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,720
No, I started, that was my high school.

203
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Right after that, I went to the University of Arizona.

204
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Okay.

205
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,400
And started their classics program there.

206
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,840
And I went through in three years and ate it up

207
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
and went to Tel Megiddo at the time

208
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,880
and did a dig at Tel Megiddo in Israel.

209
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,600
So, okay, so you said you did a classics program

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,820
at the University of Arizona.

211
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,000
When you first went into that program in college,

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,920
what was your goal?

213
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,280
What were you looking for anything?

214
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
Did you, what did you wanna learn?

215
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Jesus.

216
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,720
You wanted to learn about Jesus.

217
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
Yes.

218
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Okay.

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Okay.

220
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah, I think so.

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah, all right.

222
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,760
I think so.

223
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this, man.

224
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm trying to understand your curiosity here.

225
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
That's, I'm just trying to,

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm trying to dig deep into the psyche of Amon Hillman.

227
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Okay, I love it.

228
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay, so that's when you learned Greek.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes.

230
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,040
Was it hard to learn Greek?

231
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah, and you never stop.

232
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
You never stop.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm not kidding you.

234
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,480
I can take a text right now,

235
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,640
throw it in front of any classicist in the world,

236
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,480
and have the, and say translate it,

237
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,480
and they'll be like, mm, yeah, mm, mm, ah, no, notice.

238
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,360
I can do that with notice right now,

239
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,040
throw it in front of 98% of the classes out there,

240
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,880
they'll stumble on it.

241
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
The ones who have done notice,

242
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,600
they'll be able to get it.

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Why is notice so hard to translate?

244
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,320
Cause he's using an archaic style.

245
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,040
He's trying to do something

246
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,960
that they were doing a thousand years previous to him.

247
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

248
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
And he's putting together the longest epic.

249
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,760
It's about Dionysus and a bunch of

250
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,080
aero poison used in women.

251
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,240
Oh, wow, aero poison.

252
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Yeah.

253
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Interesting.

254
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Hot, hot stuff.

255
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
Yeah.

256
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,520
Yeah, it also causes satiriasis.

257
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,920
It's a drug, yeah.

258
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
Okay.

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
Do you know what satiriasis is?

260
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
No, what's a satiriasis?

261
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
A satir.

262
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,520
Satir.

263
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,360
Yeah.

264
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
What is a satir?

265
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,240
A satir is a guy who walks around

266
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,840
with an arachn constantly, no, constant.

267
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
How does he have an arachn constantly?

268
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Constant, unremitting arachn.

269
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Hmm.

270
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,360
Yeah.

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,280
The old Spanish fly in there.

272
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh God, keeps it hard all the time.

273
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,960
You can kill a person they say after seven days,

274
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,920
you gotta stop them.

275
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
Oh, really?

276
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
Yeah.

277
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Wow.

278
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
That's what they say in antiquity, seven days.

279
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
I don't know, how'd they find out?

280
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
Hmm.

281
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,920
Okay, so going back to your college,

282
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,360
you're studying Greek and then you said,

283
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
at what point did you go to Israel

284
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
and why did you go to Israel?

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Yeah, right after my Bachelors went to Israel

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
and stayed there for a year and worked on the Megiddo,

287
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
tell Megiddo excavation.

288
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
What is that?

289
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,640
For people who don't know.

290
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,400
People who don't know anything about this stuff.

291
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
No, that's okay.

292
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Why would they?

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
It's the place of Armageddon.

294
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,520
So it's a site in Israel.

295
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
And it has a temple.

296
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Our team discovered the temple floor that was there.

297
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,440
It's a Canaanite temple floor under everything.

298
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
And that dates back, the last time I saw,

299
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
they thought that dated back to about 4,000 BC.

300
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,120
So, and I don't use the, about 4,000 BC.

301
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,520
So it was a momentous, wondrous excavation.

302
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,080
And I'm proud to have been part of it.

303
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Yeah.

304
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
What kind of stuff did you find?

305
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,840
I found a chicken.

306
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Chicken?

307
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,520
Yeah, I found a chicken

308
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,360
because I was digging the old French dump heap.

309
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,000
What they found that was so important

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,520
was the floor of a Canaanite temple

311
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,160
were these Canaanite priestesses in 4,000 BC

312
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,400
where all the power, where all the authority is,

313
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,400
oops, is there, yeah, tell Megiddo,

314
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
there it is, I'm sorry, I'm distracted.

315
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
That's it.

316
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Yeah, tell Megiddo.

317
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,760
And it's a wonderful site.

318
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
And I tell you, I slept,

319
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,520
the most interesting part of the story is

320
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,320
I slept in the vineyard of Jezebel.

321
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
So what did you learn from the stuff

322
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,640
you found at Tell Megiddo?

323
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,040
The earliest occupation was probably

324
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,520
by these Canaanite populations there.

325
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Which was 4,000 BC?

326
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Yeah, they've got a circular dance floor

327
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,440
for them to be worshiping whatever divinities it is

328
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
that they worship.

329
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,320
And these are like the Phoenicians.

330
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
It's all up and down the coast.

331
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Jezebel was a Phoenician princess baby, you know what I mean?

332
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,360
So they had a circular dance floor.

333
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
Yeah, right, is that unimpressive?

334
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
It's very impressive, for 4,000 years ago,

335
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
it's very impressive.

336
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
Well, move on, because when I was in the vineyard

337
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,960
of Jezebel, these guys that went nuts,

338
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,640
they got up at night and they sat there

339
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,920
and they talked and they told me

340
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,560
what was gonna happen to me.

341
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
What they say was gonna happen to you?

342
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,520
On successive nights, they said a troop

343
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,520
of demons will assist you to bring the Antichrist.

344
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
Yeah.

345
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
Who said that?

346
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
Two guys on two successive nights were nuts.

347
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,360
There were people with us on the excavation, right?

348
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,400
We're working during the day and in the evenings,

349
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,520
we're sleeping and people are waking up

350
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,160
in their sleep and talking to me and then going nuts.

351
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,960
Is that thunder?

352
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,600
This is amazing, we're doing this podcast

353
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
in the middle of the thunderstorm.

354
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
Yeah, we got a storm.

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
So these guys told you, what about the Antichrist?

356
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,160
They said I would be protected by a troop of demons.

357
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,280
A troop of demons?

358
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,600
Yeah, and they said it on successive nights.

359
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
So like the first guy, Moshe, he went totally nuts, right?

360
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,240
He sat up in bed, 2 a.m., started talking to me like a puppet.

361
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,320
The next morning runs off, boom,

362
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,800
the head of the kibbutz where we're staying comes to me,

363
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,320
he says, what's going on?

364
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,360
I said, off he goes, I don't know, right?

365
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,440
The next night, I didn't think it was odd.

366
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,320
I love Jesus at this point.

367
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,840
I didn't think it was odd, but on the next night,

368
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,600
the dude that they replaced him with,

369
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,680
he did the same thing, he sat up in bed,

370
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,360
he gave me the same message.

371
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,960
You'll be protected by a troop of demons.

372
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,440
A troop of demons, for what purpose?

373
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,160
To bring the Antichrist.

374
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
What did you make of that?

375
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,320
I thought he was nuts the first time he said it.

376
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
The second time he said it, I thought, wow,

377
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
this place is like, what happened?

378
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,640
Is there some kind of material in the ground

379
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
or something out here?

380
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
Making these people crazy?

381
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,520
You know what I mean?

382
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,600
Many people, the head of the kibbutz came to me

383
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
and she said, what's going on?

384
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,440
And I said, what do you mean?

385
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
She said, what's going on?

386
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
Two of your roommates have gone totally nuts.

387
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
I said, how if I know?

388
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah, yeah, what would you expect me to say?

389
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
When they claimed that I was able to levitate

390
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,480
through doors at the university

391
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,480
and they had an inquiry as to my state of demon possession.

392
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,800
When was this?

393
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,760
When I worked for St. Mary's University.

394
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,920
So this is much later?

395
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah.

396
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,800
Okay, let's try to stay on track.

397
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,640
Let's stay on track.

398
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's try to stay like in a, wow.

399
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
You see what happens?

400
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,560
Are you sure you're not the Antichrist?

401
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,240
There's just a rain cloud that follows him around

402
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,080
everywhere.

403
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,920
Yeah.

404
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,120
What is the Christ?

405
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,400
What is the Antichrist?

406
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,360
What is the Christ if you have to know them?

407
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Antichrist, you have to know the Christ.

408
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,200
Right.

409
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,080
It's a Greek word.

410
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,440
For?

411
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,240
For applying a drug to your eyes

412
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,320
so that they may be open.

413
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,680
That's what the Christ means in Greek.

414
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,520
Yes.

415
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
It's from the verb chrio,

416
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,200
to be stung by the gadfly.

417
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Huh.

418
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,080
Who is the gadfly?

419
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,080
Who is the gadfly?

420
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah, I don't know.

421
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,480
Socrates said he was.

422
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,800
It's a thing they had going on.

423
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Remember they have orcs and stuff like that.

424
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
So you better buckle up.

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
All right.

426
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,840
But what does that have to do with the gadfly?

427
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
I mean, we think it's...

428
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,240
No, no, oistress to be stung.

429
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,360
It's a state of mania.

430
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
They call it in Greek, oistromania.

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,840
Okay.

432
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,880
To be in an altered state.

433
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,360
Right, right, right.

434
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Okay, anyways, let's go back to your in Israel, right?

435
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,760
You're doing this excavation.

436
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,920
You're finding all this stuff.

437
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,280
These crazy people come up to you

438
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
telling you that you're protected by a troop of demons.

439
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,520
How long did you stay there?

440
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,720
And then what did you do after that?

441
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,840
A year and a month.

442
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,640
And then I decided, okay, I've maxed out

443
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,280
what's my interest here.

444
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,120
Okay.

445
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,800
Came back and enrolled in another program

446
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,000
which ended up, a master's program,

447
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
ended up sending me to a lab where I cut brains.

448
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Cut brains?

449
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,160
Yeah.

450
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay.

451
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
What were you cutting brains for?

452
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,480
To identify neuropeptides.

453
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,360
Oh, okay.

454
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,840
Yeah.

455
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,680
On the science.

456
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Is this your study in bacteriology?

457
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
No, it hadn't gone to the back T

458
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
but it's what led to the back T.

459
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,960
I wanted to bolster my science education.

460
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,120
So I did a lot of like...

461
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,640
Neuropeptides, what's a neuropeptide?

462
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Yeah, it's a peptide that is active in the brain

463
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,240
as part of a signaling system.

464
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
So we talk about communication

465
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
between the hypothalamus and the pituitary

466
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
and how puberty is regulated.

467
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
That was a big one.

468
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,880
We were looking for the peptide

469
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,640
that brings on premature puberty.

470
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,760
Do you hear that?

471
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,000
That's, those are souls swirling around outside.

472
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,120
Dude, that's loud.

473
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,960
Yeah.

474
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,800
Is that rain?

475
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,720
Yeah.

476
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,920
Rain or wind blowing the rain?

477
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,760
God.

478
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,880
God.

479
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,720
So the neuropeptides that were responsible for puberty?

480
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,600
Yeah, the onset of puberty.

481
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,000
What made you so interested in that?

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
They had a grant for it.

483
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
It wasn't mine, they had a grant.

484
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,200
You just got thrown into it?

485
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,680
It's for premature, yeah.

486
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,560
It's for people who have early onset puberty.

487
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,400
Okay.

488
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Is there a problem with that?

489
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,040
Well, hell yeah, there's a problem with that.

490
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,880
What's the problem?

491
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,560
All my stuff is time with growth.

492
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,240
What causes it?

493
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,160
Peptides go astray in the brain.

494
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,600
But what makes the peptides go astray?

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,520
Is there some sort of external influences?

496
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,400
We didn't know at the time what it was.

497
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
That's what I was doing.

498
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
This is where I am in the experiment.

499
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
It's not an experiment, it's just an investigation.

500
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,600
But you're tagging.

501
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,440
You take an antibody conjugated substance

502
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,080
and it's either something that fluoresces

503
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,680
or it's a dye of some sort.

504
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,120
And you localize where these peptides are

505
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,120
in the brains of these things that you sacrificed.

506
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,480
Yeah.

507
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,320
Animals?

508
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, we used to drill holes in animals' heads.

509
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,680
And then put in a little catheter, a little tube.

510
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,480
And then you can insert a substance,

511
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,520
anything you want, anything.

512
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,680
You could insert orange juice if you wanted.

513
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,160
But we would insert substances

514
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,320
and then take another collector and see what

515
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,640
the hypothalamus did.

516
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
And it was beautiful.

517
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,160
It was a beautiful, beautiful finding.

518
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,240
Because they were mapping.

519
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,920
At the time, people were mapping how the brain works.

520
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
And this is how they were figuring out

521
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,840
what the hypothalamus does.

522
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,600
Yeah, absolutely.

523
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,840
Yeah.

524
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
That's interesting stuff.

525
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah, I was proud to be a part of it.

526
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,280
It was good, good education.

527
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,600
How long did you do those studies?

528
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,560
A couple of years.

529
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,400
A couple of years.

530
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,240
Uh-huh.

531
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah, I taught endocrinology, too.

532
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh, did you really?

533
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,720
Well, everybody in the grad program had to.

534
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
You taught endocrinology?

535
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Yeah, uh-huh.

536
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
Yeah, I did the brain part of it.

537
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,280
So, and you had to, graduate students had to.

538
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,240
Like the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the...

539
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,400
The third ventricle, man.

540
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,680
You know what that is?

541
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,720
What's the third ventricle?

542
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,800
It's an open space in the middle of your head.

543
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,640
Really?

544
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,320
It's filled with a fluid.

545
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,920
It's the water of life.

546
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,080
The water of life.

547
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,720
Yeah, and this fluid has all this...

548
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
Did people in ancient times try to drink that water of life

549
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
from people's heads?

550
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
You know they did.

551
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,600
Do you want to see the texts?

552
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm sure the texts can verify this.

553
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,400
Baby brains, man.

554
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,520
Baby brains.

555
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah.

556
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,600
No, no, they used to bleed them, too.

557
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,480
So, is this, what is this, Steve?

558
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,960
What are we looking at?

559
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,880
This is the third ventricle.

560
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,720
Beautiful.

561
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
Okay, the third ventricle.

562
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,600
Is it just to say it's just liquid in there or what?

563
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,520
Yeah, it's a pristine pool.

564
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
It's beyond...

565
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,520
What is the purpose of it?

566
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,360
What is it?

567
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,200
What is the function?

568
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,520
To carry the messengers.

569
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,360
That's the scientific description of what it does.

570
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,200
Yeah, actually it is.

571
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Really?

572
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,880
Yeah.

573
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Yeah.

574
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,600
Because it's communicating with all the tissue

575
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
that it's overlapping.

576
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,640
It's communicating.

577
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,480
Mm, okay.

578
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,400
And that little special area of the brain,

579
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,000
there's the three ventricles,

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,320
is like pristine.

581
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,080
That has to be the purest,

582
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
totally beyond the barrier for any sort of infection.

583
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,320
If you've got an infection there, you're dead.

584
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,160
Really?

585
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah.

586
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
Wow.

587
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,840
That's interesting.

588
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
Yeah, lots of brains.

589
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,760
I cut up lots of brains.

590
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,160
So, at what point in your life

591
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,200
did you start writing this infamous dissertation

592
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
that got suppressed by the heads of the department

593
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,200
in classics when you wrote,

594
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,320
when you started writing about the use of drugs and antiquity?

595
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
That's a perfect.

596
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
From that exact point,

597
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
I picked up some, a professor,

598
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Professor Romer came to me.

599
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
Professor Romer.

600
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah.

601
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
Frank Romer.

602
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,960
Frank Romer.

603
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
University of Wisconsin.

604
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,480
Yeah, at the time, he was at University of Wisconsin.

605
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I think he went out somewhere in California.

606
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,560
Mm-hmm.

607
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,840
But Frank Romer, and he said,

608
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
hey, he said, I know you're,

609
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,160
when I was on the science side, he said,

610
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,560
I already had him in classics, right?

611
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,920
So he knew what my interests were.

612
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,320
And he said, here, we have a whole bunch of documents

613
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,680
that are, nobody's ever translated from Greek.

614
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
Have at it.

615
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,160
It was like a, you know, the greatest gift.

616
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Where did you find those documents?

617
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,400
Everywhere they've been for the last 2000 years.

618
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,240
Where?

619
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Just sitting there.

620
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,160
Where on his desk?

621
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,200
In libraries.

622
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,040
Oh, really?

623
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Yeah.

624
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,760
Nobody reads them.

625
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,000
Classes just don't do it.

626
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
You know why?

627
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Why?

628
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Because they're hard.

629
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,520
They're hard.

630
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,480
Because these Greeks are smart.

631
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
They're smart.

632
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
And these pharma, how many,

633
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,120
how many classes do you think no pharmacology?

634
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,960
Yeah.

635
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,780
I have no idea.

636
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,620
Oh, zero.

637
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,460
Zero.

638
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,840
Zero, yeah.

639
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,400
They don't do the medical stuff.

640
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,280
It's a shame.

641
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
It's a shame.

642
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,960
So I went to the-

643
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
Well, that's just like any field, right?

644
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,440
A lot of people who are experts in certain fields

645
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,320
or certain disciplines, they don't have a wide variety

646
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,680
of skills or disciplines as well.

647
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,360
They're typically just in one lane.

648
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,240
You gotta talk to a lot of people.

649
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,400
Or you gotta be a jack of all trades.

650
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
Interdisciplinary.

651
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,560
Interdisciplinary.

652
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Yeah.

653
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,240
That's a good word.

654
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,080
Love that.

655
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,360
You keep one foot on either side of the fence.

656
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,520
You know what I mean?

657
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
Yeah.

658
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,280
Yeah.

659
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,240
So I went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison

660
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,240
to work with the country's best medical historian.

661
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,560
Who was, and what's his name again?

662
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
John Scarborough.

663
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,080
John Scarborough.

664
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah.

665
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,480
And he had a knowledge of the medical side as well.

666
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,320
Okay.

667
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,160
But he was also a great Byzantine.

668
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
He did a ton of the Byzantine sources.

669
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,160
He was one of the translators

670
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,560
of the Greek magical papyri.

671
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,720
So that in, it's a big deal.

672
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
It's a big deal.

673
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,400
Come on.

674
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
Can you explain what the magical papyri is?

675
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,080
Yeah.

676
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,160
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Mudwater.

677
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,880
Mudwater is a coffee alternative

678
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
containing four adaptogenic mushrooms.

679
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
With only a fraction of the caffeine as a cup of coffee,

680
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,080
you get energy without the jitters or the crash of coffee.

681
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,760
And each ingredient was added for a purpose.

682
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,000
Cacao and chai for a hint of caffeine

683
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,560
and hot chocolate-like flavor,

684
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,320
lion's mane to support focus,

685
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,600
cordyceps to help support physical performance,

686
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,880
and both chaga and reishi to support your immune system.

687
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,400
What I really love about Mudwater is that it tastes great

688
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,560
and they took their time to find all the perfect ingredients

689
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,720
to develop a product that helps you feel better

690
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,840
every single day.

691
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,320
Mudwater donates monthly to psychedelic research

692
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,040
and treatments as they believe the country

693
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,480
is in a mental health epidemic

694
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,240
and sees psychedelics as useful tools for individuals

695
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,720
with depression, PTSD, anxiety,

696
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,400
and other mental health experiences.

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,000
Now back to the show.

704
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,040
Yeah, it's a collection of Greek works.

705
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,480
It's all about some of the dirtiest cult magic stuff

706
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
that you've ever seen.

707
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,440
People who say they know Gnosticism,

708
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,040
they haven't read this thing in Greek.

709
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,440
They don't know what they're talking about.

710
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,440
This is the one where we get all the body fluids

711
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,440
that are being used for the sake of medicine.

712
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,120
Okay, it's in this papyri.

713
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,560
And who knows, one source, one source.

715
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,640
We'll get into this more later, so let's go back to...

716
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,760
So it was studying with him.

717
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah, studying and developing your...

718
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,720
He gives you these papers, these texts to translate.

719
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,840
And this is when you first discovered the use of drugs

720
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,320
or the idea of drugs being ubiquitous and antiquity.

721
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,360
Yeah, I was studying ancient pharmacology.

722
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,240
That was what my area was.

723
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,680
That's what I was forging.

724
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,440
Okay, and you already knew about Galen, right?

725
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,080
You'd already been studying Galen.

726
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Yeah, I know, and I had been to a conference in England

727
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,160
and the London Times said,

728
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,800
wow, this guy's work is the last wild frontier of classics,

729
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,240
you know, and they're right,

730
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,040
because nobody does this stuff.

731
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
Nobody does it.

732
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
For people also, to give some more context

733
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,600
to people who are listening, who is Galen?

734
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
Can you explain who Galen was?

735
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah, Galen is a second century physician of...

736
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,720
He works for Marcus Aurelius, the emperor,

737
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,520
and he's probably one of the greatest

738
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,840
intellects of Western civilization.

739
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,640
Definitely, he was a...

740
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
He wrote thousands and thousands and thousands of pages,

741
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
and probably 10% of it has been translated.

742
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,960
If that...

743
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,800
Wow.

744
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,880
And nobody goes near the pharmaceutical stuff.

745
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,920
Now, in 2013, I saw for the first time

746
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,760
a dissertation was written

747
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,760
in which the person translated Galen's theriac to Piso.

748
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
What's a theriac?

749
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,120
A theriac is a multi-drug component

750
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,240
that's used to balance a poison or deathbringer,

751
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,560
they call them.

752
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,520
To balance a poison or deathbringer,

753
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,640
so like an antidote?

754
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,800
Yeah, exactly an antidote,

755
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,600
but they called it a galenic reaction

756
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,560
unrelated to the reason of Galen.

757
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,600
A galenic reaction, that's to bring the balance

758
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
of the one that can kill you

759
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,640
with the one that can keep you alive.

760
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
Bring those together, that's the theriac, baby.

761
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
Wow, interesting.

762
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,160
What's the point of that?

763
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,200
To die and to be born again.

764
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,720
To die and to be born again.

765
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,040
Wow.

766
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,880
Okay.

767
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah, do you want...

768
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,360
How much Galen have you read?

769
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,680
Considerable, yeah, considerable.

770
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
How many...

771
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,680
I mean, ideally, how many pages?

772
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,800
Oh, God, thousands.

773
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,640
Thousands?

774
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah.

775
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
And he's written how much?

776
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Oh, 22 volumes at 1,008,

777
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,080
so somewhere around 22,000 pages.

778
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,000
And where does all this literature exist?

779
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Like, where is it being held?

780
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,040
It's held currently in a book that's sitting out in my...

781
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,960
You have all of it?

782
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,200
Yeah, I got it from Johns Hopkins.

783
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,040
Wow.

784
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,480
Yeah, because Professor Scarborough

785
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,360
was in with all the book traders, right?

786
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,680
And they were like, oh, shit,

787
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,320
Galen has become available.

788
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,160
Okay.

789
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
Can I run out and get Galen?

790
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,080
Yeah, go grab it.

791
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
And show you.

792
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,760
Go grab it.

793
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,400
He's got an original Galen book.

794
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,520
Here he comes with the original...

795
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,160
Original...

796
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,000
1840.

797
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
This is from 1840?

798
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, what's the date say on it?

799
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,240
1827.

800
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
There you go.

801
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,920
Look, I was not even close.

802
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Omnia, Coon, 14, 1827.

803
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,560
Yeah, I was off a few years.

804
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,320
So...

805
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
So open it up and you'll see the...

806
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,680
It's basically, Danny, it's a medical text

807
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
for physicians in the early 1800s.

808
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,600
Right?

809
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,440
What are they studying?

810
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,400
They're studying Galen.

811
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,360
You asked me who Galen was?

812
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,200
Guess what?

813
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,280
He's the dude who dominated medicine

814
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,840
from the second century when he lived

815
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,680
until that book that you're holding, right?

816
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,720
This is the last set.

817
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
You're talking the second century BC, right?

818
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah.

819
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,080
No, no, no, I know Domini.

820
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,920
Oh, okay.

821
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,440
Yeah, Marcus Aurelius.

822
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,480
Yeah.

823
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
This is his physician.

824
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,140
By the way,

825
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,840
he says in here that Marcus Aurelius is a total dopehead.

826
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,200
What language is this?

827
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,480
Greek on the top, Latin on the bottom.

828
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,740
And the Latin translation is garbage.

829
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,480
Right?

830
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,320
Wow.

831
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh man, this is...

832
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:06,040
wild. Yeah. Now what you're holding there is volume 14 of a 22 volume set from Johns Hopkins.

833
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,520
As you can see those backers put their mark all over it. By the way, isn't that beautiful paper?

834
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,600
Look at this. Look at this, everybody. That's centuries old centuries. Think about it. Look at

835
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,360
that. Right? Oh, it's gorgeous. It's a work of art. It's a work of art. But pages is a 700,

836
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:33,080
800 pages. 800 pages. Now think about it's volume 14, which is one of 14 books. Yeah,

837
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,440
it's one of 22. But it is 14. And 14 is all about the pharmacology of the antidotes.

838
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,440
And nobody looks into that stuff. And Galen says Marcus Aurelius is a total doped. He's on way too

839
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,640
much. What was he on specifically? The theriac. It's a combination of plants and animal products

840
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:04,040
that is meant to balance a cult ritual drug called the Black Death. The cult ritual drug that was

841
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:14,360
called the Black Death. Yeah. This is from Nero's library. Right? Nero has his arch physician

842
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:25,320
get this formula from the east for the theriac. The theriac is meant to balance the cup of Lady

843
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:33,080
Babylon. Okay. Let's go back to, I think I feel like we're starting to go down a rabbit hole.

844
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,240
We're just going to be hard for us to get out of. Yes. So I want to make sure we explain

845
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,760
this story in a linear fashion so people can follow it and don't get lost.

846
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:52,600
You're studying Galen, right? And you're working on your dissertation. And what happens next?

847
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,880
Oh, so from my dissertation, I did it on Roman pharmacy. Okay. Right. Roman pharmacy. Roman pharmacy.

848
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Nobody's written to work on Roman pharmacy. And I had already done the translation and commentary

849
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,000
for a master's thesis. That's usually what they give to doctoral students. I had done one for a

850
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,400
master's thesis and I was like, I'm not doing that again. So I'm going to write a text that's just

851
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:23,560
kind of a general Roman pharmacy text so that people can learn about drugs and the ancient world.

852
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,960
And the committee told me take out the chapter on recreational drugs or we're not going to give you

853
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,600
the degree. So you only had one chapter that was about recreational drugs?

854
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,360
Yeah. Yeah. The rest were all medicinal. Oh, wow. Yeah.

855
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,280
But didn't you say that they didn't distinguish between recreational and medicinal? Is that

856
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,240
right? No, that's exactly right. We were distinguishing. We do it now, but they didn't.

857
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah. Back then, things that you and I would call recreational, they didn't consider recreational.

858
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:04,280
They considered medicinal. Right. So curing depression is a medicinal process.

859
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,040
How long did you spend on this dissertation? Oh, couple of years.

860
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,920
Couple of years. Yeah. And then so there was one specific moment, a date where you had to go in

861
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:25,000
to, I guess, receive your judging on it or get graded on it or get a feedback on it. I have no

862
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,920
idea how this process works. You have to walk me through it. Yeah. So you write your dissertation

863
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,680
and you take it before your defense. Before your defense. Okay. Yeah. And your committee there is

864
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,480
a group of professors and usually there's one from outside the department just so the university

865
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:48,440
stays kind of impartial. You know what I mean? And so it's a committee of professors. Anyway,

866
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,240
you present your dissertation to them and then they tell you, you're terrible. They tell you,

867
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:04,280
you're terrible. Yeah. Or they pass you and you get to walk out and say, I have a doctoral degree.

868
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,160
So they told me at the end, they're supposed to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. They didn't

869
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:17,240
give me anything. And I was standing there looking around like, what? Right. And I met with the head

870
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,800
of the department and was told, you have to take out the chapter on recreational drugs

871
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,600
and you have to scrub any references to recreational drugs and the rest of the work.

872
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,880
And you're fine. Yeah. What was your response?

873
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:42,840
She said, the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing. This is the head of the department.

874
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,240
And by that time I had seen so much stuff the Romans were doing. I was like, oh my God,

875
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:58,680
I understand what's going on. They're building a ceiling that we can't get beyond. It doesn't exist.

876
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,360
We should be able to go right through that thing with these texts. We can do that.

877
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:10,280
Anyhow, so I took the material and I sent it to Macmillan. I just scrubbed it and then I sent it

878
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:19,080
to Macmillan and they accepted it. Thomas Dunn accepted it. And it was fantastic.

879
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,480
Macmillan is what? It was St. Martin's Press. Publishing company. Yeah, publishing company,

880
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,800
St. Martin's Press. And that's what became the book, the famous book that you created,

881
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,320
the Chemical Muse. Correct. Correct. And once you scrub, you decided to scrub the chapter from

882
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,840
your dissertation and any sort of reference to drugs whatsoever, and then they accepted it and

883
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,640
gave you your PhD. Any references to recreational drugs? Recreational. Because there are a whole

884
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:58,120
bunch of drugs all over it, right? For healing, right? I mean, drugs that you use in anesthesia.

885
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,600
Right, right, right, right. You know, what did they use? Yeah, fantastic.

886
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,600
What was the response after your book, The Chemical Muse, was published?

887
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:16,920
The Brentmore Classical Review came out, which is the big reviewer. And a European professor,

888
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:26,120
French, came out and said, this book is dangerous. He said it shouldn't be read

889
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,880
at any university, anytime, ever. And he was like, what year are we talking?

890
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:47,400
This was 2008. 2008. Okay. And so it was it was roundly ignored, you know,

891
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,480
put into the, the guy said, this guy obviously has a drug agenda.

892
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,640
I was like, no, let's just talk about the drugs because they don't read these texts. Now,

893
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,800
that same journalist has gone and talked to the aforementioned Brentmore Classical Reviewist.

894
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,360
And now they're writing a book about shamanism, all the same stuff, all the same material. It's

895
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,080
because they didn't know it. And it was the first one to sort of uncover the stuff and make it pop,

896
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:25,160
make it known. I was not the first. I would say I was the one who took it and it

897
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,600
took the big picture of it. I was the first one to bring the science side.

898
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,960
Who was the first one? Carl Rock. Carl Rock.

899
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,120
Yeah. No, because he said, look, he said they're using something in the Ellisonian Mysteries.

900
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,480
Right. He was already looking at, he didn't have any problem with the concept that he coined

901
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,920
entheogens, right? These are substances that are in theos that bring that divine being into you.

902
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,600
It's a whole class of drugs they were using, excuse me, they were using.

903
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,200
Have you ever had any conversations about Carl Rock with the stuff that you discovered and

904
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,720
the stuff you talk about in the Chemical Muse? Yeah, I've had the pleasure. Once the Chemical

905
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:22,600
Muse was published, they sent it to Dr. Rock for consideration. Because he's the only one

906
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:29,160
who had been on the list of people who had talked about drugs. And he got shamed. He got completely

907
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:37,640
shamed. Well, look, it seems like this idea and the idea of drugs being used back then

908
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,920
is becoming more and more accepted. I mean, you got people like Brian Merrescu and Graham Hancock.

909
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,680
You know, I think Brian's new book is called, or his latest book is the Immortality Key,

910
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,080
where he talks about the mystery cults of Elusis and the Ergot. I know Brian.

911
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,920
Oh, really? Yeah. How did you guys meet?

912
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,960
Professor Rock sent him to me to get the medical stuff.

913
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,600
So you guys spoke about when he was working on his book?

914
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah, we had a couple of interviews before when he came up with the idea.

915
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,480
Gave him a couple of interviews about what the sources are and what the extent of the stuff is.

916
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:30,680
He said, do you mind if I mention you and Joe Rogan? And I said, yes, go ahead and do that.

917
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,600
But if you do, you have to mention that Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park with a

918
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,360
boy at 4 a.m., screaming, I'm not a trafficker. You made sure you told him he needed to say that?

919
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,640
You had to say that exact phrase. So he didn't.

920
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:57,320
So he chose. So he chose. Yes. Right, right. Look, I mean, it was really interesting to me

921
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:08,600
reading your book, and I was really gripped by what you sort of uncovered, which it makes

922
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:16,280
a lot of sense when you really think about it, that life back then, life in antiquity was terrible.

923
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:27,000
And people didn't die from heart disease and from diabetes and from old age like they do today.

924
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,720
They died from hand to hand combat and plagues and famine. And to live back then was a miserable

925
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,920
existence for the most part. Infant mortality was what, like 50%. And they needed these drugs

926
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,640
just to get through the day. And the warriors fighting these wars, they needed to take these

927
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:53,960
drugs to suffer these insurmountable wounds they would have to suffer in battle.

928
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,160
Can you talk a little bit to that and to some of the details that you uncover in your book about

929
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,000
what life was like and how hard it was and the amount of death and plague and famine and how

930
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,600
these drugs were used to curb these sort of ailments? Yeah, yeah. The best way is to resurrect

931
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:23,880
the soul of Hippocrates and to look at the works that he wrote called The Epidemics in which he

932
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,080
describes all the diseases that people are getting, what they're suffering from, all the ailments. Oh,

933
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,160
my God, you know what herpes does when it goes untreated? No. Oh, Hippocrates has descriptions

934
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,560
of it. They call it herpes because their word herpeton is their word for a snake or something

935
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,760
that slithers, something that crawls because that's what herpes does when it goes untreated.

936
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:56,600
It crawls all over you. It rots you. Thank God, I don't know. You get descriptions of this kind

937
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:04,520
of stuff and you see life on a different level. One third of women were having death as a side

938
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:11,160
effect of birth. One third of women were dying from childbirth. Problems are bleeding. Right, right.

939
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,800
They're constantly trying to control bleeding and whatnot. Yeah, with drugs, with drugs.

940
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,720
Miserable. And about a third of the population of the youth from in the late teens, that's getting

941
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,880
eaten off. That's getting eaten off. They become soldiers and a certain number of those get

942
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:40,040
sacrificed. It's not a cheapness. They don't have it. There isn't a sense of futility

943
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,280
It's looked at as a sacrifice. And what point in history are we talking about?

944
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,840
Oh, God, far back is the Bronze Age, all the way down to about Byzantine. The Bronze Age is,

945
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,680
what, more than older than the 5th century? Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. In the best time,

946
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,520
the Bronze Age. It was a late Bronze Age, around 1200 to 1100. 1200 to 1100. Yeah, that's where

947
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,400
some of these oldest texts that you've read come from. Yeah, the Mycenaean linear beast

948
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:17,320
stuff comes from like 1600 BC, which is that spectacular. They've got Dionysus and all that

949
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:26,200
stuff. I worked with him, Bennett, who was a Navy cryptographer who studied crack linear B.

950
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:37,800
And in it, we have the name Dionysus. He's the son of Zeus, the Thunder.

951
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:47,240
And it was a gorgeous, gorgeous world to be able to follow that. But that's where the Greek

952
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:55,320
can take you. Sign up for courses now. Well, let me ask you this. This is sort of like broad strokes

953
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:04,040
questions. Yeah. What, how did your development, your understanding of these ancient texts and

954
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,960
reading this ancient Greek and even the Hebrew, everything that you've read, how did that change

955
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,560
your perspective on religion and Christianity and Catholicism? You were raised what, Christian or

956
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:22,040
Catholic? I love Jesus, man. I was, I don't know. What was your family? Baptist. Baptist. Okay, okay.

957
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:31,800
So once you start to understand the history and the texts, how did this change your worldview of

958
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:42,520
religion? And what sort of like misconceptions did you have that were shattered by this understanding?

959
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:54,040
I had a long-term relationship with a muse. So the whole time that I'm developing this educationally,

960
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,280
oh, look, I was just going to bring the Antichrist.

961
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,680
It's happening, guys. The Antichrist is coming, everybody. Tornado warning.

962
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:16,680
Don't bring him yet. Hold him off. Okay. Hold off Zeus. These texts that you're,

963
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,200
that you're reading and that you're translating, are these the original, original, original sources

964
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:30,520
of, of religion, of Christianity and Catholicism and baptism and all this stuff? Is this like

965
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:38,840
the originals? Yeah, this is the language that held that, all of those texts. So the New Testament's

966
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:45,240
all written in ancient Greek, right? The, what you call the Old Testament, I'm going to shock people

967
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,800
with this one, what you call the Old Testament, which people say is written in Hebrew, right,

968
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,880
which is not a language that I am work with. I had to take a little bit of modern Hebrew when I was

969
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:07,080
there just because it was part of the, you know, education. And, but the text that you think is

970
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,560
written in Hebrew is not. It's a Greek text that's written in the third century. It's a Hellenistic

971
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:21,480
text called, that you call the Torah or the Old Testament. That is not an original Hebrew text.

972
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,240
Now, how can I say that? What we have is the Septuagint that I'm talking about. It's the Greek

973
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,640
Old Testament. Do you understand Greek Old Testament? Okay. It's the oldest form that we've

974
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,240
got. Okay. Okay. The whole big deal about the Dead Sea Scrolls was they said, huh,

975
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,840
we finally have some Hebrew because none of it survives, right? Hebrew is only an eighth,

976
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:54,280
is only an eight thousand word, ancient Hebrew, eight thousand word, a unique word count language.

977
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,440
Okay. Which puts it in the realm of something you could expend by the end of your breakfast,

978
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,560
eight thousand words. That's not a lot. Okay. And the Dead Sea Scrolls were all in Hebrew?

979
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,280
The Dead Sea Scrolls were fragments in Hebrew and fragments in Greek and everybody assumed, oh,

980
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,520
this is the original in Hebrew, right? Because now we're following church history. You and I

981
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:23,480
live in a time in the stream, the time stream. We live at a time when we think that there was an

982
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:31,480
original Hebrew text of the Old Testament, but there wasn't. It doesn't exist, right? And to show

983
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:38,440
people the Greek, no, what's the proof? What's the proof? The proof is when you read the Septuagint,

984
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:46,040
that is the Greek Old Testament. It is, does not read as a translation. It reads as an original.

985
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,160
It uses Greek idiom. It's like a fingerprint on the language and it's got great. How can you tell

986
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,840
it reads? Greek fingerprints. How do you discern the difference, whether it be

987
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,720
an original or a translation? Oh, you can tell. It's easy to tell because colloquialisms don't

988
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,520
translate, right? And so it's like tagging it. So how do you, you're testing this language to see

989
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:18,040
if it's, to see what its age is. So you tag it with certain things and one of them is colloquialisms,

990
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,400
right? The other one is technical vocabulary. You cannot translate from a higher technical degree

991
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:32,760
to an, excuse me, you can't translate from a median technical degree to a high technical degree.

992
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,240
Okay. You can go down the slope. You can take something that's not technical, right?

993
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,440
And make it more technical, right? You can force that. You know, you can't drift upstream.

994
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:53,640
Right, right, right. So the original is going to have the highest degree of technicality.

995
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:02,600
Yes. So the Dead Sea Scrolls were not the highest degree of technical writing. They were lower.

996
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:10,120
They were lower than the Greek, what was the word? The book you're talking about.

997
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,080
They're Hebrew back translations because of the time the Dead Sea Scrolls,

998
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,440
they're Hebrew back translations. So they took the Greek.

999
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,640
Of what specifically?

1000
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,400
They took the Greek and they said, how do we translate this into Greek?

1001
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,720
Okay.

1002
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,880
That's why you lose all the technical terms because they didn't have them in their language.

1003
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:39,720
And what I'm asking is what was, God, that's crazy. This is the first podcast I can remember

1004
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,800
where the lightning has been this crazy, this loud. So the Dead Sea Scrolls came from where?

1005
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,240
What were the sources of the Dead Sea Scrolls?

1006
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,920
So those caves in Qumran, right? They've dated these things to probably, I've heard

1007
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,880
as early as 1st BC, but all the way up to 2nd on Odomany.

1008
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,680
So somewhere in that range, somebody is taking the Greek text that we know is already established

1009
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:08,600
because people are quoting it, right? We know, for example, they had the book of Enoch in Greek

1010
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:14,680
because people are quoting it in Greek. So that's how you can track your library.

1011
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,840
Where's your library at the time? That's how you track it, by the way.

1012
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,440
Have you read the book of Enoch?

1013
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,880
Yeah. I read the Giza fragments of it. I can see that much.

1014
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,200
What do you think about all these people talking about Anunnaki aliens flying around

1015
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,480
and building pyramids back in the day?

1016
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,840
I think it's silly.

1017
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,320
You do?

1018
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,840
Damn it!

1019
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,080
You know how many podcasts we've done with people who claim that they're experts on the Anunnaki?

1020
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,480
Yeah, it seems to be a big area, but they were drug users, bro. What can you expect?

1021
00:52:49,480 --> 00:53:00,920
That's what they taught in the Giza text that says they taught the women the art of drugs.

1022
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,480
So these weren't aliens, they were just drug users.

1023
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,760
They were just drug addicts.

1024
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,280
They were giants, bro.

1025
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,160
They were giants?

1026
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,480
Yeah.

1027
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah.

1028
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,880
Like real giants?

1029
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,760
Gigantas.

1030
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,800
Steve, are you crunching?

1031
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,480
Oh, you can hear that.

1032
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,360
Oh my god!

1033
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,120
No, I liked it. I liked it.

1034
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,960
This is the ASMR podcast.

1035
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,600
Holy.

1036
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,640
There's stimulus everywhere.

1037
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,720
They taught them the drug craft. That's what the text says.

1038
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,560
And you don't understand, man. They've got Medusa at the time.

1039
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,040
You say, well...

1040
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,880
Wait, wait, wait. Go back to giants.

1041
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,120
Yeah.

1042
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,720
What are you talking about giants?

1043
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,720
That's the Greek word. Gigantas.

1044
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,080
Giants meaning physically, they were huge people?

1045
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,320
No.

1046
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,200
Okay.

1047
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,200
Right. No.

1048
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,280
They had a superior knowledge of the drugs and they had a group of women who were called the Medusa.

1049
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,200
And the Medusa could hit you with a drug on an arrow and paralyze you.

1050
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,880
And then they would take you and do things to you.

1051
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,960
And that's how a group of these women functioned.

1052
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,640
That's how they hunted the hunted men.

1053
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,000
You can imagine the society.

1054
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,240
Women that hunted men.

1055
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,720
Yeah, you have to kill three men in order to get married.

1056
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,000
Yeah.

1057
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,280
And they don't really marry you.

1058
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,480
They just farm men.

1059
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,800
And when is this? What time period was this?

1060
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,840
This is Bronze Age.

1061
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,640
Late Bronze Age.

1062
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,360
Bronze Age.

1063
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,840
Mm-hmm.

1064
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,960
It's like 1200.

1065
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,880
The peak at 1200 say BC.

1066
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,600
1200.

1067
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,960
This is when the great Queen Medea is around.

1068
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,480
Yeah.

1069
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,120
So back...

1070
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,600
Okay. Okay. Well, this is great. I'm loving this.

1071
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,960
Back to my original question.

1072
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,520
How... Fundamentally, how did...

1073
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,120
Did your understanding and learning all of this ancient Greek

1074
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,440
change your understanding of how religion is preached today

1075
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,720
and the story of the Bible?

1076
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,960
It's a fairy tale.

1077
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,880
It's a fairy tale.

1078
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,120
The... What they teach now and do now is not even a...

1079
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,280
hair's breadth of semblance to what they did originally.

1080
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,200
Yeah.

1081
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,000
You don't understand a mystery.

1082
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,720
It's not a word that means a question or something you don't know.

1083
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:06,920
Right?

1084
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:12,120
The mystery is the performance that brings you through death back into life.

1085
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,960
And once you've been initiated into that environment,

1086
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:26,280
you're given keys, things to open up, a way to decode what's being said

1087
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,280
so that you understand what's at the higher level.

1088
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,040
Now, if you're like Jesus, you do that with 12 children.

1089
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,960
People don't realize that.

1090
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,040
The apostles are just children.

1091
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,240
Pump the brakes. We'll get there.

1092
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,640
Okay.

1093
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,200
We're going to get there.

1094
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,680
Don't worry.

1095
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,080
Okay.

1096
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,240
This...

1097
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,720
That's so loud.

1098
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,600
This is the best day of my life.

1099
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,240
Is that really?

1100
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,600
Thank you for allowing me to come here.

1101
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,720
I was going to say you've had a terrible life.

1102
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,600
This is the best day.

1103
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,640
In Greece, in Athens.

1104
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah.

1105
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,080
In...

1106
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,880
We're talking the Iron Age or the Bronze Age,

1107
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,960
when they started to develop these mystery cults of Elusis.

1108
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,960
Well, what time was this?

1109
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,560
Yeah, this is late Bronze Age.

1110
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,080
Late Bronze Age.

1111
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,960
Late Bronze Age.

1112
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,600
Uh-huh.

1113
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,080
And a couple of generations before the Trojan War.

1114
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,240
A couple of generations before the Trojan War.

1115
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:32,200
And this is when they were experimenting with these drugs that would...

1116
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,400
These psychotropic drugs like Urgot and other things.

1117
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,640
What were some of the other drugs they were using back then?

1118
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,120
They were using the ones that make you crazy.

1119
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,800
So there's several classes and one of them are the death bringers.

1120
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,920
That's what we talked about.

1121
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,120
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Verso.

1122
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,600
Have you ever tried fasting or intermittent fasting?

1123
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,680
If so, you may be aware of the sizzling energy and mental clarity that you get if you do it long enough.

1124
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,480
The scientific data validating the health benefits from fasting for weight loss is overwhelming.

1125
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,920
But what doesn't get talked about enough is the longevity benefits you get from fasting.

1126
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:14,360
When you fast, your body turns on all its defense mechanisms to help your body hunker down to fight

1127
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,640
off illness and disease.

1128
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,040
But the problem is it takes three days of starving yourself to activate this process.

1129
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,880
Scientists like Davidson Clare have recently discovered molecules to help your body

1130
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,840
turn on this process without having to fast.

1131
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,280
If you've ever heard this podcast before, you've heard me talk about Verso many times

1132
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,440
and I've had world-renowned nutritional scientists like Dominic D'Agostino on the show

1133
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,160
who is the guy who actually introduced me to Verso and I've been taking it every day for the last three years.

1134
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,560
Cell being is always the first thing I take in the morning after dragging my carcass into the kitchen

1135
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,000
which wakes me up and gives me energy.

1136
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,200
I even use it for pre-workout and clean being is the product I use every night before bed.

1137
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,000
After taking clean being for some time now, I've actually noticed a huge improvement in

1138
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,840
not only my hormone regulation but my vision has improved.

1139
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,160
I know it sounds insane but this stuff actually can improve your vision.

1140
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,640
My lipid regulation has gotten better and another huge thing is all of a sudden I don't get affected

1141
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,080
by all the pollen in the air.

1142
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,560
I don't have any of these reactions and clean being has actually been scientifically proven

1143
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,760
to alleviate these things.

1144
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,400
Other clinical trials have proven healthier skin, less inflammation, healthier hair,

1145
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,160
lipid regulation, enhanced cognitive function, and improved metabolism.

1146
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,560
On top of that, Verso always publishes third-party testing on each batch produced

1147
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,040
to guarantee you're getting exactly what you pay for.

Now back to the show.

1154
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,320
Now there is the ones that make you crazy and...

1155
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,280
Permanently?

1156
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,960
No, no, temporarily.

1157
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,600
And they would have people cured, you know, quote-unquote cured because they've got antidotes.

1158
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,640
We even have stories about people going out and he's like,

1159
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,560
well, my daughters, they went off on their colt thing and they're still not coming down.

1160
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,880
You know, what do we do?

1161
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:23,160
And he has to go whip them up an antidote for them to stop being in the state of mania.

1162
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:30,600
And it's things like hyosciamine, scopolamine, and atropine containing...

1163
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,680
Who are schoolmoses, is the Greek word.

1164
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:41,320
And it's these plants that contain the substances that, you know, they found them in hair,

1165
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,800
painted on hair because they're offerings.

1166
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,440
And what was the...

1167
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,360
What did they gain by taking these drugs?

1168
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,320
And what sort of...

1169
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,640
What did they learn?

1170
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,240
What sort of enlightenment did they achieve?

1171
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,440
And what was the ends to the use of these drugs for them?

1172
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,480
Yeah, yeah.

1173
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,520
We have an...

1174
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:09,720
Instead of me making something up, you could read the Mithraslergy in the Greek Magical Papyri

1175
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,480
where it talks about what you'll see and how you should interact and what you have to do.

1176
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,240
Oh, they had like a protocol.

1177
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,640
Yeah, it's like a manual.

1178
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,760
Wow.

1179
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,480
Yeah, yeah.

1180
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,720
And you got to have the right things to bring with you because you got to make the drugs,

1181
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,000
right?

1182
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,160
You get there and, first of all, you're going to be fasting for a certain number of days

1183
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,080
and they put you through these repetitious songs, right?

1184
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,960
And we have these in the PGM where you're setting the images in your head.

1185
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,760
Remember, this is idolatry.

1186
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,800
Adolon is the word for image, right?

1187
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,280
Image.

1188
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,000
And there's, you know, so when we're on our snake venom,

1189
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,760
and you've got a concoction with a...

1190
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,360
And they're using tons of snakes, though.

1191
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,120
I've got an entire author for you, watch this.

1192
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,360
Philuminus is his name.

1193
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,160
Philuminus.

1194
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,040
Philuminus with a pH on the front, you know.

1195
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,280
He is a physician somewhere before the 4th century because they start quoting him in the 4th.

1196
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,560
And he's a physician who talks about the venoms.

1197
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,320
I've got a couple of slides of him.

1198
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,760
He talks about the venoms that are used.

1199
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,720
Some great stuff, by the way.

1200
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,520
The snake venoms were used as mind-altering drugs or they were used as the antidotes?

1201
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,040
They were used as medicines.

1202
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,160
Medicines.

1203
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,760
Right, right.

1204
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,960
The Medusa really exist, right?

1205
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,680
They're women.

1206
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,360
They're a group of women.

1207
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,040
These are Scythian tribes, by the way.

1208
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,800
What do I mean by that?

1209
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:51,720
Tribes that are... they were a horse culture, mobile, and they ravaged people.

1210
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,880
That's how they got what they needed.

1211
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,920
And the Medusa were the ones that you said they had to kill a certain amount of men

1212
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,880
before they could get married?

1213
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,920
It's the same tribes that are producing those, that specific group of women.

1214
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,840
They have this cult thing where they apply the medicine to their hair.

1215
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,360
They wear it in their hair and they use arrows.

1216
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,960
And that poison can petrify you.

1217
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,680
And they'll drag you off and they'll do things to you.

1218
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,040
Like what, eat your brain?

1219
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,240
No, no, no.

1220
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,040
Sexy stuff.

1221
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,280
They'll either mate or kill you.

1222
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,480
Yeah, yeah.

1223
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,200
It's a shame to have to end up a relationship.

1224
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:38,760
That's weird that back then you would have to poison a man to have sex with him, right?

1225
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,880
Like wouldn't a guy just want to have sex with some chick?

1226
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,400
These are people being raided.

1227
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,120
Imagine being raided.

1228
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,440
I mean, it's hard to rape a man if you're a woman, right?

1229
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,000
So you got to give them drugs to make them hard when you're

1230
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
raping them because you're probably going to kill them too.

1231
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,160
What effects did drug use have on the philosophy of Western society

1232
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,240
and the democratic forms of governance?

1233
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:16,680
Yeah, so it's a part of the fabric of pushing society toward inspiration,

1234
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,280
looking for sources of inspiration.

1235
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,120
All the earliest Greek temples are temples of the Muses.

1236
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,200
So that written word connection is very, very important.

1237
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,760
And bring magic.

1238
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,560
People want to know what is magic, right?

1239
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,240
Classically.

1240
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,440
Classically.

1241
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,720
And classically it's that controlled logos.

1242
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,240
It's a control.

1243
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,200
People think logos.

1244
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,560
So that's a Greek word, right?

1245
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,280
Oh, then seminarians get alongside it, you know what I mean?

1246
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:52,600
And they don't really know it because seminarians don't read classical tags.

1247
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,640
The logos is that reason, that reckoning, that reckoning.

1248
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:04,680
So that's what, to me, that's what I studied so carefully.

1249
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,880
That's why classes study ancient Greek.

1250
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,200
Yeah, they do.

1251
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,160
Who's Solon?

1252
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,360
Solon.

1253
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,240
He's a reformer.

1254
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,920
He's a rich reformer who basically turns and gives power back to the people.

1255
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,160
He was advised by, oh, this guy on crack, he carried it around.

1256
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,360
He carried it around in the hoof of something.

1257
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,240
And it was a plant that he ground up and snorted all the time.

1258
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,640
He advised Solon.

1259
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,720
And Solon's reforms ultimately become what you and I know as democracy.

1260
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:49,800
What is the proper definition of democracy and antiquity compared to our democracy today?

1261
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,840
Yeah, it's the rule of the people if you want.

1262
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,960
It's the rule of the people.

1263
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,360
The Deimos is just the neighborhood.

1264
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,080
Athens is divided up into deems.

1265
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:00,600
Right.

1266
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,080
The hood.

1267
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,040
You get a neighborhood speak.

1268
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,920
That's what democracy is.

1269
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,600
It's a neighborhood speak.

1270
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,920
And it's direct representation too.

1271
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,640
And they've got all sorts of reforms like, look, you cannot take any money

1272
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,480
while you are a, you know, part of the boulet, part of the council.

1273
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,920
You can't take any money and you have to have terms and everything.

1274
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,560
It's what inspired Jefferson.

1275
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:34,280
Part of your book says that there was 300,000 people in Athens, right?

1276
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,560
Is that, and then 10% of them were part of these councils.

1277
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,480
That sounds right.

1278
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,280
There was like 30,000 of them were part of these councils that made the rules and made the laws.

1279
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,240
And, right.

1280
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,640
And they have a couple of assemblies, boulet and ecclesia.

1281
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,320
Yeah.

1282
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,400
Which becomes our word for church.

1283
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:00,120
Well, I love the way that your book described the differences between our

1284
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:07,000
democratic republic that we have in America compared to their version of democracy.

1285
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:14,840
And you had all these people that would have to debate all these ideas and rules and laws and

1286
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,280
punishment for crimes.

1287
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,160
And I think you said that people only were able to do this for one year at a time.

1288
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,160
They had like one year terms or whatever.

1289
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,480
It was different at different times, but.

1290
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,280
Right.

1291
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:26,680
Right.

1292
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,040
And what we have now is so far away from that.

1293
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,680
Very, very far away from that.

1294
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,720
Well, we don't also run out juries with 300 people either.

1295
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,920
Can you imagine that just big crowd of people from the polis doing the city thing?

1296
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,920
They're being, they're exercising their politea.

1297
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,480
That's where we get our word politics, right?

1298
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,240
It's the functioning of the city.

1299
01:06:51,240 --> 01:07:02,280
And they were vehemently against people who could gain any sort of benefit in this system

1300
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:09,160
or make any sort of money or any sort of economic gain from this system to corrupt it.

1301
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:17,960
Like it was the, it was like their version of democracy was essentially to protect humanity

1302
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,080
from itself.

1303
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,360
Yeah, exactly.

1304
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,320
Put the brakes.

1305
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,360
It was the ultimate check and balance.

1306
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,040
Definitely.

1307
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,960
And it's what inspired our democracy, the thing we call democracy.

1308
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,400
Yeah.

1309
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,080
But our democracy is so much different.

1310
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:37,640
I mean, it's, if you look at all the people that are in the government and have been in

1311
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,880
the government making decisions and making millions of dollars for so long, they're just,

1312
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,480
it is run by tyrants.

1313
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:43,960
Yes.

1314
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,560
That's how you know the Greeks said.

1315
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,800
They said whoever is profiting, wants you profiting and you cannot have the running

1316
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,760
of the state with somebody profiting from it.

1317
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,840
Because when you do, it becomes corrupt.

1318
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:03,080
They knew that you have to keep that government sacred.

1319
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,920
You have to keep it sacred.

1320
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,400
Right.

1321
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:05,720
Yeah.

1322
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:13,640
And so long was one of the originals responsible for the creation of democracy?

1323
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,240
Well, yeah, things that led to ultimately what you and I would say, voila, democracy.

1324
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,160
And how long did this last?

1325
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,400
You could argue that this is a process that doesn't start and end.

1326
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,120
But it's a process that cycles throughout time.

1327
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,240
And the deity, this is where it gets cool.

1328
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:47,240
The deity that we put on the hill is that warrior, that warrior girl.

1329
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,840
Yeah, we put a warrior girl on the hill and you know what she does?

1330
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,960
She nourishes the serpent king.

1331
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,640
Isn't that funny?

1332
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,080
She gives him her hyma.

1333
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,680
What does this mean?

1334
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,400
Her blood.

1335
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,800
Drink my blood.

1336
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,680
Yeah, they're using blood as a medicinal.

1337
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,040
Yeah, the Virgin Queen.

1338
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,840
She's the one who raises that serpent king.

1339
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,720
Yeah, no, they've got them.

1340
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,200
You can go to Athens today, go to the top of the, look for the Erechtheum on the top of the

1341
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,360
place and be like, where is it?

1342
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,720
Where's the serpent king?

1343
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,320
Who is the serpent king?

1344
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,240
Stephen, can you find this guy?

1345
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,000
He's, look for Erechthonias.

1346
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,680
Erechthonias?

1347
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,160
Yeah.

1348
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,040
Erechthonias.

1349
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,960
He's from the ground, baby.

1350
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,400
When Jesus is on the cross and he's like, I am thirsty.

1351
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,280
All right.

1352
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,880
That's what Jesus said when he was on the cross?

1353
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,120
Yeah.

1354
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,040
Is this in the Bible?

1355
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,760
Yeah.

1356
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,320
Oh, really?

1357
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,200
Yeah.

1358
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,200
Why would I make this up?

1359
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,320
Well, I'm not saying you're making it up.

1360
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:08,440
I'm just trying to distinguish the difference between what's in the Bible and what's in the text.

1361
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,960
And I assume that they're drastically different, right?

1362
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,840
No, I will give you the hardcore evidence.

1363
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,480
What is the difference?

1364
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,360
It's just the text.

1365
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:16,680
What is it?

1366
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,120
I'm just going to bring you a Greek text.

1367
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,000
And this is from the biblical Greek text.

1368
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:28,680
My question is, what is the, how big of a gap is there between the original texts and the Bible people read today?

1369
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,760
Okay.

1370
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,040
So these are the texts that are ultimately assembled into what you call the Bible.

1371
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,600
Those are the same thing, right?

1372
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,560
This is the Greek.

1373
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:46,440
So there's only some pieces, like there's a huge load of ancient Greek texts and only

1374
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,200
certain pieces are cherry picked for the Bible.

1375
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,880
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,760
I see what you mean.

1377
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,680
What's the common thread that's uniting all of these things together?

1378
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,600
It's the cults, man, and the operation of the cults.

1379
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,240
They're driving the literature at the time.

1380
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,520
You know, they've got a hostage and they're bringing it in.

1381
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,360
And you can get that from the read.

1382
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,640
All you got to do is bring up those cults and their activities.

1383
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,480
The stuff the early Christians were doing, they're collecting blood.

1384
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,600
And this is from their own insiders who are telling us this.

1385
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,520
Eustatius tells us this.

1386
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,760
And he says, oh my God.

1387
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,840
He says, look what they're doing in these ceremonies.

1388
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,080
And he goes on to describe it and I've described it in detail.

1389
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,480
But they collect the blood.

1390
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,440
Who is this guy?

1391
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,720
The fetal blood.

1392
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,080
Who's Eric Thonius?

1393
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,840
This king, this king of this serpent king.

1394
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,680
Can you pull up a description of him, Steve?

1395
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,200
I need Wikipedia's description to give me the truth.

1396
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,600
So I know I'm going to keep on in the check.

1397
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,280
Eric Thonius in Greek mythology, King Eric Thonius was a legendary

1398
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,320
early ruler of ancient Athens, according to some myths.

1399
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,800
He was Autothan, one of the so.

1400
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,840
Autothanus.

1401
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,800
Autothanus.

1402
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,680
Exactly.

1403
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,760
And what happens is Hephaestus comes along and he's like, wow.

1404
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,040
Look at the beauty of what we've made.

1405
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,360
He was adopted and raised by Athena.

1406
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,280
With this virgin Athena.

1407
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,000
Her name is Athana in Dorian.

1408
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,280
So how did we get, okay.

1409
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,640
So explain to people listening how we got to Eric Thonius

1410
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,120
from Solon, creating democracy.

1411
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,720
It's that line.

1412
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,480
It's the drug using mystery that drives everything.

1413
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,080
Cicero says his life was begun again.

1414
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,320
He was reborn.

1415
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,440
What happened?

1416
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,400
He went to the great resurrection.

1417
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,200
So these guys, these guys, these guys were taking drug

1418
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,920
and having some great transcendental experience, right?

1419
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,200
And they were similar to people when they take crazy psychedelic trips today, right?

1420
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,920
They call it the ego death and they, or they do ayahuasca ceremonies.

1421
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,680
This is what's happening to people back then.

1422
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,960
Is that what you were kind of describing?

1423
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1424
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,160
Okay.

1425
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,720
Yeah.

1426
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,800
And it's a death to life.

1427
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,160
I think it's, it's a death to life experience.

1428
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,440
It's a rebirth or what they described anyway is a rebirth.

1429
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,920
And yeah, that makes sense.

1430
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,320
Yeah.

1431
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,880
They put you, the drug concoction is incredible.

1432
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,640
We have it in Nero's library.

1433
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,240
We have it.

1434
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,960
We have the exact concoction that they use.

1435
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,640
Has anybody ever tried to recreate it?

1436
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,360
I've tried to get people to do so.

1437
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,560
Have you asked Hamilton to try to recreate it?

1438
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,080
He said, give me the formula.

1439
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:37,720
So I did.

1440
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,120
And he's got it.

1441
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:41,640
Could he?

1442
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,640
It's got a lot of stuff in it that I don't know if you know,

1443
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,640
he could actually produce.

1444
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,440
Right.

1445
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,640
It's got several, it's got like seven snake venoms.

1446
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,000
Seven different snake venoms.

1447
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,480
Yeah.

1448
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,840
You can put it up your butt.

1449
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,360
Oh my.

1450
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,800
Is that how they, is that how they typically get it back in the day?

1451
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,920
Like a suppository?

1452
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,400
Yeah.

1453
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,000
We've got a description of a guy who, his priestess,

1454
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,360
she's spanking him with some stinging needles, right?

1455
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,560
On his genitalia.

1456
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,360
And she's putting, inserting that into his, you know,

1457
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,320
it's a rectal drug administration.

1458
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,600
And we have a text that describes it.

1459
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,520
It's called a satiricon.

1460
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,240
Satirion was the word they used in Latin.

1461
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,320
It's from Greek, broad from Greek.

1462
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,400
That is the drug that causes you to have propism.

1463
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,400
Right.

1464
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,360
What is propism?

1465
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Propism is constipation.

1466
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:41,720
Okay.

1467
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,520
Okay.

1468
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,600
And this is what the Medusa use on their victims?

1469
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,320
Too late.

1470
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,760
Is it too late for that?

1471
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,560
Are they too early?

1472
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,160
Can we talk about that now?

1473
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,360
It's probably, it's still too early.

1474
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,560
Yeah, we've still got more stuff to cover.

1475
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,600
Okay, stay tuned.

1476
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:52,920
Yeah.

1477
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,160
We're going to go really deep into all of the

1478
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,000
really crazy stuff here in a little bit.

1479
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,680
We're going to cut off and go to Patreon.

1480
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,560
But I want to lay a solid foundation for

1481
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,840
your work and your research before we go there.

1482
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,800
So back to ancient Greece.

1483
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,280
Democracy is formed by Solon and Aristotle and Plato.

1484
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,400
Where do they come into the picture?

1485
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,960
They're a couple of smarties.

1486
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,760
Couple of smarties.

1487
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,240
Yeah.

1488
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,200
And who else was there?

1489
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,000
Pythagoras.

1490
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,400
Yeah.

1491
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,040
He's a little bit earlier in his, he's founding.

1492
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,400
He's the one who said, by the way,

1493
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,880
they came to him and asked him,

1494
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,480
they're going to send out a colony

1495
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,400
and the Oracle had given a go ahead.

1496
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,920
And you have to understand this is late

1497
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,640
coming from late Bronze Age, governmental tech,

1498
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,320
where you have oracles that rule,

1499
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,320
that tell you who can go to war with who,

1500
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,080
you know, which tyrant needs to be executed.

1501
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,520
Right.

1502
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,800
If you, if you send an embassy out and they ask the Oracle

1503
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,000
and she says, execute him.

1504
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:56,920
Right.

1505
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,200
What about this leader we got?

1506
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,480
And she's executed.

1507
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,920
That's it.

1508
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,480
He's dead.

1509
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,800
What is so special about this Oracle?

1510
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,080
There's, they start with these drugs.

1511
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,520
They use the drugs that those Scythian tribes

1512
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,280
are using up on the Black Sea.

1513
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,400
And they're causing this transformation

1514
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,440
that they describe as adamantine freedom.

1515
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,760
So freedom that is not corruptible.

1516
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,320
Right.

1517
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,760
It's a form of government.

1518
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,760
That's why they call them the Medusae from Medwa.

1519
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,000
It's an old Mycenaean concept.

1520
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,480
Yeah.

1521
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:37,960
Yeah.

1522
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,440
Anywho.

1523
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,080
We were talking briefly earlier about the Dead Sea Scrolls

1524
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,400
and you said the Dead Sea Scrolls were part of them were written

1525
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,440
in Hebrew and they were back translated from earlier Greek.

1526
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:50,920
Right.

1527
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,240
Yeah.

1528
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,320
Now none of them were originally written in Hebrew.

1529
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,840
They're all originally written in Greek.

1530
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,080
That's why they had complete Greek texts with them.

1531
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,320
Greek was the first.

1532
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,560
There was no, there was no Hebrew spoken

1533
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:02,760
at the time.

1534
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,480
Hebrew had become a liturgical language.

1535
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:06,440
Right.

1536
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,560
By the, by the second century BC.

1537
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,720
What, why Greek?

1538
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:19,480
I stood, I stood in a synagogue in Israel, second century.

1539
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,680
And you know what was written?

1540
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,920
There was nothing in Hebrew.

1541
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,960
It was all Greek.

1542
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,280
Really?

1543
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,320
And people are, yeah.

1544
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,080
No, you can look, check me on it.

1545
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,320
Right.

1546
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,040
They all are.

1547
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,600
They all have Zodiacs.

1548
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:33,800
Right?

1549
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,440
Wow.

1550
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:34,920
Yeah.

1551
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,040
Isn't that something?

1552
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:36,520
Yeah.

1553
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,280
That's all reflected in the language.

1554
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,400
It's like a fingerprint, man.

1555
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,360
You can track this stuff.

1556
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,520
The Old Testament, if I say anything today, the Old Testament

1557
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,120
is a work of the third century and it's originally in Greek.

1558
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,160
Yeah.

1559
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:57,000
The name Eve is the shout that a bockin makes.

1560
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,760
Eve is the shout that a bockin.

1561
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,400
Bockin.

1562
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,120
What's a bockin?

1563
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,040
It's a woman under the influence of some pretty powerful drugs who's.

1564
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,160
Everything is about drugs.

1565
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,720
There's nothing that's not about drugs.

1566
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,320
Is there anything, is there anything in history that has nothing to do with drugs

1567
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,520
or is it all drugs?

1568
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,720
Yeah, but it was boring.

1569
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,160
You just refuse to acknowledge it if it's not about drugs.

1570
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,200
That's what I'm taking from this.

1571
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:27,960
Is that right?

1572
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,480
No, no.

1573
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,240
It's just so many drugs.

1574
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,440
Yeah.

1575
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:40,280
No, I mean, the bockinalia rise, the ecstasy, the place we get the concept ecstasy

1576
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,160
is from the state that one of these women would be in and they could murder you

1577
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,840
and it was totally frigging legal.

1578
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,160
And that was one of the things that they like to do.

1579
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,840
You know why you get a blood thirst.

1580
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,680
Does that bother you?

1581
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,720
You get a blood thirst.

1582
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,760
Yeah, because when you carry around these baskets, we have these represented full of

1583
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,640
snakes and snakes and dicks.

1584
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,920
Do you ever just like find like when you're looking through these texts, do you ever like

1585
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,040
like maybe I'm not looking at this from a neutral perspective?

1586
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:24,440
Like maybe I got somehow corrupted at some point and I'm only looking for the stuff that's

1587
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,360
going to fly in the face of academia because they me over when I was doing my dissertation.

1588
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:29,560
No.

1589
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,640
Now what drags me in is the Christ.

1590
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,760
I'm still looking for Jesus.

1591
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,320
That's your that's the one thing.

1592
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,720
That term Christ is a pharmaceutical term.

1593
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:52,840
Is it possible that the texts that you've read that tell you some of these things

1594
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,200
can be translated in different ways or seen from different perspectives?

1595
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:03,640
Or is what you're saying that these texts say is that is that objective fact?

1596
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,160
Yeah, I'm all about sources and you have to be genuine to your source.

1597
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:14,840
So when I say something, I know it sounds outrageous, but there's a source that does

1598
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,120
exactly what I just said.

1599
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:21,640
That's all I'm supposed to do as a journalist is report to you the sources.

1600
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,360
And let me give you an example.

1601
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,760
There's a guy named known us and known us.

1602
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:35,080
He writes a paraphrase of John, the Gospel of John.

1603
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:36,760
Okay.

1604
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:46,760
And in it, known us talks about like Mary's alabaster and that whole sexy event.

1605
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:48,760
Mary's what?

1606
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,880
Alabaster.

1607
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,520
What does that mean?

1608
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,880
Oh, it's an oil containing device.

1609
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,720
It's a, yeah, yeah.

1610
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,440
There's older forms of them that are bigger.

1611
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,520
Aristophanes makes fun of it on the stage in the list.

1612
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:12,200
Aristophanes was an ancient, he was a playwright, comedian, like an ancient comedian.

1613
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,480
The father of comedy.

1614
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,480
They were like, father, come on, man.

1615
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,760
This is Aristophanes.

1616
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,640
He's the one, they march out on stage, you know, bigger.

1617
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,120
The last chapter of your book was all about him.

1618
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:28,680
It was, it was fascinating hearing that, you know, back then they were able to make fun of,

1619
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,320
you know, the top elite part of the society and the people in government.

1620
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,160
And he made fun of Socrates, ripped Socrates, right?

1621
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,800
Yeah, it's the stage is a religious place.

1622
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,480
The stage in antiquity was not for entertainment.

1623
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,720
Nobody's getting rich off of it.

1624
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,080
What we're doing is we're purifying the people.

1625
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,280
Yeah.

1626
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,520
And so they needed that, they needed that humor.

1627
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,520
The Romans carried the same thing to their credit, those hot dwelling Romans.

1628
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:02,520
To their credit, they did bring this protection as well.

1629
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:07,560
And you see it on their imperial side, when you've got a whole bunch of people surrounded,

1630
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,840
Julius Caesar yelling at them, things like, are you sleeping with the king?

1631
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,520
You know, stuff like that, because he was visiting someplace.

1632
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:24,840
They're trying to ward off the, the maleficio, the magic that's bad, the bad making.

1633
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:32,680
Do you ever, like when you're reading these texts, how do you know what could,

1634
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,520
how do you know what you're reading?

1635
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,240
Isn't sort of like an ancient, because I'm sure people in the ancient times, they,

1636
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:45,880
when they're writing, everybody, whether you're a journalist or whatever it is,

1637
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
everybody has an axe to grind, right?

1638
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:57,480
And how do you know, like what you're reading, isn't sort of like a tabloid or a,

1639
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:03,880
or a hit piece, for lack of a better term, that is skewing the,

1640
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,160
the optics of what was really happening.

1641
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:12,840
Yeah. I told, what you're talking about is getting through a dark cave, essentially.

1642
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,080
Yeah.

1643
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,720
There's a line on the wall and with a rope on it.

1644
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,280
And you can follow from one of the caves to the other.

1645
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,800
That's how we get through back and,

1646
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,160
back and forward through the cave.

1647
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:31,880
Yeah. And in that, in this case, it's the pharmacology, the science.

1648
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,880
It's not just the pharmacology, it's the science.

1649
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,600
That's really what, if you follow the scientific development of people

1650
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,000
and watch that over time, you can, you can notice trends.

1651
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,120
Like what's popular when they're reaching a pinnacle and the Greeks can now express calculus

1652
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,000
with words, right?

1653
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:59,000
That's, you know, that's quite a, quite an advancement.

1654
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,920
Can you express calculus with words?

1655
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,960
No, I can't even do it.

1656
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,240
Yeah. No, forget that. Physics too, physics too, man.

1657
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:05,640
Right.

1658
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,480
No, no.

1659
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,160
Um, but yeah, I don't want to rattle on.

1660
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:16,280
What, what do you want to, you want to ask another question?

1661
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:16,520
Yeah.

1662
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,760
Yeah. I have, I have, I have an endless amount of questions.

1663
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:27,000
Um, are you familiar with, um, the guy John Marco Allegro,

1664
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,640
who spent all of his life deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls,

1665
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,680
and he wrote The Sacred Mushroom in the Cross?

1666
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:38,680
One of the reasons Carl Rock has anything to do with me

1667
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:44,440
is because I have no interest. I have no interest in any of that.

1668
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,240
And you think that, isn't that insulting to Carl Rock?

1669
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,240
It seems right in line with what you're doing though.

1670
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,920
No, well it does, but I have no interest in it because it attracts.

1671
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,160
I'm sorry. Can I, Danny, I'm going to be completely honest with you.

1672
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,360
Um, there's a lot of hokum.

1673
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:08,200
Yeah. There's a lot of hokum. We only have the sources.

1674
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,360
That's what I'm saying. This is so hard to navigate.

1675
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,520
What's good? What, what's bullshit? What's real?

1676
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,880
Go to the primary sources.

1677
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,800
Yeah, but that's easy to, that's easy for you to say.

1678
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,160
Yes. Enroll in my class today. Right?

1679
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,080
Yeah. That's exactly the point of why you need classicists.

1680
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:27,640
That's why Thomas Jefferson was trying to recreate democracy.

1681
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:32,280
Right? No establishment of any laws for religion.

1682
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,280
Right? Purifying. He purified the stream, made another democracy.

1683
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,560
And wait, and he's the one who said, I'm sorry, it's you.

1684
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,960
It's your show. I didn't mean to say wait.

1685
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,280
No, no, no, no, it's not ready. Go ahead.

1686
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,160
He said every 150 years you're going to get somebody who tries to

1687
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
insurrect and overthrow the government.

1688
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,360
Everyone 150 years?

1689
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,280
Yeah. 100, he said 100, 250.

1690
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,880
And he said when they do, you have to take the tyrants.

1691
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,960
And you have to shed their blood.

1692
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,720
Anybody who tries to overthrow the government, you have to shed their blood

1693
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,000
and the blood of their lieutenants on the tree of liberty.

1694
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:08,920
Isn't that interesting?

1695
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,280
What's the tree of liberty?

1696
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,000
Oh, God.

1697
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,160
That's just a symbolic term.

1698
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,040
It's the state.

1699
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,840
Yeah, it's the race publica.

1700
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,480
It's the republic, baby.

1701
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,880
You got to save the republic by sacrificing the tyrant.

1702
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,000
That's an ancient Greek idea.

1703
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,200
Back when they had tyrants too who were women who could take you captive,

1704
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,160
they could drug you and they could cut your death off and they would sell you.

1705
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,400
You know, trafficking women, isn't that something?

1706
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,160
Yeah.

1707
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,440
How do you make eunuchs?

1708
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,320
How do you make eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven?

1709
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,600
So that's what kind of pulled me out of the Christianity.

1710
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,600
We're seeing a lot of the stuff that's actually there.

1711
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:00,840
Seeing some of the depictions of the darker side with the human trafficking and stuff like

1712
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,040
that and the trafficking.

1713
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,960
I would say the reality, right?

1714
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:04,840
It's history.

1715
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,520
You want to know the truth.

1716
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,880
History means inquiry.

1717
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,840
People don't.

1718
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,680
You think it meant like a set of events if you were a historian, right?

1719
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,200
I can't stand historians unless they can do the original languages.

1720
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,320
And most of them can't.

1721
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:23,320
Classical historians don't do the side that is the philology.

1722
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,920
So why don't you take John Marco Allegro seriously?

1723
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,280
Because I want nothing to do with any controversy.

1724
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,800
It's hooko.

1725
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,960
You don't want anything to do with controversy?

1726
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,800
I'm a purist, right?

1727
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,240
I just want those sources.

1728
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,600
Why do you think he's controversial?

1729
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,040
The sources keep getting me fired and I just want the sources out there.

1730
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,880
And he didn't read the sources?

1731
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,600
No, no.

1732
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,960
It's just it has to do with...

1733
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,920
He spent it because he was reading the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1734
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,480
Right, and he based everything that he was talking about, the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1735
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,440
Yeah, which I don't...

1736
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,640
So to you, it's irrelevant.

1737
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,680
It is totally irrelevant.

1738
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:04,520
Was there any evidence of using psychedelic mushrooms in antiquity?

1739
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,240
Yeah.

1740
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:11,080
I used to send Carl Ruck references every time I came across.

1741
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,800
I was going through these formulae, these ancient formulae,

1742
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,840
and every time I would come across the mushrooms, I sent it to him.

1743
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,960
And I did that because I just wanted to pound him and say,

1744
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,080
look, you were right, you were right, you were right,

1745
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,520
because people shunned him, they blacklisted him.

1746
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:28,760
Right.

1747
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,040
You know?

1748
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,240
Yeah, and it's not right.

1749
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:38,680
He was there bringing the knowledge of the use of drugs in antiquity.

1750
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,720
Right, yeah.

1751
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:48,840
What is so superior about Greek compared to Hebrew or any of these other...

1752
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,480
Aramaic?

1753
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:49,880
When was...

1754
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,520
When did Aramaic...

1755
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,120
Oh, God, who cares?

1756
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:52,600
Who cares?

1757
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,400
I cannot think of a less relevant...

1758
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,040
Look, in the libraries that we have from the ancient world,

1759
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,800
okay, if you just look at the libraries, remember, look at the peaks.

1760
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,080
What libraries are you talking about?

1761
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,080
It's always on the big libraries.

1762
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,600
Alexandria, right?

1763
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,120
Look at what's in those.

1764
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,120
Now, we don't have anything.

1765
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,760
We do have one that just opened up in Herculaneum.

1766
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,000
And they just scanned it.

1767
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,200
And the first word they scanned was purple.

1768
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:25,800
Oh, yeah.

1769
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,720
Porfura.

1770
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,240
Purple was the first word.

1771
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:35,320
Yes, it's one of my words that I brought to you in my little presentation.

1772
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:44,760
So, again, to you, what makes Greek so superior to any of these other languages or linguistics?

1773
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,320
It's able to convey and stretch.

1774
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,480
It's able to build, essentially.

1775
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,440
It's flexible.

1776
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:57,880
So, imagine a system like half of English is based on Greek roots, right?

1777
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,680
Imagine you've got words that are using...

1778
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,640
Greek and Latin, right?

1779
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,280
Some of it is Latin, but that's own...

1780
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,800
Oh, God, I'm going to step in here.

1781
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,680
But every...

1782
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,240
Look, there's two types of classes.

1783
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,720
Those who are Hellenists and those who study Latin.

1784
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:22,760
And everybody knows what happens to the Hellenists.

1785
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,080
They know it attracts the most intelligent people.

1786
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:31,400
And over time, it turns their brains into mind-expanding...

1787
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,320
This is the power.

1788
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,800
You asked me what's so beautiful about Greek.

1789
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,040
Greek is able to build...

1790
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,280
Let me give you an example.

1791
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:44,760
The word to kiss is phileo, right?

1792
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,600
We get all our phil words from that.

1793
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,400
Philosophies, the love of wisdom, right?

1794
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,040
Phileo means to kiss.

1795
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,800
So, if I were nice Roman, skirt-wear in Roman,

1796
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,360
I may walk up to you when I met you and kiss you.

1797
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,560
You know, do you mind if I kiss you?

1798
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,600
That's phileo.

1799
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,800
Then there's kata phileo.

1800
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,080
Kata is an intensifier.

1801
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,760
So, it takes it to the level of a...

1802
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,160
You and I, French, I meet you.

1803
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,440
Like making out?

1804
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah, give you a nice big kiss.

1805
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,040
Now, what about...

1806
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:25,800
Is there a discern from one person just kissing

1807
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,400
versus them kissing together?

1808
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,800
Like, both kissing each other?

1809
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,080
It changes...

1810
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,680
No, it's the degree of amorousness that's involved.

1811
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,200
Like the degree that Jesus had with Judas.

1812
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,080
Right, right, right.

1813
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,440
When he kissed Jesus.

1814
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,160
We'll get there.

1815
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:43,720
We'll get there.

1816
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,000
I want to expand a little bit more.

1817
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,360
I want you to talk a little bit more about Greek.

1818
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:48,680
Fair.

1819
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:52,600
The language and how far it expands compared to other languages

1820
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,280
and how it expands just the human mind.

1821
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,680
So, you have a set.

1822
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,960
You have a set of prepositions that are used as prefixes.

1823
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,320
And with those, you can build concepts.

1824
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,000
And if you just look at the concepts alone,

1825
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,920
those are basically...

1826
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,760
When you're talking unique words,

1827
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,520
that's like the capacity of your language.

1828
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,640
Greek has between...

1829
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,800
It's been estimated 250,000 to upward.

1830
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,920
I've seen upward of 500,000 unique words.

1831
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,240
Just to give you a way to compare it.

1832
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,320
Ancient Hebrew has about 8,000, right?

1833
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,040
So, it's unique word.

1834
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:40,040
It can build its own vocabulary

1835
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:43,080
so that you can create or coin terms.

1836
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:43,480
You should...

1837
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,800
Do you walk around coining terms?

1838
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,040
No.

1839
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,400
Okay.

1840
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,960
There's the problem, right?

1841
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:55,560
If you start and engage in this process of letting the Greek

1842
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,920
pump your brain, you'll start coining words.

1843
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:06,040
You'll open up a capacity to engineer around you.

1844
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,440
It's a superiority of the language.

1845
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,280
It's a power.

1846
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,640
It's overwhelming.

1847
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,720
And it overwhelmed antiquity.

1848
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,960
Marcus Aurelius, the emperor,

1849
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,360
who's on a ton of drugs, including opium.

1850
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,960
So much opium that Galen says,

1851
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,240
I can't stand this guy.

1852
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,680
He keeps bothering me about his opium.

1853
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,520
He just wants me to more and more.

1854
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,760
You know, he's adjusting his medication up,

1855
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,040
giving him a stronger dose.

1856
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,200
Who developed the language?

1857
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:38,760
You mean what people?

1858
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,280
Like when did it first come about?

1859
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:44,520
And how long did it take to expand to 250,000 to 500,000?

1860
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:44,840
Yeah.

1861
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,120
Let's take what modern scholars would say

1862
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,720
and just throw that out the window.

1863
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,200
What would modern scholars say?

1864
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,560
Modern scholars did all sorts.

1865
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,320
They'd hit and miss all over the place.

1866
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,520
They'd guess all sorts of...

1867
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,760
You could probably have a range of 3,000 years,

1868
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,560
they wouldn't know.

1869
01:33:59,560 --> 01:33:59,880
Okay.

1870
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,760
Where does Greek actually come from?

1871
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,280
It's that old Indo-European bunkum, right?

1872
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,640
That stuff's not accurate.

1873
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:11,320
The Greeks, like, forget modern linguistics.

1874
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,960
The Greeks...

1875
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,840
What did the Greeks themselves say in their own text?

1876
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:19,080
They said, we are the descendants of the Pulaski.

1877
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,040
These are a group of the Marauding Calcolithic...

1878
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,680
So this is 5,000 BC.

1879
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:33,960
5,000 BC called the Pulaski, the carriers of the purple.

1880
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,160
Yeah.

1881
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,200
This is where Greek came from.

1882
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:43,640
These are the antecedents of the Phoenicians,

1883
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,440
those who carry the purple.

1884
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,000
Okay.

1885
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,120
What is the purple?

1886
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:48,840
Way back...

1887
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,560
Oh, God.

1888
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,400
It's Murek squeezing.

1889
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,240
I take a little snail out of the water and he's in a shell.

1890
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,040
And I squeeze out this stuff and process it.

1891
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,320
There's almost a processing.

1892
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,400
And they turn it into a substance that we use in our religion.

1893
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,240
In order to induce oisteromania.

1894
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,640
You can tell the girls who develop it,

1895
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,200
because their fingers are stained with the purple.

1896
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:19,960
You can tell, because their lips are stained with the purple.

1897
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,080
Yeah.

1898
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:24,840
Yeah, it's...

1899
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,880
Who knows what's in it?

1900
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,800
I mean, I've heard people say, oh, is it DMT?

1901
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,240
Is it blah, blah, blah?

1902
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:29,640
Okay.

1903
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,280
Whatever.

1904
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:30,840
Who knows?

1905
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,480
Who knows?

1906
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,840
And who cares at this point?

1907
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,880
When do these people stop using drugs?

1908
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,240
What is this, Steve?

1909
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,800
Herculaneum Scrolls, a 20-year-old journey to read the Unreadable.

1910
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,960
Yeah, this is what Hillman was talking about.

1911
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:50,360
This is...

1912
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,320
The Herculaneum is that city that was destroyed.

1913
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,560
It was a sister city to Pompeii.

1914
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,760
And it has a lot of preserved scrolls in it.

1915
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,080
And so if you can unwrap these crusted little scrolls,

1916
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:05,960
you can read them.

1917
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,040
And there's one kid that did with AI.

1918
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:10,920
He used an AI.

1919
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,920
To help him out.

1920
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,480
But yeah, like what Hillman said, it said purple.

1921
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,400
One of them did.

1922
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:21,320
It was the first word that they could visibly read.

1923
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,520
This library, they suspect, is...

1924
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,480
I don't know, they waffle.

1925
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,240
So I don't know, that's for the archaeologists.

1926
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,600
They got to figure that out.

1927
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,120
But they say it's probably the Julian Library from the Gens Julia.

1928
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:37,720
So the Gens of Caesar himself, right?

1929
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,560
And it's destroyed in 79.

1930
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:46,360
So it's going to have, I can promise you, inside of this thing.

1931
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:49,640
I've already talked to the professor who did the scans.

1932
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,280
Oh really?

1933
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,080
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,800
He's at Kentucky Seals.

1935
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,800
And he's a nice guy, really nice guy.

1936
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,120
And he said, no, this is all going to be made public.

1937
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,520
Public access.

1938
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,880
So I've already got a team of people.

1939
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,840
Shout out to the followers of Lady Babylon.

1940
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,920
Who are ready to transcribe and translate.

1941
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,120
I guarantee you, I promise you.

1942
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,760
How close do you think AI is a translating Greek?

1943
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,520
And how accurate do you think it could possibly get?

1944
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,680
I just had a conversation with Dr. Ruck about that, just a short one.

1945
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,680
And it's going to happen, yeah.

1946
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:33,640
Even if they feed it, the lexicon, it depends on what they feed her.

1947
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,360
But I like Mary nourished in the temple.

1948
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,080
Did you know Mary was being fed by angels?

1949
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:39,800
No.

1950
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,200
Yeah.

1951
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:44,360
She's got purple fingers in the apocryphal text.

1952
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:45,640
Yeah.

1953
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,760
She's got purple fingers.

1954
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,400
Wow.

1955
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,520
She's feeding from-

1956
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,800
So Mary was doing drugs.

1957
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,920
From the angels.

1958
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:52,840
Yeah.

1959
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,040
That's when they auctioned her off at 12.

1960
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,640
A lot of this.

1961
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,480
Can we go here yet or no?

1962
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:03,160
How far into the podcast are we?

1963
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,120
We're at, I would say, 145.

1964
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,960
We can start to delve in.

1965
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,320
There's got to be a point where we're going to cut it for Patreon.

1966
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,400
But let's keep going and then-

1967
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,200
Should we go?

1968
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:14,760
Yeah.

1969
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,440
I'll mute some stuff if we have to.

1970
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,880
And then if it's getting too deep, then we'll just jump to the Patreon.

1971
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:20,680
So-

1972
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,920
Deep breath.

1973
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,040
I'm going to sound like a complete idiot when I'm trying to ask you this question.

1974
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,240
But to the best of my knowledge, at some point,

1975
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:44,040
the Romans tried to get rid of all these texts and get rid of all of the links to drugs, right?

1976
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,160
And they tried to rewrite history.

1977
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,720
The Romans, I wouldn't call those people Romans.

1978
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,160
I would say the Christians.

1979
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,960
The Christians.

1980
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,360
Yeah.

1981
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:56,120
Yeah.

1982
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,320
Who were the first Christians?

1983
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,920
Who were the-

1984
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,360
You know who the first one was?

1985
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,840
It's the guy in the cross with the head of the ass.

1986
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,520
Jesus was the first Christian.

1987
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,160
No, that's the first depiction of Jesus.

1988
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,680
The first depiction of Jesus.

1989
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,880
Yeah, isn't that neat?

1990
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,680
If you knew the ancient cult, you'd have ears to hear.

1991
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,120
And you'd know what that means.

1992
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:23,880
The metamorphoses will teach you everything, the transformations.

1993
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,960
Can you expand on that?

1994
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,640
What was the first depiction of Jesus?

1995
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:36,360
Him on a dude on a cross, very crude dude on a cross with the head of an ass.

1996
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,880
With the head of a donkey.

1997
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,120
Yeah.

1998
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:40,680
Yeah.

1999
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,600
You didn't know Nacander?

2000
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,320
No.

2001
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:49,560
No, Nacander was a priest, first century BC, late second, first.

2002
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:54,200
And at the time, they were all super well educated.

2003
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,400
Mm-hmm.

2004
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:00,440
And this guy Nacander, he's quoted by later authorities all over the place.

2005
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,480
They're going to find Nacander in Herculaneum, you watch.

2006
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:09,720
So at what point or was there a point that the drug use started to taper off?

2007
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:17,400
Yeah, in the third and fourth, you start getting movements of Christianity

2008
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,480
that is bursting in.

2009
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,240
Libanius talks about these.

2010
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:27,480
They're raids and the Christians burst in if anybody is using incense.

2011
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:33,240
Because one of the main ways that they're using drugs is through fumigation.

2012
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:33,720
Right.

2013
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:34,920
Right?

2014
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:36,760
It's an active practice.

2015
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,480
The first Baca Medea, she does this.

2016
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,240
There's an account of it by Diodorus, the Sicilian.

2017
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:49,080
And Diodorus says that she filled a pot full of all the best choices drugs

2018
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,720
and carried it through the town burning.

2019
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,560
Carried it through the town and fumigated everyone.

2020
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,960
Wow.

2021
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:59,960
And everybody joined into this giant thing that we now call an orgy.

2022
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:00,760
Right?

2023
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:05,000
When we say the rites, the cult rites, those are the orgy.

2024
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:06,760
Right?

2025
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:12,280
And you have the association with sex, but I'm not going there.

2026
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,360
Well, there was, unless you'd like to.

2027
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,520
Orgy's were a thing.

2028
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:21,800
They were just a thing that was always going on right back then in the...

2029
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,040
No.

2030
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:23,960
No?

2031
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,600
What do you think?

2032
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,440
These people are lunatics?

2033
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,440
There's just like a whole bunch of orgy's?

2034
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2035
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,000
No, no, this isn't.

2036
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,200
I thought that there was orgy's.

2037
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:37,160
I thought that there was like in Athens.

2038
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,040
Yeah, like in Greece.

2039
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,640
In Greece, there was always orgy's.

2040
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:46,200
But the problem was that there was like family members participating in the same,

2041
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,240
like a mother and son.

2042
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,640
And then that was looked down upon by the people in Rome.

2043
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,480
That's what the Christians were doing.

2044
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,280
They started persecuting the Christians for the Roman government.

2045
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,760
Oh, so the Christians were the one that were.

2046
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,000
The...

2047
01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,560
The...

2048
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,360
In the...

2049
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,560
Not the Greeks.

2050
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,080
No, it was Roman political control.

2051
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,360
Yeah, that exerted that influence.

2052
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,040
They're the ones who were the saved the children from second mommy.

2053
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:12,760
You know what I mean?

2054
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:13,400
Okay.

2055
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,400
They were rounding up, especially in Alexandria, because that was the thing.

2056
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,440
They would get involved in practices.

2057
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:25,960
The Christians, they would filate the dude who was their equivalent of a priest.

2058
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,000
It was like a father.

2059
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,680
Yeah, he was the leader of the Christian covenant.

2060
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,760
Yeah, it was this.

2061
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,960
Their Romans were like, no, we stop at the end where they have an order all the time.

2062
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,480
No, but you have seasonal.

2063
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,240
Right.

2064
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:48,360
Seasonal religious actions that you and I will classify as both or just a religious ritual and

2065
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,560
or right.

2066
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,480
Right.

2067
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:57,960
There's a reason those two words are from the same, you know, emotion.

2068
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:58,280
Right.

2069
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:58,440
Right.

2070
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,000
Right.

2071
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,960
Same gut because it was religion to them as well.

2072
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:02,920
Right.

2073
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,640
And if you don't understand that, it's because you're not a...

2074
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,520
No, I understand.

2075
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,400
I can understand it.

2076
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,960
You did Buddhism stuff then.

2077
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,400
You probably...

2078
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,760
I don't have any of that, but isn't that an Eastern thing as well?

2079
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,960
I didn't do any Buddhism stuff.

2080
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,520
It didn't?

2081
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:16,920
No.

2082
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:17,240
No.

2083
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,280
What gave you that idea?

2084
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:18,840
I don't know.

2085
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,640
It's been previous misconception.

2086
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,320
No, it was somebody you were interviewing was talking about.

2087
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,440
Oh, it was...

2088
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,560
Oh, now you did it.

2089
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,720
It was the guy that I hate that...

2090
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,520
Okay, look, I don't hate this guy, but I hated his interview with you.

2091
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,920
I thought he was being condescending.

2092
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:35,160
Why?

2093
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,080
You just thought he was being condescending.

2094
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,360
You didn't disagree with anything he was saying.

2095
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,760
You thought you didn't think what he was saying was wrong, right?

2096
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,760
No, I thought a lot of what he's saying is wrong.

2097
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,840
Yeah, but he's not a tax guy.

2098
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,760
He doesn't work with those classical tax.

2099
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,800
So whenever...

2100
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,680
You have to be careful whenever somebody steps out there

2101
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:54,120
onto some classical concept like Gnosticism.

2102
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,640
Hey, buddy, if you can't go back and you can't read the originals,

2103
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,640
don't bother saying anything about it.

2104
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:05,800
My mentor, Dr. John Scarborough at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,

2105
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,560
told me on the first day he said,

2106
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:16,200
it's great to have you as a student and drop all your secondary sources,

2107
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,560
because we're not about that.

2108
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,880
We don't care what other people think.

2109
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,760
We don't want you to tell me what your theories are.

2110
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,080
Religious studies.

2111
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,520
And I'm telling you this just as one person to another.

2112
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,960
Religious studies.

2113
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,040
This is why classical philologists laugh at religious studies.

2114
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,160
Why?

2115
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,160
Because they don't master the basics.

2116
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,960
Don't tell me what Cicero said.

2117
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,840
Don't tell me what Homer said unless you can read what Homer said.

2118
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,320
I used to tell my seminarians that because I taught at seminary.

2119
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:51,960
Who was Homer?

2120
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,160
Who was Homer?

2121
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:53,880
He was a poet.

2122
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,320
He was a bard, baby.

2123
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:55,800
From when?

2124
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,320
He sang the song Eighth.

2125
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:58,520
Eighth Century.

2126
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,720
Yeah, Eighth Century.

2127
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:06,760
There's three famous poets who you talk about who you take the sources from,

2128
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:09,640
which is Homer, Ovid, and who else?

2129
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,840
Yeah, Ovid not so much.

2130
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,800
Not so much Ovid.

2131
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,520
Yeah, yeah, no.

2132
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,320
If I only had my three choices, I was going to make a soup of the best stuff.

2133
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,400
Yeah, I would say Homer and I would say Pindar.

2134
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,280
Pindar.

2135
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,680
Yeah, Pindar gives you that classical flavor.

2136
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,360
And then I would say Aeschylus as did Euripides.

2137
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,960
He had to give in.

2138
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:41,320
In Aristophanes play, The Frogs, Zionisus goes to the underworld.

2139
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:48,040
Remember the stage at the time is a place of ritual purification.

2140
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,760
It's a place of ritual purification.

2141
01:45:52,760 --> 01:46:01,880
So Aristophanes pulls out Euripides and Aeschylus fighting about who's the best,

2142
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:05,240
who's the better poet in hell, if you will.

2143
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,440
In hell.

2144
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,880
Yeah, it's not really hell.

2145
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,800
They didn't really have a concept of hell.

2146
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,840
It was the other side of the dark star.

2147
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,480
The other side of the dark star.

2148
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:22,360
Yeah, which is apparently, it's apparently the place from which they would pull

2149
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,600
all of this oracular information.

2150
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,840
They said it was the real and we were the image of it.

2151
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,040
Go figure.

2152
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,560
Okay, I don't know what that means.

2153
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,360
I don't know either.

2154
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,240
Yeah, maybe you got to be on the juice.

2155
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:37,560
Maybe.

2156
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,680
You got to stick that stuff up your ass.

2157
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:46,200
Yeah, we got to put some purple in our butts to really understand what was going on.

2158
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,240
Yeah.

2159
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:54,200
Okay, so the first depiction of Christ was a man being crucified with a donkey head.

2160
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:54,520
Correct.

2161
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,880
And so who was Jesus Christ?

2162
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,760
Yeah, Christ is a title.

2163
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,760
Christ is a title.

2164
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,680
Yeah, Christ is a title.

2165
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,440
Yeah, and it's a pharmaceutical term.

2166
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,080
It's the-

2167
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:10,680
Christ is a pharmaceutical term.

2168
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,160
Where you put-

2169
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,800
In Greek.

2170
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:12,520
Yeah, yes.

2171
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:15,320
And it means, I have several examples over to show you,

2172
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:21,400
but it means you can perform an incristation, they called it, where I give you a drug.

2173
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:26,200
What usually what you'll see me do is I'll spit on the ground.

2174
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,280
Yeah, I'll spit on the ground and I'll use a combination of earth and spittle, my own spittle.

2175
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,320
Why am I spitting?

2176
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:36,360
Did you know Jesus walked out and spit in people's faces?

2177
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:37,800
I thought you said Christ was just a-

2178
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,440
I didn't-

2179
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,800
He was an actual person?

2180
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,800
In the text.

2181
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,400
Who is he in the text?

2182
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,520
Who is yeah?

2183
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,120
Yeah, that's what's most important.

2184
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:46,440
Okay.

2185
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:49,240
That text is going to show us history, right?

2186
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:53,640
You can say what you want about the text as long as we're translating it accurately.

2187
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,640
So what is the text?

2188
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,160
Because the text is our evidence.

2189
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:58,200
This is science, man.

2190
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:05,880
I refuse to give over the discipline of classics to the humanities people.

2191
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,720
It needs to be taken by the scientists.

2192
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,320
It's linguistics is a science.

2193
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:12,920
I'm not a linguist, I'm not a linguist, I'm a classical philologist.

2194
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,040
What's the difference?

2195
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,120
Linguists do general stuff, right?

2196
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:22,840
Like how language acts under certain circumstances or, you know, it's the basic mechanics.

2197
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,360
Allegra was a linguist.

2198
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:30,360
Yeah, classists do just Greek and then there are some that do Latin.

2199
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,560
Okay, okay.

2200
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,600
All right, so tell me more about Christ.

2201
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,920
Yeah, so it's a drug term and it means to be putting that thing in your eye.

2202
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,960
Can I show you something?

2203
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:46,760
So to Christ or to christen means to put drugs in your eyes.

2204
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,040
Originally, yeah.

2205
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:48,760
Originally.

2206
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,720
Originally.

2207
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:50,520
Okay.

2208
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:58,520
So how did this get turned into the person everybody knows as Jesus Christ?

2209
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:59,320
Fairytale.

2210
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:04,520
For example, you can talk about the age of the apostles, right?

2211
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,000
And everybody gets in their mind.

2212
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,840
The images of bearded adult men, right?

2213
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,400
People don't realize those are teenagers.

2214
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:13,960
The apostles.

2215
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,160
We're talking about the picture of like Jesus with the apostles the last supper.

2216
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,000
Yeah, notice they're all bearded men.

2217
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,680
They're all bearded men, yeah.

2218
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,880
What happened because of the original description?

2219
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,840
He's constantly calling them children and they aren't.

2220
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,760
In the original description, who's constantly calling?

2221
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:37,400
Okay, so like James and John are two of Jesus's boys.

2222
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:37,960
Yes.

2223
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,960
He picked them up one day on a boat.

2224
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,560
What do you mean boys?

2225
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,280
Like they're his homies or like they're his children?

2226
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,160
Yeah, what do they do?

2227
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,600
That's the question.

2228
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:53,320
They end up together a lot with boys in tombs.

2229
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,400
With boys in tombs.

2230
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:55,880
Yeah.

2231
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,360
Okay.

2232
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:56,760
Yeah.

2233
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,600
Multiple documents show that.

2234
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,160
Okay.

2235
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:06,200
We have Saint Cyril coming out of one of these graveyards with a bunch of venom that says

2236
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:11,080
bleeding out his and a couple of prophets with him.

2237
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:13,240
Right?

2238
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,640
Yeah, yeah.

2239
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,960
Every Heracles has his highless.

2240
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,680
What was, uh, yeah.

2241
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:27,960
How common was in these cultures back then in the society?

2242
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:28,600
Define.

2243
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:35,720
How was and viewed and how how ubiquitous was and what was was it looked down upon?

2244
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,560
Was it or was it just a an accepted part of society?

2245
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,160
It's kind of like drugs were.

2246
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:44,200
Oh God, it's the we got to go to Cyprus.

2247
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:52,440
We got to go to Cyprus and worship Aphrodite where once a year your wife has two choices.

2248
01:50:53,160 --> 01:51:03,240
Either she can shave her head and stay with you or she can go to the public forum

2249
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,120
and pick up one of the local sailors and with them all night.

2250
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,800
Not thinking about you and come back the next day and be completely healed.

2251
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,320
Yeah, that's the devotion.

2252
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,440
That's the devotion to the Aphrodite.

2253
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:28,200
Remember the Romans are children of Venus.

2254
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:32,920
So this is embedded.

2255
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:37,320
This woman centric gorgeous goddess.

2256
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,400
This is part of their medical system.

2257
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:42,680
It's part of their healing.

2258
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:50,840
And so those you asked me about later those the Christians would call prophets.

2259
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,200
And that's where you and I get our term from.

2260
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,280
Okay.

2261
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,120
And the negative you would never.

2262
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,880
These are priestesses of Aphrodite.

2263
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,720
You have made sacred the institution of.

2264
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:15,160
Why would the why would the wives have to go with sailors and who were the sailors?

2265
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,400
I don't know.

2266
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,080
Sometimes you get the need.

2267
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,040
Who were the sailors?

2268
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:23,640
Look, they come in and they go and it's a religious festival.

2269
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,600
If you have a problem with that, that's between you and your wife.

2270
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:34,760
Now, what kind of instruction does that give to the people to the men on Cyprus?

2271
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:35,480
What kind of instruction?

2272
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:39,320
What what do you what do you learn from that kind of religious festival?

2273
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,480
Or once a year, your wife gets to go have it with who with whomever she wants.

2274
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,920
Are the wives wanting to do this?

2275
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,680
Well, you'd have to ask them when they're doing it.

2276
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,440
But since they all come back with smiles,

2277
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,240
it says that they come back with smiles.

2278
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:04,840
No, I made up they could come back with smiles, but they do it every year.

2279
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,200
And you only have one choice.

2280
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,840
Shave your head and enter.

2281
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:10,120
And why do they say shave your head?

2282
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,200
Because that shows that you're in the sign of morning,

2283
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:15,320
that you're mourning the loss of Adonis.

2284
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,040
That you're mourning that.

2285
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,960
So you stay with your husband.

2286
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,400
You see the loyalty.

2287
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,480
She's loyal to him, even in death.

2288
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,040
The women who keep their hair.

2289
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:27,320
That's resurrection, baby.

2290
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:28,760
Right.

2291
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,880
They're out there.

2292
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,600
This is Easter.

2293
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:31,880
Yeah.

2294
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:33,240
Yeah.

2295
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,960
Does that kid look exactly like you?

2296
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,560
Yeah.

2297
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,000
Half sisters and brothers.

2298
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,440
Huh.

2299
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,320
Yeah.

2300
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,840
Children of Aphrodite.

2301
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,200
Right.

2302
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,480
Sons of God.

2303
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,360
These are Romans.

2304
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:52,280
That's what the Romans called themselves.

2305
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,040
Right.

2306
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,120
Offspring of Aphrodite herself.

2307
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:58,600
It's gorgeous.

2308
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:03,560
Once you have access to these texts, you'll be surprised.

2309
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,360
It'll open up a whole new world that is the actual history.

2310
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,520
History means inquiry.

2311
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:12,440
All right.

2312
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:14,040
It's not a linear chain of events.

2313
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:15,480
It means inquiry.

2314
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:20,680
And specifically, Historia were the questions that you ask oracles.

2315
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,600
And who are oracles?

2316
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,960
Some 14-year-old girl totally bombed on drugs.

2317
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,080
Singing.

2318
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:27,880
Wow.

2319
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:29,160
Singing.

2320
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:29,400
Yeah.

2321
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:29,960
Her words.

2322
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,680
They're divine.

2323
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:35,400
If we follow them, we're going to end up at democracy.

2324
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:45,160
I think it was in your book, I think it was Plato who you said that he was a

2325
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:56,440
tempting to or maybe he wasn't attempting to, but he thought of drugs and delusion and

2326
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,760
creativity and mania.

2327
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,520
All is the same thing.

2328
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:02,920
Right.

2329
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:14,360
And I think you used an analogy to the human soul being driven by two horses.

2330
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:23,880
The human soul was a chariot being pulled by two horses that were fed drugs, basically.

2331
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,080
You know whose horses those are?

2332
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,560
Those are the horses of the God's baby, right?

2333
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,480
And what are the God's fed?

2334
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,560
Ambrosia.

2335
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,000
Ambrosia.

2336
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
You know who has the best ambrosia?

2337
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,080
Ganymede.

2338
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:43,800
You know who Ganymede is?

2339
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:44,440
I don't.

2340
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,480
He's, I'm sorry.

2341
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,440
He's, if I can, if I may, kill this if you have to.

2342
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,200
Please, Steve.

2343
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:57,400
So for people who are listening to this podcast now, if it's on YouTube,

2344
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,120
it's going to be heavily censored because there's some words and there's some descriptions that

2345
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,520
Amon is giving here that can't be showed on YouTube.

2346
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,120
So if you want to watch this thing fully uncensored, it's on our Patreon.

2347
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:08,840
It's linked below.

2348
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:09,880
Sorry to interrupt.

2349
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,920
Continue, please.

2350
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,480
I will be as literal and direct as possible.

2351
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:16,840
The most scientific as possible in honor of you Danny, because I don't,

2352
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,440
I don't want to.

2353
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:21,800
I just want to make sure that this thing gets out to as many people as possible.

2354
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:22,200
Okay.

2355
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:29,720
And unfortunately, the high priests and priestesses at YouTube and Google will not

2356
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:33,000
let that happen if there are crazy words being used.

2357
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,440
So that's the only reason.

2358
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,400
Totally, totally.

2359
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,400
So Ganymede is the lover boy of Zeus.

2360
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:49,560
And what he does is he pours Zeus the nectar and in Pripyat and Colt,

2361
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,160
Pripyat is the God of the around in antiquity.

2362
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:54,680
There's a God of around.

2363
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,160
Yeah.

2364
01:56:55,160 --> 01:57:02,920
In the Met Museum, you can see they've got a thing up now of all the pripyat stuff and all the,

2365
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:08,760
you know, when you're in a city and they see a statue of Pripyat,

2366
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,960
you see a statue of Pripyat, you rub the, if you're a young girl,

2367
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,960
you rub the, for the sake of, you know, good luck.

2368
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,120
You know, you know, it's a positive thing.

2369
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:24,040
So you'd see people doing this.

2370
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,240
Every garden has a statue of Pripyat in Rome.

2371
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,040
Can you find a statue?

2372
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:28,360
Oh, there we go.

2373
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:29,000
There's a statue.

2374
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:29,720
Oh my God.

2375
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:33,880
Blow up one of these photos.

2376
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,760
Blow up that one in the middle.

2377
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,000
Yeah, joking.

2378
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:40,760
That's a beautiful one.

2379
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,000
Okay.

2380
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,600
This is according to Wikipedia.

2381
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:43,080
Okay.

2382
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:51,720
A Pripyat was described in various sources as the son of Aphrodite by Dionysus and the son

2383
01:57:51,720 --> 01:58:02,200
of Dionysus and Chion as perhaps the father or son of Hermes or as the son of Zeus or Pan.

2384
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:03,560
Okay.

2385
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:04,680
So that thing.

2386
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,160
Oh, wow.

2387
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:05,640
Go hang on.

2388
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,360
Go back real quick.

2389
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2390
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:16,600
According to legend, Hurrah cursed him with inconvenient impotence.

2391
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:20,600
He could not sustain an eruption when the time came for septic intercourse.

2392
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,240
Inconvenient impotence.

2393
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:25,640
I've read.

2394
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,280
So he had a huge, but he couldn't get it hard.

2395
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:35,480
I've read descriptions in different ancient authors about the different drugs that are made

2396
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:41,960
in order to induce and to reduce it.

2397
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:45,160
So yeah, it's a drug thing they're using.

2398
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,360
Look at that little guy there.

2399
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:46,840
Yeah.

2400
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:52,040
The first thing Bacchus did when he came back from hell is he sat on a

2401
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,560
over the grave of the guy who pointed in the direction of the cave.

2402
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,400
We're going to go find the underworld.

2403
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:01,080
Yeah.

2404
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,440
Why are they doing that stuff with their?

2405
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:06,280
Yeah.

2406
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,600
Why, why are these people such sickos?

2407
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,040
You, you asked me.

2408
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:12,520
You were like, are you sure you're not just focusing too much?

2409
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:12,920
Look at this.

2410
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:14,920
Yeah.

2411
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:17,160
No, I guess it's hard to escape.

2412
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:17,880
Right.

2413
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:18,440
Yeah.

2414
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:18,840
Yeah.

2415
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:25,240
The first depictions of Aphrodite or she has a beautiful woman with a giant

2416
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,440
coming right at you.

2417
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,720
Can you find this, Steve?

2418
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:30,120
Yeah.

2419
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,600
Find the early Aphrodite sculptures, please.

2420
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,280
Early Aphrodite sculptures.

2421
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:35,080
Skull sculptures.

2422
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:35,640
Yeah.

2423
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:35,880
Yeah.

2424
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:36,600
Yeah.

2425
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,080
Love it.

2426
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:37,960
It's good stuff.

2427
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,400
And they put stuff on those.

2428
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:43,560
You can find this in the satiricon, right?

2429
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:46,200
And that's how they're administering drugs.

2430
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:48,120
That's how they're administering this.

2431
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:49,560
Inventively?

2432
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:50,040
Yes.

2433
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,680
And orally and ocular.

2434
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,600
They have an ocular administration in my purse.

2435
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,240
Or an ocular.

2436
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:56,520
Yeah.

2437
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,560
No, not a, that's spreading the seed, brother.

2438
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:00,840
Right.

2439
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,960
Don't you want to have an incristation?

2440
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,360
You know, somebody seed the ophites, the ophites, they called them in antiquity.

2441
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:12,920
There it is.

2442
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:13,880
They're a sect.

2443
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:15,000
They're, look.

2444
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:15,960
This is Aphrodite.

2445
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,680
I think.

2446
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,880
She's lifting up her skirt.

2447
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:19,160
What's she got under their skirt?

2448
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,960
Oh my lord.

2449
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:22,760
What is that?

2450
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:23,960
Now why?

2451
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,720
Why?

2452
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,960
It's such a f for dethose.

2453
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,520
Why not?

2454
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,320
Yeah.

2455
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:31,880
Why not?

2456
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:35,640
Huh?

2457
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:36,760
Yeah.

2458
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:39,880
Why not?

2459
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:41,960
Is that disturbing?

2460
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:43,240
Is that disturbing?

2461
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,200
It's not disturbing.

2462
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,240
It's just interesting.

2463
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:51,000
I'm wondering, like, were they, were they hyper obsessed with gender?

2464
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,560
And why, why were they so obsessed with sex?

2465
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,640
They don't even have a word for homosexual.

2466
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:56,680
Right.

2467
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:58,040
Yeah, right.

2468
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:01,800
So it's all a part of the, they don't seem to have a problem.

2469
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:12,360
So there was no, there was no moral or ideological boundaries when it came to sex course.

2470
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:19,160
Obviously others or scientific, I mean, scientific other than the fact you could create offspring.

2471
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:19,720
Yeah.

2472
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,760
One thing you have to say, one thing you have to say, and I always use this,

2473
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:30,440
whenever you hear a historian or class assistant or anybody using generalities, right, that's,

2474
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,360
you can tell that they're full of it.

2475
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,320
Different cultures.

2476
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:40,520
We're talking about span of 2000 years, you know, say 1000 BC to 1000 auto-dominy,

2477
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,080
you know, about 2000 years.

2478
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:49,800
So in that time, you've got a lot of different things going on, right?

2479
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:52,360
Spartans do something totally different than what Greeks do, right?

2480
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:55,640
Dorians do different things than Ionians do, right?

2481
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,960
Where do we find this, where do we find this lady?

2482
02:01:57,960 --> 02:01:58,840
What about the-

2483
02:01:58,840 --> 02:01:59,480
Where do we find her?

2484
02:01:59,480 --> 02:01:59,880
Tell me where.

2485
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,400
Yeah, I don't remember where this one's from.

2486
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:02,120
Okay.

2487
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:04,360
But where is she originally her form?

2488
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:06,200
You gotta thank the great mother, baby.

2489
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,760
You gotta thank the great mother.

2490
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:12,520
There's a lot of castration going on in the worship of the great mother.

2491
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:21,240
You know, I've seen a 10-year-old boy, that's what Lucian says, a 10-year-old boy cut off his own

2492
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,960
and this was during a religious festival, right?

2493
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,400
Don't worry, the parents are there.

2494
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,080
Lucian wrote this?

2495
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:29,640
Yeah.

2496
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:30,760
Who was Lucian?

2497
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,280
Oh, he's second century.

2498
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:37,640
He's a guy who's writing the auto-dominy and he's talking about the rites of Sibley.

2499
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,360
Okay.

2500
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,080
These festivals, you know, you could go there too.

2501
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,440
It's like spring break, but-

2502
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,600
Except you're cutting off?

2503
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,080
Yeah.

2504
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:46,360
And we have an account.

2505
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:46,600
No.

2506
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:52,680
Cutellus 63 is an account of one of these boys who did this cut his

2507
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,520
off the next morning.

2508
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,400
He was like, I don't know.

2509
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,320
Regret.

2510
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,280
But she'd take the-

2511
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:07,960
says Lucian and you throw him into somebody's house and whoever gets the tables

2512
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,560
has to provide you with a woman's kit.

2513
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:13,640
What's a woman's kit?

2514
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,800
Oh, all the clothes that a woman needs to be-

2515
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:19,320
Why would they do that?

2516
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:21,880
Because you cut your-

2517
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,720
Why would you want to be dressed- cut your-

2518
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:26,920
to dress like a woman though?

2519
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,360
Because you're honoring the great mother.

2520
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,440
You're honoring the great mother.

2521
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:30,760
Yeah.

2522
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:32,520
Okay.

2523
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,080
Right, everybody loves mom except for Nazis, right?

2524
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:37,880
Yeah, I guess.

2525
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:44,200
The Romans imported her cult when they were having a problem with Hannibal.

2526
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,400
They were like, we're screwed.

2527
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:47,320
What do we do?

2528
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:52,120
And they sent somebody out to the Oracle and the Oracle at Delphi told them,

2529
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:54,920
she said, you got to import the worship of the great mother.

2530
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:55,560
Okay.

2531
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,440
And so they did.

2532
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:57,480
Okay.

2533
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:00,280
And they blew them- that's when they blew up into an empire.

2534
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:03,080
This is like 205 BC.

2535
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:03,720
Okay.

2536
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:05,480
And after that, they just blew up.

2537
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,840
Their control was blew up.

2538
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,760
It's that ecstatic worship of the mother.

2539
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,240
That's what requires the-

2540
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:19,640
Imagine how devoted you would have to be to the great mother.

2541
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:20,600
Cut off your own.

2542
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:25,240
Now, he said, sometimes tourists do get wrapped up on a whole festival

2543
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:29,240
and will be like, oh, you know, they'll join in.

2544
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:30,360
But that's-

2545
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:34,440
Right.

2546
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:37,640
Remember, you're on drugs and you're being whipped and stuff too, baby.

2547
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,080
I mean, this is intricate.

2548
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,200
This is crazy stuff.

2549
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:43,320
There's a sadistic level to this.

2550
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,200
So it's gorgeous.

2551
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:47,080
They open up these Roman villas, like the Villa of the Mysteries,

2552
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:49,720
Herculaneum and Pompeii and stuff.

2553
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:54,840
They open those things up and they've got all these frescoes of gorgeous people with

2554
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:56,840
whips and people.

2555
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,240
And you're like, what are they doing?

2556
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:00,360
What are these people doing?

2557
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,080
It's crazy.

2558
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:02,360
No, it's mental health.

2559
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:03,400
Don't worry.

2560
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:04,840
Purge is the society.

2561
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,200
The emperors know this.

2562
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:10,760
Yeah, it gets out of hand and they have a conspiracy in the 180s.

2563
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:15,640
And it gets out of hand and they end up killing like 2,000 women.

2564
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:20,440
And the way that they caught them was their drugs.

2565
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:22,280
Yeah.

2566
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,840
What was the conspiracy?

2567
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:29,800
It was a bunch of wives of prominent senators who were trying to restructure the government.

2568
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:33,720
Oh, it was a coup, a tempted coup.

2569
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:33,960
Right.

2570
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,080
That's why they took it down.

2571
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,240
They made it illegal, those Romans.

2572
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,160
These are the fresco whips of Pompeii.

2573
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,360
Yeah, look at these.

2574
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:43,160
I don't know.

2575
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:43,800
Is this them?

2576
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,520
I'm trying to find it.

2577
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,960
This is just what popped up.

2578
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:46,680
Yeah, there you go.

2579
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,040
What's going on down there?

2580
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,080
Fashion show.

2581
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,280
No, the one of them is getting beaten, baby.

2582
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,920
There's somebody right next to her with a whip.

2583
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,280
If you had a time machine, you could go to any place in history.

2584
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:01,800
Where was the first place you would go?

2585
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:06,760
Yeah, I would go back to the Garden of Gethsemane.

2586
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:09,000
The Garden of Gethsemane.

2587
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,200
It's the public park where Jesus was arrested.

2588
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,880
You are obsessed with this.

2589
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,840
Yeah, I think I'm obsessed with it.

2590
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,440
You constantly talk about this moment when Jesus was arrested.

2591
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:21,960
Yeah, it's why is that?

2592
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,640
Is this in the Bible?

2593
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,760
Yes, it is.

2594
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:25,800
Also, dumb question.

2595
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,720
How many versions of the modern Bible are there?

2596
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,720
I don't know how many, but I can think of at least 12.

2597
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,920
What's the difference between them all?

2598
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,240
Why?

2599
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:36,760
Why are there so many versions?

2600
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,840
It depends on the time that they're translated.

2601
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:42,120
And if you'll notice, a lot of them will follow the earlier authors.

2602
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:46,120
Bible scholars don't read anything outside of the Bible.

2603
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:48,280
So how good do you think their vocab is?

2604
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:50,600
How good do you think their translation skills are?

2605
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,080
That's the problem.

2606
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:55,480
Those translations are generally pretty bad.

2607
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:57,640
And that's what I brought some examples of.

2608
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:02,360
This is in the Garden, actually, that I brought these slides for.

2609
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,960
And this is the Garden of Gethsemane.

2610
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:06,760
And where are we?

2611
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:09,720
We're with Jesus in the first.

2612
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,080
And he's being arrested.

2613
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:14,920
Okay, so let's give some context.

2614
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:15,880
Let's get some context.

2615
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:16,680
Let's do it.

2616
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:21,000
So who was Jesus and why and what is so good?

2617
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,960
What is so great about him?

2618
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:26,920
Yeah, Jesus is a guy who walked around with 12 children.

2619
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,480
All the time.

2620
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:32,840
And a group of prophets.

2621
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:34,280
No, I'm just telling what the text says.

2622
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:36,440
He was just a guy who walked around with prophets.

2623
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:38,040
He prophets and children.

2624
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,000
So what was so great about him?

2625
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,280
He called his disciples and he calls them his children constantly, right?

2626
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:47,720
Remember, remember God.

2627
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:48,840
So he's a pimp.

2628
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,600
God blesses those.

2629
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:56,520
Who take care of the children, right?

2630
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,120
Okay.

2631
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:58,680
Yeah.

2632
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:00,040
He takes care of these children.

2633
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,640
He takes care of these children.

2634
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,120
Okay.

2635
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:07,720
There is a female underage called the Pideska.

2636
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:15,000
When Jesus Christ is in his trial, his followers won't admit they're his followers,

2637
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:16,760
right?

2638
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:19,160
It's the whole, you're going to deny me, right?

2639
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:22,680
Jesus is all like, I'm going to get frigging scandalized, right?

2640
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:25,960
And you're going to deny me when he's in the garden and he gets caught.

2641
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:32,120
And those three, Peter, James and John, they're keeping watch, the text says.

2642
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:39,640
They're guarding at a distance while Jesus takes a good boy that's been assigned to him.

2643
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:40,680
That's what the text says.

2644
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:42,760
Like a slave.

2645
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:52,920
So this, the depiction of this event is only in one version of the Bible, is that right?

2646
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,280
Is it Matthew?

2647
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:58,680
No, it's in multiple, but the kid is only in Mark.

2648
02:08:58,680 --> 02:08:59,640
Only in Mark.

2649
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,120
Yeah.

2650
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:00,360
Okay.

2651
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,040
And it's only like two sentences, right?

2652
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,440
Stephen, can you pull up, can you pull up the passage?

2653
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:05,480
It's, I've got it here.

2654
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,200
Oh, you've got it there.

2655
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:06,600
Okay.

2656
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:06,840
Yeah.

2657
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,560
1451, is that first line?

2658
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:15,720
I can pull up the passages and show the different versions and how it translates as well.

2659
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,080
What passage is it?

2660
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,680
Mark 1451.

2661
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:21,640
1451.

2662
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,400
All right, cool.

2663
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:23,720
Okay.

2664
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,480
A young man, what is it?

2665
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,360
Can you blow it up?

2666
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:26,600
Yeah.

2667
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:33,560
A young man wearing nothing, but a linen garment was following Jesus when they seized him.

2668
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:34,440
That's all it says.

2669
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,000
Yeah.

2670
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,200
Now look at the Greek.

2671
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2672
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:46,600
And it says, a young boy was assigned to him having wrapped his

2673
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:52,680
with a medicated bandage and they arrested him.

2674
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:54,760
A medicated bandage is what it says.

2675
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,120
Seemed on, yeah.

2676
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:56,920
I've got the.

2677
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:00,840
Okay, so I'm comparing yours to what this one says.

2678
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,400
So, visibility, I can turn on Greek as well.

2679
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:03,880
Okay.

2680
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:09,320
I'd love to see how this online Bible matches yours.

2681
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:11,080
Check out the.

2682
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:12,680
Okay, so right here.

2683
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,960
Is that exactly what you're reading?

2684
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,000
Yeah, that's what I'm reading.

2685
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,040
Okay.

2686
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:22,120
Which one of those Greek words is wrapped in a medicated linen?

2687
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:25,000
This is on the, okay.

2688
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,440
Let's just start on the first line.

2689
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,240
Maybe we should, should we go to his computer, Steve?

2690
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:29,640
Yeah, yeah.

2691
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:30,520
I'm punching it out.

2692
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:31,000
That's it.

2693
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:31,720
Okay.

2694
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,640
The first, let's go to the first one.

2695
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:39,160
The second word in is neoniskos and that is what we call a diminutive.

2696
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:40,440
Neoniskos.

2697
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,840
So, it's a little of something else.

2698
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:44,280
And what is a neonias?

2699
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,640
A neonias is a boy.

2700
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:46,760
Okay.

2701
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,080
Yeah.

2702
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,520
So, this is a little boy.

2703
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,320
Okay.

2704
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:55,480
And they called Pideska female dudes who were underage.

2705
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:55,960
Okay.

2706
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:57,560
And when I say underage, I don't mean underage.

2707
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:59,720
Did they define underage down back then?

2708
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,520
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2709
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,200
It's not under 18.

2710
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:02,920
It's before.

2711
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,000
So, okay.

2712
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:07,800
So, that was their word for, for before.

2713
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:10,840
Age was, they didn't set a year.

2714
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:11,080
Right.

2715
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:11,480
Okay.

2716
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:11,960
Got it.

2717
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:12,280
Right.

2718
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:13,960
The translation here says young.

2719
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:21,720
And was there, was there, was there any sort of moral boundaries

2720
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:29,320
when it came to, based on the, not from what I've seen.

2721
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:29,880
Okay.

2722
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:30,520
Yeah.

2723
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:33,960
Now, generally, in different, no, in different civilizations,

2724
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,160
you can still, like in Athens, you can still prosecute for somebody coercing what you and

2725
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:40,920
I would say is underage, then before.

2726
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:42,440
Yeah.

2727
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,600
That's still, you can get in trouble for that.

2728
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:44,920
Okay.

2729
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:50,120
But it's not like it, it's not like there's compensation involved because,

2730
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:53,400
you know, it's not like a crime like you and I consider a crime.

2731
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:54,600
It's more like a civil crime.

2732
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:55,800
Yeah.

2733
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:56,600
Okay.

2734
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,560
Like being punched.

2735
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:58,040
Right.

2736
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:58,440
Yeah.

2737
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:02,360
You've damaged somebody so you can give them reparations for damaging them.

2738
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:02,840
Oh, okay.

2739
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:04,200
That's what you do.

2740
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:12,120
But the pedagogy in antiquity, pedagogy, that person who raises, educates the children.

2741
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:13,480
Right.

2742
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:17,640
That person, that's the kentauron they called them.

2743
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,320
The centaur.

2744
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,200
It's their word for best.

2745
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:26,440
Which means what?

2746
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:31,320
Oh, it means with children.

2747
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,080
Yeah.

2748
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:34,520
Yeah.

2749
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:36,440
Yeah.

2750
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,600
And Chiron, remember Chiron?

2751
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:42,120
He's a centaur who is the master of Heracles.

2752
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:46,280
And now you know why Heracles has his boy Hylas.

2753
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,680
Do you understand?

2754
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:53,080
The sacred mystery is passed from generation to generation.

2755
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:55,240
Okay.

2756
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:55,480
Yeah.

2757
02:12:56,440 --> 02:13:01,640
So again, what was so special about Jesus?

2758
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:05,080
He was a guy who walked around with kids.

2759
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:05,640
Yeah.

2760
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:06,440
Apostles.

2761
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,320
Apostles.

2762
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:07,640
Yeah.

2763
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:10,840
So what was so special about him?

2764
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:12,040
Was he the only one doing that?

2765
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,240
What was so, no.

2766
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:15,160
What was so, what was so special about him?

2767
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:17,880
Like, oh, and this is, that's perfect.

2768
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:19,000
No, he's not.

2769
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,520
It's called being a laystace.

2770
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:22,200
What is a laystace?

2771
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,880
He, and he was crucified between two of these.

2772
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,280
A laystace is defined, and I've got it on the next.

2773
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:30,760
Let's see.

2774
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:34,040
Oh, here, look, this follows my presentation.

2775
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:39,080
So this is what the boy that was with Jesus, the boy,

2776
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:42,600
this is what he was with him, doing him.

2777
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,120
He's, he's following him.

2778
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:47,080
Notice they use this term, Tsunakulethu.

2779
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:50,200
And where, where do you get this from?

2780
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:50,840
This, this image.

2781
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:54,440
Oh, this, the thank you to the Victorians from Oxford,

2782
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:58,280
who have given us this wonderful, fantastic lexicon

2783
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:01,000
of ancient Greek, 1850s.

2784
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:06,520
After that book that you just had was, was written.

2785
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:08,120
And here it is.

2786
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:11,080
And it's, notice that it's using soldiers.

2787
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:14,920
It's using term for soldiers and slaves, right?

2788
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:19,160
So this kid is not just hanging out with Jesus, right?

2789
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:24,520
People have tried to explain this for a while.

2790
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:27,080
What was the kid doing with Jesus, right?

2791
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:30,040
Okay. Anyway, let's go on to the next one.

2792
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:31,080
Double click.

2793
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:31,480
There you go.

2794
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,520
Now hit the green button.

2795
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:35,320
Look, this is what the kid is wrapped on his gumnos.

2796
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,760
And you say, what's gumnos?

2797
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:37,320
Gumnos is.

2798
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,080
Fine cloth, usually linen.

2799
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:39,880
Yeah.

2800
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:40,360
Yeah.

2801
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:41,160
Fine cloth.

2802
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:44,200
Look, look, look, look where it's, look at the second line.

2803
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:47,720
It says, busines, telamones, right?

2804
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:51,880
So they're wrapping things in this fine cloth, right?

2805
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:54,520
And surgeons bandages.

2806
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,400
And bandages.

2807
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:56,840
And that's where I get it.

2808
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:59,080
On my end, when I'm reading the medical authors,

2809
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,840
they're all saying that you impregnate linen with drugs

2810
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:05,000
that you're going to treat the wound with, right?

2811
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,720
This kind of makes sense.

2812
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:07,960
You impregnate women.

2813
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,560
No, no, linen, linen, I'm sorry.

2814
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,240
You impregnate linen.

2815
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,520
Don't impregnate the women.

2816
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:13,320
With drugs.

2817
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,480
Yeah.

2818
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,280
Yeah.

2819
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:14,440
Yeah.

2820
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:15,480
To treat wounds.

2821
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:15,960
Yeah.

2822
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:16,360
Okay.

2823
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:16,680
So.

2824
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,400
That makes sense.

2825
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:19,720
This is, this is the original text.

2826
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:24,040
And this right here is the translation that we have right now,

2827
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:26,200
which is, I'll punch it up for people,

2828
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:29,480
but a, nothing but a linen garment.

2829
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:30,600
Yeah.

2830
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:34,120
Notice how they took it from a bandage and turned it into.

2831
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:34,680
Who did this?

2832
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:35,960
Who's responsible for this?

2833
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:37,320
Crappy translators.

2834
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:40,120
People who do not work with the Greek.

2835
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:40,920
If you'll bring up the next one.

2836
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,200
Is this, but is this, is this an accident or is this intentional?

2837
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:45,480
No.

2838
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:46,120
These translations.

2839
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:47,480
Intentional stupidity.

2840
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:51,000
Are they intentionally leaving this, this out of the Bible?

2841
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,440
No, it's bad training.

2842
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:53,160
Oh, okay.

2843
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:54,680
It's just bad training.

2844
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:55,560
Okay.

2845
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:55,800
Yeah.

2846
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:57,320
There we go.

2847
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,280
Now watch this one.

2848
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:00,760
Okay.

2849
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:03,240
So that last one had businos on it.

2850
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,760
Well, what is the businos?

2851
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:07,400
It's fine linen bandage, right?

2852
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:08,360
They give you at the top,

2853
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:10,920
but then look at the reference on the second line.

2854
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,440
That's Euripides bakai.

2855
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:13,640
Okay.

2856
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:18,360
So this is something that they're using within some kind of religious ritual.

2857
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:23,960
And look at number two at the bottom, Roman numeral number two por furus.

2858
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,080
That's Hesekius.

2859
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:26,920
And who's Hesekius?

2860
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:32,600
Hesekius is a lexicographer from the fourth and fifth who comes in.

2861
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:39,080
And he has access to these ancient Greek lexicography texts, right?

2862
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:43,720
So before anybody was having any kind of substantial literature,

2863
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,800
the Greeks were already at the level.

2864
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:47,880
And these are ancient Greeks.

2865
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:54,120
They're already at the level of creating a language that is so highly specialized.

2866
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:56,840
We're still trying to translate it.

2867
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:59,560
Look at por furos here, right?

2868
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:02,600
And you see the different dialects that you get from at the top.

2869
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:08,680
You got it in Attic and you got it in Eolian and they got some Sappho there.

2870
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,840
Well, look at number one, right?

2871
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,120
It's something you do at the sea.

2872
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:14,440
Number two, blood gushing.

2873
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,120
Purple.

2874
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:18,280
Number two, the purple.

2875
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:22,600
Of purple, of stuff, cloths, et cetera.

2876
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:24,680
Yeah, et cetera.

2877
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:26,600
It's a dye, right?

2878
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:28,600
Look at number three, purple clad.

2879
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,520
You can have the purple people, right?

2880
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,280
We're walking around with their purple.

2881
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:35,320
And then number four, purple spas.

2882
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:38,440
But then number five is a specific.

2883
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:40,920
And then number six, oh, more, there it is.

2884
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,560
It's that thing that sets, right?

2885
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:44,280
The purple.

2886
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:51,000
It's the, it's the chemical that we're going to be using within the right

2887
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,320
to make what is called the burning purple.

2888
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,560
And that comes from the virgin.

2889
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:57,880
And they come from the virgin.

2890
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,160
Yeah, right.

2891
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:02,280
Mary's fingers were covered with purple.

2892
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:06,200
And when her midwife came in to check her,

2893
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:10,040
because that's what midwives do, all this stuff, by the way,

2894
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:11,400
is coming from medicine.

2895
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:12,920
It's coming from women's medicine.

2896
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:15,400
Yeah, that's where all the science is.

2897
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,160
And when the midwife came in to check her.

2898
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,240
To check Mary, she palpated her.

2899
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:19,960
How'd she do that?

2900
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,640
Say she stuck her two fingers in.

2901
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:25,320
And that's how, that's what they do when they're,

2902
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:26,760
when someone's pregnant to check.

2903
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:26,840
Yeah.

2904
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,840
How dilated their cervix is or whatever.

2905
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:29,320
Yeah, right.

2906
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:31,720
Yeah, you do the same thing with cows, right?

2907
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:35,080
I guess, I don't know, never heard of cow.

2908
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:35,400
No.

2909
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:38,200
Well, here she, her and then she, oh God,

2910
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,400
now you're going to have to pull that out.

2911
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,040
Don't say that.

2912
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:40,280
Don't say that.

2913
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,320
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2914
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:43,320
Okay, what happened?

2915
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,000
Yeah, we're just creating more work for the editor.

2916
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,160
She, she had purple fingers and those purple fingers burned.

2917
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:52,600
Right.

2918
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:55,960
Says the apocryphal text say it burned her finger,

2919
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:57,240
the midwife's finger.

2920
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:58,840
Okay.

2921
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:02,520
Um, where are we getting Baptist from?

2922
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:05,560
And you say, wait a minute, this thing's jumping all over.

2923
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,000
No, we're still talking about the purple.

2924
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:08,200
Look at this.

2925
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,560
This is the word buffet.

2926
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:13,000
Dipping of red hot iron in water.

2927
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,160
Hence temper or edge of a blade or tool produced thereby.

2928
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2929
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,160
No, look at number two.

2930
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:23,160
Die.

2931
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:23,640
Die.

2932
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:25,240
And the source there is theophrasis.

2933
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,680
Blood, die of blood.

2934
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:27,160
Yeah.

2935
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,160
That's the source there is theophrasis.

2936
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:32,680
Since the historian Plontorum, he was a student of Aristotle.

2937
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:35,160
And he's the first botanist.

2938
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:36,200
He's considered the free.

2939
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,880
He wasn't the first botanist, but he was considered to be the father of botany.

2940
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:42,440
And if you look at the word that follows theophrasis,

2941
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:46,360
it's porfura, which is just the word we got out of Herculaneum.

2942
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:50,600
And it says porfura buffet.

2943
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:55,240
The baptism is a baptism into the purple.

2944
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:57,800
Okay.

2945
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:59,960
We didn't, we didn't leave the cult.

2946
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:02,040
We're still in the cult, right?

2947
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:03,880
Baptists, you know what baptists carry?

2948
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:05,160
They carry drugs.

2949
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:05,720
Yeah.

2950
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:06,840
They carry drugs.

2951
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,880
Everybody's carrying drugs.

2952
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,640
Oh, and by the way, in the Roman market is an open market.

2953
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,240
The Roman market is an open market.

2954
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:15,560
Yeah.

2955
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:16,280
You can buy anything.

2956
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:20,040
You can buy venom from North Africa in the Roman market.

2957
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:21,000
Make a concoction.

2958
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,360
It'll knock you down.

2959
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:26,280
And we know this because they have recipes and doctors

2960
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:29,000
writing about what do you do when you come across somebody

2961
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,600
and he's had too much hemlock.

2962
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:32,680
The first time I read that I was like, wait a minute,

2963
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:33,480
too much hemlock.

2964
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:35,400
That's what Socrates was killed with, right?

2965
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:36,360
Mm-hmm.

2966
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:36,840
Yeah.

2967
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:38,200
But this is a dude who just-

2968
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:40,120
Do you use small amounts to trip balls?

2969
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,360
He said, he said he'll be walking on all fours

2970
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,800
and bleeding like a sheep.

2971
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:48,920
God.

2972
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah.

2973
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:51,720
And what do you do?

2974
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:53,080
You got to give him an antidote.

2975
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:55,880
And that's where I was talking before about the rope

2976
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:58,040
that's in the cave, that's guiding us through the cave,

2977
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:58,840
is the science.

2978
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:04,120
They have come through.

2979
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:07,800
The Romans have come through a world that was a bronze age

2980
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:10,920
renaissance of drugs,

2981
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:13,720
dotes and antidotes, they call it,

2982
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:15,480
Christ and Antichrist.

2983
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:17,640
Oh.

2984
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:18,280
Yeah.

2985
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:18,920
Yeah.

2986
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,760
They are pharmacological terms.

2987
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:22,600
And they're using them that way.

2988
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:23,960
And when you get baptized,

2989
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,040
this is what you're being baptized into.

2990
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:29,400
It's the only way to bring eternal life.

2991
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,320
And you say, wait a minute,

2992
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:32,200
why don't I thought,

2993
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:33,960
because you're thinking the wrong eternal life.

2994
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:37,080
There's no phrase in the New Testament that says eternal life.

2995
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:40,040
They all say Ionic life.

2996
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,160
Ionic life.

2997
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:41,800
Uh-huh.

2998
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:42,920
Which, what does that mean?

2999
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,160
It's outside the time stream.

3000
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:47,160
That's how they describe it.

3001
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:50,280
Pythagoras said it has 360 degrees.

3002
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:53,000
Yeah.

3003
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,280
So they're talking about some sort of DMT realm, maybe.

3004
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:58,280
Quantum physics, I don't understand it.

3005
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,600
Because they're also talking about the dark star.

3006
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:03,320
This stuff is all accessible across the dark star.

3007
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:07,240
So I don't know what that means,

3008
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:10,440
but I know that you have to join a lot of drugs and a lot of

3009
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:13,000
behavior.

3010
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,600
Where does Bacchus always lead?

3011
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,760
Bacchus always leads us to Aphrodite.

3012
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:19,000
Why is that?

3013
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,680
Because she is life.

3014
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,280
There's a sacred name of Rome that is sacred,

3015
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,320
and I give everybody on my channel a hard time

3016
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:33,160
to derive the sacred name.

3017
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,840
They can't derive the sacred name.

3018
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:36,040
If you know this,

3019
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:37,400
this is what they said in antiquity,

3020
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,040
don't blame me.

3021
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:40,920
They said if you knew the sacred name of Rome,

3022
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:42,440
you can control her power.

3023
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,480
If you knew the sacred name of Rome,

3024
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,880
you could control her power.

3025
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3026
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:55,080
And that name is the operation of a mystery.

3027
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:58,040
The name is an operation of a mystery.

3028
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,480
It's the operation.

3029
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:02,760
It is that resurrection of the Korah.

3030
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:04,440
That's why in the,

3031
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:07,240
which they did in Elucis every year.

3032
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:08,200
Right.

3033
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:14,520
Which is why you have the very same kind of worship

3034
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,400
that's spreading through the oracles.

3035
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:21,560
The oracles are spreading the power of that Elucinian,

3036
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:23,160
they call it a purification.

3037
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:29,240
When you can put your population through an act

3038
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:30,760
that brings them healing,

3039
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:32,440
they're better citizens.

3040
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:33,560
Wow.

3041
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:35,240
Yeah.

3042
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:35,640
Wow.

3043
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:37,320
Yeah.

3044
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,320
Now you understand what they call the temple.

3045
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:43,720
This is some wild sh** man.

3046
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:47,400
Uh, priest is, means process.

3047
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:50,440
Well, that's what the later Christians call them.

3048
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:51,720
You know why they did now,

3049
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:53,640
because this is the activity they're doing.

3050
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:55,880
They're bringing that healing.

3051
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:56,920
All right.

3052
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,680
There's 20, there's 20,000,

3053
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,280
I think it was 20 or 22,000,

3054
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:04,600
that celebrate during the Bonadia, the Romans call it.

3055
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,480
I mean, it's all,

3056
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:09,320
this is all making a lot more sense to me now.

3057
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:13,640
I mean, it's, it's when you're talking about the creation of

3058
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:17,240
democracy and, and saving humanity from itself,

3059
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:22,760
and trying to eliminate all the negative influences of,

3060
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:25,000
of ancient oligarchs or tyrants,

3061
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:30,600
and trying to create a just and fair society,

3062
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:35,640
that's essentially what, what they did.

3063
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:40,200
And, and the use of, of drugs

3064
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:43,800
to, to have an understanding of this,

3065
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,720
and to create this sort of world,

3066
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,400
that, that is the best way.

3067
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:50,600
I mean, even in modern times,

3068
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:54,600
when you hear people talking about psychedelic experiences,

3069
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,600
and, or, you know,

3070
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:59,560
experimenting with things like DMT or, or whatever it is,

3071
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:06,760
there are many modern descriptions of this same thing

3072
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,960
you're sort of talking about.

3073
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:11,400
I mean, and even like, if you talk about, like, if, if,

3074
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:17,720
if you wanted the best, most just and fair,

3075
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:21,080
uncorrupted version of government today,

3076
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:23,560
you would want the president of the United States to trip,

3077
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:25,400
to be tripping on mushrooms, right?

3078
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:28,040
So, but the problem with it is the way that we look at,

3079
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,000
the way we look at it today is,

3080
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,560
if you have all the people, like when it,

3081
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:34,600
going back to democracy,

3082
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,680
if you have all of these people,

3083
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:39,080
10% of your population making the decisions

3084
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,600
and debating the decisions,

3085
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,920
you're never going to become the number one empire.

3086
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:46,440
You're not going to be able to control other empires

3087
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,440
because you're only worrying about yourself.

3088
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:51,640
You're not creating wars

3089
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:53,560
and trying to influence the rest of the world

3090
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:56,280
and trying to, trying to have the stranglehold

3091
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:57,320
on everyone else.

3092
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:02,440
You're just worrying about your society and being good.

3093
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:08,440
And the downside of that is you become vulnerable

3094
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:11,960
to the outside world.

3095
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:16,520
Or to an insurrection, which is,

3096
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:19,320
which is what happened to the Romans

3097
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:20,520
and they're screaming.

3098
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:21,960
The emperor Julian is like,

3099
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:25,000
oh my God, do not let the Christians teach.

3100
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:28,440
And, you know, today that's like, what?

3101
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:30,120
Oh, that's so terrible.

3102
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:33,000
No, he says they will pull down your government

3103
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:33,800
right around years

3104
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:37,240
and they'll set up something that's horrific in its place.

3105
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:38,040
Sure enough, they did.

3106
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:38,920
They killed him though.

3107
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:40,200
I'll put it in within a few years.

3108
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:43,480
He was dead by a Christian soldier who speared him in the back.

3109
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:48,440
Yeah, yeah, it's the attempt to extinguish.

3110
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:51,960
That's why I'm so grateful for the Herculaneum Scrolls

3111
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:55,160
because every time, this is the largest,

3112
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:59,000
the only intact library that we have from the ancient world.

3113
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:02,440
And it is the largest collection.

3114
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:05,080
It will have completely new authors.

3115
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:07,480
It will have authors that we know exist,

3116
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:10,360
but we didn't have that copy of that play.

3117
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,320
It'll have those two.

3118
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:14,680
And every time in history there is,

3119
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:16,600
I have great, I bring you great news

3120
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,680
because every time in history that we have a enlightenment,

3121
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:27,800
it's based upon a resurgence of that classical muse.

3122
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:29,720
It's based upon her.

3123
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,360
And to call that forward,

3124
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:35,640
I predict that this thing is potentially

3125
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,920
able to create another renaissance.

3126
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:44,600
And I hope people are aware that it's out there.

3127
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:48,680
And it has silver, it has the purple written on it, right?

3128
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:49,480
There?

3129
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,120
Yeah.

3130
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:52,360
Exactly, exactly.

3131
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:55,800
So these translations that you just pulled up,

3132
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:59,480
what does this have to do with,

3133
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:05,080
or what does this tell you about the scene of Jesus in the park?

3134
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:07,560
That's exactly what this verse says right here.

3135
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:08,520
It says...

3136
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:09,720
Can you zoom in on that a little bit?

3137
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:10,440
Yeah, can we...

3138
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:11,640
There you go.

3139
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:11,960
There you go.

3140
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,840
You just did it.

3141
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:13,160
Yeah.

3142
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:15,480
And so he's, what happened?

3143
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,880
So Jesus is there and it says,

3144
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:21,960
the kid dropped the bandage and ran off.

3145
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:24,280
That's exactly what that says.

3146
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:27,400
He had dropped the bandage and ran off naked.

3147
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:27,720
Okay.

3148
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:29,240
Yeah.

3149
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:32,440
So, and it says specifically in previous, in 51,

3150
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:34,280
that it was epigumnos.

3151
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:37,720
And epigumnos is on his private parts.

3152
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:41,000
An epigumna, which is the bandage that's soaked in drugs.

3153
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,240
The scene done, that's on there, right?

3154
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:43,800
Why?

3155
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:45,320
Why is Jesus with the kid?

3156
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:48,280
Remember, when he first walks in the garden, he falls over,

3157
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:51,000
he stumbles over and he's eyes in pain,

3158
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,720
he's going through the exact same symptoms

3159
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:55,880
that doctors will describe.

3160
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:56,440
Jesus is?

3161
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:57,880
Of the drug users.

3162
02:28:57,880 --> 02:28:59,240
Yeah, it's in this chapter.

3163
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:00,200
It's in Mark 14.

3164
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:01,240
Yeah.

3165
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:02,040
So he's tripping.

3166
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:07,560
He says that he's exceptionally fearful, right?

3167
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:10,600
So it looks like he's in some kind of psychotic fear.

3168
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:15,400
And he's screaming about, take it, don't, you know,

3169
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,520
don't let me do it.

3170
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:17,640
And he's with his kid.

3171
02:29:18,280 --> 02:29:21,640
He's with this kid at the time, right?

3172
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:24,120
And he ends up with stuff on his face.

3173
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:29,560
Stuff that is like big drops of porfuran.

3174
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:32,120
Talking about bodily fluids.

3175
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:35,560
Blood is how it's typically, no, that's how it's translated.

3176
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:37,800
It's not the blood that he's got.

3177
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:38,520
It's purple.

3178
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:41,880
And he's got an antidote from the kids.

3179
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:45,080
That's the galene is the kid.

3180
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:49,160
He has to, Heracles has to have

3181
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:50,680
Hylus.

3182
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:51,800
He has to have his boy.

3183
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,480
Zeus has to have Ganymede.

3184
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:56,920
On the pripyx sign, they call it Ganymede's.

3185
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:00,600
And the question is, do you drink from Ganymede's?

3186
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:03,960
I don't.

3187
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:08,040
Well, that's why you're not in charge.

3188
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:13,000
Yeah, probably.

3189
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,600
All right, bring me back down to earth here.

3190
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:20,760
What's going on in the park again?

3191
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:25,880
So Jesus has the purple on his face.

3192
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:27,560
Yeah, he's got the purple on his face.

3193
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:32,680
Jesus is having some sort of a psychotic fit, right?

3194
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:37,560
He's having some kind of overwhelming emotional state.

3195
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,160
It's hitting him so hard.

3196
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:40,760
He's falling on the ground.

3197
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:44,760
So he's got something on board that's causing him to stumble.

3198
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:46,360
And it's 4 a.m. in the morning.

3199
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:47,320
Yeah, it's 4 a.m.

3200
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

3201
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:51,400
And he's got...

3202
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:56,680
He just came from the party with the kids.

3203
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,080
He just came from the park.

3204
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:00,280
Did one of the cops write this?

3205
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:01,560
One of the cops that arrested him?

3206
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,840
No, this is Mark.

3207
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:04,760
Mark was there.

3208
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:09,160
Well, no, Mark is telling you the secret things that you're not supposed to know.

3209
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,920
So how does Mark know if he wasn't there?

3210
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,040
Yeah, well, I don't care if he does or doesn't know.

3211
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,560
The fact is he's saying them.

3212
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:16,840
Okay.

3213
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,280
And that's what's scary.

3214
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:20,760
Well, how do we know Mark didn't have an extra ground against Jesus?

3215
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:23,560
You want to make Jesus look like a bad guy

3216
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:25,640
and make him look like a weirdo or a crazy person?

3217
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:26,520
He could, maybe.

3218
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,560
I don't know for all I know.

3219
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:31,560
That's why I say we have to stick with exactly what the source is.

3220
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:33,560
The point is that this is what...

3221
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:34,440
Take it for what it's worth.

3222
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:35,720
This is what Mark said.

3223
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:36,280
Yeah, and he said...

3224
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,400
And Mark was not there.

3225
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:41,720
No, it was Peter, James, and John and the kid.

3226
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:42,040
Okay.

3227
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:43,240
Yeah.

3228
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:48,760
Now, Mark, excuse me, where did Jesus come from before this in the scene?

3229
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:53,320
He came from the place where he was with all the kids in the upper room.

3230
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,720
That's where they came from, right?

3231
02:31:55,720 --> 02:31:56,600
In what room?

3232
02:31:56,600 --> 02:31:57,480
In the upper room.

3233
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:59,560
It's just a way to refer to the place.

3234
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:01,160
Look, it was shady, right?

3235
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,280
This is part of the cops.

3236
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:05,080
This is part of what the cops have on him, right?

3237
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:09,320
He sent out a couple of his boys to go scout out a place.

3238
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:10,280
And when he did, he told them,

3239
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:12,920
hey, you're going to come to this guy and he's standing there.

3240
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,880
And he's doing this.

3241
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:16,680
And you got to approach him and say, Jesus's boys,

3242
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:20,120
where do we need the place for Jesus to celebrate?

3243
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:22,040
And he says, take them in here.

3244
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:23,720
And he finds a guy and they take him up.

3245
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:25,400
They get a shady back room business.

3246
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:28,680
Remember, what does Jesus do with his boys?

3247
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,440
We all know this.

3248
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:33,160
That's why we're a crowd and we're angry.

3249
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:34,680
We want Jesus crucified.

3250
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:37,480
Now, you understand why there was a freaking crowd there.

3251
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:41,800
Yeah, a little bit brutal with them, weren't they?

3252
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,400
Well, yeah, they had good reason to be.

3253
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:51,800
He was with those 12 underage kids in that room washing feet.

3254
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:56,920
And you got to get it when you wash feet.

3255
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:58,360
Have you ever washed somebody's feet?

3256
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:01,720
Not that I can recall.

3257
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,240
How about a 12-year-old boy?

3258
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:04,600
No, absolutely not.

3259
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:05,640
No, why wouldn't you?

3260
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:08,040
Do you have some kind of problem with Jesus?

3261
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:11,480
Apparently I do.

3262
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:13,000
Okay, all right.

3263
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,960
That's too bad, because he ends up in the garden after this

3264
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:18,520
with the three older ones.

3265
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:21,880
And he says, keep guard while he takes the young kid off

3266
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:23,000
to the middle of the garden.

3267
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:25,400
In the meantime, they're falling asleep

3268
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:27,800
while Jesus is rolling around in agony

3269
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:32,200
and doing what he's got to do to get for the galene from the boy.

3270
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:35,000
And that's the mastery here.

3271
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,920
The boy has some kind of antidote.

3272
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:39,320
Galen describes pre-

3273
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:43,160
Yeah, it's not milky.

3274
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:45,080
Galen describes this.

3275
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:47,480
Yeah, as long as the pre-girls

3276
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:52,920
exudate from their breasts, you can milk.

3277
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:53,880
You didn't know you could?

3278
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:54,760
I did not know that.

3279
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,640
Okay, we can.

3280
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:56,200
Medically.

3281
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,520
Probably has antibodies in it to whatever the venoms they're using.

3282
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:02,680
Because these same girls, you cut them.

3283
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,640
And this stuff?

3284
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,520
You cut them and you wrap them with the snake venom.

3285
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:10,760
And that's why we all hold up serpent, right?

3286
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:11,560
We all know it.

3287
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:13,720
You see my tattoo, right?

3288
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:14,600
Which tattoo?

3289
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:16,760
It doesn't say it was on a pole.

3290
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:18,040
Show me the tattoo you're talking about.

3291
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,880
It says it was on a tattoo.

3292
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:21,000
I'm just in here.

3293
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,640
Just in here.

3294
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,480
I'm waxing, poetic.

3295
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:23,960
I'm sorry.

3296
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:28,600
Okay, so Galen talks about this

3297
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:31,000
pre-

3298
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:34,840
towards the boys and girls create.

3299
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:37,640
And he talks about this being used as an antidote

3300
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:39,480
to snake venom specifically.

3301
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:42,040
It's the, and it's the Galene.

3302
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:46,760
It's a Greek term that means the calm after the storm.

3303
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:48,600
Galene.

3304
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:51,480
And that-

3305
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:53,880
What is the calm after the storm supposed to mean though?

3306
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:58,600
Because, okay, remember how Jesus was screaming on the cross?

3307
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:01,000
I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah.

3308
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,400
You don't have to scream while you're on the cross, right?

3309
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:04,440
You don't have to.

3310
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,080
All right.

3311
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:09,000
But he not only was a screamer, he was a dire early.

3312
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,400
He didn't die of the crucifixion.

3313
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:15,240
Jesus Christ did not die of a crucifixion.

3314
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:19,720
He screams out and then boom, he's gone.

3315
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,800
And it says the soldiers are surprised.

3316
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:23,000
They reported the pilot.

3317
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:24,920
And I'm like, he died early, bro.

3318
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:32,040
Now this tells us that that vinegar that they offered to Jesus on the cross and the sponge,

3319
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:37,080
that that was an antidote to the deep sauce.

3320
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:45,400
The deep sauce is the horned viper of North Africa and it's venom makes you really thirsty.

3321
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:49,160
They were trying to give him an antidote.

3322
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:52,040
His followers, all those idiots that were around the cross,

3323
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:53,640
they were trying to give him an antidote.

3324
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:56,920
He didn't get it and he overdosed.

3325
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:57,560
He's dead.

3326
02:35:57,560 --> 02:35:58,120
That's it.

3327
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:59,480
How did they administer the snake venom?

3328
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,800
Oh, that's the brother.

3329
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:03,720
While he was on the cross?

3330
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:05,000
No, no.

3331
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,760
Oh, no, he had had it already by the time.

3332
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:09,800
When he shows up in the garden, he's got it on his face.

3333
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:12,360
Oh, so he had already been given this.

3334
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:13,480
He gave himself the snake venom?

3335
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:17,880
That's why he's going through the gyrations and feeling bad.

3336
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:19,480
He's already going through it.

3337
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:20,360
It was the voice.

3338
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:22,280
That was the antidote to it.

3339
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:23,080
It's the antidote.

3340
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:25,640
And he says, he says, let this cup pass.

3341
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:30,040
What is that cup in the apocalypse, the revelation?

3342
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,680
Yes.

3343
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:37,400
It says that cup is born up by that theriac, by that galene.

3344
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:39,320
They're using the same.

3345
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:40,280
It's one right.

3346
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:43,800
They're using the same drugs in the apocalypse.

3347
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:48,120
And the great enemy of God is that lady's cup,

3348
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:49,960
which is full of penea.

3349
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:52,920
You have to drink the boy's penea.

3350
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:54,280
To survive.

3351
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:55,560
In order to survive.

3352
02:36:55,560 --> 02:36:57,080
But why did he get this?

3353
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:59,080
Why did he just take the snake venom in the first place?

3354
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:01,080
Because he was a Christ.

3355
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:04,840
So he overdosed.

3356
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:06,280
How are you going to prophesy?

3357
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:07,480
How are you going to prophesy?

3358
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:10,120
He accidentally took too much is what you're saying.

3359
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:11,640
No, I don't think he took too much.

3360
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:13,000
I don't think he got an antidote.

3361
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:13,720
The texts are not saying.

3362
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:14,840
Oh, he just didn't get an antidote.

3363
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:18,680
Yeah, I think that's why Nona says they were attempting that sponge,

3364
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:22,120
which by the way, Nona's is corroborated by the geoponica.

3365
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:26,760
The geoponica is a Byzantine farmer's manual, for lack of a better term.

3366
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:32,760
And in it, it says the vinegar, the oxus, that is the remedy.

3367
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:35,800
That's the common term for the remedy of the dipsass snake.

3368
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:40,040
So it's the chemical knowledge is all there.

3369
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:41,160
They were just using it.

3370
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:46,680
Heracles likes it in the eyes though.

3371
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:48,360
That's the thing.

3372
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:52,120
But how much later did he die from that moment in the park?

3373
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:54,200
How much time passed before he was crucified?

3374
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:56,120
Yeah, it's at midday.

3375
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:57,080
Isn't it at midday?

3376
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:58,120
When's he shot out?

3377
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:00,520
I think it's during an eclipse.

3378
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:02,440
Because there was like the Last Supper, right?

3379
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:03,400
Doing the eclipse.

3380
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:04,760
Yeah, no, it's later.

3381
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:07,320
Last Supper was the party all night naked, right?

3382
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:12,840
It says specifically that Jesus was naked with his paidea, with his boys.

3383
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:14,440
And he's always calling them boys.

3384
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:15,800
He calls them my little ones.

3385
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:18,200
I've got some verses here where he calls them my little ones.

3386
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:22,120
So why is he, what is he doing?

3387
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:23,720
He's perpetuating a cult.

3388
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:32,280
That is a practical business is a, if it's illegitimate,

3389
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,280
because it's prosecuted by the government.

3390
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:39,000
And Julius Caesar was one of the people who cracked,

3391
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:42,440
started cracking the back of it because they kidnapped him.

3392
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:44,280
They were going to sell him off.

3393
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:49,080
And he got a ransom and came back and killed them all.

3394
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:51,560
Wow.

3395
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:52,600
Crucified him.

3396
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:57,160
So I'm surprised it took the snake venom so long to kill him.

3397
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:58,680
Yeah.

3398
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:03,480
I mean, that was, so it was more than 24 hours from when he was crucified,

3399
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,520
from when he was found in the park?

3400
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:05,560
No, he would have gotten it.

3401
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:08,360
So he went to the party with the boys at night.

3402
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:12,600
So that's when they would have done the administration of the flesh and the blood.

3403
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:12,920
Okay.

3404
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:13,960
Yeah.

3405
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,440
And it was the next day he was crucified.

3406
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:22,680
Remember the Ophites still fillate for the sacred communion.

3407
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:23,960
Hmm.

3408
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:25,320
Roman soldiers do too.

3409
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:27,320
Yeah.

3410
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:28,840
So the sacred communion.

3411
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:29,640
Mithraic.

3412
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:29,880
Yes.

3413
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,240
Was, was a.

3414
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:35,240
Your seed, your seed makes me high.

3415
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:42,120
So they were, so not only was this stuff being used as an antidote,

3416
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:45,960
they were also mixing it with other stuff to get high.

3417
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:47,240
It's polypharmacy.

3418
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:49,400
It's a ton of plants and animal substances.

3419
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:52,440
Some of my life, but oh my God, gee, how did they figure that out?

3420
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:53,400
No idea.

3421
02:39:53,400 --> 02:40:00,760
But didn't you, didn't you mention that that somehow the boy or, or either animals or humans

3422
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:03,480
were used to endogenously create drugs?

3423
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,680
They tested on roosters.

3424
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:12,760
They tested drugs on roosters and they would give them poisons and then feed on the antidote,

3425
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:18,600
cause them to swallow the antidote and to see if that, you know, Galen writes about that.

3426
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,120
He says, you can do it on people too.

3427
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:20,760
And they do.

3428
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:25,560
So were they, were they giving the poisons to these people and then assuming that these people

3429
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:29,000
would, their immune system would react in a certain way and they could pull out,

3430
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:34,600
like for lack of a better term, like the antibodies that we're using to fight the poison

3431
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:37,560
and use that to put into other people.

3432
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:41,320
I think that's what's happening when they talk about breast milk.

3433
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,080
Yeah.

3434
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:45,160
These priestesses will give off a breast milk.

3435
02:40:45,160 --> 02:40:46,360
They cut their arms.

3436
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:48,520
And they would give themselves drugs and then they would use them.

3437
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:51,080
They would give themselves the venom over time in a wrap.

3438
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:52,760
And then they,

3439
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:55,880
And their body would start fighting against it and then they would use,

3440
02:40:55,880 --> 02:40:59,000
they would pull out the breast milk and use that as an anti-venom.

3441
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,760
As an anti-venom, yeah, essentially.

3442
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:01,720
Already anti-Christ.

3443
02:41:01,720 --> 02:41:04,120
It's not really a anti-venom either.

3444
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:07,640
It's a, it is a balancing drug.

3445
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:07,960
Right.

3446
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:11,480
So you're not stopping the venom.

3447
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:16,360
You're, you're basically the physician say you're stopping the negative symptoms.

3448
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:18,280
Oh, wow.

3449
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,240
Yeah. Polypharmacy.

3450
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:21,640
Wow.

3451
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:24,440
Yeah. Yeah.

3452
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:25,000
Good stuff.

3453
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:30,520
Let's get some hemlock and some henbane, some aconite, some really poisonous stuff.

3454
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:30,760
And then-

3455
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:35,320
Do you think that they're pharmaceutical knowledge and their drug knowledge?

3456
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:40,200
If we understood all of that today, do you think it would,

3457
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:44,120
it would advance our knowledge currently

3458
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:52,280
in science and, and pharmaceuticals and, and the treatments of illnesses and disease?

3459
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:53,400
Yeah, undoubtedly.

3460
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,240
And I tell people just that.

3461
02:41:56,760 --> 02:42:04,440
They're thinking of making the human body, the producer of the drug, right?

3462
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:08,280
Your body becomes, they're not thinking, okay, this person is depressed.

3463
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:11,240
Therefore, I'm going to hit him with this drug, right?

3464
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:14,760
This one drug, I'm going to see what happens to him and watch him, you know what I mean?

3465
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:15,800
They want to kill themselves?

3466
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:18,360
Oh, that's not going to work, right?

3467
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:19,640
That's not what they're doing.

3468
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:27,240
They're looking at using multiple drugs to basically create the potential that the human

3469
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:35,320
body has to make its own communion, to be a source of health, right?

3470
02:42:35,320 --> 02:42:37,080
Sacred name of Rome.

3471
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:37,720
Right.

3472
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:39,320
Is that health?

3473
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:40,600
It is that power?

3474
02:42:41,480 --> 02:42:44,360
It is that extended capacity?

3475
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:47,960
It's why we insist that the vessels are virgins.

3476
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:52,600
Yeah, they direct us.

3477
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:55,320
It's why we insist that the vessels are virgins?

3478
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:55,720
Yeah.

3479
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:56,920
What do you mean by that?

3480
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:00,760
Yeah, it's why that they have to be in a certain physical state,

3481
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:04,360
because the person becomes the vehicle of the drug.

3482
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:08,360
The cup is full of herpania.

3483
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:10,360
That's her adjailate.

3484
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:16,360
We are talking about the communion that is the adjailate of a virgin.

3485
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:17,160
Right.

3486
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:18,840
An irracular virgin.

3487
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:21,160
Right.

3488
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:21,960
Yeah.

3489
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:27,960
And when I say virgin, I mean the kind that they put up on the statues, right?

3490
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:33,960
Remember Athena, Athena, that's the exact image that they put up on the statues.

3491
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:39,960
The adolon that they're creating is Athena, the virgin, holy virgin.

3492
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:43,160
You don't worship the holy virgin?

3493
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:45,720
Do I?

3494
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,960
What is your religion?

3495
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:51,080
I'm not really religious.

3496
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:51,960
Yeah, I didn't think so.

3497
02:43:51,960 --> 02:43:53,560
It's a bunch of crap, isn't it?

3498
02:43:53,560 --> 02:43:54,040
I don't know.

3499
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:56,200
Not according to you.

3500
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:56,920
No.

3501
02:43:56,920 --> 02:44:00,280
According to you, it's way more than I thought it was.

3502
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:11,560
So why in the Bible do they explain that the guys who were being crucified next to Jesus were just thieves?

3503
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:14,120
Yeah, that's how they translate it.

3504
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:15,160
That's how they translate it.

3505
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,840
And again, this is not on purpose.

3506
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:18,440
They just accidentally did this.

3507
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:19,560
How are you going to translate it?

3508
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:24,680
But isn't it convenient for them that they left all this out?

3509
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:27,080
You are right on top of it, detective.

3510
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:29,320
No, seriously, write your dissertation now.

3511
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:36,120
Why would you choose between a kid having a linen garment and a bandage on his parts?

3512
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:45,960
And why would you choose to present Jesus in a way that's not accurate to the sources?

3513
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:48,360
I'm not saying to anybody's interpretation.

3514
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:49,960
There's no room for interpretation here.

3515
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:53,720
It's just one of the sources saying he's a lacedace.

3516
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:54,760
Which is a pimp.

3517
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,920
Which is basically a trafficker.

3518
02:44:58,600 --> 02:44:59,080
Yeah.

3519
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:00,280
Which was looked down upon.

3520
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:01,720
Which was frowned upon back then.

3521
02:45:01,720 --> 02:45:04,600
Because it's an active organized crime.

3522
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:07,400
But a civil crime.

3523
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:10,440
You've got boys of Galilee.

3524
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:14,600
And those boys of Galilee, they're entrenched in the...

3525
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:21,560
But didn't you say that when the people approached Jesus in the park, you call them cops?

3526
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:23,160
They were like ancient cops?

3527
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:23,640
Wrong cops.

3528
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:25,960
Did they have chess cams?

3529
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:28,200
No, but they had big weapons.

3530
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:29,480
He notes it.

3531
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:37,800
And according to Matthew, the first thing he said is I am not a lacedace or a trafficker.

3532
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,200
Right.

3533
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:39,960
He said I'm not a lacedace, man.

3534
02:45:40,520 --> 02:45:42,440
He says, why did you come out here?

3535
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,640
Why did you come out here with all your heavy weapons?

3536
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:47,080
Like I'm a lacedace.

3537
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:51,480
Well, maybe he wasn't.

3538
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:53,240
Maybe he was just trying to get the antidote.

3539
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:54,040
Well, it could be.

3540
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:56,440
But he's making a big deal about it, right?

3541
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:57,320
For some reason.

3542
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:59,320
And he's standing there right next to...

3543
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:01,400
Contextually right next to a kid.

3544
02:46:02,600 --> 02:46:07,160
So, you know, maybe he's trying to give an answer for why there's a kid with him in a

3545
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:09,240
public park at 4 a.m. that...

3546
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,840
If I'm his lawyer, that's what I'm going to say.

3547
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:11,800
Yeah, exactly.

3548
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,000
Exactly.

3549
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:13,880
Yes.

3550
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:21,400
No, more importantly, what's that kid actually doing?

3551
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:23,240
And I think that's the question.

3552
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:23,960
What do you think?

3553
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:34,200
The evidence only shows that he could be one of these boys who's providing the people who

3554
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:35,960
are in the cult with the glane.

3555
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:36,600
Okay.

3556
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:42,200
With the thing that's going to balance whatever it is that Jesus has taken that's put him into

3557
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:42,760
a state.

3558
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:45,320
And yeah, it doesn't work.

3559
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:46,520
And he ends up getting...

3560
02:46:46,520 --> 02:46:48,040
He ends up dying on the cross.

3561
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:52,040
And, you know, if you notice in the resurrection, we just had Easter, you know.

3562
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:53,640
Did anybody notice that it's another ball?

3563
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:55,640
We just had an Easter and we just had an eclipse.

3564
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:56,200
Yeah.

3565
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:59,960
Another boy with Jesus in the tomb.

3566
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,240
Don't you remember?

3567
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:01,800
No.

3568
02:47:01,800 --> 02:47:02,120
Yes.

3569
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,160
I never read the Bible.

3570
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:04,280
Yeah.

3571
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:05,160
Oh, you didn't.

3572
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:05,720
That's right.

3573
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:08,120
Oh, we got to start reading the Bible.

3574
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:08,760
Should I read it?

3575
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,640
Yeah, I think you should.

3576
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:10,840
Which version should I read?

3577
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:11,560
The Greek version.

3578
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:13,640
Yeah.

3579
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:14,760
Yeah.

3580
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:15,800
Come to my class.

3581
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:16,600
Come to my class.

3582
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,320
I'll have you 20 weeks, 20 weeks.

3583
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:22,040
I'll have you just enough to be dangerous.

3584
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:22,840
20 weeks.

3585
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:23,400
Yeah.

3586
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:24,920
Well, no, most of my students are...

3587
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:25,960
How do I go to your class?

3588
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:26,360
40.

3589
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:26,920
Is it online?

3590
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,800
Like 40 weeks.

3591
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:30,360
You don't have to show up to a university.

3592
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:31,640
I'm working for a...

3593
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:34,360
I'm working for a tutoring company.

3594
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:39,560
Because once you've been ejected, it turns out, from a university,

3595
02:47:39,560 --> 02:47:42,200
pretty much you're running from that point on.

3596
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:45,400
And I had people that I applied for jobs that were like,

3597
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:47,880
why would you want to have this job?

3598
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:49,960
Do you just want to be around young people?

3599
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:50,520
You know what I mean?

3600
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,520
I'm like, skip you.

3601
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:55,000
Show me the sources.

3602
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,040
My students loved it.

3603
02:47:56,040 --> 02:48:03,000
My last semester, my last semester, I had 90-some students petitioned

3604
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:08,520
the administration to take my class that was capped at 30.

3605
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:10,600
They had to form a petition.

3606
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:11,400
They wanted it.

3607
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:16,440
For a small liberal arts university, that's not bad.

3608
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:19,000
100 people is a big audience.

3609
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:25,400
I had 270, 350 at University of Wisconsin when I taught history of medicine.

3610
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:30,040
But as a grad student, and I can very proudly say I'm the only grad student

3611
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:35,000
to ever teach the level of a professor at the University of Wisconsin,

3612
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,200
I taught a whole course on medical history and medical terminology.

3613
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:40,200
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

3614
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:43,080
They wanted to know the dirty stuff, though.

3615
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:45,080
It's the dirty stuff you got to bring out.

3616
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:47,800
Why do you have to bring it out?

3617
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:49,720
Yeah, you got to have women having it.

3618
02:48:51,240 --> 02:48:53,240
How do you get an antiquity?

3619
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:55,160
You're chemical.

3620
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:57,560
They got all sorts of the midwives.

3621
02:48:57,560 --> 02:48:58,760
They have all sorts of...

3622
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:00,040
You know, you can regulate your own...

3623
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:04,520
Wouldn't it be cool if you were a woman and you could regulate your own...

3624
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:07,720
Yeah, we do that now, right?

3625
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:08,360
Yeah, it's called...

3626
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:11,800
We have like IUDs, we have these like little metal prongs.

3627
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:13,880
No, I mean, but chemically, chemically, so that you...

3628
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:15,080
Yeah, those things have chemicals on them.

3629
02:49:15,080 --> 02:49:20,200
You could turn up your flow and turn down your flow, right?

3630
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:20,760
Dial it.

3631
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:24,280
Yeah, why would you want to be doing that?

3632
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:26,200
Because there's a point of ecstasy.

3633
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,040
People don't realize an antiquity in a woman's...

3634
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:32,520
There's a point where she is close to the gods.

3635
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:34,120
There's an eclipse.

3636
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:37,640
Yeah, there's an eclipse and when you have the eclipse,

3637
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:40,200
you have the power of that moon blocking that sun.

3638
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:44,760
Is that why women, when right before they have their...

3639
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:45,320
They get so...

3640
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:51,640
Is it because of Aphrodite, they would say, and my answer would be yes.

3641
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:53,560
Okay, that's the eclipse.

3642
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:55,240
And you have to...

3643
02:49:55,240 --> 02:49:56,440
No, that's the pre-eclipse.

3644
02:49:56,440 --> 02:50:06,200
And you have to channel that within a woman's being in order to be a proper mate.

3645
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:09,000
Yeah.

3646
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:13,720
You have to channel that within a woman's being to be a proper mate.

3647
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:15,080
You got to make her ovulate.

3648
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:20,200
It's all about that production, right?

3649
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:22,120
Even the city and women who hunt men.

3650
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:26,120
The only reason they give them the satirian was to cause them to be able to...

3651
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:29,400
Because they're already paralyzed.

3652
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:34,760
Can you imagine being paralyzed in a...

3653
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:36,280
No, how can...

3654
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:40,520
After someone has given you a drug that induces psychosis,

3655
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:44,280
they call it the pan, the fury, the fear.

3656
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,560
So they've put you in a state of psychotic fear

3657
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:50,280
and they've given you a drug that gives you...

3658
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:53,720
And they manually bring you to...

3659
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:58,600
For what?

3660
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:01,560
Yeah, for what?

3661
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:02,920
That's got to be a state to be...

3662
02:51:03,480 --> 02:51:05,480
I mean, if you could take somebody there.

3663
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:07,960
Hmm.

3664
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:10,040
Is that what caused the enlightenment?

3665
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:13,400
Was it people sitting around?

3666
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:14,040
You know what I mean?

3667
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:16,040
Was it people sitting around who followed?

3668
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:18,040
You got to the Templars.

3669
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:21,160
Templars are licking an ant.

3670
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:23,160
I mean, an ant head.

3671
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:25,640
Yeah.

3672
02:51:25,640 --> 02:51:26,840
They're looking at them?

3673
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:27,320
Licking.

3674
02:51:27,320 --> 02:51:28,040
Licking them.

3675
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:28,520
Yeah.

3676
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:29,000
Hmm.

3677
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,440
Initiates lick.

3678
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,800
There's a purple cross on the bottom of that...

3679
02:51:37,640 --> 02:51:42,040
Where they give the medicine, drizzles out in those initiates.

3680
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:44,760
That's where they start to get exposed to it.

3681
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:47,160
And you can do it, they said, in the papers,

3682
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:49,240
that they're the court papers, so to speak.

3683
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:53,480
The investigation papers.

3684
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:55,080
You can...

3685
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:56,040
The Templars were...

3686
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:58,760
It's one of the reasons they were persecuted so heavily.

3687
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,040
Hmm.

3688
02:52:00,040 --> 02:52:02,520
It's because they were having them lick their...

3689
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:04,280
Or they could also lick the...

3690
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:04,920
It's itself.

3691
02:52:05,720 --> 02:52:07,960
And get that purple stain.

3692
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:17,240
What sort of pushback or backlash have you gotten from the mainstream academic institutions

3693
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:19,160
for talking about all this stuff?

3694
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:20,200
None.

3695
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:21,320
None?

3696
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:21,880
None.

3697
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:22,120
No.

3698
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,280
It's better to ignore.

3699
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:25,240
Right?

3700
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:25,800
It takes them...

3701
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:28,120
A professor from Brown told me it'll take them 10 years

3702
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,560
to catch up with your research.

3703
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:33,000
And they're just behind...

3704
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,600
Didn't something happen with the church?

3705
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:36,280
Didn't the church or something come...

3706
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:38,200
Make a statement about you specifically?

3707
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:40,840
I was investigated by the Catholic Church.

3708
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:42,920
You were investigated by the Catholic Church?

3709
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:43,560
When?

3710
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:46,840
For when I worked for the St. Mary's University.

3711
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:47,640
Really?

3712
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:49,080
And how did you find out about this?

3713
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:52,840
I had a Monsignor come to me and say,

3714
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:54,360
Hey, I've been to...

3715
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:56,600
He was one of my students, right?

3716
02:52:57,560 --> 02:53:00,520
Keeping tabs on everything and learning Greek.

3717
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:02,040
He got to learn Greek in the process.

3718
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:04,520
I hope he kept it up to this day.

3719
02:53:05,560 --> 02:53:08,040
He told me, he said, I've been to five meetings about you.

3720
02:53:09,400 --> 02:53:09,800
What?

3721
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:14,200
I couldn't help but laugh, you know what I mean?

3722
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:16,200
At this time, my professor's coming to me going,

3723
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:17,000
You're going to get fired.

3724
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:18,520
You can't get fired.

3725
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:21,160
And oh, by the way, we support what you're doing,

3726
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:23,960
but we're not going to put our asses out there.

3727
02:53:23,960 --> 02:53:24,360
Right.

3728
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:27,560
I thought, well, cowards, but whatever.

3729
02:53:27,560 --> 02:53:29,080
I had to stay true to the sources.

3730
02:53:29,800 --> 02:53:30,360
So I did.

3731
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:33,960
So the Catholic Church, look, a student on campus

3732
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:38,280
claimed that she woke up at 4.35 in the morning.

3733
02:53:39,960 --> 02:53:42,840
And that I was floating.

3734
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:46,360
I floated through the door of her dorm

3735
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:51,160
and hovered over her roommate and had a chat with her roommate

3736
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:53,480
as I hovered over her bed.

3737
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:57,480
And then she woke up and made a noise.

3738
02:53:57,480 --> 02:54:01,320
And I extended my hand and paralyzed her.

3739
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:12,280
Now this student was released from school due to the mania.

3740
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:14,600
It was a middle discharge.

3741
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:15,880
This was one of your students.

3742
02:54:15,880 --> 02:54:17,320
No, she wasn't one of my students.

3743
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:19,800
She was one of the students that was working on the play,

3744
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:25,160
the medea that I was the contracted advisor for.

3745
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:30,760
And the student that I allegedly hovered over and made cosmic love to

3746
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:37,880
was the lead role as the younger form.

3747
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:38,680
We had two forms.

3748
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:42,040
We had a younger, the one that killed her brother, and then an older form.

3749
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:46,920
And so they had a hearing.

3750
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:49,960
So who did she tell this to?

3751
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:51,000
Who did she tell the story to?

3752
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,040
Administration.

3753
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:54,600
And then how did the Catholic Church get involved?

3754
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:57,320
The Catholic Church had an inquiry and the bishop had to come and sit.

3755
02:54:57,320 --> 02:54:58,440
I'm sure it was hilarious.

3756
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:01,400
I had a group of people before.

3757
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:04,040
The inquiry had a group of people come to me and say,

3758
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:05,880
I was like, who are these people in my office?

3759
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:10,440
And they said, we know who you are and we know what you're doing.

3760
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:13,320
And the demons that you're working with.

3761
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:15,000
And I was like, excuse me?

3762
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:17,880
Right, excuse me?

3763
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:22,520
And then there was the inquiry, the formal inquiry.

3764
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:24,840
And it was two, I'm told it was two charges.

3765
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:29,880
Number one was demon possession, which personally I think that's pretty cool.

3766
02:55:29,880 --> 02:55:31,080
That's pretty, that's pretty metal.

3767
02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:31,720
No, it is.

3768
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:32,360
Yeah.

3769
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:38,200
Number two, it was, I was opening portals to wear.

3770
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:41,720
I don't know.

3771
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:43,720
But do you think I would be a Catholic?

3772
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:45,640
Can you find this?

3773
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:47,080
Is this published anywhere?

3774
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:48,040
Yeah, it is.

3775
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:54,760
I got to finish though, so people can have a little sympathy for me.

3776
02:55:54,760 --> 02:55:58,520
I was fired after the production of the Medea.

3777
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,720
It was wildly successful.

3778
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:02,360
People said it was the best thing they ever produced, right?

3779
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:09,080
But I had, I had furious choruses of Catholic university students pointing those.

3780
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:10,200
What?

3781
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:13,880
Yes. They said they wanted it accurate.

3782
02:56:13,880 --> 02:56:16,680
So we brought in the priapus.

3783
02:56:16,680 --> 02:56:18,840
We brought in what they call the faschinum.

3784
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:20,600
It's a rum and implement.

3785
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:27,400
It's a, and when you pointed at somebody, like a priest who's involved in doing naughty

3786
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:33,240
things to children, you are throwing off from the stage that corruption.

3787
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:34,840
You're purifying your audience.

3788
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:37,480
And it was quite successful.

3789
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:44,040
It succeeded to the point that, you know, the Monsignor that I knew, I probably shouldn't

3790
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:47,160
put his, he probably couldn't put his, no, he's a big guy.

3791
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:53,400
He said, look, you know, he brought up the book.

3792
02:56:53,400 --> 02:57:00,040
I had just published a book that was about ritual in the early church.

3793
02:57:01,240 --> 02:57:03,960
And apparently that was what was making all the hullabaloo.

3794
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:10,600
The story of me flying through the air and all of that just kind of added a, added an

3795
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:14,680
atmosphere of, it was like religious frenzy.

3796
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:22,520
And the Monsignor just explained it to me that the charismatic wing was quite active in that

3797
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:25,080
area. And he didn't like the way the direction it was going.

3798
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:26,840
And I just happened to be one of their targets.

3799
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:30,520
So that's why, you know, they, they did what they did.

3800
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:34,760
And, you know, once you've been ejected, you can't go back.

3801
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:36,440
There's no way. I'm Ronin now.

3802
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:39,400
So what I do is I use the same skills.

3803
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:40,920
You're what now? What was the word you used?

3804
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:41,400
Ronin.

3805
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:42,040
Ronin.

3806
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:45,720
It's a Japanese samurai who's lost his lord.

3807
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:49,720
He's got no protection of the institution, nothing like that.

3808
02:57:49,720 --> 02:57:50,040
Yeah.

3809
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:51,480
What is this?

3810
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:52,680
Okay. This is an article.

3811
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:56,520
All right. So, I mean, I'm sure Hillman can put more.

3812
02:57:56,520 --> 02:58:01,640
Fired over the phallus, a junk to St. Mary's University of Minnesota says his contract

3813
02:58:01,640 --> 02:58:06,200
wasn't renewed and he was fired from a custodial job on campus due to a play prop.

3814
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:07,000
All right.

3815
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:08,440
This is, now get this.

3816
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:09,880
During the week, this is it.

3817
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:14,680
Hillman was contracted by the Catholic University this fall to translate

3818
02:58:15,240 --> 02:58:20,520
Senes' version of Medea, a story largely about a women's revenge on a husband who's abandoned her

3819
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:23,480
for a more politically advantageous marriage.

3820
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:27,320
But Hillman, technically the production's playwright also highlighted Medea's undertones

3821
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:34,120
about greed and suggested that the cast members deliver admonishing lines about corporate greed

3822
02:58:34,120 --> 02:58:41,080
while pointing fascina at the audiences used in the ancient world in certain rights and

3823
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:50,840
to ward off evil, fascina are supposed to embody the divina power of the phallus.

3824
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:57,240
In that spirit, the props being prepared for the show looked distinctively like

3825
02:58:58,920 --> 02:59:00,920
one of the props pictured at the right.

3826
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:09,240
There was one that was six feet long that they carried in procession into the performance.

3827
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:14,200
Now remember, these are sold out too. All of our performances were totally sold out.

3828
02:59:14,200 --> 02:59:14,680
Really?

3829
02:59:14,680 --> 02:59:20,280
Yeah. And they said it was the best thing the theater department had ever produced.

3830
02:59:21,640 --> 02:59:26,760
So when I was fired after this, people were like, what's going on?

3831
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:34,680
And when I was fired, the American professors, it's like a union,

3832
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:39,080
the National Association of University Professors

3833
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:45,560
sent a couple of people out to inquire about my termination.

3834
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:51,480
And they ruled that I was improperly terminated.

3835
02:59:53,080 --> 02:59:57,160
This was just because of what I was teaching. I had nothing to do with anything else.

3836
02:59:58,120 --> 03:00:04,280
So I thought that was nice, that the AUP would come out and do that.

3837
03:00:04,280 --> 03:00:06,120
They had the international one do the same thing.

3838
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:13,080
There's an article on fire, which is the freedom for free speech on campus.

3839
03:00:15,640 --> 03:00:20,280
The act of the St. Mary's University firing me got them put on the

3840
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,360
top 10 list of bad places for free speech.

3841
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,320
Really?

3842
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:29,000
Yeah. The USA Today is the one that publishes it.

3843
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:30,040
Can you find that?

3844
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:34,600
Yeah. It's going to be on there. And they made the top 10 list because of what they did to me.

3845
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,760
Wow. No way.

3846
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:41,240
So, and there's quite an article. They had me in a place where I had to even work.

3847
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:46,440
And I didn't mind because I don't mind doing dirty jobs, but I used to clean toilets.

3848
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:52,040
I used to clean toilets because the professor's salary they paid me was not enough to feed my

3849
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:56,360
children. So you can see why the Monsignor was like, okay.

3850
03:00:56,920 --> 03:01:03,080
How did that affect you personally after this all happened?

3851
03:01:03,960 --> 03:01:14,760
You know, it shut off my, you know, every time something happens, it's happened in my life.

3852
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:20,520
It's helped to build, to forge my path ahead.

3853
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:25,560
When my head of my department told me the Romans wouldn't do such a thing as take drugs.

3854
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:27,480
He said, why would they do it back then?

3855
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:29,960
Why would they do that back then when we don't do it today?

3856
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:31,640
Right? Something to that effect?

3857
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:34,200
She said they just wouldn't do such a thing.

3858
03:01:35,400 --> 03:01:36,840
They just wouldn't do such a thing.

3859
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:42,840
When she said that, I realized, okay, I've got to go investigate everything there is to know

3860
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:49,880
about drug use in the ancient world. I've got to find the question. I've got to dig the hole.

3861
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:56,440
And I've got to find that reality that lies there beneath the ideas of scholars.

3862
03:01:57,400 --> 03:02:00,040
That real history. I want to see it. I want to see it.

3863
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:06,120
One thing I wanted to ask you about that we haven't talked about is

3864
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:09,880
Lucian's writing on Alexander the False Prophet.

3865
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:11,320
Yes. Good. Good. Nice.

3866
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:15,560
Can you talk about that? Who is Alexander the False Prophet?

3867
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:17,560
A real person? Or was this just a story?

3868
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:22,440
Yeah, no. He's a real person. And Lucian is a real person writing about another real person

3869
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:27,960
in Cappadocia up on the Black Sea again. They're up on the Black Sea.

3870
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:38,520
And he started a cult, an Iraqi cult. And Lucian says, you know, look, I hate to write to you

3871
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:41,320
about bad people. History should be awful of good people.

3872
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:46,040
Right? But just like this other guy, he says, wrote about this lace days. I'm going to write

3873
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:51,080
to you about a lace days. Like, he's the worst. He's the worst of these guys.

3874
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:58,360
And it turns out, when he's a boy, he's entered into the trade and he becomes,

3875
03:02:58,360 --> 03:03:02,520
because he's known for being very good looking. He's got a really good look to him.

3876
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:04,440
Alexander the False Prophet.

3877
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:09,080
Yeah. Right. Right. And he travels around. He gets the attention of a couple of very wealthy

3878
03:03:09,080 --> 03:03:15,880
women who set him up making oracles. And he has imported to himself boys,

3879
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:23,160
young boys, who are exceptionally handsome. And he has a very specific list of what they should

3880
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:27,320
and shouldn't look like. You know, they'll take the short ones, take the tall ones, you know?

3881
03:03:27,960 --> 03:03:31,880
Take the ones that have problems on their skin. Take the ones that are smooth.

3882
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:33,880
Right? That kind of thing.

3883
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:35,640
You're talking about like ancient eugenics.

3884
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:44,680
Yeah. Kind of like, keep your lover, keep your lover in the best ideal form. Remember,

3885
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:48,920
the gods are just the ideal. That's why you see a lot of depictions of the gods.

3886
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:53,880
Is this, you know, jacked. Yeah. And young. And young.

3887
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:57,320
Yeah. That's weird about the, about the god, the depictions of the gods and like,

3888
03:03:57,320 --> 03:04:03,800
even the sculpture, like David and Zeus is, they were all like these big jacked warriors,

3889
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:09,720
but they had small wieners. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what happens when you spend time with the

3890
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:14,600
Queen of the Amazons, man. Hercules did for a year. She made him walk around in a dress.

3891
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:18,680
You know why? Wait, wait. Who made who walk around in a dress?

3892
03:04:18,680 --> 03:04:23,560
Oh, the Queen of the Amazons. And if you think the Amazons are myth, they're not.

3893
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:29,960
We have Athenian graveyards full of people that they killed. So these are, again, those warring,

3894
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:36,040
roaming tribes around the Black Sea that just plunder. They live by plunder. And by the way,

3895
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:41,800
the Thracians, the Thracians are big on the eunuch trade. And making eunuchs is a big deal.

3896
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:46,040
And that's why Odysseus is so. What's a eunuch? When I cut somebody's

3897
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:52,120
off, I turn them into a eunuch. Got it. Because what am I doing? I'm changing the pharmacy.

3898
03:04:52,120 --> 03:04:56,440
Right. Right. That testosterone is going to change whatever the.

3899
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:58,840
So when you cut off the eunuch, they have no more testosterone?

3900
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:02,120
Yeah. And what, what's so good about that? Well, what's so great about a eunuch?

3901
03:05:02,120 --> 03:05:06,840
Because then you can use their s**t, right? You can't use it otherwise.

3902
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:10,120
So it's got to have no, it's got to have no s**t for a minute.

3903
03:05:10,120 --> 03:05:14,120
Yeah. It's got to have no testosterone. That's what they need. So they're turning the person

3904
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:17,800
into the dispensary. They're turning the person into this dispensary of drugs.

3905
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:19,880
Right. And here. A drug factory, essentially.

3906
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:22,040
Yeah. A communion. A place of communion.

3907
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:23,960
Okay. Yeah.

3908
03:05:23,960 --> 03:05:26,760
Wow. Yeah. It's intricate tech.

3909
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:29,320
So, okay. Alexander the False Prophet.

3910
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:32,920
Yeah. He wanted these perfect looking people, tall, no skin abrasions.

3911
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:38,040
Yeah. So he runs a business and it ends up, you know, in a bad way. One of the kids,

3912
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:43,720
he thinks is murdered and, or he hasn't murdered and it's just, it's not good.

3913
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:48,920
Looks bad for him. And that's the moral lesson that Lucian is trying to teach,

3914
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:55,080
is what happens when you become profit driven and you have no, you have no,

3915
03:05:55,960 --> 03:06:02,040
you have nothing to stop you. No breaks. And that's this guy, Alexander the False Prophet.

3916
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:06,360
But it's important to note that he's a prophet because that's what prophets are in antiquity.

3917
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:13,080
There are not prophets that are not jacked in. Prophet, prophesying is taking drugs.

3918
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:20,520
There's no, there's no way around it. It's a part of doing what they said, going into the

3919
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:25,880
Eremon. And what is that Eremon? It's the wilderness. You know what I mean? When you're in that,

3920
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:33,080
you're in that void. Mark talks about the void. Yeah. Where Jesus meets

3921
03:06:33,880 --> 03:06:38,840
Lucifer and converses with Lucifer. You didn't know, yeah, it's in the Bible. He, yeah.

3922
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:50,040
Yeah. He, he sees Uranos split and out of Uranos comes that dove with that milk and he ends up

3923
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:56,520
going into the Eremon where he is tempted, tested, tried by Lucifer.

3924
03:06:58,680 --> 03:07:02,520
Yeah. Yeah. So he's going through it. Jesus, good for him. He's going through the,

3925
03:07:03,080 --> 03:07:07,320
he's doing the whole right, right? He's, he's really practicing. That Baptist is really

3926
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:12,600
practicing. And what is standard issue of every Baptist according to juvenile, the standard issue

3927
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:24,920
is a shaped cup. You can put it, it's called the vitreum priapeum or the glass and every

3928
03:07:24,920 --> 03:07:33,720
Baptist carries them. That's why they take the kids out. It's the pedorasty of the ancient

3929
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:40,600
Greek religion sleeping in. And that's why Paul is screaming, you can't do this. That dude is

3930
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:47,640
sleeping with his stepmother. It's right. And that's what Paul says. Yeah. Paul's immune to

3931
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:53,720
viper venom, right? Okay. Yeah. Yes. He gets bitten by a viper and the locals are like, you're gonna

3932
03:07:53,720 --> 03:08:00,920
die. And he doesn't. He's got the antidote. Yeah. Cause he's obviously using, right? Right. Mithridates

3933
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:07,400
was the great king who couldn't be poisoned to death because he was taking the stereocall at

3934
03:08:07,400 --> 03:08:12,920
the time. He had constant antidote on board. Right. And Marcus Aurelius, when we get down to Marcus

3935
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:18,680
Aurelius, people are saying about him that he's looking better ever since Galen started him on

3936
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:24,760
the theriac. He's looking better. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's doing something like, whoa, nice improvement

3937
03:08:24,760 --> 03:08:30,120
there. And he said, Galen says in his treatise to Pisa, remember, this is not made up literature.

3938
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:36,840
These are accounts of Roman medicine. And in it, he says, yeah, that's gonna, this was used after

3939
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:45,000
Marcus Aurelius too. But they acknowledged it more. It's good stuff, man. He says Cleopatra

3940
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:52,360
was in the game too. She couldn't. Who is Lucifer? He's the dawn bringer. Yeah. They first called

3941
03:08:52,360 --> 03:09:00,360
him Lucifer and he was a girl. You ever see a girl with a big beard? I mean, I saw a girl with a

3942
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:04,600
little earlier. He showed me a statue of one. That's the morning star. What was her name again?

3943
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:09,320
Venus. Tell me more about Lucifer. Yeah. He's the morning star and he's the one who guards the

3944
03:09:09,320 --> 03:09:14,280
gate. They call him, he's way older than Christianity, right? Or Judaism. He's way older. He's part of

3945
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:21,560
the Saturnian religion. And what is that? That's the mystery that revolves around sun, moon, and earth.

3946
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:26,440
So it's a very, it's all constellations and stuff like that and all solar stuff and

3947
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:32,760
yearly festivals and whatnot. That's Saturnian, the worship of Cronus. They call it the golden age.

3948
03:09:32,760 --> 03:09:40,920
It's before the Zeus enters and takes over, right? Zeus. On Olympus, right? It's before he takes over.

3949
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:46,600
So Lucifer comes from that older generation and he's a dawn bringer. What does everybody's

3950
03:09:46,600 --> 03:09:51,000
genre mean? What does that mean? It means you bring dawn. You herald. Bring the new day. Yes,

3951
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:56,520
you herald the dawn. The dawn is that funny moment when you don't have any sunlight, direct sunlight

3952
03:09:56,520 --> 03:09:59,400
and it's kind of a, they talked about it as a spark in the ether,

3953
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:05,000
spin theory. They call this spark. A spark in the ether. And that's what you're preserving.

3954
03:10:05,560 --> 03:10:09,880
When you meet as a Christian, you get up early in the morning. This is how they originally met.

3955
03:10:09,880 --> 03:10:14,840
They get up at sunrise, right? No, that's why you have the associations of sunrise with,

3956
03:10:14,840 --> 03:10:19,640
you know, Easter and all that kind of stuff like that. They get there early because they're dawn

3957
03:10:19,640 --> 03:10:26,520
bringers, right? Jesus is saying in the apocalypse, he says, I am the morning star.

3958
03:10:27,160 --> 03:10:35,240
Jesus says that. Yes. Yes. And he's got a bra on too. A what? A bra. A bra. Yeah. Yeah. It's

3959
03:10:35,240 --> 03:10:42,360
a special device. So what do you make of that? Why did he say he was the morning star? Because he

3960
03:10:42,360 --> 03:10:47,880
has to be. If he's going to be the Christ, if he's going to be what the one in the position

3961
03:10:48,440 --> 03:10:53,720
to be elevated as Christ, he's got to be the morning star. That's the title. They're all

3962
03:10:53,720 --> 03:11:01,640
dawn bringers, right? Christos is a dawn bringer, right? So yeah, he's got to. He's following at

3963
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:06,920
least the people who are writing about him and John, John's apocalypse, at least they're making

3964
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:13,080
that association. Yeah. Notice that they've got Filtra too. The angels, when an angel pours out

3965
03:11:13,640 --> 03:11:20,600
a Filtra, right? Or Filtron. When they pour it out, that's a drug containing device.

3966
03:11:21,080 --> 03:11:31,480
So the angels that pour out the plagues, those are drugs. The beast is called Therion.

3967
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:38,600
So how did Lucifer become a bad guy? How did Lucifer become a bad guy? Because God's a liar.

3968
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:46,680
Because God's Zeus? Yeah. Zeus. What did Zeus do to him? He lied. How? He closed the eyes of his

3969
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:56,360
Ewa. That was what? That was Ewa, his Eve. In order to make the second Adam, right? Don't you know

3970
03:11:56,360 --> 03:12:05,960
we're dealing with sacrifice? Huh? Yeah. God killing his only son. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right? In order to

3971
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:12,360
elevate him to what they call the Soter. That's the savior. That's where we get for savior.

3972
03:12:13,080 --> 03:12:22,360
Right? That's an old title for Lucifer, the female Donbringer. That's why he's wearing a bra.

3973
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:29,160
This is hard to, a lot of this is really hard to digest.

3974
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:35,160
That's what that boy thought, probably. What is the word Satan come from?

3975
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:38,840
Now, people will say, oh. You always say in your videos or your

3976
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:43,480
documentaries that you make on your YouTube channel, you always say Hail Satan. Right,

3977
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:48,120
indeed. But you also claim that you don't worship Satan. I don't have a religion,

3978
03:12:48,120 --> 03:12:57,640
do you? I'm way too lazy for that. I don't think you're lazy, man. No, no. Yeah, no. I'm not promoting

3979
03:12:57,640 --> 03:13:02,360
a religion and that's something I tell everybody. I tell everybody don't. I don't want you to buy

3980
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:08,040
my books. I don't have any reason to condescend. I don't have anything to set up here and pulled

3981
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:13,720
up and say, you should buy this. No, what is out there is a lot of Greek texts and I'm a

3982
03:13:13,720 --> 03:13:18,920
classicist and my job is to protect those texts and to get you the integrity of what's in them.

3983
03:13:18,920 --> 03:13:25,720
And what you have read from the Bible that you have read in English is a mistranslation.

3984
03:13:25,720 --> 03:13:34,680
It's the best hack job. At worst, it's a purposeful obscuring obfuscation of the actual history.

3985
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:37,000
And when you start looking at Jesus who's screaming,

3986
03:13:38,840 --> 03:13:41,640
you know, when he's getting arrested that he's not one of these

3987
03:13:42,200 --> 03:13:49,880
lacedaces. Yeah. Then he's, you know, you see the real, all of a sudden the real becomes obvious

3988
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:55,240
and that's what I think is the job of a classical philosopher is to preserve these texts and get

3989
03:13:55,240 --> 03:14:01,800
them to you. So what does Hail Satan mean to you? It's the gadfly. What's the gadfly again?

3990
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:06,360
It's the punch in somebody's face. It's the, it's the oistress that you need.

3991
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:12,760
There's a reason you get beaten with whips. It does something. Yeah. It does something,

3992
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:17,640
you know, not in a decide kind of way. It's shock, it shocks you. Yeah. It brings you,

3993
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:22,600
I don't know, it does something chemically to you, right? Causes you to release something in your

3994
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:28,120
blood. You ever get the thirst for the blood? Do you know what it's like to eat? Do you think,

3995
03:14:28,120 --> 03:14:33,080
first of all, do you think it's possible that you give me the address where they do this? But

3996
03:14:33,880 --> 03:14:40,600
they eat, they take that freckled red-haired kid, and what we have taxed for this, by the way,

3997
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:47,400
is called the day ought to wallow on you and you take this red-haired freckled kid and you pump

3998
03:14:47,400 --> 03:14:54,360
him full of drugs and you roast him slowly raising his body temperature and you bleed him as his

3999
03:14:54,360 --> 03:15:01,560
body temperature rises and that blood is communion blood. That's what you get the taste for. Now,

4000
03:15:01,560 --> 03:15:06,680
why he has to be red-haired and freckled? I mean, not freckled, red-haired and pimpled. He's got

4001
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:10,280
to have pimples, which makes you think, well, you got to use a teenage kid for this or something.

4002
03:15:10,840 --> 03:15:14,680
Something about the pimples, you know, it has to do with hormones because it's right at that time

4003
03:15:14,680 --> 03:15:19,560
that whatever is going on in his body is producing those, those pimples, but that's what you got to

4004
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:29,160
use. Where does this come from? The day ought to wallow on you. It's a recipe for Medea's communion

4005
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:36,520
and it is sandwiched in an Arthurian tale, which is terrible. It's terribly written. It's lightened,

4006
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:41,800
12th century lightened and it's awful. It's awful. It's like torture to read it.

4007
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:49,400
But what sort of Greek sources does it come from? We don't know. Oh, you don't know?

4008
03:15:49,400 --> 03:15:53,720
No, nobody knows. Is this what comes from these modern-day

4009
03:15:55,480 --> 03:16:00,200
conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family trying to

4010
03:16:01,240 --> 03:16:07,080
traffic young kids to drink their blood and to get an adrenochrome to make them young,

4011
03:16:07,080 --> 03:16:13,720
bohemian grove and all this stuff? Yeah. I have no idea, to be honest. Do you think maybe that

4012
03:16:13,800 --> 03:16:20,920
culturally influenced? Yeah, I have no idea, honestly. I don't. Do you pay attention to

4013
03:16:20,920 --> 03:16:26,360
any of that stuff? I see it and when I do, I laugh because it's like, look, they're talking about

4014
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:35,400
cults that I can show you, right? Eustatius talks about the cult that takes that nine-month-old and

4015
03:16:35,400 --> 03:16:40,600
delivers it forcefully and then bleeds it. Yeah, flashing blood, man. How do you think?

4016
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:43,800
Why do you think Jesus is sitting there and saying, you got to drink my flesh and eat my blood?

4017
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:50,360
Right? It's part of the cult. Yeah, I'm glad he wasn't like the Ophite saying, you got to drink my

4018
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:56,280
girls, you know, when you went to Catholic Church today, they would be giving you some rice pudding

4019
03:16:56,280 --> 03:17:04,120
or something. I don't know. How often are you reading new stuff and new texts? Every day.

4020
03:17:04,120 --> 03:17:08,520
Every day you read new stuff? Every day. The corpus metachorum gricorum is huge.

4021
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:14,440
And it's got a whole bunch of works that nobody reads. Galen, I can never finish reading Galen.

4022
03:17:14,440 --> 03:17:18,920
I've just, you know, there's no way I'm going to. I'm just specializing on his drug works.

4023
03:17:19,720 --> 03:17:24,920
I think that's what I'm, you know, my future is. He's got lots of good stuff, but I'm looking at

4024
03:17:24,920 --> 03:17:31,640
Nicander. I'm looking at Nicander and I'm looking at a lot of Eretias of Cappadocia. These are all

4025
03:17:31,640 --> 03:17:36,680
pharmacologically oriented. Nicander is a priest, though. So he gets into the priestess, though.

4026
03:17:36,680 --> 03:17:40,920
It's pretty cool. So what does this all mean? Everything you've learned, everything we've

4027
03:17:40,920 --> 03:17:45,480
talked about today, all the drug use and all this cult rituals in the ancient world, what are the,

4028
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:52,520
what would be the implications on the modern world today if we were to be enlightened by this

4029
03:17:52,520 --> 03:18:02,360
information? Yeah, it means our religious background is rooted in a guy that we venerate. And that guy

4030
03:18:03,160 --> 03:18:16,200
was somebody who used children. He was involved with drugs. It's a mystery that was nothing like

4031
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:21,640
going to church today. At least I don't think it is. Maybe somebody's other, but

4032
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:27,080
I don't think it's like that anymore. And the fact is we have built a society based on a lie,

4033
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:34,040
on a complete lie. And it's such a hypocritical lie because the very guy that you venerate,

4034
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:40,680
I mean, dude, he's arrested in a public park with a kid. Danny, if you got it, if you and I got

4035
03:18:40,680 --> 03:18:47,160
arrested in a public park with 12 kids, what do you think we would be? We sure as hell wouldn't

4036
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:52,040
be right. Are you the only one that said, are you, are you the only one that's translating

4037
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:57,000
this stuff this way? No, no, there's other people. I'm just the first one to have guts to do it.

4038
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:03,960
Are there other classicists or linguists who can, who have translated these same texts you

4039
03:19:03,960 --> 03:19:08,120
are corroborating what you're saying? Yeah, Dr. Rock, for example, and that's why I always throw

4040
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:13,800
him out as my corroborator. Dr. Rock will tell you, because he and I translated

4041
03:19:14,600 --> 03:19:20,600
apocalypse together and I showed him my breakdown and outline of it. And so he can tell you,

4042
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:25,480
all I'm doing is translating. I'm not, none of this stuff is made up. It's just straight up

4043
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:31,400
translations, but it's translations coming from somebody who's actually read the medical side

4044
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:38,040
and read the science side and can talk about what the terms are actually doing until classes get

4045
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:44,760
off their lazy rumps and stop trying to sell books. They're not going to, they're not going to,

4046
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:52,520
classicists infamously hate Bible studies. Yeah, I mean, they're kind of a joke. Biblical scholars

4047
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:55,800
are kind of a joke with classicists and they know that if they get into that

4048
03:19:56,440 --> 03:20:00,600
patty, there may be some landmines in there. You know what I mean? Are you ever going to write

4049
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:06,040
another book? Dr. Rock asked me to write another book, but I think what I'm doing is with Lady

4050
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:11,560
Babylon, I'm trying to write the book through a different medium. Yeah, a different medium. Yeah.

4051
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:16,680
Yeah, hopefully Lady Babylon is your website and your YouTube channel. It's my YouTube channel.

4052
03:20:16,680 --> 03:20:19,400
Yeah, and I'm not. Why do you call it Lady Babylon?

4053
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:27,640
Because Lady Babylon is that first Christ. I told you, I love Jesus, man. And Lady Babylon is that

4054
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:32,200
first Bronze Age Christ. That's actually the oldest Greek that we have for Christ goes to her.

4055
03:20:33,080 --> 03:20:38,360
She's that Medwa, that Medea. She's the one who has that knowledge. It's such a breakthrough for

4056
03:20:38,360 --> 03:20:45,560
humans and brings that water of life. That's Lady Babylon. She was Queen of Babylon. The Lady Babylon

4057
03:20:45,560 --> 03:20:52,680
is, she's the one who holds up the cup and that cup is full of her. And that's what causes us,

4058
03:20:52,680 --> 03:20:59,640
that the beast is able to cause us to enter into that communion. So if that's the history,

4059
03:21:00,440 --> 03:21:04,520
because that's what the texts say, you can say, well, what does it, what does all of it mean? It

4060
03:21:04,520 --> 03:21:10,120
means that we have texts that say this and welcome to the museum. That's what's really important is

4061
03:21:10,120 --> 03:21:18,840
that you see these texts. You see Jesus arrested with a boy. I sent a letter to about 45 heads of

4062
03:21:18,840 --> 03:21:27,240
seminaries and professors asking them about these very passages saying, who is this kid? And what

4063
03:21:27,240 --> 03:21:32,120
is this? Have you ever seen this medicated bandage? And do you know anything about the mystery, the

4064
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:40,360
pagan mystery? And the universal answer, except for from one woman was, that's interesting,

4065
03:21:40,360 --> 03:21:44,600
is what she said. Everybody else, you know, was negative. They're not going to get into this.

4066
03:21:45,800 --> 03:21:50,360
Biblical scholars can't handle it, first of all. And second of all, they don't want to,

4067
03:21:50,360 --> 03:21:56,440
because it's dangerous, man. What are people going to do? Back when this thing was in the,

4068
03:21:56,680 --> 03:22:01,960
when Pope Gregory came out in one of his homilies, he said, this is not,

4069
03:22:02,760 --> 03:22:08,680
we're going to excuse Mary for having the sex drugs, number one. And number two, that kid that

4070
03:22:08,680 --> 03:22:16,040
was with Jesus was his cousin. Kissing cousins. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. But it was

4071
03:22:16,040 --> 03:22:22,120
an excuse. It's a way to excuse it because the reality of what Jesus was is far harder to bear.

4072
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:27,960
Right. And, but when you go back and read the gospels now, now people and people have told me

4073
03:22:27,960 --> 03:22:33,720
this, oh my God, other things suddenly make sense. Like why people were telling, we're saying, hey,

4074
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:41,080
he's touching, stop touching. Right. All that stuff makes sense now. Why is Jesus saying, hey,

4075
03:22:41,080 --> 03:22:45,560
if you're a real Christian, you're going to lift up these vipers and you're going to drink

4076
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:53,080
thanosemone, you're going to drink a drug, a death inducer. Jesus says you will drink

4077
03:22:53,080 --> 03:22:59,800
death inducer. That's a drug. And he's saying it. This is what you're going to do. People don't,

4078
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:04,040
they read a fairy tale. I want the real Jesus. I don't want a fairy tale Jesus. I want the one

4079
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:09,800
that was arrested with a kid. And I want to know that my society has based its morality on that,

4080
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:19,480
dude. Wow. Powerful stuff, man. Where can people pirate your books?

4081
03:23:20,120 --> 03:23:25,640
Yeah. You know what? I think I'm just going to post my book somewhere in electronic copy because

4082
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:32,760
my students found it. Don't buy my book. Just get an electronic copy if you really are interested.

4083
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:39,080
And most importantly, what I want to draw people to is I bring these sources out there

4084
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:48,120
in Lady Babylon. And yeah, it's my final portrait. And I hope that, you know, I hope to

4085
03:23:48,920 --> 03:23:53,880
that people will be able to appreciate the museum again, that people will worship and honor the

4086
03:23:53,880 --> 03:23:59,080
muse because that's what our society and our gorgeous democracy, our gorgeous democracy

4087
03:23:59,080 --> 03:24:04,280
is built on that. And I want to preserve that. Do you think everyone knowing this stuff and

4088
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:13,320
basically, I mean, if people accepted this truth that you claim, do you think that that would be

4089
03:24:13,320 --> 03:24:20,840
a benefit to humanity to know this truth? Yeah, just like I assume that practicing

4090
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:26,840
religions would collapse, right? Because who would want to, if you know that Jesus was a

4091
03:24:26,840 --> 03:24:30,840
no, would you really go? Right. Would you want to be involved? Would you want to give

4092
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:36,600
you how do you think it would benefit our society? Freedom. I had a man in freedom. Yeah.

4093
03:24:37,320 --> 03:24:42,600
Nobody is above. No, nobody is above the democracy. Nobody is above your reason.

4094
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:50,920
Nobody is above the mind that you've been given. And that nature is your, is your mom.

4095
03:24:51,960 --> 03:24:58,520
And the mystery brings you to a place where you know who you are. That's what it said on the

4096
03:24:58,520 --> 03:25:06,600
Temple of Apollo. It said, know yourself. Know yourself. So yeah, I think there would be a

4097
03:25:06,600 --> 03:25:10,360
renaissance and I would love it. I would love it, but you couldn't worship Jesus anymore. You

4098
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:14,360
couldn't take the communion. If you knew what he was doing to that kid, you couldn't take that

4099
03:25:14,360 --> 03:25:19,640
communion anymore. I don't care what the priests say. I don't care if they're following that or

4100
03:25:19,640 --> 03:25:26,920
not. They're following that spirit. And, you know, yeah, needs to be stopped now. Yeah.

4101
03:25:26,920 --> 03:25:30,920
That's fascinating stuff, man. Well, Amen. Thank you so much for coming here and talking about

4102
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:35,320
this stuff. I really appreciate your time. Danny, it's a huge, huge honor for me to come here.

4103
03:25:35,320 --> 03:25:41,800
And I want you to know I really, to your audience, you know, you're a really cool guy, man.

4104
03:25:42,680 --> 03:25:48,040
I appreciate it. You as well, man. I think what you're doing is, I think what you're doing is

4105
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:56,920
exploration and it's like free. It's like university or, you know, salon grade

4106
03:25:58,120 --> 03:26:04,040
spirit that I get here. So kudos to you for being able to pull that off in this crap world.

4107
03:26:04,040 --> 03:26:09,160
Cheers, brother. I appreciate your time. And good night, folks.
