Checking Danny Jones/Ancient Language Expert： Jesus Christ Used Children as Drugs ｜ Ammon Hillman.txt
 In this conversation, Danny Thompson discusses his perspectives on the historical and factual nature of Jesus' life as depicted in the gospels. He emphasizes that biblical scholars often avoid or resist exploring these topics because it challenges established religious narratives and could have significant implications for society if widely accepted. Danny argues that understanding the true history behind the biblical accounts would lead to greater freedom and self-awareness, allowing individuals to reason and think independently without being bound by dogmatic beliefs.

Danny asserts that Jesus was likely a married man with children, based on various pieces of evidence he has researched and presented in his work. He suggests that the story of Jesus has been mythologized over time, and that the real Jesus might be more radical and challenging to contemporary Christian beliefs than the sanitized version presented in religious teachings.

He also touches upon the importance of critical thinking and the value of understanding one's history and origins, as depicted in ancient temples like the Temple of Apollo with its inscription "know thyself." Danny encourages people to question established narratives and to seek truth through reason and evidence.

The conversation highlights the potential benefits of a society that embraces this deeper understanding of historical figures like Jesus, leading to a renaissance of freedom and personal discovery. However, Danny also acknowledges the challenges such revelations would pose to religious practices and institutions. The dialogue is respectful and thought-provoking, inviting listeners to consider the implications of reevaluating long-held beliefs about historical and religious figures.
