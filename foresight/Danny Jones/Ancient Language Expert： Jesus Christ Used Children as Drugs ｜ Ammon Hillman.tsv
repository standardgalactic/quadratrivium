0	3800	I don't even know where to begin with this episode.
3800	5680	The following guest, Dr. Hillman,
5680	8800	has a master's degree in bacteriology,
8800	10160	a master's degree in classics,
10160	12680	as well as a PhD in classics,
12680	15880	until he was eventually investigated
15880	18600	by the Catholic Church for demon possession,
18600	22120	which led to him being ejected by his university.
22120	24680	Now, although I did read his book,
24680	26920	The Chemical Muse, before we recorded this podcast,
26920	29520	it quickly became clear that I was not prepared
29520	30440	for what was coming.
32000	34160	And I'm still trying to process this conversation
34160	35800	weeks after we recorded it.
35800	38360	Due to the provocative and unsettling nature
38360	39320	of this episode,
39320	43120	it has been heavily censored with parts redacted.
43120	45800	However, we posted the full uncensored version
45800	48480	in its entirety on Patreon if you want it.
48480	50680	You better buckle up, folks.
50680	53040	Please hammer that subscribe button below
53040	54120	and enjoy the show.
54120	59120	All right, Mr. Ommon Hillman,
63720	68720	you are a quite the controversial figure
68760	73760	when it comes to religion, classics, ancient texts.
74360	77280	You're a linguist, you're a classicist.
77280	81080	What is your official title?
82320	83840	Hail Satan, Danny.
84360	86520	It's nice to be here, by the way.
86520	87680	Thank you so much for your invitation.
87680	89160	Are you a Satanist?
89160	90640	Am I a Satanist?
90640	92720	Oh, God.
92720	95040	Those people bother me so much.
95040	97840	No, I can't be a Satanist, I'm sorry.
97840	99000	They bother you.
99000	100640	What bothers you about them?
100640	103160	The whole religious side of things.
104480	106080	Yeah, no, no, no.
106080	107080	What am I?
107080	108840	Well, you are a religious scholar, right?
108840	110680	No, I'm a classicist.
110680	113960	Religious scholars, no, we eat those for breakfast.
114360	116800	No, no, I'm a classicist.
116800	118280	What I do is...
118280	119200	What is a classicist?
119200	122960	It's somebody who is a specialist
122960	126240	in the translation of ancient Greek.
126240	127880	Some people do Latin, too,
127880	132480	but Latin was for hot dwelling Romans, you know what I mean?
132480	135640	It's just not to the level that the Greek is.
137000	140600	The unique word, can alone, is off the chart for Greek.
140600	145600	It is a superior language, devoured languages in antiquity.
145680	147920	It just ate them up, boom, boom.
147920	152920	And this is normal in any language over time.
153320	155560	Any language over time, right?
155560	157680	Some become strong and they become dominant,
157680	159520	others die out.
159520	162080	The Greek was the behemoth.
162080	164360	It was the dragon of antiquity.
164360	166240	Modern Greek is nothing like it.
166240	168960	How long have you been studying and reading
168960	170200	and translating Greek?
171040	174280	For 30 years now, for 30 years now.
174280	179280	And every classicist knows it's our honor and duty
180840	185840	to guard the muse and to keep those ancient documents
187280	191360	within the flow, within time itself.
191360	193440	So we're dragons, man.
193440	195360	That's what classicists were there.
195360	198160	Unfortunately, most classicists today,
199160	204160	they're focused on things that are more to build careers
204920	206800	and garbage, essentially.
206800	210160	So a lot of texts, a lot of these ancient texts
210160	213360	that we've got, they aren't translated even.
213360	217440	I've got an entire book that I brought to show to you
217440	221360	that is from the 1800s, it's Galen.
221360	223400	And these things are untranslated.
223400	224320	It's all in Greek.
224320	227160	I have the physical copies sitting in my bag.
227880	231040	So what pushed you in the direction
231040	233240	to be interested in this stuff?
233240	236360	Did you have a religious childhood
236360	238080	or a religious upbringing?
238080	240840	Or what got you into this?
240840	243360	Jesus got me into this.
243360	244680	Yeah, I actually-
244680	246080	When you were how old?
246080	248480	Oh, God, when I was like 13.
248480	249320	When you were 13.
249320	250160	Yeah, no.
250160	251280	So you were religious when you were a child.
251280	253320	Oh, yes, I was born again.
253320	254760	Love Jesus Christ.
254760	256080	Oh, Jesus.
256080	257880	Yeah, yeah.
257880	259480	I used to teach you to mission.
259480	260320	Are you kidding me?
260320	262080	I used to convert people.
262080	265840	I used to have mostly drunks, mostly drunks.
265840	268480	And I don't know, we were like a place for them to go
268480	272880	and to sober up, but they had to listen to my crap.
272880	273720	Oh, excuse me.
273720	278440	They had to listen to my sermon in order to get that meal.
278440	280440	Cause that's how we spread, brother.
280440	281800	Do you understand?
282320	284680	I converted souls into mission.
286160	290560	You converted souls to Christianity when you were 13?
290560	294560	No, I started doing that when I was like 17.
296760	297960	When you were 17.
297960	299200	Yeah.
299200	300880	I was teaching Sunday school class too,
300880	303040	cause their Sunday school teachers sucked.
305040	305880	Really?
305880	306720	Yeah.
306720	310200	How does a 17 year old get to start teaching Sunday school?
310200	312440	Did your parents get you into this stuff?
312440	314680	Oh, of course, you know, you know,
314680	317520	through the family and through some very intelligent teachers
317520	320160	like Dr. J. Vernon McKee.
320160	324240	Oh God, beloved Dallas theologian.
324240	325080	You know what I mean?
325080	326560	Dallas Theological Seminary.
326560	328560	I went there for three months
328560	331120	and their Greek program was so bad.
331120	333400	I said, I went to the president of the university.
333400	336160	I said, hey, it's not up to stuff.
336160	338440	His name was Walbert, John Walbert.
338440	341960	I said, your program isn't up to snuff.
341960	346200	What's the, your Greek program is terrible, right?
346200	350640	So I went on to university to get a PhD and...
350640	353160	So going back to the early childhood stuff.
353160	354000	Yeah.
354000	355160	When you were in your teens,
355160	357240	you said you were teaching Sunday school.
357240	358080	Yeah.
359320	362480	What particularly were you teaching
362480	364920	and was there some point in your life
364920	367120	that led you to question?
368560	371480	The teachings of the Bible
371480	373040	and the teachings of the church
373040	375160	and everything you knew when you were young?
376760	379680	I got there through Aristotle.
379680	381080	So I saw, here's what happened.
381080	384280	I saw how bad the standards were
384280	387680	on the Christian side for ancient Greek.
389200	393000	And I said, I've got to follow a track
393000	396080	to be able to get there.
396080	399560	And it went through the sciences.
399560	401040	It went through the sciences.
402200	405320	And I think what happened was
405320	407560	when I was 21, I just cracked.
407560	409800	I was reading Aristotle.
409800	414800	And the pure, unadulterated glory of his reason.
415640	417720	And you're talking about Greek, you're reading Greek?
417720	418560	Yeah.
418560	419400	What?
419400	420240	Yeah.
420240	422280	So how did you learn Greek at 21?
423280	427680	Because I went to a special high school, first of all.
427680	428520	Okay.
428520	431600	Shout out to the people from special projects.
431600	433480	Special projects?
433480	435640	That was its first name.
435640	440160	Everybody, you had a test to get into it, right?
440160	441320	Uh-huh.
441320	445880	Everybody that I was around is somehow involved
445880	450880	in military, government, stuff like that.
451040	455720	We won the chess championship two years in a row.
455720	457800	National chess championship, right?
457800	459800	Bunch of nerds, right?
459800	460920	Total nerds.
461840	466840	So I knew I would be going to learn about Jesus
467440	470360	at a seminary someday, because that was my bent.
470360	472200	I saved people, you know?
473400	474840	And you said when you were saving people,
474840	477320	you were saving alcoholics, drunks, rather?
477320	479280	They were the easy peckins.
480120	480960	So what did they do?
480960	481800	They just came to you?
481800	483120	They said, my life is terrible?
483120	484240	No, it's a mission.
484240	486440	So they check in for the evening.
486440	488960	They're gonna sit and listen to us preach.
488960	490280	Then they give them dinner.
490280	492000	They're mostly there to get fed, you know?
492000	492960	Right.
492960	495240	You know, charity, so to speak.
495240	498760	But I was the one who was saving souls.
498760	501200	That was my thing.
501200	502160	It was delicious.
502160	503800	Have you never saved a soul?
505640	506720	Probably not, no.
506720	507720	No?
507720	509200	Oh, you should try.
509480	510320	Well, I'll have to learn.
510320	511160	It's yummy.
512280	516240	Okay, so you're doing this in your early teens,
516240	519880	saving souls in a mission, it's called a mission.
519880	521320	Okay.
521320	524080	And then you decide in your early 20s,
524080	527840	you're gonna learn Greek at the high school you're at.
527840	530720	No, I started, that was my high school.
530720	533720	Right after that, I went to the University of Arizona.
533720	534560	Okay.
534560	537400	And started their classics program there.
537400	541840	And I went through in three years and ate it up
541840	544200	and went to Tel Megiddo at the time
544200	546880	and did a dig at Tel Megiddo in Israel.
547840	550600	So, okay, so you said you did a classics program
550600	551820	at the University of Arizona.
551820	556000	When you first went into that program in college,
556000	558920	what was your goal?
558920	560280	What were you looking for anything?
560280	562480	Did you, what did you wanna learn?
562480	563320	Jesus.
563320	564720	You wanted to learn about Jesus.
564720	565880	Yes.
565880	566720	Okay.
567240	568080	Okay.
569240	570080	Yeah, I think so.
570080	570920	Yeah, all right.
570920	571760	I think so.
571760	573400	I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this, man.
573400	576400	I'm trying to understand your curiosity here.
576400	578000	That's, I'm just trying to,
578000	581080	I'm trying to dig deep into the psyche of Amon Hillman.
581080	582320	Okay, I love it.
584400	586240	Okay, so that's when you learned Greek.
586240	587080	Yes.
588360	590040	Was it hard to learn Greek?
590040	592040	Yeah, and you never stop.
592040	593000	You never stop.
593000	594800	I'm not kidding you.
594840	597480	I can take a text right now,
597480	601640	throw it in front of any classicist in the world,
601640	603480	and have the, and say translate it,
603480	608480	and they'll be like, mm, yeah, mm, mm, ah, no, notice.
608760	610360	I can do that with notice right now,
610360	614040	throw it in front of 98% of the classes out there,
614040	615880	they'll stumble on it.
615880	617560	The ones who have done notice,
617560	618600	they'll be able to get it.
618600	621200	Why is notice so hard to translate?
621200	623320	Cause he's using an archaic style.
623320	625040	He's trying to do something
625040	627960	that they were doing a thousand years previous to him.
627960	628800	Okay.
628800	631440	And he's putting together the longest epic.
632960	634760	It's about Dionysus and a bunch of
634760	637080	aero poison used in women.
637080	639240	Oh, wow, aero poison.
639240	640120	Yeah.
640120	640960	Interesting.
640960	642960	Hot, hot stuff.
642960	643800	Yeah.
643800	646520	Yeah, it also causes satiriasis.
646520	648920	It's a drug, yeah.
648920	650240	Okay.
650240	651840	Do you know what satiriasis is?
651840	652680	No, what's a satiriasis?
652720	653680	A satir.
653680	654520	Satir.
654520	655360	Yeah.
655360	656200	What is a satir?
656200	659240	A satir is a guy who walks around
659240	662840	with an arachn constantly, no, constant.
662840	664400	How does he have an arachn constantly?
664400	666920	Constant, unremitting arachn.
666920	668520	Hmm.
668520	669360	Yeah.
669360	671280	The old Spanish fly in there.
671280	674720	Oh God, keeps it hard all the time.
674720	676960	You can kill a person they say after seven days,
676960	677920	you gotta stop them.
677920	678760	Oh, really?
678760	679600	Yeah.
679600	680440	Wow.
680440	681760	That's what they say in antiquity, seven days.
681800	683360	I don't know, how'd they find out?
683360	684560	Hmm.
684560	686920	Okay, so going back to your college,
686920	689360	you're studying Greek and then you said,
689360	690920	at what point did you go to Israel
690920	692240	and why did you go to Israel?
692240	695040	Yeah, right after my Bachelors went to Israel
695040	698320	and stayed there for a year and worked on the Megiddo,
698320	699680	tell Megiddo excavation.
699680	700800	What is that?
700800	701640	For people who don't know.
701640	703400	People who don't know anything about this stuff.
703400	704360	No, that's okay.
704360	705200	Why would they?
705200	707400	It's the place of Armageddon.
707400	711520	So it's a site in Israel.
711520	713400	And it has a temple.
713400	718400	Our team discovered the temple floor that was there.
718840	721440	It's a Canaanite temple floor under everything.
722480	724480	And that dates back, the last time I saw,
724480	728240	they thought that dated back to about 4,000 BC.
729120	734120	So, and I don't use the, about 4,000 BC.
734520	739520	So it was a momentous, wondrous excavation.
740520	743080	And I'm proud to have been part of it.
743080	744080	Yeah.
744080	745640	What kind of stuff did you find?
746480	748840	I found a chicken.
748840	749680	Chicken?
749680	750520	Yeah, I found a chicken
750520	752360	because I was digging the old French dump heap.
752360	754000	What they found that was so important
754000	755520	was the floor of a Canaanite temple
755520	760160	were these Canaanite priestesses in 4,000 BC
760160	763400	where all the power, where all the authority is,
763400	768400	oops, is there, yeah, tell Megiddo,
769120	771080	there it is, I'm sorry, I'm distracted.
771080	771920	That's it.
771920	773320	Yeah, tell Megiddo.
774240	775760	And it's a wonderful site.
775760	777760	And I tell you, I slept,
778600	780520	the most interesting part of the story is
780520	784320	I slept in the vineyard of Jezebel.
784320	785960	So what did you learn from the stuff
785960	787640	you found at Tell Megiddo?
789080	793040	The earliest occupation was probably
793040	796520	by these Canaanite populations there.
796560	798480	Which was 4,000 BC?
798480	803480	Yeah, they've got a circular dance floor
805240	809440	for them to be worshiping whatever divinities it is
809440	811000	that they worship.
811000	814320	And these are like the Phoenicians.
814320	815320	It's all up and down the coast.
815320	819320	Jezebel was a Phoenician princess baby, you know what I mean?
819320	821360	So they had a circular dance floor.
821360	825040	Yeah, right, is that unimpressive?
825080	827080	It's very impressive, for 4,000 years ago,
827080	827920	it's very impressive.
827920	830240	Well, move on, because when I was in the vineyard
830240	832960	of Jezebel, these guys that went nuts,
832960	835640	they got up at night and they sat there
835640	836920	and they talked and they told me
836920	838560	what was gonna happen to me.
838560	839600	What they say was gonna happen to you?
839600	844520	On successive nights, they said a troop
844520	849520	of demons will assist you to bring the Antichrist.
852840	853680	Yeah.
853680	854800	Who said that?
854800	858160	Two guys on two successive nights were nuts.
858160	862360	There were people with us on the excavation, right?
862360	866400	We're working during the day and in the evenings,
866400	868520	we're sleeping and people are waking up
868520	873160	in their sleep and talking to me and then going nuts.
873160	874960	Is that thunder?
874960	876600	This is amazing, we're doing this podcast
876600	877720	in the middle of the thunderstorm.
877720	878560	Yeah, we got a storm.
878560	881360	So these guys told you, what about the Antichrist?
881400	885160	They said I would be protected by a troop of demons.
885160	886280	A troop of demons?
886280	889600	Yeah, and they said it on successive nights.
889600	894240	So like the first guy, Moshe, he went totally nuts, right?
894240	899240	He sat up in bed, 2 a.m., started talking to me like a puppet.
900720	903320	The next morning runs off, boom,
903320	905800	the head of the kibbutz where we're staying comes to me,
905800	907320	he says, what's going on?
907320	910360	I said, off he goes, I don't know, right?
910360	912440	The next night, I didn't think it was odd.
912440	914320	I love Jesus at this point.
916240	919840	I didn't think it was odd, but on the next night,
919840	922600	the dude that they replaced him with,
922600	924680	he did the same thing, he sat up in bed,
924680	926360	he gave me the same message.
927320	929960	You'll be protected by a troop of demons.
929960	932440	A troop of demons, for what purpose?
932440	934160	To bring the Antichrist.
934160	936400	What did you make of that?
936400	939320	I thought he was nuts the first time he said it.
939360	941040	The second time he said it, I thought, wow,
941040	943440	this place is like, what happened?
943440	945640	Is there some kind of material in the ground
945640	946640	or something out here?
946640	947680	Making these people crazy?
947680	948520	You know what I mean?
948520	950600	Many people, the head of the kibbutz came to me
950600	953000	and she said, what's going on?
953000	954440	And I said, what do you mean?
954440	955440	She said, what's going on?
955440	958560	Two of your roommates have gone totally nuts.
958560	960320	I said, how if I know?
960320	965320	Yeah, yeah, what would you expect me to say?
965800	968800	When they claimed that I was able to levitate
968800	971480	through doors at the university
971480	976480	and they had an inquiry as to my state of demon possession.
978240	979800	When was this?
979800	981760	When I worked for St. Mary's University.
981760	982920	So this is much later?
982920	983760	Yeah.
983760	984800	Okay, let's try to stay on track.
984800	985640	Let's stay on track.
985640	987800	Let's try to stay like in a, wow.
989800	990920	You see what happens?
990920	993560	Are you sure you're not the Antichrist?
993560	995240	There's just a rain cloud that follows him around
995240	996080	everywhere.
1000080	1000920	Yeah.
1000920	1002120	What is the Christ?
1002120	1003400	What is the Antichrist?
1003400	1005360	What is the Christ if you have to know them?
1005360	1007360	Antichrist, you have to know the Christ.
1007360	1008200	Right.
1008200	1009080	It's a Greek word.
1011360	1012440	For?
1012440	1017240	For applying a drug to your eyes
1017240	1020320	so that they may be open.
1021720	1024680	That's what the Christ means in Greek.
1024680	1025520	Yes.
1025520	1027560	It's from the verb chrio,
1027560	1030200	to be stung by the gadfly.
1031720	1032760	Huh.
1032760	1034080	Who is the gadfly?
1036240	1037080	Who is the gadfly?
1037080	1037920	Yeah, I don't know.
1037920	1039480	Socrates said he was.
1041320	1042800	It's a thing they had going on.
1042800	1044600	Remember they have orcs and stuff like that.
1044600	1046880	So you better buckle up.
1046880	1047720	All right.
1048760	1050840	But what does that have to do with the gadfly?
1050840	1052320	I mean, we think it's...
1052960	1055240	No, no, oistress to be stung.
1056400	1058360	It's a state of mania.
1060040	1063040	They call it in Greek, oistromania.
1064000	1064840	Okay.
1064840	1066880	To be in an altered state.
1066880	1068360	Right, right, right.
1068360	1073360	Okay, anyways, let's go back to your in Israel, right?
1075480	1076760	You're doing this excavation.
1076760	1077920	You're finding all this stuff.
1077920	1079280	These crazy people come up to you
1079280	1082080	telling you that you're protected by a troop of demons.
1083080	1084520	How long did you stay there?
1084520	1085720	And then what did you do after that?
1085720	1087840	A year and a month.
1087840	1090640	And then I decided, okay, I've maxed out
1090640	1092280	what's my interest here.
1092280	1093120	Okay.
1093120	1097800	Came back and enrolled in another program
1097800	1100000	which ended up, a master's program,
1100000	1105000	ended up sending me to a lab where I cut brains.
1105360	1106320	Cut brains?
1106320	1107160	Yeah.
1107160	1108000	Okay.
1108000	1108840	What were you cutting brains for?
1108840	1111480	To identify neuropeptides.
1111520	1112360	Oh, okay.
1112360	1113840	Yeah.
1113840	1114680	On the science.
1114680	1116680	Is this your study in bacteriology?
1116680	1118680	No, it hadn't gone to the back T
1118680	1120960	but it's what led to the back T.
1120960	1125960	I wanted to bolster my science education.
1126400	1128120	So I did a lot of like...
1128120	1130640	Neuropeptides, what's a neuropeptide?
1130640	1135640	Yeah, it's a peptide that is active in the brain
1136600	1139240	as part of a signaling system.
1140080	1142240	So we talk about communication
1142240	1146160	between the hypothalamus and the pituitary
1146160	1148240	and how puberty is regulated.
1148240	1149480	That was a big one.
1149480	1151880	We were looking for the peptide
1151880	1156640	that brings on premature puberty.
1157600	1158760	Do you hear that?
1160520	1164000	That's, those are souls swirling around outside.
1164000	1165120	Dude, that's loud.
1165120	1165960	Yeah.
1165960	1166800	Is that rain?
1166800	1167720	Yeah.
1167720	1169920	Rain or wind blowing the rain?
1169920	1170760	God.
1172040	1172880	God.
1174080	1177720	So the neuropeptides that were responsible for puberty?
1177720	1179600	Yeah, the onset of puberty.
1179600	1182000	What made you so interested in that?
1182000	1183280	They had a grant for it.
1183280	1185160	It wasn't mine, they had a grant.
1185160	1186200	You just got thrown into it?
1186200	1187680	It's for premature, yeah.
1187680	1190560	It's for people who have early onset puberty.
1190560	1191400	Okay.
1191400	1192240	Is there a problem with that?
1192240	1194040	Well, hell yeah, there's a problem with that.
1194040	1194880	What's the problem?
1194880	1197560	All my stuff is time with growth.
1198400	1199240	What causes it?
1200320	1203160	Peptides go astray in the brain.
1203160	1204600	But what makes the peptides go astray?
1204600	1206520	Is there some sort of external influences?
1206520	1208400	We didn't know at the time what it was.
1208400	1210000	That's what I was doing.
1210000	1212480	This is where I am in the experiment.
1212480	1214480	It's not an experiment, it's just an investigation.
1214480	1216600	But you're tagging.
1216600	1220440	You take an antibody conjugated substance
1220440	1225080	and it's either something that fluoresces
1225120	1227680	or it's a dye of some sort.
1227680	1230120	And you localize where these peptides are
1230120	1235120	in the brains of these things that you sacrificed.
1236640	1237480	Yeah.
1237480	1238320	Animals?
1238320	1241920	Yeah, we used to drill holes in animals' heads.
1241920	1245680	And then put in a little catheter, a little tube.
1245680	1248480	And then you can insert a substance,
1248480	1249520	anything you want, anything.
1249520	1252680	You could insert orange juice if you wanted.
1252720	1255160	But we would insert substances
1255160	1258320	and then take another collector and see what
1258320	1261640	the hypothalamus did.
1261640	1262760	And it was beautiful.
1262760	1266160	It was a beautiful, beautiful finding.
1267160	1268240	Because they were mapping.
1268240	1270920	At the time, people were mapping how the brain works.
1270920	1272280	And this is how they were figuring out
1272280	1273840	what the hypothalamus does.
1273840	1274600	Yeah, absolutely.
1274600	1275840	Yeah.
1275840	1277000	That's interesting stuff.
1277000	1278480	Yeah, I was proud to be a part of it.
1278480	1280280	It was good, good education.
1280280	1282600	How long did you do those studies?
1282600	1283560	A couple of years.
1283560	1284400	A couple of years.
1284400	1285240	Uh-huh.
1285240	1287280	Yeah, I taught endocrinology, too.
1287280	1288200	Oh, did you really?
1288200	1290720	Well, everybody in the grad program had to.
1290720	1292400	You taught endocrinology?
1292400	1294240	Yeah, uh-huh.
1294240	1296960	Yeah, I did the brain part of it.
1296960	1301280	So, and you had to, graduate students had to.
1301280	1304240	Like the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the...
1304240	1305400	The third ventricle, man.
1305400	1306680	You know what that is?
1306680	1307720	What's the third ventricle?
1307720	1310800	It's an open space in the middle of your head.
1310800	1311640	Really?
1311640	1314320	It's filled with a fluid.
1314320	1315920	It's the water of life.
1315920	1317080	The water of life.
1317080	1318720	Yeah, and this fluid has all this...
1318720	1321120	Did people in ancient times try to drink that water of life
1321120	1322240	from people's heads?
1323200	1324240	You know they did.
1325920	1327600	Do you want to see the texts?
1328520	1330800	I'm sure the texts can verify this.
1334120	1336400	Baby brains, man.
1336400	1337520	Baby brains.
1337520	1338760	Yeah.
1338760	1340600	No, no, they used to bleed them, too.
1341720	1343480	So, is this, what is this, Steve?
1343480	1344960	What are we looking at?
1344960	1347880	This is the third ventricle.
1347880	1348720	Beautiful.
1348720	1350200	Okay, the third ventricle.
1350200	1352600	Is it just to say it's just liquid in there or what?
1352600	1354520	Yeah, it's a pristine pool.
1354520	1355360	It's beyond...
1355360	1356520	What is the purpose of it?
1356520	1357360	What is it?
1357360	1358200	What is the function?
1358200	1359520	To carry the messengers.
1361640	1364360	That's the scientific description of what it does.
1366720	1368200	Yeah, actually it is.
1368200	1369040	Really?
1369040	1369880	Yeah.
1369880	1370880	Yeah.
1370920	1373600	Because it's communicating with all the tissue
1373600	1376480	that it's overlapping.
1376480	1377640	It's communicating.
1377640	1378480	Mm, okay.
1378480	1381400	And that little special area of the brain,
1381400	1384000	there's the three ventricles,
1384000	1385320	is like pristine.
1385320	1388080	That has to be the purest,
1388080	1393080	totally beyond the barrier for any sort of infection.
1393080	1395320	If you've got an infection there, you're dead.
1395320	1396160	Really?
1396160	1397000	Yeah.
1397000	1397840	Wow.
1400000	1400840	That's interesting.
1400840	1402240	Yeah, lots of brains.
1402240	1403760	I cut up lots of brains.
1403760	1407160	So, at what point in your life
1407160	1411200	did you start writing this infamous dissertation
1411200	1414960	that got suppressed by the heads of the department
1414960	1416200	in classics when you wrote,
1416200	1419320	when you started writing about the use of drugs and antiquity?
1420680	1421520	That's a perfect.
1421520	1424000	From that exact point,
1424000	1426080	I picked up some, a professor,
1426080	1428080	Professor Romer came to me.
1428080	1429240	Professor Romer.
1429240	1430080	Yeah.
1430280	1431120	Frank Romer.
1431120	1431960	Frank Romer.
1431960	1432800	University of Wisconsin.
1432800	1435480	Yeah, at the time, he was at University of Wisconsin.
1435480	1437480	I think he went out somewhere in California.
1437480	1438560	Mm-hmm.
1438560	1440840	But Frank Romer, and he said,
1440840	1442840	hey, he said, I know you're,
1442840	1445160	when I was on the science side, he said,
1445160	1447560	I already had him in classics, right?
1447560	1448920	So he knew what my interests were.
1448920	1451320	And he said, here, we have a whole bunch of documents
1451320	1454680	that are, nobody's ever translated from Greek.
1454680	1455520	Have at it.
1455520	1457160	It was like a, you know, the greatest gift.
1457160	1459160	Where did you find those documents?
1459360	1462400	Everywhere they've been for the last 2000 years.
1462400	1463240	Where?
1463240	1464240	Just sitting there.
1464240	1465160	Where on his desk?
1465160	1466200	In libraries.
1466200	1467040	Oh, really?
1467040	1467880	Yeah.
1467880	1468760	Nobody reads them.
1468760	1470000	Classes just don't do it.
1470000	1470840	You know why?
1470840	1471680	Why?
1471680	1472680	Because they're hard.
1472680	1473520	They're hard.
1473520	1475480	Because these Greeks are smart.
1475480	1476680	They're smart.
1476680	1478600	And these pharma, how many,
1478600	1482120	how many classes do you think no pharmacology?
1482120	1482960	Yeah.
1482960	1483780	I have no idea.
1483780	1484620	Oh, zero.
1484620	1485460	Zero.
1485460	1486840	Zero, yeah.
1486840	1488400	They don't do the medical stuff.
1488440	1489280	It's a shame.
1489280	1490120	It's a shame.
1490120	1490960	So I went to the-
1490960	1492160	Well, that's just like any field, right?
1492160	1494440	A lot of people who are experts in certain fields
1494440	1498320	or certain disciplines, they don't have a wide variety
1498320	1500680	of skills or disciplines as well.
1500680	1502360	They're typically just in one lane.
1503360	1505240	You gotta talk to a lot of people.
1505240	1507400	Or you gotta be a jack of all trades.
1507400	1508720	Interdisciplinary.
1508720	1509560	Interdisciplinary.
1509560	1510400	Yeah.
1510400	1511240	That's a good word.
1511240	1512080	Love that.
1512080	1514360	You keep one foot on either side of the fence.
1514360	1515520	You know what I mean?
1515520	1516440	Yeah.
1516440	1517280	Yeah.
1517280	1520240	So I went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison
1520240	1525240	to work with the country's best medical historian.
1527120	1528560	Who was, and what's his name again?
1528560	1529680	John Scarborough.
1529680	1531080	John Scarborough.
1531080	1531920	Yeah.
1531920	1535480	And he had a knowledge of the medical side as well.
1535480	1536320	Okay.
1537760	1541160	But he was also a great Byzantine.
1541160	1542920	He did a ton of the Byzantine sources.
1542920	1545160	He was one of the translators
1545160	1547560	of the Greek magical papyri.
1549320	1553720	So that in, it's a big deal.
1553720	1554560	It's a big deal.
1554560	1555400	Come on.
1555400	1556240	Can you explain what the magical papyri is?
1556240	1557080	Yeah.

1623040	1624000	Now back to the show.
1624000	1626040	Yeah, it's a collection of Greek works.
1626040	1630480	It's all about some of the dirtiest cult magic stuff
1630520	1631680	that you've ever seen.
1631680	1633440	People who say they know Gnosticism,
1633440	1636040	they haven't read this thing in Greek.
1636040	1638440	They don't know what they're talking about.
1638440	1643440	This is the one where we get all the body fluids
1643600	1646440	that are being used for the sake of medicine.
1646440	1649120	Okay, it's in this papyri.
1649120	1651920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1651920	1654560	And who knows, one source, one source.
1654560	1658640	We'll get into this more later, so let's go back to...
1658640	1659760	So it was studying with him.
1659800	1662720	Yeah, studying and developing your...
1662720	1667720	He gives you these papers, these texts to translate.
1668000	1672840	And this is when you first discovered the use of drugs
1672840	1676320	or the idea of drugs being ubiquitous and antiquity.
1677880	1680360	Yeah, I was studying ancient pharmacology.
1680360	1682240	That was what my area was.
1682240	1683680	That's what I was forging.
1683680	1686440	Okay, and you already knew about Galen, right?
1686440	1688080	You'd already been studying Galen.
1688080	1693080	Yeah, I know, and I had been to a conference in England
1693080	1695160	and the London Times said,
1695160	1698800	wow, this guy's work is the last wild frontier of classics,
1698800	1701240	you know, and they're right,
1701240	1704040	because nobody does this stuff.
1704040	1704880	Nobody does it.
1704880	1706880	For people also, to give some more context
1706880	1709600	to people who are listening, who is Galen?
1709600	1711840	Can you explain who Galen was?
1711840	1715880	Yeah, Galen is a second century physician of...
1715880	1718720	He works for Marcus Aurelius, the emperor,
1718720	1720520	and he's probably one of the greatest
1720520	1722840	intellects of Western civilization.
1722840	1724640	Definitely, he was a...
1724640	1729440	He wrote thousands and thousands and thousands of pages,
1729440	1733120	and probably 10% of it has been translated.
1733120	1733960	If that...
1733960	1734800	Wow.
1734800	1737880	And nobody goes near the pharmaceutical stuff.
1737880	1740920	Now, in 2013, I saw for the first time
1741920	1743760	a dissertation was written
1743840	1748760	in which the person translated Galen's theriac to Piso.
1749840	1750680	What's a theriac?
1750680	1753120	A theriac is a multi-drug component
1755240	1760240	that's used to balance a poison or deathbringer,
1760640	1761560	they call them.
1761560	1764520	To balance a poison or deathbringer,
1764520	1765640	so like an antidote?
1765640	1767800	Yeah, exactly an antidote,
1767800	1771600	but they called it a galenic reaction
1771600	1773560	unrelated to the reason of Galen.
1774360	1779600	A galenic reaction, that's to bring the balance
1779600	1781400	of the one that can kill you
1781400	1784640	with the one that can keep you alive.
1784640	1786960	Bring those together, that's the theriac, baby.
1786960	1788320	Wow, interesting.
1788320	1790160	What's the point of that?
1790160	1792200	To die and to be born again.
1792200	1793720	To die and to be born again.
1794720	1796040	Wow.
1796040	1796880	Okay.
1796880	1797720	Yeah, do you want...
1797720	1799360	How much Galen have you read?
1799360	1801680	Considerable, yeah, considerable.
1801680	1802520	How many...
1802520	1804680	I mean, ideally, how many pages?
1804680	1806800	Oh, God, thousands.
1806800	1807640	Thousands?
1807640	1808480	Yeah.
1808480	1809440	And he's written how much?
1809440	1812320	Oh, 22 volumes at 1,008,
1812320	1815080	so somewhere around 22,000 pages.
1817200	1821000	And where does all this literature exist?
1821000	1822240	Like, where is it being held?
1822240	1825040	It's held currently in a book that's sitting out in my...
1825040	1825960	You have all of it?
1825960	1829200	Yeah, I got it from Johns Hopkins.
1829200	1830040	Wow.
1830040	1831480	Yeah, because Professor Scarborough
1831520	1834360	was in with all the book traders, right?
1834360	1835680	And they were like, oh, shit,
1835680	1839320	Galen has become available.
1839320	1840160	Okay.
1840160	1842240	Can I run out and get Galen?
1842240	1843080	Yeah, go grab it.
1843080	1843920	And show you.
1843920	1844760	Go grab it.
1844760	1847400	He's got an original Galen book.
1847400	1849520	Here he comes with the original...
1849520	1851160	Original...
1851160	1852000	1840.
1852000	1854080	This is from 1840?
1854080	1855840	Yeah, what's the date say on it?
1855840	1857240	1827.
1857240	1858080	There you go.
1858080	1858920	Look, I was not even close.
1859920	1862840	Omnia, Coon, 14, 1827.
1862840	1864560	Yeah, I was off a few years.
1865480	1866320	So...
1866320	1868240	So open it up and you'll see the...
1868240	1871680	It's basically, Danny, it's a medical text
1871680	1876680	for physicians in the early 1800s.
1877760	1878600	Right?
1878600	1879440	What are they studying?
1879440	1880400	They're studying Galen.
1880400	1882360	You asked me who Galen was?
1882360	1883200	Guess what?
1883200	1885280	He's the dude who dominated medicine
1885280	1887840	from the second century when he lived
1888640	1891680	until that book that you're holding, right?
1891680	1892720	This is the last set.
1892720	1895040	You're talking the second century BC, right?
1895040	1895880	Yeah.
1895880	1897080	No, no, no, I know Domini.
1897080	1897920	Oh, okay.
1897920	1899440	Yeah, Marcus Aurelius.
1900560	1901480	Yeah.
1901480	1903200	This is his physician.
1903200	1904140	By the way,
1904140	1906840	he says in here that Marcus Aurelius is a total dopehead.
1906840	1908200	What language is this?
1908200	1910480	Greek on the top, Latin on the bottom.
1910480	1913740	And the Latin translation is garbage.
1914640	1915480	Right?
1915480	1916320	Wow.
1916320	1917320	Oh man, this is...
1917320	1926040	wild. Yeah. Now what you're holding there is volume 14 of a 22 volume set from Johns Hopkins.
1926040	1930520	As you can see those backers put their mark all over it. By the way, isn't that beautiful paper?
1930520	1936600	Look at this. Look at this, everybody. That's centuries old centuries. Think about it. Look at
1936600	1944360	that. Right? Oh, it's gorgeous. It's a work of art. It's a work of art. But pages is a 700,
1944360	1953080	800 pages. 800 pages. Now think about it's volume 14, which is one of 14 books. Yeah,
1953080	1960440	it's one of 22. But it is 14. And 14 is all about the pharmacology of the antidotes.
1961800	1968440	And nobody looks into that stuff. And Galen says Marcus Aurelius is a total doped. He's on way too
1968440	1975640	much. What was he on specifically? The theriac. It's a combination of plants and animal products
1975640	1984040	that is meant to balance a cult ritual drug called the Black Death. The cult ritual drug that was
1984040	1994360	called the Black Death. Yeah. This is from Nero's library. Right? Nero has his arch physician
1995240	2005320	get this formula from the east for the theriac. The theriac is meant to balance the cup of Lady
2005320	2013080	Babylon. Okay. Let's go back to, I think I feel like we're starting to go down a rabbit hole.
2013080	2017240	We're just going to be hard for us to get out of. Yes. So I want to make sure we explain
2018200	2022760	this story in a linear fashion so people can follow it and don't get lost.
2024520	2032600	You're studying Galen, right? And you're working on your dissertation. And what happens next?
2033640	2039880	Oh, so from my dissertation, I did it on Roman pharmacy. Okay. Right. Roman pharmacy. Roman pharmacy.
2039880	2045880	Nobody's written to work on Roman pharmacy. And I had already done the translation and commentary
2045880	2051000	for a master's thesis. That's usually what they give to doctoral students. I had done one for a
2051000	2055400	master's thesis and I was like, I'm not doing that again. So I'm going to write a text that's just
2055400	2063560	kind of a general Roman pharmacy text so that people can learn about drugs and the ancient world.
2063560	2069960	And the committee told me take out the chapter on recreational drugs or we're not going to give you
2070760	2076600	the degree. So you only had one chapter that was about recreational drugs?
2076600	2080360	Yeah. Yeah. The rest were all medicinal. Oh, wow. Yeah.
2080360	2084280	But didn't you say that they didn't distinguish between recreational and medicinal? Is that
2084280	2089240	right? No, that's exactly right. We were distinguishing. We do it now, but they didn't.
2089240	2094760	Yeah. Back then, things that you and I would call recreational, they didn't consider recreational.
2094760	2104280	They considered medicinal. Right. So curing depression is a medicinal process.
2104280	2110040	How long did you spend on this dissertation? Oh, couple of years.
2110040	2116920	Couple of years. Yeah. And then so there was one specific moment, a date where you had to go in
2117720	2125000	to, I guess, receive your judging on it or get graded on it or get a feedback on it. I have no
2125000	2128920	idea how this process works. You have to walk me through it. Yeah. So you write your dissertation
2128920	2134680	and you take it before your defense. Before your defense. Okay. Yeah. And your committee there is
2134680	2139480	a group of professors and usually there's one from outside the department just so the university
2139480	2148440	stays kind of impartial. You know what I mean? And so it's a committee of professors. Anyway,
2148440	2155240	you present your dissertation to them and then they tell you, you're terrible. They tell you,
2155240	2164280	you're terrible. Yeah. Or they pass you and you get to walk out and say, I have a doctoral degree.
2165240	2169160	So they told me at the end, they're supposed to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. They didn't
2169160	2177240	give me anything. And I was standing there looking around like, what? Right. And I met with the head
2177240	2183800	of the department and was told, you have to take out the chapter on recreational drugs
2184360	2188600	and you have to scrub any references to recreational drugs and the rest of the work.
2189560	2193880	And you're fine. Yeah. What was your response?
2194200	2202840	She said, the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing. This is the head of the department.
2203480	2209240	And by that time I had seen so much stuff the Romans were doing. I was like, oh my God,
2209240	2218680	I understand what's going on. They're building a ceiling that we can't get beyond. It doesn't exist.
2218680	2222360	We should be able to go right through that thing with these texts. We can do that.
2223320	2230280	Anyhow, so I took the material and I sent it to Macmillan. I just scrubbed it and then I sent it
2230280	2239080	to Macmillan and they accepted it. Thomas Dunn accepted it. And it was fantastic.
2239080	2245480	Macmillan is what? It was St. Martin's Press. Publishing company. Yeah, publishing company,
2245480	2251800	St. Martin's Press. And that's what became the book, the famous book that you created,
2251800	2259320	the Chemical Muse. Correct. Correct. And once you scrub, you decided to scrub the chapter from
2259320	2264840	your dissertation and any sort of reference to drugs whatsoever, and then they accepted it and
2264840	2271640	gave you your PhD. Any references to recreational drugs? Recreational. Because there are a whole
2271640	2278120	bunch of drugs all over it, right? For healing, right? I mean, drugs that you use in anesthesia.
2278120	2282600	Right, right, right, right. You know, what did they use? Yeah, fantastic.
2282600	2286600	What was the response after your book, The Chemical Muse, was published?
2289080	2296920	The Brentmore Classical Review came out, which is the big reviewer. And a European professor,
2298360	2306120	French, came out and said, this book is dangerous. He said it shouldn't be read
2306360	2311880	at any university, anytime, ever. And he was like, what year are we talking?
2312680	2327400	This was 2008. 2008. Okay. And so it was it was roundly ignored, you know,
2328120	2331480	put into the, the guy said, this guy obviously has a drug agenda.
2332440	2337640	I was like, no, let's just talk about the drugs because they don't read these texts. Now,
2338440	2345800	that same journalist has gone and talked to the aforementioned Brentmore Classical Reviewist.
2347160	2354360	And now they're writing a book about shamanism, all the same stuff, all the same material. It's
2354360	2359080	because they didn't know it. And it was the first one to sort of uncover the stuff and make it pop,
2359080	2365160	make it known. I was not the first. I would say I was the one who took it and it
2366680	2370600	took the big picture of it. I was the first one to bring the science side.
2370600	2373960	Who was the first one? Carl Rock. Carl Rock.
2373960	2378120	Yeah. No, because he said, look, he said they're using something in the Ellisonian Mysteries.
2379240	2385480	Right. He was already looking at, he didn't have any problem with the concept that he coined
2385560	2392920	entheogens, right? These are substances that are in theos that bring that divine being into you.
2394200	2398600	It's a whole class of drugs they were using, excuse me, they were using.
2400680	2404200	Have you ever had any conversations about Carl Rock with the stuff that you discovered and
2405240	2409720	the stuff you talk about in the Chemical Muse? Yeah, I've had the pleasure. Once the Chemical
2409720	2422600	Muse was published, they sent it to Dr. Rock for consideration. Because he's the only one
2422600	2429160	who had been on the list of people who had talked about drugs. And he got shamed. He got completely
2429160	2437640	shamed. Well, look, it seems like this idea and the idea of drugs being used back then
2438120	2442920	is becoming more and more accepted. I mean, you got people like Brian Merrescu and Graham Hancock.
2442920	2446680	You know, I think Brian's new book is called, or his latest book is the Immortality Key,
2446680	2453080	where he talks about the mystery cults of Elusis and the Ergot. I know Brian.
2454600	2456920	Oh, really? Yeah. How did you guys meet?
2458360	2463960	Professor Rock sent him to me to get the medical stuff.
2464200	2468600	So you guys spoke about when he was working on his book?
2468600	2473160	Yeah, we had a couple of interviews before when he came up with the idea.
2474920	2479480	Gave him a couple of interviews about what the sources are and what the extent of the stuff is.
2480280	2490680	He said, do you mind if I mention you and Joe Rogan? And I said, yes, go ahead and do that.
2490680	2496600	But if you do, you have to mention that Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park with a
2496600	2502360	boy at 4 a.m., screaming, I'm not a trafficker. You made sure you told him he needed to say that?
2502360	2505640	You had to say that exact phrase. So he didn't.
2509240	2517320	So he chose. So he chose. Yes. Right, right. Look, I mean, it was really interesting to me
2517320	2528600	reading your book, and I was really gripped by what you sort of uncovered, which it makes
2528600	2536280	a lot of sense when you really think about it, that life back then, life in antiquity was terrible.
2539080	2547000	And people didn't die from heart disease and from diabetes and from old age like they do today.
2547000	2555720	They died from hand to hand combat and plagues and famine. And to live back then was a miserable
2555720	2562920	existence for the most part. Infant mortality was what, like 50%. And they needed these drugs
2562920	2567640	just to get through the day. And the warriors fighting these wars, they needed to take these
2567640	2573960	drugs to suffer these insurmountable wounds they would have to suffer in battle.
2574040	2581160	Can you talk a little bit to that and to some of the details that you uncover in your book about
2581160	2587000	what life was like and how hard it was and the amount of death and plague and famine and how
2587000	2596600	these drugs were used to curb these sort of ailments? Yeah, yeah. The best way is to resurrect
2596600	2603880	the soul of Hippocrates and to look at the works that he wrote called The Epidemics in which he
2603880	2611080	describes all the diseases that people are getting, what they're suffering from, all the ailments. Oh,
2611080	2617160	my God, you know what herpes does when it goes untreated? No. Oh, Hippocrates has descriptions
2617160	2623560	of it. They call it herpes because their word herpeton is their word for a snake or something
2623640	2628760	that slithers, something that crawls because that's what herpes does when it goes untreated.
2628760	2636600	It crawls all over you. It rots you. Thank God, I don't know. You get descriptions of this kind
2636600	2644520	of stuff and you see life on a different level. One third of women were having death as a side
2644520	2651160	effect of birth. One third of women were dying from childbirth. Problems are bleeding. Right, right.
2651160	2655800	They're constantly trying to control bleeding and whatnot. Yeah, with drugs, with drugs.
2658280	2665720	Miserable. And about a third of the population of the youth from in the late teens, that's getting
2665720	2671880	eaten off. That's getting eaten off. They become soldiers and a certain number of those get
2671880	2680040	sacrificed. It's not a cheapness. They don't have it. There isn't a sense of futility
2680920	2686280	It's looked at as a sacrifice. And what point in history are we talking about?
2686280	2692840	Oh, God, far back is the Bronze Age, all the way down to about Byzantine. The Bronze Age is,
2692840	2698680	what, more than older than the 5th century? Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. In the best time,
2698680	2704520	the Bronze Age. It was a late Bronze Age, around 1200 to 1100. 1200 to 1100. Yeah, that's where
2704520	2709400	some of these oldest texts that you've read come from. Yeah, the Mycenaean linear beast
2709400	2717320	stuff comes from like 1600 BC, which is that spectacular. They've got Dionysus and all that
2717320	2726200	stuff. I worked with him, Bennett, who was a Navy cryptographer who studied crack linear B.
2726200	2737800	And in it, we have the name Dionysus. He's the son of Zeus, the Thunder.
2739560	2747240	And it was a gorgeous, gorgeous world to be able to follow that. But that's where the Greek
2747240	2755320	can take you. Sign up for courses now. Well, let me ask you this. This is sort of like broad strokes
2755400	2764040	questions. Yeah. What, how did your development, your understanding of these ancient texts and
2764040	2769960	reading this ancient Greek and even the Hebrew, everything that you've read, how did that change
2769960	2775560	your perspective on religion and Christianity and Catholicism? You were raised what, Christian or
2775560	2782040	Catholic? I love Jesus, man. I was, I don't know. What was your family? Baptist. Baptist. Okay, okay.
2782600	2791800	So once you start to understand the history and the texts, how did this change your worldview of
2791800	2802520	religion? And what sort of like misconceptions did you have that were shattered by this understanding?
2802520	2814040	I had a long-term relationship with a muse. So the whole time that I'm developing this educationally,
2816120	2818280	oh, look, I was just going to bring the Antichrist.
2819960	2824680	It's happening, guys. The Antichrist is coming, everybody. Tornado warning.
2825560	2836680	Don't bring him yet. Hold him off. Okay. Hold off Zeus. These texts that you're,
2838280	2844200	that you're reading and that you're translating, are these the original, original, original sources
2844200	2850520	of, of religion, of Christianity and Catholicism and baptism and all this stuff? Is this like
2850520	2858840	the originals? Yeah, this is the language that held that, all of those texts. So the New Testament's
2858840	2865240	all written in ancient Greek, right? The, what you call the Old Testament, I'm going to shock people
2865240	2871800	with this one, what you call the Old Testament, which people say is written in Hebrew, right,
2871800	2877880	which is not a language that I am work with. I had to take a little bit of modern Hebrew when I was
2877880	2887080	there just because it was part of the, you know, education. And, but the text that you think is
2887080	2893560	written in Hebrew is not. It's a Greek text that's written in the third century. It's a Hellenistic
2893560	2901480	text called, that you call the Torah or the Old Testament. That is not an original Hebrew text.
2901480	2907240	Now, how can I say that? What we have is the Septuagint that I'm talking about. It's the Greek
2908200	2915640	Old Testament. Do you understand Greek Old Testament? Okay. It's the oldest form that we've
2915640	2921240	got. Okay. Okay. The whole big deal about the Dead Sea Scrolls was they said, huh,
2921880	2926840	we finally have some Hebrew because none of it survives, right? Hebrew is only an eighth,
2927800	2934280	is only an eight thousand word, ancient Hebrew, eight thousand word, a unique word count language.
2934280	2940440	Okay. Which puts it in the realm of something you could expend by the end of your breakfast,
2941320	2945560	eight thousand words. That's not a lot. Okay. And the Dead Sea Scrolls were all in Hebrew?
2945560	2950280	The Dead Sea Scrolls were fragments in Hebrew and fragments in Greek and everybody assumed, oh,
2950920	2956520	this is the original in Hebrew, right? Because now we're following church history. You and I
2956520	2963480	live in a time in the stream, the time stream. We live at a time when we think that there was an
2963480	2971480	original Hebrew text of the Old Testament, but there wasn't. It doesn't exist, right? And to show
2971480	2978440	people the Greek, no, what's the proof? What's the proof? The proof is when you read the Septuagint,
2978440	2986040	that is the Greek Old Testament. It is, does not read as a translation. It reads as an original.
2986040	2991160	It uses Greek idiom. It's like a fingerprint on the language and it's got great. How can you tell
2991160	2996840	it reads? Greek fingerprints. How do you discern the difference, whether it be
2998200	3003720	an original or a translation? Oh, you can tell. It's easy to tell because colloquialisms don't
3003720	3010520	translate, right? And so it's like tagging it. So how do you, you're testing this language to see
3010520	3018040	if it's, to see what its age is. So you tag it with certain things and one of them is colloquialisms,
3018760	3025400	right? The other one is technical vocabulary. You cannot translate from a higher technical degree
3026280	3032760	to an, excuse me, you can't translate from a median technical degree to a high technical degree.
3032760	3039240	Okay. You can go down the slope. You can take something that's not technical, right?
3040520	3046440	And make it more technical, right? You can force that. You know, you can't drift upstream.
3046440	3053640	Right, right, right. So the original is going to have the highest degree of technicality.
3053640	3062600	Yes. So the Dead Sea Scrolls were not the highest degree of technical writing. They were lower.
3062600	3070120	They were lower than the Greek, what was the word? The book you're talking about.
3070120	3075080	They're Hebrew back translations because of the time the Dead Sea Scrolls,
3075080	3078440	they're Hebrew back translations. So they took the Greek.
3078440	3079640	Of what specifically?
3079640	3083400	They took the Greek and they said, how do we translate this into Greek?
3083400	3083720	Okay.
3083720	3087880	That's why you lose all the technical terms because they didn't have them in their language.
3089720	3099720	And what I'm asking is what was, God, that's crazy. This is the first podcast I can remember
3099720	3103800	where the lightning has been this crazy, this loud. So the Dead Sea Scrolls came from where?
3103800	3105240	What were the sources of the Dead Sea Scrolls?
3105240	3110920	So those caves in Qumran, right? They've dated these things to probably, I've heard
3110920	3115880	as early as 1st BC, but all the way up to 2nd on Odomany.
3116760	3122680	So somewhere in that range, somebody is taking the Greek text that we know is already established
3122680	3128600	because people are quoting it, right? We know, for example, they had the book of Enoch in Greek
3128680	3134680	because people are quoting it in Greek. So that's how you can track your library.
3134680	3138840	Where's your library at the time? That's how you track it, by the way.
3138840	3140440	Have you read the book of Enoch?
3140440	3143880	Yeah. I read the Giza fragments of it. I can see that much.
3145080	3148200	What do you think about all these people talking about Anunnaki aliens flying around
3148200	3149480	and building pyramids back in the day?
3151160	3152840	I think it's silly.
3152840	3153320	You do?
3156280	3156840	Damn it!
3159080	3163080	You know how many podcasts we've done with people who claim that they're experts on the Anunnaki?
3163080	3169480	Yeah, it seems to be a big area, but they were drug users, bro. What can you expect?
3169480	3180920	That's what they taught in the Giza text that says they taught the women the art of drugs.
3180920	3183480	So these weren't aliens, they were just drug users.
3183480	3184760	They were just drug addicts.
3184760	3186280	They were giants, bro.
3186280	3187160	They were giants?
3187160	3187480	Yeah.
3188280	3189000	Yeah.
3189000	3189880	Like real giants?
3189880	3190760	Gigantas.
3190760	3191800	Steve, are you crunching?
3192520	3193480	Oh, you can hear that.
3193480	3194360	Oh my god!
3194360	3196120	No, I liked it. I liked it.
3196120	3197960	This is the ASMR podcast.
3197960	3198600	Holy.
3198600	3199640	There's stimulus everywhere.
3202520	3205720	They taught them the drug craft. That's what the text says.
3206520	3209560	And you don't understand, man. They've got Medusa at the time.
3209560	3210040	You say, well...
3210040	3211880	Wait, wait, wait. Go back to giants.
3211880	3212120	Yeah.
3212680	3213720	What are you talking about giants?
3213720	3215720	That's the Greek word. Gigantas.
3216840	3219080	Giants meaning physically, they were huge people?
3219080	3219320	No.
3219880	3220200	Okay.
3221160	3222200	Right. No.
3222840	3228280	They had a superior knowledge of the drugs and they had a group of women who were called the Medusa.
3229320	3234200	And the Medusa could hit you with a drug on an arrow and paralyze you.
3234200	3235880	And then they would take you and do things to you.
3237080	3239960	And that's how a group of these women functioned.
3239960	3241640	That's how they hunted the hunted men.
3241640	3243000	You can imagine the society.
3243720	3245240	Women that hunted men.
3245240	3247720	Yeah, you have to kill three men in order to get married.
3250520	3251000	Yeah.
3251000	3252280	And they don't really marry you.
3252280	3253480	They just farm men.
3253480	3255800	And when is this? What time period was this?
3255800	3256840	This is Bronze Age.
3256840	3257640	Late Bronze Age.
3257640	3258360	Bronze Age.
3258360	3258840	Mm-hmm.
3258840	3259960	It's like 1200.
3259960	3261880	The peak at 1200 say BC.
3261880	3262600	1200.
3263400	3265960	This is when the great Queen Medea is around.
3266840	3267480	Yeah.
3267480	3268120	So back...
3268120	3270600	Okay. Okay. Well, this is great. I'm loving this.
3270600	3271960	Back to my original question.
3272120	3274520	How... Fundamentally, how did...
3274520	3278120	Did your understanding and learning all of this ancient Greek
3278840	3282440	change your understanding of how religion is preached today
3282440	3283720	and the story of the Bible?
3284680	3285960	It's a fairy tale.
3286920	3287880	It's a fairy tale.
3287880	3292120	The... What they teach now and do now is not even a...
3292920	3296280	hair's breadth of semblance to what they did originally.
3297640	3298200	Yeah.
3298200	3301000	You don't understand a mystery.
3302600	3305720	It's not a word that means a question or something you don't know.
3306600	3306920	Right?
3306920	3312120	The mystery is the performance that brings you through death back into life.
3313560	3317960	And once you've been initiated into that environment,
3318600	3326280	you're given keys, things to open up, a way to decode what's being said
3327080	3330280	so that you understand what's at the higher level.
3330280	3334040	Now, if you're like Jesus, you do that with 12 children.
3334920	3335960	People don't realize that.
3335960	3338040	The apostles are just children.
3338040	3339240	Pump the brakes. We'll get there.
3339240	3339640	Okay.
3341560	3342200	We're going to get there.
3342200	3342680	Don't worry.
3342680	3343080	Okay.
3343080	3343240	This...
3347000	3347720	That's so loud.
3348440	3350600	This is the best day of my life.
3350600	3351240	Is that really?
3353080	3354600	Thank you for allowing me to come here.
3354600	3355720	I was going to say you've had a terrible life.
3355720	3356600	This is the best day.
3357960	3359640	In Greece, in Athens.
3361240	3361960	Yeah.
3361960	3363080	In...
3363080	3365880	We're talking the Iron Age or the Bronze Age,
3365880	3371960	when they started to develop these mystery cults of Elusis.
3371960	3373960	Well, what time was this?
3373960	3375560	Yeah, this is late Bronze Age.
3376360	3377080	Late Bronze Age.
3377080	3377960	Late Bronze Age.
3377960	3378600	Uh-huh.
3378600	3383080	And a couple of generations before the Trojan War.
3383080	3385240	A couple of generations before the Trojan War.
3385240	3392200	And this is when they were experimenting with these drugs that would...
3394840	3399400	These psychotropic drugs like Urgot and other things.
3399400	3401640	What were some of the other drugs they were using back then?
3401640	3404120	They were using the ones that make you crazy.
3404120	3407800	So there's several classes and one of them are the death bringers.
3407800	3408920	That's what we talked about.
3409480	3412120	This episode of the podcast is brought to you by Verso.
3412120	3414600	Have you ever tried fasting or intermittent fasting?
3414600	3420680	If so, you may be aware of the sizzling energy and mental clarity that you get if you do it long enough.
3420680	3425480	The scientific data validating the health benefits from fasting for weight loss is overwhelming.
3425480	3428920	But what doesn't get talked about enough is the longevity benefits you get from fasting.
3428920	3434360	When you fast, your body turns on all its defense mechanisms to help your body hunker down to fight
3434360	3435640	off illness and disease.
3435640	3440040	But the problem is it takes three days of starving yourself to activate this process.
3440040	3443880	Scientists like Davidson Clare have recently discovered molecules to help your body
3443880	3446840	turn on this process without having to fast.
3446840	3450280	If you've ever heard this podcast before, you've heard me talk about Verso many times
3450280	3454440	and I've had world-renowned nutritional scientists like Dominic D'Agostino on the show
3454440	3459160	who is the guy who actually introduced me to Verso and I've been taking it every day for the last three years.
3459160	3463560	Cell being is always the first thing I take in the morning after dragging my carcass into the kitchen
3463560	3465000	which wakes me up and gives me energy.
3465000	3470200	I even use it for pre-workout and clean being is the product I use every night before bed.
3470200	3475000	After taking clean being for some time now, I've actually noticed a huge improvement in
3475000	3478840	not only my hormone regulation but my vision has improved.
3478840	3483160	I know it sounds insane but this stuff actually can improve your vision.
3483160	3489640	My lipid regulation has gotten better and another huge thing is all of a sudden I don't get affected
3489640	3491080	by all the pollen in the air.
3491080	3495560	I don't have any of these reactions and clean being has actually been scientifically proven
3495560	3496760	to alleviate these things.
3496760	3501400	Other clinical trials have proven healthier skin, less inflammation, healthier hair,
3501400	3505160	lipid regulation, enhanced cognitive function, and improved metabolism.
3505160	3509560	On top of that, Verso always publishes third-party testing on each batch produced

3536040	3539320	Now there is the ones that make you crazy and...
3539320	3540280	Permanently?
3540280	3541960	No, no, temporarily.
3541960	3546600	And they would have people cured, you know, quote-unquote cured because they've got antidotes.
3547240	3549640	We even have stories about people going out and he's like,
3549800	3553560	well, my daughters, they went off on their colt thing and they're still not coming down.
3554440	3555880	You know, what do we do?
3555880	3563160	And he has to go whip them up an antidote for them to stop being in the state of mania.
3563800	3570600	And it's things like hyosciamine, scopolamine, and atropine containing...
3570600	3574680	Who are schoolmoses, is the Greek word.
3574680	3581320	And it's these plants that contain the substances that, you know, they found them in hair,
3581960	3583800	painted on hair because they're offerings.
3585240	3586440	And what was the...
3586440	3590360	What did they gain by taking these drugs?
3590360	3591320	And what sort of...
3592840	3593640	What did they learn?
3593640	3595240	What sort of enlightenment did they achieve?
3595240	3600440	And what was the ends to the use of these drugs for them?
3600440	3601480	Yeah, yeah.
3601480	3602520	We have an...
3602520	3609720	Instead of me making something up, you could read the Mithraslergy in the Greek Magical Papyri
3609720	3615480	where it talks about what you'll see and how you should interact and what you have to do.
3615480	3617240	Oh, they had like a protocol.
3617240	3619640	Yeah, it's like a manual.
3620200	3620760	Wow.
3620760	3621480	Yeah, yeah.
3621480	3625720	And you got to have the right things to bring with you because you got to make the drugs,
3626600	3627000	right?
3627000	3631160	You get there and, first of all, you're going to be fasting for a certain number of days
3631880	3637080	and they put you through these repetitious songs, right?
3637080	3641960	And we have these in the PGM where you're setting the images in your head.
3641960	3644760	Remember, this is idolatry.
3644760	3649800	Adolon is the word for image, right?
3649800	3650280	Image.
3650280	3653000	And there's, you know, so when we're on our snake venom,
3653960	3656760	and you've got a concoction with a...
3656760	3658360	And they're using tons of snakes, though.
3658360	3660120	I've got an entire author for you, watch this.
3660760	3662360	Philuminus is his name.
3662360	3663160	Philuminus.
3663160	3666040	Philuminus with a pH on the front, you know.
3666840	3672280	He is a physician somewhere before the 4th century because they start quoting him in the 4th.
3673000	3677560	And he's a physician who talks about the venoms.
3677560	3679320	I've got a couple of slides of him.
3679400	3682760	He talks about the venoms that are used.
3682760	3683720	Some great stuff, by the way.
3683720	3688520	The snake venoms were used as mind-altering drugs or they were used as the antidotes?
3688520	3690040	They were used as medicines.
3690040	3691160	Medicines.
3691160	3692760	Right, right.
3692760	3695960	The Medusa really exist, right?
3695960	3696680	They're women.
3696680	3698360	They're a group of women.
3698360	3700040	These are Scythian tribes, by the way.
3700920	3701800	What do I mean by that?
3701800	3711720	Tribes that are... they were a horse culture, mobile, and they ravaged people.
3711720	3713880	That's how they got what they needed.
3713880	3716920	And the Medusa were the ones that you said they had to kill a certain amount of men
3716920	3717880	before they could get married?
3717880	3722920	It's the same tribes that are producing those, that specific group of women.
3722920	3726840	They have this cult thing where they apply the medicine to their hair.
3727640	3730360	They wear it in their hair and they use arrows.
3731000	3733960	And that poison can petrify you.
3735080	3738680	And they'll drag you off and they'll do things to you.
3738680	3740040	Like what, eat your brain?
3740040	3741240	No, no, no.
3741240	3742040	Sexy stuff.
3742040	3744280	They'll either mate or kill you.
3746120	3747480	Yeah, yeah.
3747480	3750200	It's a shame to have to end up a relationship.
3750200	3758760	That's weird that back then you would have to poison a man to have sex with him, right?
3758760	3761880	Like wouldn't a guy just want to have sex with some chick?
3761880	3763400	These are people being raided.
3764280	3766120	Imagine being raided.
3766120	3768440	I mean, it's hard to rape a man if you're a woman, right?
3769960	3773000	So you got to give them drugs to make them hard when you're
3773000	3775000	raping them because you're probably going to kill them too.
3778520	3783160	What effects did drug use have on the philosophy of Western society
3784760	3787240	and the democratic forms of governance?
3787560	3796680	Yeah, so it's a part of the fabric of pushing society toward inspiration,
3796680	3798280	looking for sources of inspiration.
3798280	3802120	All the earliest Greek temples are temples of the Muses.
3803240	3808200	So that written word connection is very, very important.
3809240	3810760	And bring magic.
3810760	3813560	People want to know what is magic, right?
3813560	3815240	Classically.
3815640	3816440	Classically.
3817240	3819720	And classically it's that controlled logos.
3820520	3821240	It's a control.
3821240	3822200	People think logos.
3822200	3823560	So that's a Greek word, right?
3823560	3826280	Oh, then seminarians get alongside it, you know what I mean?
3827080	3832600	And they don't really know it because seminarians don't read classical tags.
3833320	3837640	The logos is that reason, that reckoning, that reckoning.
3838520	3844680	So that's what, to me, that's what I studied so carefully.
3845560	3847880	That's why classes study ancient Greek.
3849160	3850200	Yeah, they do.
3850200	3851160	Who's Solon?
3851800	3852360	Solon.
3852360	3853240	He's a reformer.
3854280	3858920	He's a rich reformer who basically turns and gives power back to the people.
3858920	3863160	He was advised by, oh, this guy on crack, he carried it around.
3864040	3868360	He carried it around in the hoof of something.
3868920	3873240	And it was a plant that he ground up and snorted all the time.
3874200	3875640	He advised Solon.
3876280	3881720	And Solon's reforms ultimately become what you and I know as democracy.
3883240	3889800	What is the proper definition of democracy and antiquity compared to our democracy today?
3890360	3892840	Yeah, it's the rule of the people if you want.
3892840	3893960	It's the rule of the people.
3893960	3896360	The Deimos is just the neighborhood.
3897080	3899080	Athens is divided up into deems.
3900120	3900600	Right.
3900600	3901080	The hood.
3902040	3904040	You get a neighborhood speak.
3905000	3906920	That's what democracy is.
3906920	3908600	It's a neighborhood speak.
3908600	3910920	And it's direct representation too.
3910920	3915640	And they've got all sorts of reforms like, look, you cannot take any money
3917240	3921480	while you are a, you know, part of the boulet, part of the council.
3921480	3924920	You can't take any money and you have to have terms and everything.
3925720	3927560	It's what inspired Jefferson.
3927560	3934280	Part of your book says that there was 300,000 people in Athens, right?
3934280	3937560	Is that, and then 10% of them were part of these councils.
3938360	3939480	That sounds right.
3939480	3944280	There was like 30,000 of them were part of these councils that made the rules and made the laws.
3944280	3945240	And, right.
3945240	3949640	And they have a couple of assemblies, boulet and ecclesia.
3950920	3951320	Yeah.
3951320	3953400	Which becomes our word for church.
3953400	3960120	Well, I love the way that your book described the differences between our
3961400	3967000	democratic republic that we have in America compared to their version of democracy.
3967560	3974840	And you had all these people that would have to debate all these ideas and rules and laws and
3974840	3976280	punishment for crimes.
3977320	3981160	And I think you said that people only were able to do this for one year at a time.
3981160	3983160	They had like one year terms or whatever.
3983720	3985480	It was different at different times, but.
3985480	3986280	Right.
3986280	3986680	Right.
3986680	3990040	And what we have now is so far away from that.
3991000	3992680	Very, very far away from that.
3992680	3995720	Well, we don't also run out juries with 300 people either.
3997960	4002920	Can you imagine that just big crowd of people from the polis doing the city thing?
4003800	4006920	They're being, they're exercising their politea.
4007480	4009480	That's where we get our word politics, right?
4009480	4011240	It's the functioning of the city.
4011240	4022280	And they were vehemently against people who could gain any sort of benefit in this system
4022280	4029160	or make any sort of money or any sort of economic gain from this system to corrupt it.
4029160	4037960	Like it was the, it was like their version of democracy was essentially to protect humanity
4037960	4039080	from itself.
4039080	4040360	Yeah, exactly.
4040440	4041320	Put the brakes.
4041320	4044360	It was the ultimate check and balance.
4045320	4046040	Definitely.
4046040	4049960	And it's what inspired our democracy, the thing we call democracy.
4050840	4051400	Yeah.
4051400	4053080	But our democracy is so much different.
4053080	4057640	I mean, it's, if you look at all the people that are in the government and have been in
4057640	4061880	the government making decisions and making millions of dollars for so long, they're just,
4061880	4063480	it is run by tyrants.
4063480	4063960	Yes.
4063960	4065560	That's how you know the Greeks said.
4066120	4071800	They said whoever is profiting, wants you profiting and you cannot have the running
4071800	4074760	of the state with somebody profiting from it.
4074760	4076840	Because when you do, it becomes corrupt.
4078040	4083080	They knew that you have to keep that government sacred.
4083800	4084920	You have to keep it sacred.
4084920	4085400	Right.
4085400	4085720	Yeah.
4086680	4093640	And so long was one of the originals responsible for the creation of democracy?
4093640	4099240	Well, yeah, things that led to ultimately what you and I would say, voila, democracy.
4099240	4101160	And how long did this last?
4103400	4109400	You could argue that this is a process that doesn't start and end.
4110040	4114120	But it's a process that cycles throughout time.
4115160	4119240	And the deity, this is where it gets cool.
4120120	4127240	The deity that we put on the hill is that warrior, that warrior girl.
4129560	4132840	Yeah, we put a warrior girl on the hill and you know what she does?
4133800	4137960	She nourishes the serpent king.
4140840	4141640	Isn't that funny?
4141640	4143080	She gives him her hyma.
4143720	4144680	What does this mean?
4144680	4145400	Her blood.
4148520	4149800	Drink my blood.
4151160	4154680	Yeah, they're using blood as a medicinal.
4156280	4158040	Yeah, the Virgin Queen.
4158760	4162840	She's the one who raises that serpent king.
4164680	4165720	Yeah, no, they've got them.
4165720	4170200	You can go to Athens today, go to the top of the, look for the Erechtheum on the top of the
4170760	4172360	place and be like, where is it?
4172360	4173720	Where's the serpent king?
4174280	4175320	Who is the serpent king?
4175320	4177240	Stephen, can you find this guy?
4177240	4179000	He's, look for Erechthonias.
4179800	4180680	Erechthonias?
4180680	4181160	Yeah.
4181160	4182040	Erechthonias.
4182040	4183960	He's from the ground, baby.
4186520	4189400	When Jesus is on the cross and he's like, I am thirsty.
4191960	4192280	All right.
4194040	4195880	That's what Jesus said when he was on the cross?
4195880	4196120	Yeah.
4197080	4198040	Is this in the Bible?
4198040	4198760	Yeah.
4198760	4199320	Oh, really?
4199320	4200200	Yeah.
4200200	4202200	Why would I make this up?
4202200	4203320	Well, I'm not saying you're making it up.
4203320	4208440	I'm just trying to distinguish the difference between what's in the Bible and what's in the text.
4208440	4211960	And I assume that they're drastically different, right?
4211960	4214840	No, I will give you the hardcore evidence.
4214840	4215480	What is the difference?
4215480	4216360	It's just the text.
4216360	4216680	What is it?
4216680	4218120	I'm just going to bring you a Greek text.
4218120	4221000	And this is from the biblical Greek text.
4221640	4228680	My question is, what is the, how big of a gap is there between the original texts and the Bible people read today?
4229640	4230760	Okay.
4230760	4236040	So these are the texts that are ultimately assembled into what you call the Bible.
4237000	4238600	Those are the same thing, right?
4238600	4239560	This is the Greek.
4239560	4246440	So there's only some pieces, like there's a huge load of ancient Greek texts and only
4247640	4250200	certain pieces are cherry picked for the Bible.
4251240	4251880	Oh, yeah.
4251880	4252760	I see what you mean.
4252760	4256680	What's the common thread that's uniting all of these things together?
4257240	4260600	It's the cults, man, and the operation of the cults.
4260600	4263240	They're driving the literature at the time.
4264040	4266520	You know, they've got a hostage and they're bringing it in.
4266520	4268360	And you can get that from the read.
4268360	4271640	All you got to do is bring up those cults and their activities.
4272200	4275480	The stuff the early Christians were doing, they're collecting blood.
4276120	4280600	And this is from their own insiders who are telling us this.
4280600	4282520	Eustatius tells us this.
4283080	4284760	And he says, oh my God.
4284760	4286840	He says, look what they're doing in these ceremonies.
4286840	4291080	And he goes on to describe it and I've described it in detail.
4292200	4293480	But they collect the blood.
4293480	4294440	Who is this guy?
4294440	4295720	The fetal blood.
4295720	4297080	Who's Eric Thonius?
4297880	4300840	This king, this king of this serpent king.
4300840	4302680	Can you pull up a description of him, Steve?
4302680	4306200	I need Wikipedia's description to give me the truth.
4306200	4308600	So I know I'm going to keep on in the check.
4308600	4312280	Eric Thonius in Greek mythology, King Eric Thonius was a legendary
4312280	4315320	early ruler of ancient Athens, according to some myths.
4315320	4319800	He was Autothan, one of the so.
4319800	4320840	Autothanus.
4320840	4321800	Autothanus.
4324040	4324680	Exactly.
4325320	4328760	And what happens is Hephaestus comes along and he's like, wow.
4328760	4332040	Look at the beauty of what we've made.
4332040	4334360	He was adopted and raised by Athena.
4334360	4336280	With this virgin Athena.
4337080	4341000	Her name is Athana in Dorian.
4341080	4342280	So how did we get, okay.
4342280	4345640	So explain to people listening how we got to Eric Thonius
4346280	4348120	from Solon, creating democracy.
4348680	4349720	It's that line.
4350520	4353480	It's the drug using mystery that drives everything.
4354600	4359080	Cicero says his life was begun again.
4359960	4361320	He was reborn.
4361320	4362440	What happened?
4362440	4365400	He went to the great resurrection.
4365400	4368200	So these guys, these guys, these guys were taking drug
4368200	4372920	and having some great transcendental experience, right?
4372920	4378200	And they were similar to people when they take crazy psychedelic trips today, right?
4378200	4382920	They call it the ego death and they, or they do ayahuasca ceremonies.
4382920	4384680	This is what's happening to people back then.
4384680	4385960	Is that what you were kind of describing?
4385960	4386760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4386760	4387160	Okay.
4387160	4387720	Yeah.
4387720	4389800	And it's a death to life.
4389800	4393160	I think it's, it's a death to life experience.
4393160	4396440	It's a rebirth or what they described anyway is a rebirth.
4397400	4398920	And yeah, that makes sense.
4398920	4399320	Yeah.
4399320	4401880	They put you, the drug concoction is incredible.
4401880	4403640	We have it in Nero's library.
4404440	4405240	We have it.
4405240	4407960	We have the exact concoction that they use.
4407960	4409640	Has anybody ever tried to recreate it?
4410360	4412360	I've tried to get people to do so.
4413800	4415560	Have you asked Hamilton to try to recreate it?
4415560	4417080	He said, give me the formula.
4417080	4417720	So I did.
4419320	4420120	And he's got it.
4421160	4421640	Could he?
4422600	4425640	It's got a lot of stuff in it that I don't know if you know,
4425640	4427640	he could actually produce.
4427640	4428440	Right.
4428440	4431640	It's got several, it's got like seven snake venoms.
4431640	4433000	Seven different snake venoms.
4433000	4433480	Yeah.
4433480	4434840	You can put it up your butt.
4435880	4436360	Oh my.
4437240	4439800	Is that how they, is that how they typically get it back in the day?
4439800	4440920	Like a suppository?
4440920	4441400	Yeah.
4441400	4445000	We've got a description of a guy who, his priestess,
4445880	4450360	she's spanking him with some stinging needles, right?
4450360	4451560	On his genitalia.
4452280	4456360	And she's putting, inserting that into his, you know,
4456360	4459320	it's a rectal drug administration.
4460040	4462600	And we have a text that describes it.
4463160	4464520	It's called a satiricon.
4465240	4469240	Satirion was the word they used in Latin.
4469240	4471320	It's from Greek, broad from Greek.
4472360	4475400	That is the drug that causes you to have propism.
4477000	4477400	Right.
4477400	4478360	What is propism?
4478360	4480360	Propism is constipation.
4481080	4481720	Okay.
4481720	4482520	Okay.
4482520	4484600	And this is what the Medusa use on their victims?
4484600	4485320	Too late.
4485320	4486760	Is it too late for that?
4486760	4487560	Are they too early?
4487560	4489160	Can we talk about that now?
4489160	4490360	It's probably, it's still too early.
4490360	4491560	Yeah, we've still got more stuff to cover.
4491560	4492600	Okay, stay tuned.
4492600	4492920	Yeah.
4492920	4495160	We're going to go really deep into all of the
4496280	4499000	really crazy stuff here in a little bit.
4499000	4500680	We're going to cut off and go to Patreon.
4500680	4503560	But I want to lay a solid foundation for
4505160	4506840	your work and your research before we go there.
4507080	4511800	So back to ancient Greece.
4511800	4516280	Democracy is formed by Solon and Aristotle and Plato.
4516280	4517400	Where do they come into the picture?
4518200	4519960	They're a couple of smarties.
4519960	4520760	Couple of smarties.
4520760	4521240	Yeah.
4521240	4522200	And who else was there?
4522200	4523000	Pythagoras.
4523000	4523400	Yeah.
4523400	4526040	He's a little bit earlier in his, he's founding.
4526040	4527400	He's the one who said, by the way,
4528440	4529880	they came to him and asked him,
4529880	4531480	they're going to send out a colony
4531480	4533400	and the Oracle had given a go ahead.
4533400	4534920	And you have to understand this is late
4535560	4539640	coming from late Bronze Age, governmental tech,
4540600	4543320	where you have oracles that rule,
4543320	4545320	that tell you who can go to war with who,
4546520	4549080	you know, which tyrant needs to be executed.
4550040	4550520	Right.
4550520	4553800	If you, if you send an embassy out and they ask the Oracle
4553800	4555000	and she says, execute him.
4556120	4556920	Right.
4556920	4558200	What about this leader we got?
4558200	4559480	And she's executed.
4560120	4560920	That's it.
4560920	4561480	He's dead.
4562360	4563800	What is so special about this Oracle?
4564760	4567080	There's, they start with these drugs.
4567880	4570520	They use the drugs that those Scythian tribes
4570520	4572280	are using up on the Black Sea.
4573880	4577400	And they're causing this transformation
4577400	4580440	that they describe as adamantine freedom.
4581400	4584760	So freedom that is not corruptible.
4586760	4587320	Right.
4587320	4588760	It's a form of government.
4588760	4592760	That's why they call them the Medusae from Medwa.
4592760	4595000	It's an old Mycenaean concept.
4596680	4597480	Yeah.
4597480	4597960	Yeah.
4597960	4598440	Anywho.
4599960	4603080	We were talking briefly earlier about the Dead Sea Scrolls
4604120	4607400	and you said the Dead Sea Scrolls were part of them were written
4607400	4610440	in Hebrew and they were back translated from earlier Greek.
4610440	4610920	Right.
4610920	4611240	Yeah.
4611240	4613320	Now none of them were originally written in Hebrew.
4613320	4614840	They're all originally written in Greek.
4614840	4617080	That's why they had complete Greek texts with them.
4618120	4619320	Greek was the first.
4619320	4621560	There was no, there was no Hebrew spoken
4622120	4622760	at the time.
4622760	4625480	Hebrew had become a liturgical language.
4626200	4626440	Right.
4626440	4629560	By the, by the second century BC.
4630600	4631720	What, why Greek?
4631720	4639480	I stood, I stood in a synagogue in Israel, second century.
4639480	4640680	And you know what was written?
4641720	4642920	There was nothing in Hebrew.
4642920	4643960	It was all Greek.
4643960	4644280	Really?
4644280	4645320	And people are, yeah.
4645320	4647080	No, you can look, check me on it.
4647080	4647320	Right.
4647320	4648040	They all are.
4649000	4650600	They all have Zodiacs.
4653400	4653800	Right?
4653800	4654440	Wow.
4654440	4654920	Yeah.
4654920	4656040	Isn't that something?
4656040	4656520	Yeah.
4656520	4658280	That's all reflected in the language.
4658280	4659400	It's like a fingerprint, man.
4659400	4660360	You can track this stuff.
4660920	4664520	The Old Testament, if I say anything today, the Old Testament
4665080	4670120	is a work of the third century and it's originally in Greek.
4670760	4671160	Yeah.
4671160	4677000	The name Eve is the shout that a bockin makes.
4677720	4680760	Eve is the shout that a bockin.
4680760	4681400	Bockin.
4681400	4682120	What's a bockin?
4682760	4686040	It's a woman under the influence of some pretty powerful drugs who's.
4687640	4689160	Everything is about drugs.
4689960	4691720	There's nothing that's not about drugs.
4694040	4697320	Is there anything, is there anything in history that has nothing to do with drugs
4697320	4698520	or is it all drugs?
4698520	4699720	Yeah, but it was boring.
4702600	4705160	You just refuse to acknowledge it if it's not about drugs.
4705160	4706200	That's what I'm taking from this.
4707400	4707960	Is that right?
4708840	4709480	No, no.
4709480	4711240	It's just so many drugs.
4712040	4712440	Yeah.
4712440	4720280	No, I mean, the bockinalia rise, the ecstasy, the place we get the concept ecstasy
4721000	4727160	is from the state that one of these women would be in and they could murder you
4727160	4728840	and it was totally frigging legal.
4730440	4733160	And that was one of the things that they like to do.
4733160	4734840	You know why you get a blood thirst.
4737240	4738680	Does that bother you?
4738680	4739720	You get a blood thirst.
4739720	4744760	Yeah, because when you carry around these baskets, we have these represented full of
4744760	4747640	snakes and snakes and dicks.
4748440	4752920	Do you ever just like find like when you're looking through these texts, do you ever like
4754520	4758040	like maybe I'm not looking at this from a neutral perspective?
4758040	4764440	Like maybe I got somehow corrupted at some point and I'm only looking for the stuff that's
4764440	4768360	going to fly in the face of academia because they me over when I was doing my dissertation.
4769320	4769560	No.
4770520	4773640	Now what drags me in is the Christ.
4774840	4776760	I'm still looking for Jesus.
4777320	4779320	That's your that's the one thing.
4779960	4783720	That term Christ is a pharmaceutical term.
4785480	4792840	Is it possible that the texts that you've read that tell you some of these things
4793560	4798200	can be translated in different ways or seen from different perspectives?
4798200	4803640	Or is what you're saying that these texts say is that is that objective fact?
4804200	4809160	Yeah, I'm all about sources and you have to be genuine to your source.
4809880	4814840	So when I say something, I know it sounds outrageous, but there's a source that does
4814840	4816120	exactly what I just said.
4816120	4821640	That's all I'm supposed to do as a journalist is report to you the sources.
4822440	4824360	And let me give you an example.
4825320	4828760	There's a guy named known us and known us.
4829800	4835080	He writes a paraphrase of John, the Gospel of John.
4836360	4836760	Okay.
4837400	4846760	And in it, known us talks about like Mary's alabaster and that whole sexy event.
4847960	4848760	Mary's what?
4848760	4849880	Alabaster.
4849880	4850520	What does that mean?
4851000	4853880	Oh, it's an oil containing device.
4854440	4857720	It's a, yeah, yeah.
4857720	4860440	There's older forms of them that are bigger.
4861560	4866520	Aristophanes makes fun of it on the stage in the list.
4866520	4872200	Aristophanes was an ancient, he was a playwright, comedian, like an ancient comedian.
4872200	4873480	The father of comedy.
4873480	4875480	They were like, father, come on, man.
4875480	4876760	This is Aristophanes.
4876760	4879640	He's the one, they march out on stage, you know, bigger.
4880120	4882120	The last chapter of your book was all about him.
4883080	4888680	It was, it was fascinating hearing that, you know, back then they were able to make fun of,
4888680	4893320	you know, the top elite part of the society and the people in government.
4893320	4897160	And he made fun of Socrates, ripped Socrates, right?
4897160	4899800	Yeah, it's the stage is a religious place.
4900520	4903480	The stage in antiquity was not for entertainment.
4903480	4905720	Nobody's getting rich off of it.
4906440	4909080	What we're doing is we're purifying the people.
4910280	4912280	Yeah.
4912280	4914520	And so they needed that, they needed that humor.
4914520	4918520	The Romans carried the same thing to their credit, those hot dwelling Romans.
4919240	4922520	To their credit, they did bring this protection as well.
4922520	4927560	And you see it on their imperial side, when you've got a whole bunch of people surrounded,
4928120	4932840	Julius Caesar yelling at them, things like, are you sleeping with the king?
4933560	4936520	You know, stuff like that, because he was visiting someplace.
4937480	4944840	They're trying to ward off the, the maleficio, the magic that's bad, the bad making.
4945880	4952680	Do you ever, like when you're reading these texts, how do you know what could,
4953240	4954520	how do you know what you're reading?
4954520	4959240	Isn't sort of like an ancient, because I'm sure people in the ancient times, they,
4959240	4965880	when they're writing, everybody, whether you're a journalist or whatever it is,
4966520	4968520	everybody has an axe to grind, right?
4969960	4977480	And how do you know, like what you're reading, isn't sort of like a tabloid or a,
4977480	4983880	or a hit piece, for lack of a better term, that is skewing the,
4984840	4987160	the optics of what was really happening.
4987160	4992840	Yeah. I told, what you're talking about is getting through a dark cave, essentially.
4992840	4993080	Yeah.
4993800	4997720	There's a line on the wall and with a rope on it.
4997720	5000280	And you can follow from one of the caves to the other.
5000280	5001800	That's how we get through back and,
5002760	5005160	back and forward through the cave.
5005960	5011880	Yeah. And in that, in this case, it's the pharmacology, the science.
5011880	5013880	It's not just the pharmacology, it's the science.
5015800	5020600	That's really what, if you follow the scientific development of people
5020600	5025000	and watch that over time, you can, you can notice trends.
5025000	5030120	Like what's popular when they're reaching a pinnacle and the Greeks can now express calculus
5032360	5035000	with words, right?
5035720	5039000	That's, you know, that's quite a, quite an advancement.
5039000	5040920	Can you express calculus with words?
5040920	5041960	No, I can't even do it.
5041960	5045240	Yeah. No, forget that. Physics too, physics too, man.
5045240	5045640	Right.
5045640	5047480	No, no.
5048440	5051160	Um, but yeah, I don't want to rattle on.
5051160	5056280	What, what do you want to, you want to ask another question?
5056280	5056520	Yeah.
5057800	5060760	Yeah. I have, I have, I have an endless amount of questions.
5060760	5067000	Um, are you familiar with, um, the guy John Marco Allegro,
5067000	5069640	who spent all of his life deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls,
5070760	5072680	and he wrote The Sacred Mushroom in the Cross?
5073640	5078680	One of the reasons Carl Rock has anything to do with me
5079720	5084440	is because I have no interest. I have no interest in any of that.
5085560	5089240	And you think that, isn't that insulting to Carl Rock?
5089240	5091240	It seems right in line with what you're doing though.
5091240	5094920	No, well it does, but I have no interest in it because it attracts.
5094920	5099160	I'm sorry. Can I, Danny, I'm going to be completely honest with you.
5099160	5102360	Um, there's a lot of hokum.
5104360	5108200	Yeah. There's a lot of hokum. We only have the sources.
5108200	5110360	That's what I'm saying. This is so hard to navigate.
5110360	5112520	What's good? What, what's bullshit? What's real?
5112520	5113880	Go to the primary sources.
5113880	5115800	Yeah, but that's easy to, that's easy for you to say.
5115800	5119160	Yes. Enroll in my class today. Right?
5119960	5123080	Yeah. That's exactly the point of why you need classicists.
5123080	5127640	That's why Thomas Jefferson was trying to recreate democracy.
5127640	5132280	Right? No establishment of any laws for religion.
5133320	5138280	Right? Purifying. He purified the stream, made another democracy.
5138280	5141560	And wait, and he's the one who said, I'm sorry, it's you.
5142280	5143960	It's your show. I didn't mean to say wait.
5143960	5146280	No, no, no, no, it's not ready. Go ahead.
5146280	5149160	He said every 150 years you're going to get somebody who tries to
5149160	5151160	insurrect and overthrow the government.
5151160	5152360	Everyone 150 years?
5152360	5154280	Yeah. 100, he said 100, 250.
5154920	5157880	And he said when they do, you have to take the tyrants.
5158520	5159960	And you have to shed their blood.
5160680	5163720	Anybody who tries to overthrow the government, you have to shed their blood
5163720	5167000	and the blood of their lieutenants on the tree of liberty.
5168360	5168920	Isn't that interesting?
5168920	5170280	What's the tree of liberty?
5170280	5171000	Oh, God.
5171000	5173160	That's just a symbolic term.
5173160	5174040	It's the state.
5174920	5176840	Yeah, it's the race publica.
5178040	5179480	It's the republic, baby.
5180440	5183880	You got to save the republic by sacrificing the tyrant.
5184920	5187000	That's an ancient Greek idea.
5187000	5190200	Back when they had tyrants too who were women who could take you captive,
5190760	5195160	they could drug you and they could cut your death off and they would sell you.
5196760	5199400	You know, trafficking women, isn't that something?
5200680	5201160	Yeah.
5201160	5202440	How do you make eunuchs?
5203240	5205320	How do you make eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven?
5206600	5210600	So that's what kind of pulled me out of the Christianity.
5210600	5212600	We're seeing a lot of the stuff that's actually there.
5215080	5220840	Seeing some of the depictions of the darker side with the human trafficking and stuff like
5220840	5222040	that and the trafficking.
5222040	5223960	I would say the reality, right?
5223960	5224840	It's history.
5224840	5226520	You want to know the truth.
5226520	5227880	History means inquiry.
5227880	5228840	People don't.
5228840	5232680	You think it meant like a set of events if you were a historian, right?
5232680	5236200	I can't stand historians unless they can do the original languages.
5236200	5237320	And most of them can't.
5237320	5243320	Classical historians don't do the side that is the philology.
5243320	5246920	So why don't you take John Marco Allegro seriously?
5247800	5250280	Because I want nothing to do with any controversy.
5250280	5251800	It's hooko.
5251800	5253960	You don't want anything to do with controversy?
5258200	5259800	I'm a purist, right?
5259800	5261240	I just want those sources.
5261240	5262600	Why do you think he's controversial?
5262600	5266040	The sources keep getting me fired and I just want the sources out there.
5266040	5267880	And he didn't read the sources?
5267880	5268600	No, no.
5268600	5269960	It's just it has to do with...
5269960	5272920	He spent it because he was reading the Dead Sea Scrolls.
5272920	5275480	Right, and he based everything that he was talking about, the Dead Sea Scrolls.
5275480	5276440	Yeah, which I don't...
5276440	5277640	So to you, it's irrelevant.
5277640	5278680	It is totally irrelevant.
5279400	5284520	Was there any evidence of using psychedelic mushrooms in antiquity?
5284520	5285240	Yeah.
5285240	5291080	I used to send Carl Ruck references every time I came across.
5291800	5295800	I was going through these formulae, these ancient formulae,
5295800	5298840	and every time I would come across the mushrooms, I sent it to him.
5298840	5301960	And I did that because I just wanted to pound him and say,
5301960	5305080	look, you were right, you were right, you were right,
5305080	5308520	because people shunned him, they blacklisted him.
5308520	5308760	Right.
5309640	5310040	You know?
5311160	5313240	Yeah, and it's not right.
5313240	5318680	He was there bringing the knowledge of the use of drugs in antiquity.
5318680	5319720	Right, yeah.
5319720	5328840	What is so superior about Greek compared to Hebrew or any of these other...
5328840	5329480	Aramaic?
5329480	5329880	When was...
5329880	5330520	When did Aramaic...
5330520	5332120	Oh, God, who cares?
5332120	5332600	Who cares?
5335160	5337400	I cannot think of a less relevant...
5337960	5342040	Look, in the libraries that we have from the ancient world,
5342840	5347800	okay, if you just look at the libraries, remember, look at the peaks.
5347800	5349080	What libraries are you talking about?
5349080	5351080	It's always on the big libraries.
5351080	5352600	Alexandria, right?
5353160	5354120	Look at what's in those.
5354120	5356120	Now, we don't have anything.
5356120	5358760	We do have one that just opened up in Herculaneum.
5358760	5361000	And they just scanned it.
5361800	5364200	And the first word they scanned was purple.
5365320	5365800	Oh, yeah.
5366600	5367720	Porfura.
5367720	5369240	Purple was the first word.
5369240	5375320	Yes, it's one of my words that I brought to you in my little presentation.
5375880	5384760	So, again, to you, what makes Greek so superior to any of these other languages or linguistics?
5384760	5387320	It's able to convey and stretch.
5387320	5389480	It's able to build, essentially.
5389480	5390440	It's flexible.
5391400	5397880	So, imagine a system like half of English is based on Greek roots, right?
5397880	5400680	Imagine you've got words that are using...
5400680	5401640	Greek and Latin, right?
5403080	5406280	Some of it is Latin, but that's own...
5406280	5409800	Oh, God, I'm going to step in here.
5409800	5410680	But every...
5411480	5413240	Look, there's two types of classes.
5413480	5417720	Those who are Hellenists and those who study Latin.
5418680	5422760	And everybody knows what happens to the Hellenists.
5422760	5425080	They know it attracts the most intelligent people.
5425720	5431400	And over time, it turns their brains into mind-expanding...
5432440	5433320	This is the power.
5433320	5435800	You asked me what's so beautiful about Greek.
5436360	5438040	Greek is able to build...
5439080	5440280	Let me give you an example.
5441080	5444760	The word to kiss is phileo, right?
5444760	5446600	We get all our phil words from that.
5447240	5449400	Philosophies, the love of wisdom, right?
5450680	5452040	Phileo means to kiss.
5452040	5455800	So, if I were nice Roman, skirt-wear in Roman,
5455800	5458360	I may walk up to you when I met you and kiss you.
5459160	5461560	You know, do you mind if I kiss you?
5461560	5462600	That's phileo.
5464040	5465800	Then there's kata phileo.
5467320	5469080	Kata is an intensifier.
5470040	5472760	So, it takes it to the level of a...
5472760	5475160	You and I, French, I meet you.
5475720	5476440	Like making out?
5476440	5479000	Yeah, give you a nice big kiss.
5479000	5480040	Now, what about...
5481080	5485800	Is there a discern from one person just kissing
5485800	5487400	versus them kissing together?
5488200	5489800	Like, both kissing each other?
5489800	5491080	It changes...
5491080	5494680	No, it's the degree of amorousness that's involved.
5495560	5498200	Like the degree that Jesus had with Judas.
5498200	5499080	Right, right, right.
5499960	5502440	When he kissed Jesus.
5502440	5503160	We'll get there.
5503160	5503720	We'll get there.
5503720	5505000	I want to expand a little bit more.
5505000	5508360	I want you to talk a little bit more about Greek.
5508360	5508680	Fair.
5508680	5512600	The language and how far it expands compared to other languages
5512600	5516280	and how it expands just the human mind.
5517240	5518680	So, you have a set.
5518680	5521960	You have a set of prepositions that are used as prefixes.
5522520	5525320	And with those, you can build concepts.
5526280	5529000	And if you just look at the concepts alone,
5529000	5530920	those are basically...
5530920	5532760	When you're talking unique words,
5533480	5536520	that's like the capacity of your language.
5536520	5537640	Greek has between...
5538280	5541800	It's been estimated 250,000 to upward.
5541800	5546920	I've seen upward of 500,000 unique words.
5546920	5549240	Just to give you a way to compare it.
5549240	5553320	Ancient Hebrew has about 8,000, right?
5553400	5556040	So, it's unique word.
5556040	5560040	It can build its own vocabulary
5560040	5563080	so that you can create or coin terms.
5563080	5563480	You should...
5563480	5565800	Do you walk around coining terms?
5565800	5566040	No.
5566680	5567400	Okay.
5567400	5569960	There's the problem, right?
5569960	5575560	If you start and engage in this process of letting the Greek
5577240	5580920	pump your brain, you'll start coining words.
5580920	5586040	You'll open up a capacity to engineer around you.
5586040	5588440	It's a superiority of the language.
5589240	5590280	It's a power.
5590280	5591640	It's overwhelming.
5591640	5593720	And it overwhelmed antiquity.
5593720	5595960	Marcus Aurelius, the emperor,
5595960	5598360	who's on a ton of drugs, including opium.
5598360	5599960	So much opium that Galen says,
5599960	5603240	I can't stand this guy.
5603240	5606680	He keeps bothering me about his opium.
5606680	5608520	He just wants me to more and more.
5609240	5612760	You know, he's adjusting his medication up,
5612760	5614040	giving him a stronger dose.
5614920	5616200	Who developed the language?
5617640	5618760	You mean what people?
5618760	5620280	Like when did it first come about?
5620280	5624520	And how long did it take to expand to 250,000 to 500,000?
5624520	5624840	Yeah.
5625720	5628120	Let's take what modern scholars would say
5628120	5629720	and just throw that out the window.
5630760	5632200	What would modern scholars say?
5632200	5633560	Modern scholars did all sorts.
5633560	5635320	They'd hit and miss all over the place.
5635320	5636520	They'd guess all sorts of...
5636520	5638760	You could probably have a range of 3,000 years,
5638760	5639560	they wouldn't know.
5639560	5639880	Okay.
5640520	5642760	Where does Greek actually come from?
5642760	5646280	It's that old Indo-European bunkum, right?
5646280	5647640	That stuff's not accurate.
5647640	5651320	The Greeks, like, forget modern linguistics.
5651320	5651960	The Greeks...
5651960	5654840	What did the Greeks themselves say in their own text?
5655640	5659080	They said, we are the descendants of the Pulaski.
5660040	5664040	These are a group of the Marauding Calcolithic...
5667080	5668680	So this is 5,000 BC.
5669560	5673960	5,000 BC called the Pulaski, the carriers of the purple.
5676360	5677160	Yeah.
5677160	5678200	This is where Greek came from.
5678200	5683640	These are the antecedents of the Phoenicians,
5684680	5686440	those who carry the purple.
5686440	5687000	Okay.
5687000	5688120	What is the purple?
5688120	5688840	Way back...
5688840	5689560	Oh, God.
5689560	5691400	It's Murek squeezing.
5691400	5695240	I take a little snail out of the water and he's in a shell.
5695800	5698040	And I squeeze out this stuff and process it.
5698040	5699320	There's almost a processing.
5699880	5703400	And they turn it into a substance that we use in our religion.
5704840	5707240	In order to induce oisteromania.
5708920	5711640	You can tell the girls who develop it,
5711640	5714200	because their fingers are stained with the purple.
5715160	5719960	You can tell, because their lips are stained with the purple.
5722760	5723080	Yeah.
5724120	5724840	Yeah, it's...
5724840	5725880	Who knows what's in it?
5725880	5727800	I mean, I've heard people say, oh, is it DMT?
5727800	5729240	Is it blah, blah, blah?
5729240	5729640	Okay.
5729640	5730280	Whatever.
5730280	5730840	Who knows?
5730840	5731480	Who knows?
5731480	5732840	And who cares at this point?
5733640	5735880	When do these people stop using drugs?
5740280	5741240	What is this, Steve?
5741240	5745800	Herculaneum Scrolls, a 20-year-old journey to read the Unreadable.
5745800	5747960	Yeah, this is what Hillman was talking about.
5749960	5750360	This is...
5752520	5755320	The Herculaneum is that city that was destroyed.
5755880	5757560	It was a sister city to Pompeii.
5757560	5760760	And it has a lot of preserved scrolls in it.
5760760	5765080	And so if you can unwrap these crusted little scrolls,
5765080	5765960	you can read them.
5766840	5770040	And there's one kid that did with AI.
5770040	5770920	He used an AI.
5771640	5772920	To help him out.
5772920	5775480	But yeah, like what Hillman said, it said purple.
5776440	5777400	One of them did.
5777400	5781320	It was the first word that they could visibly read.
5781320	5784520	This library, they suspect, is...
5784520	5785480	I don't know, they waffle.
5785480	5787240	So I don't know, that's for the archaeologists.
5787240	5788600	They got to figure that out.
5788600	5794120	But they say it's probably the Julian Library from the Gens Julia.
5794680	5797720	So the Gens of Caesar himself, right?
5798040	5801560	And it's destroyed in 79.
5802520	5806360	So it's going to have, I can promise you, inside of this thing.
5806360	5809640	I've already talked to the professor who did the scans.
5809640	5810280	Oh really?
5810280	5811080	Yeah, yeah.
5811080	5813800	He's at Kentucky Seals.
5813800	5815800	And he's a nice guy, really nice guy.
5815800	5818120	And he said, no, this is all going to be made public.
5819640	5820520	Public access.
5821160	5823880	So I've already got a team of people.
5823880	5826840	Shout out to the followers of Lady Babylon.
5827720	5830920	Who are ready to transcribe and translate.
5831960	5834120	I guarantee you, I promise you.
5834120	5836760	How close do you think AI is a translating Greek?
5836760	5838520	And how accurate do you think it could possibly get?
5838520	5842680	I just had a conversation with Dr. Ruck about that, just a short one.
5843720	5846680	And it's going to happen, yeah.
5849160	5853640	Even if they feed it, the lexicon, it depends on what they feed her.
5854200	5856360	But I like Mary nourished in the temple.
5856360	5859080	Did you know Mary was being fed by angels?
5859080	5859800	No.
5859800	5860200	Yeah.
5860200	5864360	She's got purple fingers in the apocryphal text.
5865240	5865640	Yeah.
5865640	5866760	She's got purple fingers.
5866760	5867400	Wow.
5867400	5868520	She's feeding from-
5868520	5869800	So Mary was doing drugs.
5869800	5870920	From the angels.
5872520	5872840	Yeah.
5873720	5876040	That's when they auctioned her off at 12.
5878360	5879640	A lot of this.
5879640	5881480	Can we go here yet or no?
5881480	5883160	How far into the podcast are we?
5883160	5886120	We're at, I would say, 145.
5886680	5887960	We can start to delve in.
5888840	5891320	There's got to be a point where we're going to cut it for Patreon.
5891320	5893400	But let's keep going and then-
5893400	5894200	Should we go?
5894200	5894760	Yeah.
5894760	5896440	I'll mute some stuff if we have to.
5896440	5899880	And then if it's getting too deep, then we'll just jump to the Patreon.
5900440	5900680	So-
5901880	5902920	Deep breath.
5902920	5906040	I'm going to sound like a complete idiot when I'm trying to ask you this question.
5906040	5909240	But to the best of my knowledge, at some point,
5910040	5924040	the Romans tried to get rid of all these texts and get rid of all of the links to drugs, right?
5924600	5927160	And they tried to rewrite history.
5928600	5931720	The Romans, I wouldn't call those people Romans.
5931720	5933160	I would say the Christians.
5933160	5933960	The Christians.
5933960	5934360	Yeah.
5935480	5936120	Yeah.
5936120	5937320	Who were the first Christians?
5938200	5938920	Who were the-
5938920	5940360	You know who the first one was?
5940360	5942840	It's the guy in the cross with the head of the ass.
5944680	5946520	Jesus was the first Christian.
5946520	5949160	No, that's the first depiction of Jesus.
5949160	5950680	The first depiction of Jesus.
5950680	5951880	Yeah, isn't that neat?
5952760	5956680	If you knew the ancient cult, you'd have ears to hear.
5956680	5958120	And you'd know what that means.
5958920	5963880	The metamorphoses will teach you everything, the transformations.
5964680	5965960	Can you expand on that?
5965960	5967640	What was the first depiction of Jesus?
5968520	5976360	Him on a dude on a cross, very crude dude on a cross with the head of an ass.
5976360	5977880	With the head of a donkey.
5977880	5978120	Yeah.
5980120	5980680	Yeah.
5980680	5982600	You didn't know Nacander?
5982600	5983320	No.
5983320	5989560	No, Nacander was a priest, first century BC, late second, first.
5990440	5994200	And at the time, they were all super well educated.
5994200	5995400	Mm-hmm.
5995400	6000440	And this guy Nacander, he's quoted by later authorities all over the place.
6000440	6003480	They're going to find Nacander in Herculaneum, you watch.
6004120	6009720	So at what point or was there a point that the drug use started to taper off?
6010920	6017400	Yeah, in the third and fourth, you start getting movements of Christianity
6018040	6019480	that is bursting in.
6019480	6021240	Libanius talks about these.
6021240	6027480	They're raids and the Christians burst in if anybody is using incense.
6028280	6033240	Because one of the main ways that they're using drugs is through fumigation.
6033240	6033720	Right.
6034600	6034920	Right?
6035480	6036760	It's an active practice.
6036760	6039480	The first Baca Medea, she does this.
6039480	6043240	There's an account of it by Diodorus, the Sicilian.
6043960	6049080	And Diodorus says that she filled a pot full of all the best choices drugs
6049720	6051720	and carried it through the town burning.
6052680	6055560	Carried it through the town and fumigated everyone.
6055560	6055960	Wow.
6055960	6059960	And everybody joined into this giant thing that we now call an orgy.
6060520	6060760	Right?
6060760	6065000	When we say the rites, the cult rites, those are the orgy.
6066360	6066760	Right?
6067400	6072280	And you have the association with sex, but I'm not going there.
6072280	6074360	Well, there was, unless you'd like to.
6075240	6076520	Orgy's were a thing.
6077560	6081800	They were just a thing that was always going on right back then in the...
6081800	6082040	No.
6083640	6083960	No?
6083960	6084600	What do you think?
6084600	6086440	These people are lunatics?
6086440	6088440	There's just like a whole bunch of orgy's?
6088440	6089160	Yeah, that's what I thought.
6089160	6091000	No, no, this isn't.
6091000	6092200	I thought that there was orgy's.
6092200	6097160	I thought that there was like in Athens.
6097160	6098040	Yeah, like in Greece.
6098040	6099640	In Greece, there was always orgy's.
6099640	6106200	But the problem was that there was like family members participating in the same,
6106200	6107240	like a mother and son.
6108200	6111640	And then that was looked down upon by the people in Rome.
6111640	6113480	That's what the Christians were doing.
6113480	6116280	They started persecuting the Christians for the Roman government.
6116280	6118760	Oh, so the Christians were the one that were.
6118760	6119000	The...
6119000	6119560	The...
6119560	6120360	In the...
6120360	6121560	Not the Greeks.
6122680	6125080	No, it was Roman political control.
6126280	6128360	Yeah, that exerted that influence.
6128360	6132040	They're the ones who were the saved the children from second mommy.
6132040	6132760	You know what I mean?
6132760	6133400	Okay.
6134120	6137400	They were rounding up, especially in Alexandria, because that was the thing.
6138040	6140440	They would get involved in practices.
6140440	6145960	The Christians, they would filate the dude who was their equivalent of a priest.
6145960	6147000	It was like a father.
6147800	6150680	Yeah, he was the leader of the Christian covenant.
6151640	6152760	Yeah, it was this.
6152760	6157960	Their Romans were like, no, we stop at the end where they have an order all the time.
6157960	6159480	No, but you have seasonal.
6160760	6161240	Right.
6161240	6168360	Seasonal religious actions that you and I will classify as both or just a religious ritual and
6169000	6169560	or right.
6171000	6171480	Right.
6171480	6177960	There's a reason those two words are from the same, you know, emotion.
6177960	6178280	Right.
6178280	6178440	Right.
6178440	6179000	Right.
6179000	6181960	Same gut because it was religion to them as well.
6182680	6182920	Right.
6182920	6185640	And if you don't understand that, it's because you're not a...
6185640	6186520	No, I understand.
6186520	6187400	I can understand it.
6188360	6189960	You did Buddhism stuff then.
6190840	6191400	You probably...
6191400	6194760	I don't have any of that, but isn't that an Eastern thing as well?
6194760	6195960	I didn't do any Buddhism stuff.
6195960	6196520	It didn't?
6196520	6196920	No.
6196920	6197240	No.
6197240	6198280	What gave you that idea?
6198280	6198840	I don't know.
6198840	6201640	It's been previous misconception.
6203000	6205320	No, it was somebody you were interviewing was talking about.
6205320	6206440	Oh, it was...
6206440	6207560	Oh, now you did it.
6207560	6209720	It was the guy that I hate that...
6209720	6212520	Okay, look, I don't hate this guy, but I hated his interview with you.
6212520	6214920	I thought he was being condescending.
6214920	6215160	Why?
6215960	6217080	You just thought he was being condescending.
6217080	6218360	You didn't disagree with anything he was saying.
6218360	6220760	You thought you didn't think what he was saying was wrong, right?
6220760	6222760	No, I thought a lot of what he's saying is wrong.
6223480	6224840	Yeah, but he's not a tax guy.
6224840	6226760	He doesn't work with those classical tax.
6226760	6227800	So whenever...
6227800	6230680	You have to be careful whenever somebody steps out there
6231240	6234120	onto some classical concept like Gnosticism.
6234760	6237640	Hey, buddy, if you can't go back and you can't read the originals,
6237640	6239640	don't bother saying anything about it.
6239640	6245800	My mentor, Dr. John Scarborough at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
6246600	6249560	told me on the first day he said,
6249560	6256200	it's great to have you as a student and drop all your secondary sources,
6256200	6257560	because we're not about that.
6258440	6259880	We don't care what other people think.
6260680	6262760	We don't want you to tell me what your theories are.
6263560	6265080	Religious studies.
6265080	6268520	And I'm telling you this just as one person to another.
6268520	6269960	Religious studies.
6269960	6274040	This is why classical philologists laugh at religious studies.
6274840	6275160	Why?
6275800	6279160	Because they don't master the basics.
6280040	6281960	Don't tell me what Cicero said.
6281960	6286840	Don't tell me what Homer said unless you can read what Homer said.
6286840	6291320	I used to tell my seminarians that because I taught at seminary.
6291320	6291960	Who was Homer?
6292520	6293160	Who was Homer?
6293160	6293880	He was a poet.
6293880	6295320	He was a bard, baby.
6295320	6295800	From when?
6295800	6297320	He sang the song Eighth.
6297880	6298520	Eighth Century.
6298520	6299720	Yeah, Eighth Century.
6300120	6306760	There's three famous poets who you talk about who you take the sources from,
6306760	6309640	which is Homer, Ovid, and who else?
6310840	6312840	Yeah, Ovid not so much.
6312840	6313800	Not so much Ovid.
6313800	6314520	Yeah, yeah, no.
6314520	6319320	If I only had my three choices, I was going to make a soup of the best stuff.
6320200	6323400	Yeah, I would say Homer and I would say Pindar.
6323400	6324280	Pindar.
6324280	6326680	Yeah, Pindar gives you that classical flavor.
6326680	6330360	And then I would say Aeschylus as did Euripides.
6334760	6335960	He had to give in.
6335960	6341320	In Aristophanes play, The Frogs, Zionisus goes to the underworld.
6341320	6348040	Remember the stage at the time is a place of ritual purification.
6350840	6352760	It's a place of ritual purification.
6352760	6361880	So Aristophanes pulls out Euripides and Aeschylus fighting about who's the best,
6361880	6365240	who's the better poet in hell, if you will.
6365800	6366440	In hell.
6366440	6367880	Yeah, it's not really hell.
6367880	6369800	They didn't really have a concept of hell.
6370520	6372840	It was the other side of the dark star.
6373960	6375480	The other side of the dark star.
6375480	6382360	Yeah, which is apparently, it's apparently the place from which they would pull
6382360	6384600	all of this oracular information.
6385160	6388840	They said it was the real and we were the image of it.
6391240	6392040	Go figure.
6392040	6393560	Okay, I don't know what that means.
6393560	6394360	I don't know either.
6395160	6397240	Yeah, maybe you got to be on the juice.
6397240	6397560	Maybe.
6399000	6400680	You got to stick that stuff up your ass.
6400680	6406200	Yeah, we got to put some purple in our butts to really understand what was going on.
6406200	6409240	Yeah.
6409240	6414200	Okay, so the first depiction of Christ was a man being crucified with a donkey head.
6414200	6414520	Correct.
6416440	6419880	And so who was Jesus Christ?
6421240	6422760	Yeah, Christ is a title.
6423640	6424760	Christ is a title.
6424760	6426680	Yeah, Christ is a title.
6426680	6428440	Yeah, and it's a pharmaceutical term.
6428440	6429080	It's the-
6429080	6430680	Christ is a pharmaceutical term.
6430680	6431160	Where you put-
6431160	6431800	In Greek.
6431800	6432520	Yeah, yes.
6432520	6435320	And it means, I have several examples over to show you,
6435320	6441400	but it means you can perform an incristation, they called it, where I give you a drug.
6442760	6446200	What usually what you'll see me do is I'll spit on the ground.
6447000	6452280	Yeah, I'll spit on the ground and I'll use a combination of earth and spittle, my own spittle.
6452280	6453320	Why am I spitting?
6453320	6456360	Did you know Jesus walked out and spit in people's faces?
6456360	6457800	I thought you said Christ was just a-
6457800	6458440	I didn't-
6458440	6459800	He was an actual person?
6460920	6461800	In the text.
6461800	6463400	Who is he in the text?
6463400	6464520	Who is yeah?
6464520	6466120	Yeah, that's what's most important.
6466120	6466440	Okay.
6466440	6469240	That text is going to show us history, right?
6469240	6473640	You can say what you want about the text as long as we're translating it accurately.
6474520	6475640	So what is the text?
6475640	6477160	Because the text is our evidence.
6477160	6478200	This is science, man.
6478760	6485880	I refuse to give over the discipline of classics to the humanities people.
6485880	6487720	It needs to be taken by the scientists.
6487720	6489320	It's linguistics is a science.
6489320	6492920	I'm not a linguist, I'm not a linguist, I'm a classical philologist.
6492920	6494040	What's the difference?
6494040	6496120	Linguists do general stuff, right?
6496120	6502840	Like how language acts under certain circumstances or, you know, it's the basic mechanics.
6502840	6504360	Allegra was a linguist.
6504360	6510360	Yeah, classists do just Greek and then there are some that do Latin.
6510360	6511560	Okay, okay.
6513320	6514600	All right, so tell me more about Christ.
6515160	6520920	Yeah, so it's a drug term and it means to be putting that thing in your eye.
6520920	6521960	Can I show you something?
6521960	6526760	So to Christ or to christen means to put drugs in your eyes.
6526760	6528040	Originally, yeah.
6528040	6528760	Originally.
6528760	6529720	Originally.
6529720	6530520	Okay.
6530520	6538520	So how did this get turned into the person everybody knows as Jesus Christ?
6538520	6539320	Fairytale.
6540920	6544520	For example, you can talk about the age of the apostles, right?
6545160	6547000	And everybody gets in their mind.
6547000	6550840	The images of bearded adult men, right?
6550840	6553400	People don't realize those are teenagers.
6553400	6553960	The apostles.
6553960	6557160	We're talking about the picture of like Jesus with the apostles the last supper.
6557160	6559000	Yeah, notice they're all bearded men.
6559000	6560680	They're all bearded men, yeah.
6560680	6563880	What happened because of the original description?
6563880	6566840	He's constantly calling them children and they aren't.
6567960	6570760	In the original description, who's constantly calling?
6570760	6577400	Okay, so like James and John are two of Jesus's boys.
6577400	6577960	Yes.
6577960	6579960	He picked them up one day on a boat.
6580600	6581560	What do you mean boys?
6581560	6584280	Like they're his homies or like they're his children?
6584280	6585160	Yeah, what do they do?
6585720	6586600	That's the question.
6587320	6593320	They end up together a lot with boys in tombs.
6593880	6595400	With boys in tombs.
6595400	6595880	Yeah.
6595880	6596360	Okay.
6596360	6596760	Yeah.
6596760	6598600	Multiple documents show that.
6598600	6599160	Okay.
6599160	6606200	We have Saint Cyril coming out of one of these graveyards with a bunch of venom that says
6606200	6611080	bleeding out his and a couple of prophets with him.
6612920	6613240	Right?
6614280	6615640	Yeah, yeah.
6615640	6617960	Every Heracles has his highless.
6618680	6620680	What was, uh, yeah.
6622440	6627960	How common was in these cultures back then in the society?
6627960	6628600	Define.
6628600	6635720	How was and viewed and how how ubiquitous was and what was was it looked down upon?
6636200	6639560	Was it or was it just a an accepted part of society?
6639560	6641160	It's kind of like drugs were.
6641160	6644200	Oh God, it's the we got to go to Cyprus.
6644200	6652440	We got to go to Cyprus and worship Aphrodite where once a year your wife has two choices.
6653160	6663240	Either she can shave her head and stay with you or she can go to the public forum
6663960	6668120	and pick up one of the local sailors and with them all night.
6669400	6675800	Not thinking about you and come back the next day and be completely healed.
6678840	6681320	Yeah, that's the devotion.
6681320	6684440	That's the devotion to the Aphrodite.
6684440	6688200	Remember the Romans are children of Venus.
6688600	6692920	So this is embedded.
6692920	6697320	This woman centric gorgeous goddess.
6698440	6701400	This is part of their medical system.
6701400	6702680	It's part of their healing.
6703320	6710840	And so those you asked me about later those the Christians would call prophets.
6710840	6714200	And that's where you and I get our term from.
6715560	6716280	Okay.
6716280	6718120	And the negative you would never.
6718120	6719880	These are priestesses of Aphrodite.
6721800	6725720	You have made sacred the institution of.
6730280	6735160	Why would the why would the wives have to go with sailors and who were the sailors?
6735160	6735400	I don't know.
6735400	6737080	Sometimes you get the need.
6737080	6738040	Who were the sailors?
6739880	6743640	Look, they come in and they go and it's a religious festival.
6743640	6746600	If you have a problem with that, that's between you and your wife.
6749880	6754760	Now, what kind of instruction does that give to the people to the men on Cyprus?
6754760	6755480	What kind of instruction?
6755480	6759320	What what do you what do you learn from that kind of religious festival?
6760760	6765480	Or once a year, your wife gets to go have it with who with whomever she wants.
6769240	6770920	Are the wives wanting to do this?
6774600	6776680	Well, you'd have to ask them when they're doing it.
6776680	6778440	But since they all come back with smiles,
6779480	6781240	it says that they come back with smiles.
6781240	6784840	No, I made up they could come back with smiles, but they do it every year.
6784840	6786200	And you only have one choice.
6786200	6788840	Shave your head and enter.
6788840	6790120	And why do they say shave your head?
6790120	6792200	Because that shows that you're in the sign of morning,
6792920	6795320	that you're mourning the loss of Adonis.
6796200	6798040	That you're mourning that.
6798040	6799960	So you stay with your husband.
6799960	6801400	You see the loyalty.
6801480	6803480	She's loyal to him, even in death.
6804680	6806040	The women who keep their hair.
6806040	6807320	That's resurrection, baby.
6808360	6808760	Right.
6808760	6809880	They're out there.
6809880	6810600	This is Easter.
6811640	6811880	Yeah.
6813000	6813240	Yeah.
6813880	6815960	Does that kid look exactly like you?
6821000	6821560	Yeah.
6821560	6823000	Half sisters and brothers.
6823720	6824440	Huh.
6824440	6825320	Yeah.
6825320	6826840	Children of Aphrodite.
6827720	6828200	Right.
6828200	6829480	Sons of God.
6829480	6830360	These are Romans.
6830360	6832280	That's what the Romans called themselves.
6833240	6834040	Right.
6834040	6836120	Offspring of Aphrodite herself.
6837880	6838600	It's gorgeous.
6840360	6843560	Once you have access to these texts, you'll be surprised.
6844920	6848360	It'll open up a whole new world that is the actual history.
6849160	6850520	History means inquiry.
6852200	6852440	All right.
6852440	6854040	It's not a linear chain of events.
6854040	6855480	It means inquiry.
6855480	6860680	And specifically, Historia were the questions that you ask oracles.
6861640	6862600	And who are oracles?
6863160	6865960	Some 14-year-old girl totally bombed on drugs.
6866680	6867080	Singing.
6867640	6867880	Wow.
6868680	6869160	Singing.
6869160	6869400	Yeah.
6869400	6869960	Her words.
6869960	6870680	They're divine.
6871720	6875400	If we follow them, we're going to end up at democracy.
6879480	6885160	I think it was in your book, I think it was Plato who you said that he was a
6885160	6896440	tempting to or maybe he wasn't attempting to, but he thought of drugs and delusion and
6896440	6898760	creativity and mania.
6899320	6900520	All is the same thing.
6902600	6902920	Right.
6902920	6914360	And I think you used an analogy to the human soul being driven by two horses.
6914360	6923880	The human soul was a chariot being pulled by two horses that were fed drugs, basically.
6927480	6929080	You know whose horses those are?
6929080	6931560	Those are the horses of the God's baby, right?
6932120	6933480	And what are the God's fed?
6934920	6935560	Ambrosia.
6936120	6937000	Ambrosia.
6937000	6939000	You know who has the best ambrosia?
6940360	6941080	Ganymede.
6942600	6943800	You know who Ganymede is?
6943800	6944440	I don't.
6944440	6945480	He's, I'm sorry.
6946600	6950440	He's, if I can, if I may, kill this if you have to.
6951160	6952200	Please, Steve.
6952840	6957400	So for people who are listening to this podcast now, if it's on YouTube,
6958040	6962120	it's going to be heavily censored because there's some words and there's some descriptions that
6962120	6964520	Amon is giving here that can't be showed on YouTube.
6964520	6968120	So if you want to watch this thing fully uncensored, it's on our Patreon.
6968120	6968840	It's linked below.
6968840	6969880	Sorry to interrupt.
6969880	6970920	Continue, please.
6970920	6973480	I will be as literal and direct as possible.
6973640	6976840	The most scientific as possible in honor of you Danny, because I don't,
6977720	6978440	I don't want to.
6978440	6981800	I just want to make sure that this thing gets out to as many people as possible.
6981800	6982200	Okay.
6982200	6989720	And unfortunately, the high priests and priestesses at YouTube and Google will not
6989720	6993000	let that happen if there are crazy words being used.
6993000	6994440	So that's the only reason.
6994440	6995400	Totally, totally.
6996520	7001400	So Ganymede is the lover boy of Zeus.
7001880	7009560	And what he does is he pours Zeus the nectar and in Pripyat and Colt,
7009560	7013160	Pripyat is the God of the around in antiquity.
7013160	7014680	There's a God of around.
7014680	7015160	Yeah.
7015160	7022920	In the Met Museum, you can see they've got a thing up now of all the pripyat stuff and all the,
7023800	7028760	you know, when you're in a city and they see a statue of Pripyat,
7028760	7033960	you see a statue of Pripyat, you rub the, if you're a young girl,
7033960	7037960	you rub the, for the sake of, you know, good luck.
7038920	7042120	You know, you know, it's a positive thing.
7042120	7044040	So you'd see people doing this.
7044040	7047240	Every garden has a statue of Pripyat in Rome.
7047240	7048040	Can you find a statue?
7048040	7048360	Oh, there we go.
7048360	7049000	There's a statue.
7049000	7049720	Oh my God.
7052680	7053880	Blow up one of these photos.
7053880	7054760	Blow up that one in the middle.
7054760	7055000	Yeah, joking.
7055000	7060760	That's a beautiful one.
7060760	7061000	Okay.
7061000	7062600	This is according to Wikipedia.
7062600	7063080	Okay.
7063080	7071720	A Pripyat was described in various sources as the son of Aphrodite by Dionysus and the son
7071720	7082200	of Dionysus and Chion as perhaps the father or son of Hermes or as the son of Zeus or Pan.
7083080	7083560	Okay.
7083640	7084680	So that thing.
7084680	7085160	Oh, wow.
7085160	7085640	Go hang on.
7085640	7086360	Go back real quick.
7088280	7089080	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
7090120	7096600	According to legend, Hurrah cursed him with inconvenient impotence.
7096600	7100600	He could not sustain an eruption when the time came for septic intercourse.
7101960	7103240	Inconvenient impotence.
7105000	7105640	I've read.
7105640	7108280	So he had a huge, but he couldn't get it hard.
7108280	7115480	I've read descriptions in different ancient authors about the different drugs that are made
7116120	7121960	in order to induce and to reduce it.
7122920	7125160	So yeah, it's a drug thing they're using.
7125160	7126360	Look at that little guy there.
7126360	7126840	Yeah.
7126840	7132040	The first thing Bacchus did when he came back from hell is he sat on a
7132840	7137560	over the grave of the guy who pointed in the direction of the cave.
7137560	7139400	We're going to go find the underworld.
7140840	7141080	Yeah.
7141960	7144440	Why are they doing that stuff with their?
7145960	7146280	Yeah.
7146280	7148600	Why, why are these people such sickos?
7148600	7150040	You, you asked me.
7150040	7152520	You were like, are you sure you're not just focusing too much?
7152520	7152920	Look at this.
7154600	7154920	Yeah.
7154920	7157160	No, I guess it's hard to escape.
7157160	7157880	Right.
7157880	7158440	Yeah.
7158520	7158840	Yeah.
7158840	7165240	The first depictions of Aphrodite or she has a beautiful woman with a giant
7167160	7168440	coming right at you.
7168440	7169720	Can you find this, Steve?
7169720	7170120	Yeah.
7170120	7172600	Find the early Aphrodite sculptures, please.
7172600	7174280	Early Aphrodite sculptures.
7174280	7175080	Skull sculptures.
7175080	7175640	Yeah.
7175640	7175880	Yeah.
7175880	7176600	Yeah.
7176600	7177080	Love it.
7177080	7177960	It's good stuff.
7177960	7179400	And they put stuff on those.
7181160	7183560	You can find this in the satiricon, right?
7183560	7186200	And that's how they're administering drugs.
7186840	7188120	That's how they're administering this.
7188440	7189560	Inventively?
7189560	7190040	Yes.
7190040	7192680	And orally and ocular.
7192680	7194600	They have an ocular administration in my purse.
7194600	7195240	Or an ocular.
7196040	7196520	Yeah.
7196520	7199560	No, not a, that's spreading the seed, brother.
7200520	7200840	Right.
7201560	7203960	Don't you want to have an incristation?
7205000	7212360	You know, somebody seed the ophites, the ophites, they called them in antiquity.
7212360	7212920	There it is.
7212920	7213880	They're a sect.
7214760	7215000	They're, look.
7215000	7215960	This is Aphrodite.
7215960	7216680	I think.
7216680	7217880	She's lifting up her skirt.
7217880	7219160	What's she got under their skirt?
7220680	7221960	Oh my lord.
7221960	7222760	What is that?
7223400	7223960	Now why?
7225000	7225720	Why?
7225720	7227960	It's such a f for dethose.
7227960	7228520	Why not?
7230840	7231320	Yeah.
7231320	7231880	Why not?
7235160	7235640	Huh?
7236440	7236760	Yeah.
7239320	7239880	Why not?
7240680	7241960	Is that disturbing?
7241960	7243240	Is that disturbing?
7243240	7244200	It's not disturbing.
7244200	7245240	It's just interesting.
7245240	7251000	I'm wondering, like, were they, were they hyper obsessed with gender?
7251000	7253560	And why, why were they so obsessed with sex?
7253560	7255640	They don't even have a word for homosexual.
7256360	7256680	Right.
7257320	7258040	Yeah, right.
7258040	7261800	So it's all a part of the, they don't seem to have a problem.
7261800	7272360	So there was no, there was no moral or ideological boundaries when it came to sex course.
7273320	7279160	Obviously others or scientific, I mean, scientific other than the fact you could create offspring.
7279160	7279720	Yeah.
7279720	7282760	One thing you have to say, one thing you have to say, and I always use this,
7283480	7290440	whenever you hear a historian or class assistant or anybody using generalities, right, that's,
7290440	7292360	you can tell that they're full of it.
7292360	7293320	Different cultures.
7293320	7300520	We're talking about span of 2000 years, you know, say 1000 BC to 1000 auto-dominy,
7301160	7303080	you know, about 2000 years.
7303720	7309800	So in that time, you've got a lot of different things going on, right?
7309800	7312360	Spartans do something totally different than what Greeks do, right?
7312360	7315640	Dorians do different things than Ionians do, right?
7315640	7317960	Where do we find this, where do we find this lady?
7317960	7318840	What about the-
7318840	7319480	Where do we find her?
7319480	7319880	Tell me where.
7319880	7321400	Yeah, I don't remember where this one's from.
7321400	7322120	Okay.
7322120	7324360	But where is she originally her form?
7324360	7326200	You gotta thank the great mother, baby.
7327080	7328760	You gotta thank the great mother.
7328760	7332520	There's a lot of castration going on in the worship of the great mother.
7332520	7341240	You know, I've seen a 10-year-old boy, that's what Lucian says, a 10-year-old boy cut off his own
7342760	7345960	and this was during a religious festival, right?
7345960	7347400	Don't worry, the parents are there.
7348040	7349080	Lucian wrote this?
7349080	7349640	Yeah.
7349640	7350760	Who was Lucian?
7350760	7352280	Oh, he's second century.
7352280	7357640	He's a guy who's writing the auto-dominy and he's talking about the rites of Sibley.
7357640	7358360	Okay.
7358760	7361080	These festivals, you know, you could go there too.
7361080	7362440	It's like spring break, but-
7363080	7364600	Except you're cutting off?
7364600	7365080	Yeah.
7365080	7366360	And we have an account.
7366360	7366600	No.
7367400	7372680	Cutellus 63 is an account of one of these boys who did this cut his
7373800	7374520	off the next morning.
7374520	7375400	He was like, I don't know.
7376840	7377320	Regret.
7379400	7380280	But she'd take the-
7381320	7387960	says Lucian and you throw him into somebody's house and whoever gets the tables
7389320	7391560	has to provide you with a woman's kit.
7392440	7393640	What's a woman's kit?
7393640	7395800	Oh, all the clothes that a woman needs to be-
7398280	7399320	Why would they do that?
7400680	7401880	Because you cut your-
7402760	7405720	Why would you want to be dressed- cut your-
7405720	7406920	to dress like a woman though?
7406920	7408360	Because you're honoring the great mother.
7408920	7410440	You're honoring the great mother.
7410440	7410760	Yeah.
7412040	7412520	Okay.
7412520	7415080	Right, everybody loves mom except for Nazis, right?
7417240	7417880	Yeah, I guess.
7418520	7424200	The Romans imported her cult when they were having a problem with Hannibal.
7424200	7425400	They were like, we're screwed.
7426280	7427320	What do we do?
7427320	7432120	And they sent somebody out to the Oracle and the Oracle at Delphi told them,
7432120	7434920	she said, you got to import the worship of the great mother.
7434920	7435560	Okay.
7435560	7436440	And so they did.
7437000	7437480	Okay.
7437480	7440280	And they blew them- that's when they blew up into an empire.
7440280	7443080	This is like 205 BC.
7443080	7443720	Okay.
7443720	7445480	And after that, they just blew up.
7445480	7446840	Their control was blew up.
7446840	7450760	It's that ecstatic worship of the mother.
7451800	7453240	That's what requires the-
7454840	7459640	Imagine how devoted you would have to be to the great mother.
7459640	7460600	Cut off your own.
7461400	7465240	Now, he said, sometimes tourists do get wrapped up on a whole festival
7465880	7469240	and will be like, oh, you know, they'll join in.
7469960	7470360	But that's-
7474040	7474440	Right.
7474440	7477640	Remember, you're on drugs and you're being whipped and stuff too, baby.
7477640	7479080	I mean, this is intricate.
7479080	7480200	This is crazy stuff.
7481080	7483320	There's a sadistic level to this.
7483320	7484200	So it's gorgeous.
7484200	7487080	They open up these Roman villas, like the Villa of the Mysteries,
7487640	7489720	Herculaneum and Pompeii and stuff.
7489720	7494840	They open those things up and they've got all these frescoes of gorgeous people with
7494840	7496840	whips and people.
7497400	7499240	And you're like, what are they doing?
7499240	7500360	What are these people doing?
7500360	7501080	It's crazy.
7501080	7502360	No, it's mental health.
7502360	7503400	Don't worry.
7503400	7504840	Purge is the society.
7504840	7506200	The emperors know this.
7507160	7510760	Yeah, it gets out of hand and they have a conspiracy in the 180s.
7511320	7515640	And it gets out of hand and they end up killing like 2,000 women.
7517320	7520440	And the way that they caught them was their drugs.
7521960	7522280	Yeah.
7523560	7524840	What was the conspiracy?
7524840	7529800	It was a bunch of wives of prominent senators who were trying to restructure the government.
7529800	7533720	Oh, it was a coup, a tempted coup.
7533720	7533960	Right.
7533960	7535080	That's why they took it down.
7536680	7539240	They made it illegal, those Romans.
7539240	7541160	These are the fresco whips of Pompeii.
7541160	7542360	Yeah, look at these.
7542360	7543160	I don't know.
7543160	7543800	Is this them?
7543800	7544520	I'm trying to find it.
7544520	7545960	This is just what popped up.
7545960	7546680	Yeah, there you go.
7546680	7548040	What's going on down there?
7550120	7551080	Fashion show.
7551800	7554280	No, the one of them is getting beaten, baby.
7554280	7556920	There's somebody right next to her with a whip.
7557000	7560280	If you had a time machine, you could go to any place in history.
7560280	7561800	Where was the first place you would go?
7562520	7566760	Yeah, I would go back to the Garden of Gethsemane.
7566760	7569000	The Garden of Gethsemane.
7569000	7572200	It's the public park where Jesus was arrested.
7572200	7573880	You are obsessed with this.
7573880	7574840	Yeah, I think I'm obsessed with it.
7574840	7578440	You constantly talk about this moment when Jesus was arrested.
7578440	7581960	Yeah, it's why is that?
7581960	7583640	Is this in the Bible?
7583640	7584760	Yes, it is.
7584760	7585800	Also, dumb question.
7585800	7587720	How many versions of the modern Bible are there?
7589000	7593720	I don't know how many, but I can think of at least 12.
7593720	7594920	What's the difference between them all?
7594920	7595240	Why?
7595240	7596760	Why are there so many versions?
7596760	7598840	It depends on the time that they're translated.
7598840	7602120	And if you'll notice, a lot of them will follow the earlier authors.
7602760	7606120	Bible scholars don't read anything outside of the Bible.
7606120	7608280	So how good do you think their vocab is?
7608280	7610600	How good do you think their translation skills are?
7611720	7613080	That's the problem.
7613480	7615480	Those translations are generally pretty bad.
7615480	7617640	And that's what I brought some examples of.
7618520	7622360	This is in the Garden, actually, that I brought these slides for.
7623720	7625960	And this is the Garden of Gethsemane.
7625960	7626760	And where are we?
7626760	7629720	We're with Jesus in the first.
7630600	7633080	And he's being arrested.
7633080	7634920	Okay, so let's give some context.
7634920	7635880	Let's get some context.
7635880	7636680	Let's do it.
7636680	7641000	So who was Jesus and why and what is so good?
7641000	7641960	What is so great about him?
7642920	7646920	Yeah, Jesus is a guy who walked around with 12 children.
7649000	7649480	All the time.
7649480	7652840	And a group of prophets.
7652840	7654280	No, I'm just telling what the text says.
7654280	7656440	He was just a guy who walked around with prophets.
7656440	7658040	He prophets and children.
7658040	7659000	So what was so great about him?
7659000	7664280	He called his disciples and he calls them his children constantly, right?
7664280	7667720	Remember, remember God.
7667720	7668840	So he's a pimp.
7668840	7670600	God blesses those.
7672520	7676520	Who take care of the children, right?
7677400	7678120	Okay.
7678120	7678680	Yeah.
7678680	7680040	He takes care of these children.
7680040	7681640	He takes care of these children.
7681640	7682120	Okay.
7682120	7687720	There is a female underage called the Pideska.
7688680	7695000	When Jesus Christ is in his trial, his followers won't admit they're his followers,
7696040	7696760	right?
7696760	7699160	It's the whole, you're going to deny me, right?
7699160	7702680	Jesus is all like, I'm going to get frigging scandalized, right?
7702680	7705960	And you're going to deny me when he's in the garden and he gets caught.
7706920	7712120	And those three, Peter, James and John, they're keeping watch, the text says.
7712120	7719640	They're guarding at a distance while Jesus takes a good boy that's been assigned to him.
7719640	7720680	That's what the text says.
7721800	7722760	Like a slave.
7723720	7732920	So this, the depiction of this event is only in one version of the Bible, is that right?
7732920	7734280	Is it Matthew?
7734280	7738680	No, it's in multiple, but the kid is only in Mark.
7738680	7739640	Only in Mark.
7739640	7740120	Yeah.
7740120	7740360	Okay.
7740360	7742040	And it's only like two sentences, right?
7742040	7744440	Stephen, can you pull up, can you pull up the passage?
7744440	7745480	It's, I've got it here.
7745480	7746200	Oh, you've got it there.
7746200	7746600	Okay.
7746600	7746840	Yeah.
7747640	7749560	1451, is that first line?
7749560	7755720	I can pull up the passages and show the different versions and how it translates as well.
7755720	7757080	What passage is it?
7757080	7758680	Mark 1451.
7759240	7761640	1451.
7762360	7763400	All right, cool.
7763400	7763720	Okay.
7763720	7765480	A young man, what is it?
7765480	7766360	Can you blow it up?
7766360	7766600	Yeah.
7767720	7773560	A young man wearing nothing, but a linen garment was following Jesus when they seized him.
7773560	7774440	That's all it says.
7774440	7775000	Yeah.
7775000	7776200	Now look at the Greek.
7777080	7778200	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7778200	7786600	And it says, a young boy was assigned to him having wrapped his
7788040	7792680	with a medicated bandage and they arrested him.
7792680	7794760	A medicated bandage is what it says.
7794760	7796120	Seemed on, yeah.
7796120	7796920	I've got the.
7796920	7800840	Okay, so I'm comparing yours to what this one says.
7800840	7803400	So, visibility, I can turn on Greek as well.
7803400	7803880	Okay.
7803880	7809320	I'd love to see how this online Bible matches yours.
7810280	7811080	Check out the.
7811720	7812680	Okay, so right here.
7812680	7813960	Is that exactly what you're reading?
7813960	7815000	Yeah, that's what I'm reading.
7815640	7816040	Okay.
7816040	7822120	Which one of those Greek words is wrapped in a medicated linen?
7824280	7825000	This is on the, okay.
7825000	7826440	Let's just start on the first line.
7827000	7829240	Maybe we should, should we go to his computer, Steve?
7829240	7829640	Yeah, yeah.
7829640	7830520	I'm punching it out.
7830520	7831000	That's it.
7831000	7831720	Okay.
7831720	7833640	The first, let's go to the first one.
7834040	7839160	The second word in is neoniskos and that is what we call a diminutive.
7839960	7840440	Neoniskos.
7840440	7842840	So, it's a little of something else.
7842840	7844280	And what is a neonias?
7844280	7845640	A neonias is a boy.
7846280	7846760	Okay.
7846760	7847080	Yeah.
7847080	7848520	So, this is a little boy.
7848520	7849320	Okay.
7849320	7855480	And they called Pideska female dudes who were underage.
7855480	7855960	Okay.
7855960	7857560	And when I say underage, I don't mean underage.
7857560	7859720	Did they define underage down back then?
7859720	7860520	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
7860520	7862200	It's not under 18.
7862200	7862920	It's before.
7864200	7865000	So, okay.
7865640	7867800	So, that was their word for, for before.
7868360	7870840	Age was, they didn't set a year.
7870840	7871080	Right.
7871080	7871480	Okay.
7871480	7871960	Got it.
7871960	7872280	Right.
7872280	7873960	The translation here says young.
7873960	7881720	And was there, was there, was there any sort of moral boundaries
7882440	7889320	when it came to, based on the, not from what I've seen.
7889320	7889880	Okay.
7889880	7890520	Yeah.
7890520	7893960	Now, generally, in different, no, in different civilizations,
7893960	7899160	you can still, like in Athens, you can still prosecute for somebody coercing what you and
7899160	7900920	I would say is underage, then before.
7902200	7902440	Yeah.
7902440	7904600	That's still, you can get in trouble for that.
7904600	7904920	Okay.
7904920	7910120	But it's not like it, it's not like there's compensation involved because,
7910840	7913400	you know, it's not like a crime like you and I consider a crime.
7913400	7914600	It's more like a civil crime.
7915640	7915800	Yeah.
7915800	7916600	Okay.
7916600	7917560	Like being punched.
7917560	7918040	Right.
7918040	7918440	Yeah.
7918440	7922360	You've damaged somebody so you can give them reparations for damaging them.
7922360	7922840	Oh, okay.
7923320	7924200	That's what you do.
7924200	7932120	But the pedagogy in antiquity, pedagogy, that person who raises, educates the children.
7933000	7933480	Right.
7933480	7937640	That person, that's the kentauron they called them.
7938520	7939320	The centaur.
7940280	7942200	It's their word for best.
7945320	7946440	Which means what?
7946440	7951320	Oh, it means with children.
7952680	7953080	Yeah.
7954120	7954520	Yeah.
7956040	7956440	Yeah.
7956440	7958600	And Chiron, remember Chiron?
7958600	7962120	He's a centaur who is the master of Heracles.
7962840	7966280	And now you know why Heracles has his boy Hylas.
7967880	7968680	Do you understand?
7969320	7973080	The sacred mystery is passed from generation to generation.
7974680	7975240	Okay.
7975240	7975480	Yeah.
7976440	7981640	So again, what was so special about Jesus?
7981640	7985080	He was a guy who walked around with kids.
7985080	7985640	Yeah.
7985640	7986440	Apostles.
7986440	7987320	Apostles.
7987320	7987640	Yeah.
7988920	7990840	So what was so special about him?
7990840	7992040	Was he the only one doing that?
7992040	7993240	What was so, no.
7993240	7995160	What was so, what was so special about him?
7995160	7997880	Like, oh, and this is, that's perfect.
7997880	7999000	No, he's not.
7999000	8000520	It's called being a laystace.
8001080	8002200	What is a laystace?
8002200	8005880	He, and he was crucified between two of these.
8007000	8010280	A laystace is defined, and I've got it on the next.
8010280	8010760	Let's see.
8011400	8014040	Oh, here, look, this follows my presentation.
8015720	8019080	So this is what the boy that was with Jesus, the boy,
8019080	8022600	this is what he was with him, doing him.
8022600	8024120	He's, he's following him.
8024120	8027080	Notice they use this term, Tsunakulethu.
8027800	8030200	And where, where do you get this from?
8030200	8030840	This, this image.
8030840	8034440	Oh, this, the thank you to the Victorians from Oxford,
8035160	8038280	who have given us this wonderful, fantastic lexicon
8038280	8041000	of ancient Greek, 1850s.
8042520	8046520	After that book that you just had was, was written.
8047400	8048120	And here it is.
8048120	8051080	And it's, notice that it's using soldiers.
8051080	8054920	It's using term for soldiers and slaves, right?
8054920	8059160	So this kid is not just hanging out with Jesus, right?
8059720	8064520	People have tried to explain this for a while.
8064520	8067080	What was the kid doing with Jesus, right?
8067800	8070040	Okay. Anyway, let's go on to the next one.
8070600	8071080	Double click.
8071080	8071480	There you go.
8071480	8072520	Now hit the green button.
8072520	8075320	Look, this is what the kid is wrapped on his gumnos.
8075320	8076760	And you say, what's gumnos?
8076760	8077320	Gumnos is.
8077320	8079080	Fine cloth, usually linen.
8079080	8079880	Yeah.
8079880	8080360	Yeah.
8080360	8081160	Fine cloth.
8081160	8084200	Look, look, look, look where it's, look at the second line.
8084200	8087720	It says, busines, telamones, right?
8087720	8091880	So they're wrapping things in this fine cloth, right?
8092600	8094520	And surgeons bandages.
8094520	8095400	And bandages.
8095400	8096840	And that's where I get it.
8096840	8099080	On my end, when I'm reading the medical authors,
8099080	8102840	they're all saying that you impregnate linen with drugs
8102840	8105000	that you're going to treat the wound with, right?
8105000	8105720	This kind of makes sense.
8105720	8107960	You impregnate women.
8107960	8109560	No, no, linen, linen, I'm sorry.
8109560	8111240	You impregnate linen.
8111240	8112520	Don't impregnate the women.
8112520	8113320	With drugs.
8113320	8113480	Yeah.
8113480	8114280	Yeah.
8114280	8114440	Yeah.
8114440	8115480	To treat wounds.
8115480	8115960	Yeah.
8115960	8116360	Okay.
8116360	8116680	So.
8116680	8117400	That makes sense.
8117560	8119720	This is, this is the original text.
8119720	8124040	And this right here is the translation that we have right now,
8124040	8126200	which is, I'll punch it up for people,
8126840	8129480	but a, nothing but a linen garment.
8130200	8130600	Yeah.
8130600	8134120	Notice how they took it from a bandage and turned it into.
8134120	8134680	Who did this?
8134680	8135960	Who's responsible for this?
8135960	8137320	Crappy translators.
8138280	8140120	People who do not work with the Greek.
8140120	8140920	If you'll bring up the next one.
8140920	8144200	Is this, but is this, is this an accident or is this intentional?
8145240	8145480	No.
8145480	8146120	These translations.
8146200	8147480	Intentional stupidity.
8148040	8151000	Are they intentionally leaving this, this out of the Bible?
8151000	8152440	No, it's bad training.
8152440	8153160	Oh, okay.
8153160	8154680	It's just bad training.
8154680	8155560	Okay.
8155560	8155800	Yeah.
8156520	8157320	There we go.
8157320	8158280	Now watch this one.
8160360	8160760	Okay.
8160760	8163240	So that last one had businos on it.
8163240	8164760	Well, what is the businos?
8164760	8167400	It's fine linen bandage, right?
8167400	8168360	They give you at the top,
8168360	8170920	but then look at the reference on the second line.
8170920	8172440	That's Euripides bakai.
8173240	8173640	Okay.
8173640	8178360	So this is something that they're using within some kind of religious ritual.
8178360	8183960	And look at number two at the bottom, Roman numeral number two por furus.
8183960	8185080	That's Hesekius.
8185800	8186920	And who's Hesekius?
8186920	8192600	Hesekius is a lexicographer from the fourth and fifth who comes in.
8192600	8199080	And he has access to these ancient Greek lexicography texts, right?
8199080	8203720	So before anybody was having any kind of substantial literature,
8203720	8205800	the Greeks were already at the level.
8206680	8207880	And these are ancient Greeks.
8207880	8214120	They're already at the level of creating a language that is so highly specialized.
8214120	8216840	We're still trying to translate it.
8216840	8219560	Look at por furos here, right?
8219560	8222600	And you see the different dialects that you get from at the top.
8222600	8228680	You got it in Attic and you got it in Eolian and they got some Sappho there.
8228680	8230840	Well, look at number one, right?
8230840	8232120	It's something you do at the sea.
8232840	8234440	Number two, blood gushing.
8235640	8236120	Purple.
8236840	8238280	Number two, the purple.
8238280	8242600	Of purple, of stuff, cloths, et cetera.
8242600	8244680	Yeah, et cetera.
8245400	8246600	It's a dye, right?
8246600	8248600	Look at number three, purple clad.
8248600	8250520	You can have the purple people, right?
8250520	8252280	We're walking around with their purple.
8252280	8255320	And then number four, purple spas.
8255320	8258440	But then number five is a specific.
8258440	8260920	And then number six, oh, more, there it is.
8260920	8263560	It's that thing that sets, right?
8263560	8264280	The purple.
8265640	8271000	It's the, it's the chemical that we're going to be using within the right
8271000	8273320	to make what is called the burning purple.
8274040	8275560	And that comes from the virgin.
8276280	8277880	And they come from the virgin.
8277880	8279160	Yeah, right.
8279880	8282280	Mary's fingers were covered with purple.
8282360	8286200	And when her midwife came in to check her,
8286840	8290040	because that's what midwives do, all this stuff, by the way,
8290040	8291400	is coming from medicine.
8291400	8292920	It's coming from women's medicine.
8293720	8295400	Yeah, that's where all the science is.
8295400	8297160	And when the midwife came in to check her.
8297160	8299240	To check Mary, she palpated her.
8299240	8299960	How'd she do that?
8299960	8301640	Say she stuck her two fingers in.
8303160	8305320	And that's how, that's what they do when they're,
8305320	8306760	when someone's pregnant to check.
8306760	8306840	Yeah.
8306840	8308840	How dilated their cervix is or whatever.
8308840	8309320	Yeah, right.
8309320	8311720	Yeah, you do the same thing with cows, right?
8312520	8315080	I guess, I don't know, never heard of cow.
8315080	8315400	No.
8315400	8318200	Well, here she, her and then she, oh God,
8318200	8319400	now you're going to have to pull that out.
8319400	8320040	Don't say that.
8320040	8320280	Don't say that.
8320280	8321320	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
8321320	8323320	Okay, what happened?
8323320	8325000	Yeah, we're just creating more work for the editor.
8325000	8331160	She, she had purple fingers and those purple fingers burned.
8332200	8332600	Right.
8332600	8335960	Says the apocryphal text say it burned her finger,
8335960	8337240	the midwife's finger.
8338440	8338840	Okay.
8339640	8342520	Um, where are we getting Baptist from?
8343480	8345560	And you say, wait a minute, this thing's jumping all over.
8345560	8347000	No, we're still talking about the purple.
8347800	8348200	Look at this.
8348200	8349560	This is the word buffet.
8349560	8353000	Dipping of red hot iron in water.
8353000	8357160	Hence temper or edge of a blade or tool produced thereby.
8357480	8359480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8360040	8361160	No, look at number two.
8362680	8363160	Die.
8363160	8363640	Die.
8363640	8365240	And the source there is theophrasis.
8365240	8366680	Blood, die of blood.
8366760	8367160	Yeah.
8367160	8369160	That's the source there is theophrasis.
8369160	8372680	Since the historian Plontorum, he was a student of Aristotle.
8373560	8375160	And he's the first botanist.
8375160	8376200	He's considered the free.
8376200	8379880	He wasn't the first botanist, but he was considered to be the father of botany.
8379880	8382440	And if you look at the word that follows theophrasis,
8382440	8386360	it's porfura, which is just the word we got out of Herculaneum.
8387640	8390600	And it says porfura buffet.
8391480	8395240	The baptism is a baptism into the purple.
8397080	8397800	Okay.
8397800	8399960	We didn't, we didn't leave the cult.
8399960	8402040	We're still in the cult, right?
8402040	8403880	Baptists, you know what baptists carry?
8403880	8405160	They carry drugs.
8405160	8405720	Yeah.
8405720	8406840	They carry drugs.
8406840	8407880	Everybody's carrying drugs.
8410760	8413640	Oh, and by the way, in the Roman market is an open market.
8413640	8415240	The Roman market is an open market.
8415240	8415560	Yeah.
8415560	8416280	You can buy anything.
8416280	8420040	You can buy venom from North Africa in the Roman market.
8420040	8421000	Make a concoction.
8421000	8422360	It'll knock you down.
8422360	8426280	And we know this because they have recipes and doctors
8426360	8429000	writing about what do you do when you come across somebody
8429000	8430600	and he's had too much hemlock.
8430600	8432680	The first time I read that I was like, wait a minute,
8432680	8433480	too much hemlock.
8433480	8435400	That's what Socrates was killed with, right?
8435400	8436360	Mm-hmm.
8436360	8436840	Yeah.
8436840	8438200	But this is a dude who just-
8438200	8440120	Do you use small amounts to trip balls?
8440760	8444360	He said, he said he'll be walking on all fours
8444360	8445800	and bleeding like a sheep.
8448440	8448920	God.
8450680	8451000	Yeah.
8451000	8451720	And what do you do?
8451720	8453080	You got to give him an antidote.
8453080	8455880	And that's where I was talking before about the rope
8455960	8458040	that's in the cave, that's guiding us through the cave,
8458040	8458840	is the science.
8461240	8464120	They have come through.
8464120	8467800	The Romans have come through a world that was a bronze age
8468440	8470920	renaissance of drugs,
8471560	8473720	dotes and antidotes, they call it,
8473720	8475480	Christ and Antichrist.
8476360	8477640	Oh.
8477640	8478280	Yeah.
8478280	8478920	Yeah.
8478920	8480760	They are pharmacological terms.
8481320	8482600	And they're using them that way.
8482600	8483960	And when you get baptized,
8483960	8486040	this is what you're being baptized into.
8486040	8489400	It's the only way to bring eternal life.
8490040	8491320	And you say, wait a minute,
8491320	8492200	why don't I thought,
8492200	8493960	because you're thinking the wrong eternal life.
8493960	8497080	There's no phrase in the New Testament that says eternal life.
8497880	8500040	They all say Ionic life.
8500040	8501160	Ionic life.
8501160	8501800	Uh-huh.
8501800	8502920	Which, what does that mean?
8502920	8505160	It's outside the time stream.
8506280	8507160	That's how they describe it.
8507160	8510280	Pythagoras said it has 360 degrees.
8512200	8513000	Yeah.
8513000	8516280	So they're talking about some sort of DMT realm, maybe.
8516280	8518280	Quantum physics, I don't understand it.
8518280	8520600	Because they're also talking about the dark star.
8520600	8523320	This stuff is all accessible across the dark star.
8524120	8527240	So I don't know what that means,
8527240	8530440	but I know that you have to join a lot of drugs and a lot of
8532440	8533000	behavior.
8533000	8534600	Where does Bacchus always lead?
8534600	8536760	Bacchus always leads us to Aphrodite.
8538120	8539000	Why is that?
8539000	8540680	Because she is life.
8543720	8546280	There's a sacred name of Rome that is sacred,
8546280	8549320	and I give everybody on my channel a hard time
8551400	8553160	to derive the sacred name.
8553160	8554840	They can't derive the sacred name.
8554840	8556040	If you know this,
8556040	8557400	this is what they said in antiquity,
8557400	8558040	don't blame me.
8558600	8560920	They said if you knew the sacred name of Rome,
8560920	8562440	you can control her power.
8563160	8565480	If you knew the sacred name of Rome,
8565480	8567880	you could control her power.
8567880	8571400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8571400	8575080	And that name is the operation of a mystery.
8575640	8578040	The name is an operation of a mystery.
8578040	8579480	It's the operation.
8580280	8582760	It is that resurrection of the Korah.
8582760	8584440	That's why in the,
8585560	8587240	which they did in Elucis every year.
8587960	8588200	Right.
8589160	8594520	Which is why you have the very same kind of worship
8594520	8597400	that's spreading through the oracles.
8597960	8601560	The oracles are spreading the power of that Elucinian,
8601560	8603160	they call it a purification.
8604680	8609240	When you can put your population through an act
8609240	8610760	that brings them healing,
8611400	8612440	they're better citizens.
8613160	8613560	Wow.
8614280	8615240	Yeah.
8615240	8615640	Wow.
8617000	8617320	Yeah.
8619480	8621320	Now you understand what they call the temple.
8622360	8623720	This is some wild sh** man.
8623720	8627400	Uh, priest is, means process.
8628280	8630440	Well, that's what the later Christians call them.
8630440	8631720	You know why they did now,
8631720	8633640	because this is the activity they're doing.
8634440	8635880	They're bringing that healing.
8636600	8636920	All right.
8636920	8638680	There's 20, there's 20,000,
8638680	8640280	I think it was 20 or 22,000,
8640280	8644600	that celebrate during the Bonadia, the Romans call it.
8644600	8645480	I mean, it's all,
8646600	8649320	this is all making a lot more sense to me now.
8649320	8653640	I mean, it's, it's when you're talking about the creation of
8653720	8657240	democracy and, and saving humanity from itself,
8657960	8662760	and trying to eliminate all the negative influences of,
8662760	8665000	of ancient oligarchs or tyrants,
8666440	8670600	and trying to create a just and fair society,
8673560	8675640	that's essentially what, what they did.
8675640	8680200	And, and the use of, of drugs
8680520	8683800	to, to have an understanding of this,
8683800	8685720	and to create this sort of world,
8687000	8689400	that, that is the best way.
8689400	8690600	I mean, even in modern times,
8690600	8694600	when you hear people talking about psychedelic experiences,
8694600	8696600	and, or, you know,
8696600	8699560	experimenting with things like DMT or, or whatever it is,
8700760	8706760	there are many modern descriptions of this same thing
8706760	8707960	you're sort of talking about.
8708120	8711400	I mean, and even like, if you talk about, like, if, if,
8712360	8717720	if you wanted the best, most just and fair,
8718520	8721080	uncorrupted version of government today,
8721080	8723560	you would want the president of the United States to trip,
8723560	8725400	to be tripping on mushrooms, right?
8725400	8728040	So, but the problem with it is the way that we look at,
8728040	8731000	the way we look at it today is,
8731000	8733560	if you have all the people, like when it,
8733560	8734600	going back to democracy,
8734600	8736680	if you have all of these people,
8736680	8739080	10% of your population making the decisions
8739080	8740600	and debating the decisions,
8740600	8742920	you're never going to become the number one empire.
8744520	8746440	You're not going to be able to control other empires
8747000	8748440	because you're only worrying about yourself.
8749400	8751640	You're not creating wars
8751640	8753560	and trying to influence the rest of the world
8753560	8756280	and trying to, trying to have the stranglehold
8756280	8757320	on everyone else.
8757320	8762440	You're just worrying about your society and being good.
8762840	8768440	And the downside of that is you become vulnerable
8771000	8771960	to the outside world.
8773320	8776520	Or to an insurrection, which is,
8776520	8779320	which is what happened to the Romans
8779320	8780520	and they're screaming.
8780520	8781960	The emperor Julian is like,
8781960	8785000	oh my God, do not let the Christians teach.
8786120	8788440	And, you know, today that's like, what?
8788440	8790120	Oh, that's so terrible.
8790520	8793000	No, he says they will pull down your government
8793000	8793800	right around years
8793800	8797240	and they'll set up something that's horrific in its place.
8797240	8798040	Sure enough, they did.
8798040	8798920	They killed him though.
8798920	8800200	I'll put it in within a few years.
8800200	8803480	He was dead by a Christian soldier who speared him in the back.
8804600	8808440	Yeah, yeah, it's the attempt to extinguish.
8808440	8811960	That's why I'm so grateful for the Herculaneum Scrolls
8812600	8815160	because every time, this is the largest,
8816040	8819000	the only intact library that we have from the ancient world.
8820120	8822440	And it is the largest collection.
8822440	8825080	It will have completely new authors.
8825080	8827480	It will have authors that we know exist,
8827480	8830360	but we didn't have that copy of that play.
8830360	8831320	It'll have those two.
8832360	8834680	And every time in history there is,
8834680	8836600	I have great, I bring you great news
8836600	8840680	because every time in history that we have a enlightenment,
8841880	8847800	it's based upon a resurgence of that classical muse.
8848440	8849720	It's based upon her.
8850360	8852360	And to call that forward,
8852360	8855640	I predict that this thing is potentially
8856200	8858920	able to create another renaissance.
8858920	8864600	And I hope people are aware that it's out there.
8864600	8868680	And it has silver, it has the purple written on it, right?
8868680	8869480	There?
8869480	8870120	Yeah.
8870120	8872360	Exactly, exactly.
8872360	8875800	So these translations that you just pulled up,
8876760	8879480	what does this have to do with,
8879480	8885080	or what does this tell you about the scene of Jesus in the park?
8885080	8887560	That's exactly what this verse says right here.
8888120	8888520	It says...
8888520	8889720	Can you zoom in on that a little bit?
8889720	8890440	Yeah, can we...
8891160	8891640	There you go.
8891640	8891960	There you go.
8891960	8892840	You just did it.
8892840	8893160	Yeah.
8893160	8895480	And so he's, what happened?
8895480	8897880	So Jesus is there and it says,
8898440	8901960	the kid dropped the bandage and ran off.
8902600	8904280	That's exactly what that says.
8904360	8907400	He had dropped the bandage and ran off naked.
8907400	8907720	Okay.
8908440	8909240	Yeah.
8909240	8912440	So, and it says specifically in previous, in 51,
8912440	8914280	that it was epigumnos.
8914280	8917720	And epigumnos is on his private parts.
8917720	8921000	An epigumna, which is the bandage that's soaked in drugs.
8921000	8923240	The scene done, that's on there, right?
8923240	8923800	Why?
8923800	8925320	Why is Jesus with the kid?
8925320	8928280	Remember, when he first walks in the garden, he falls over,
8928280	8931000	he stumbles over and he's eyes in pain,
8931000	8933720	he's going through the exact same symptoms
8934280	8935880	that doctors will describe.
8935880	8936440	Jesus is?
8936440	8937880	Of the drug users.
8937880	8939240	Yeah, it's in this chapter.
8939240	8940200	It's in Mark 14.
8941160	8941240	Yeah.
8941240	8942040	So he's tripping.
8943400	8947560	He says that he's exceptionally fearful, right?
8947560	8950600	So it looks like he's in some kind of psychotic fear.
8951480	8955400	And he's screaming about, take it, don't, you know,
8955400	8956520	don't let me do it.
8956520	8957640	And he's with his kid.
8958280	8961640	He's with this kid at the time, right?
8961640	8964120	And he ends up with stuff on his face.
8965800	8969560	Stuff that is like big drops of porfuran.
8970360	8972120	Talking about bodily fluids.
8972120	8975560	Blood is how it's typically, no, that's how it's translated.
8976200	8977800	It's not the blood that he's got.
8977800	8978520	It's purple.
8979240	8981880	And he's got an antidote from the kids.
8982840	8985080	That's the galene is the kid.
8986520	8989160	He has to, Heracles has to have
8990120	8990680	Hylus.
8990680	8991800	He has to have his boy.
8991800	8993480	Zeus has to have Ganymede.
8994520	8996920	On the pripyx sign, they call it Ganymede's.
8998120	9000600	And the question is, do you drink from Ganymede's?
9003240	9003960	I don't.
9003960	9008040	Well, that's why you're not in charge.
9012040	9013000	Yeah, probably.
9017080	9018600	All right, bring me back down to earth here.
9019080	9020760	What's going on in the park again?
9020760	9025880	So Jesus has the purple on his face.
9025880	9027560	Yeah, he's got the purple on his face.
9028920	9032680	Jesus is having some sort of a psychotic fit, right?
9033720	9037560	He's having some kind of overwhelming emotional state.
9037560	9039160	It's hitting him so hard.
9039160	9040760	He's falling on the ground.
9040760	9044760	So he's got something on board that's causing him to stumble.
9044760	9046360	And it's 4 a.m. in the morning.
9046360	9047320	Yeah, it's 4 a.m.
9048040	9049480	Yeah, yeah.
9050840	9051400	And he's got...
9053400	9056680	He just came from the party with the kids.
9058280	9059080	He just came from the park.
9059080	9060280	Did one of the cops write this?
9060280	9061560	One of the cops that arrested him?
9061560	9062840	No, this is Mark.
9063880	9064760	Mark was there.
9064760	9069160	Well, no, Mark is telling you the secret things that you're not supposed to know.
9069160	9070920	So how does Mark know if he wasn't there?
9070920	9074040	Yeah, well, I don't care if he does or doesn't know.
9074040	9075560	The fact is he's saying them.
9076360	9076840	Okay.
9076920	9078280	And that's what's scary.
9078280	9080760	Well, how do we know Mark didn't have an extra ground against Jesus?
9080760	9083560	You want to make Jesus look like a bad guy
9083560	9085640	and make him look like a weirdo or a crazy person?
9085640	9086520	He could, maybe.
9086520	9087560	I don't know for all I know.
9088520	9091560	That's why I say we have to stick with exactly what the source is.
9091560	9093560	The point is that this is what...
9093560	9094440	Take it for what it's worth.
9094440	9095720	This is what Mark said.
9095720	9096280	Yeah, and he said...
9096280	9097400	And Mark was not there.
9098920	9101720	No, it was Peter, James, and John and the kid.
9101720	9102040	Okay.
9102760	9103240	Yeah.
9103240	9108760	Now, Mark, excuse me, where did Jesus come from before this in the scene?
9108760	9113320	He came from the place where he was with all the kids in the upper room.
9113320	9115720	That's where they came from, right?
9115720	9116600	In what room?
9116600	9117480	In the upper room.
9117480	9119560	It's just a way to refer to the place.
9119560	9121160	Look, it was shady, right?
9121160	9122280	This is part of the cops.
9122280	9125080	This is part of what the cops have on him, right?
9125080	9129320	He sent out a couple of his boys to go scout out a place.
9129320	9130280	And when he did, he told them,
9130280	9132920	hey, you're going to come to this guy and he's standing there.
9132920	9133880	And he's doing this.
9133880	9136680	And you got to approach him and say, Jesus's boys,
9137720	9140120	where do we need the place for Jesus to celebrate?
9140760	9142040	And he says, take them in here.
9142040	9143720	And he finds a guy and they take him up.
9143720	9145400	They get a shady back room business.
9146040	9148680	Remember, what does Jesus do with his boys?
9149640	9150440	We all know this.
9150440	9153160	That's why we're a crowd and we're angry.
9153160	9154680	We want Jesus crucified.
9154680	9157480	Now, you understand why there was a freaking crowd there.
9158840	9161800	Yeah, a little bit brutal with them, weren't they?
9161800	9163400	Well, yeah, they had good reason to be.
9164440	9171800	He was with those 12 underage kids in that room washing feet.
9174360	9176920	And you got to get it when you wash feet.
9176920	9178360	Have you ever washed somebody's feet?
9180680	9181720	Not that I can recall.
9181720	9183240	How about a 12-year-old boy?
9183240	9184600	No, absolutely not.
9184600	9185640	No, why wouldn't you?
9185640	9188040	Do you have some kind of problem with Jesus?
9190520	9191480	Apparently I do.
9191720	9193000	Okay, all right.
9193000	9195960	That's too bad, because he ends up in the garden after this
9196520	9198520	with the three older ones.
9198520	9201880	And he says, keep guard while he takes the young kid off
9201880	9203000	to the middle of the garden.
9203640	9205400	In the meantime, they're falling asleep
9205400	9207800	while Jesus is rolling around in agony
9207800	9212200	and doing what he's got to do to get for the galene from the boy.
9213080	9215000	And that's the mastery here.
9215000	9216920	The boy has some kind of antidote.
9217480	9219320	Galen describes pre-
9221960	9223160	Yeah, it's not milky.
9223720	9225080	Galen describes this.
9225080	9227480	Yeah, as long as the pre-girls
9229400	9232920	exudate from their breasts, you can milk.
9232920	9233880	You didn't know you could?
9233880	9234760	I did not know that.
9234760	9235640	Okay, we can.
9235640	9236200	Medically.
9237000	9240520	Probably has antibodies in it to whatever the venoms they're using.
9241080	9242680	Because these same girls, you cut them.
9242680	9243640	And this stuff?
9243640	9246520	You cut them and you wrap them with the snake venom.
9246520	9250760	And that's why we all hold up serpent, right?
9250760	9251560	We all know it.
9251560	9253720	You see my tattoo, right?
9253720	9254600	Which tattoo?
9254600	9256760	It doesn't say it was on a pole.
9257480	9258040	Show me the tattoo you're talking about.
9258040	9259880	It says it was on a tattoo.
9259880	9261000	I'm just in here.
9261000	9261640	Just in here.
9262200	9263480	I'm waxing, poetic.
9263480	9263960	I'm sorry.
9266120	9268600	Okay, so Galen talks about this
9270680	9271000	pre-
9272760	9274840	towards the boys and girls create.
9274840	9277640	And he talks about this being used as an antidote
9277640	9279480	to snake venom specifically.
9279560	9282040	It's the, and it's the Galene.
9283240	9286760	It's a Greek term that means the calm after the storm.
9287960	9288600	Galene.
9291080	9291480	And that-
9291480	9293880	What is the calm after the storm supposed to mean though?
9293880	9298600	Because, okay, remember how Jesus was screaming on the cross?
9299320	9301000	I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah.
9301000	9303400	You don't have to scream while you're on the cross, right?
9303400	9304440	You don't have to.
9304440	9305080	All right.
9305080	9309000	But he not only was a screamer, he was a dire early.
9309000	9311400	He didn't die of the crucifixion.
9311400	9315240	Jesus Christ did not die of a crucifixion.
9315240	9319720	He screams out and then boom, he's gone.
9319720	9321800	And it says the soldiers are surprised.
9321800	9323000	They reported the pilot.
9323560	9324920	And I'm like, he died early, bro.
9325960	9332040	Now this tells us that that vinegar that they offered to Jesus on the cross and the sponge,
9332040	9337080	that that was an antidote to the deep sauce.
9338040	9345400	The deep sauce is the horned viper of North Africa and it's venom makes you really thirsty.
9347480	9349160	They were trying to give him an antidote.
9349160	9352040	His followers, all those idiots that were around the cross,
9352040	9353640	they were trying to give him an antidote.
9354840	9356920	He didn't get it and he overdosed.
9356920	9357560	He's dead.
9357560	9358120	That's it.
9358120	9359480	How did they administer the snake venom?
9360360	9361800	Oh, that's the brother.
9362520	9363720	While he was on the cross?
9363720	9365000	No, no.
9365000	9366760	Oh, no, he had had it already by the time.
9366840	9369800	When he shows up in the garden, he's got it on his face.
9369800	9372360	Oh, so he had already been given this.
9372360	9373480	He gave himself the snake venom?
9373480	9377880	That's why he's going through the gyrations and feeling bad.
9377880	9379480	He's already going through it.
9379480	9380360	It was the voice.
9381160	9382280	That was the antidote to it.
9382280	9383080	It's the antidote.
9383080	9385640	And he says, he says, let this cup pass.
9385640	9390040	What is that cup in the apocalypse, the revelation?
9390040	9390680	Yes.
9390760	9397400	It says that cup is born up by that theriac, by that galene.
9398120	9399320	They're using the same.
9399320	9400280	It's one right.
9400280	9403800	They're using the same drugs in the apocalypse.
9403800	9408120	And the great enemy of God is that lady's cup,
9408120	9409960	which is full of penea.
9410600	9412920	You have to drink the boy's penea.
9413560	9414280	To survive.
9414280	9415560	In order to survive.
9415560	9417080	But why did he get this?
9417080	9419080	Why did he just take the snake venom in the first place?
9420040	9421080	Because he was a Christ.
9422440	9424840	So he overdosed.
9424840	9426280	How are you going to prophesy?
9426280	9427480	How are you going to prophesy?
9428040	9430120	He accidentally took too much is what you're saying.
9430120	9431640	No, I don't think he took too much.
9431640	9433000	I don't think he got an antidote.
9433000	9433720	The texts are not saying.
9433720	9434840	Oh, he just didn't get an antidote.
9434840	9438680	Yeah, I think that's why Nona says they were attempting that sponge,
9438680	9442120	which by the way, Nona's is corroborated by the geoponica.
9442120	9446760	The geoponica is a Byzantine farmer's manual, for lack of a better term.
9447400	9452760	And in it, it says the vinegar, the oxus, that is the remedy.
9452760	9455800	That's the common term for the remedy of the dipsass snake.
9457640	9460040	So it's the chemical knowledge is all there.
9460040	9461160	They were just using it.
9464760	9466680	Heracles likes it in the eyes though.
9467480	9468360	That's the thing.
9468360	9472120	But how much later did he die from that moment in the park?
9472120	9474200	How much time passed before he was crucified?
9474200	9476120	Yeah, it's at midday.
9476120	9477080	Isn't it at midday?
9477080	9478120	When's he shot out?
9478120	9480520	I think it's during an eclipse.
9480520	9482440	Because there was like the Last Supper, right?
9482440	9483400	Doing the eclipse.
9483400	9484760	Yeah, no, it's later.
9484760	9487320	Last Supper was the party all night naked, right?
9487320	9492840	It says specifically that Jesus was naked with his paidea, with his boys.
9492840	9494440	And he's always calling them boys.
9494440	9495800	He calls them my little ones.
9495800	9498200	I've got some verses here where he calls them my little ones.
9499640	9502120	So why is he, what is he doing?
9502120	9503720	He's perpetuating a cult.
9504760	9512280	That is a practical business is a, if it's illegitimate,
9512280	9514280	because it's prosecuted by the government.
9515800	9519000	And Julius Caesar was one of the people who cracked,
9519000	9522440	started cracking the back of it because they kidnapped him.
9523080	9524280	They were going to sell him off.
9525720	9529080	And he got a ransom and came back and killed them all.
9531080	9531560	Wow.
9531560	9532600	Crucified him.
9534600	9537160	So I'm surprised it took the snake venom so long to kill him.
9538280	9538680	Yeah.
9538680	9543480	I mean, that was, so it was more than 24 hours from when he was crucified,
9543480	9544520	from when he was found in the park?
9544520	9545560	No, he would have gotten it.
9545560	9548360	So he went to the party with the boys at night.
9548360	9552600	So that's when they would have done the administration of the flesh and the blood.
9552600	9552920	Okay.
9553720	9553960	Yeah.
9555000	9556440	And it was the next day he was crucified.
9556440	9562680	Remember the Ophites still fillate for the sacred communion.
9563480	9563960	Hmm.
9563960	9565320	Roman soldiers do too.
9566680	9567320	Yeah.
9567320	9568840	So the sacred communion.
9568840	9569640	Mithraic.
9569640	9569880	Yes.
9570600	9571240	Was, was a.
9571960	9575240	Your seed, your seed makes me high.
9577400	9582120	So they were, so not only was this stuff being used as an antidote,
9582120	9585960	they were also mixing it with other stuff to get high.
9585960	9587240	It's polypharmacy.
9587240	9589400	It's a ton of plants and animal substances.
9589400	9592440	Some of my life, but oh my God, gee, how did they figure that out?
9592440	9593400	No idea.
9593400	9600760	But didn't you, didn't you mention that that somehow the boy or, or either animals or humans
9600760	9603480	were used to endogenously create drugs?
9604360	9606680	They tested on roosters.
9606680	9612760	They tested drugs on roosters and they would give them poisons and then feed on the antidote,
9612760	9618600	cause them to swallow the antidote and to see if that, you know, Galen writes about that.
9618600	9620120	He says, you can do it on people too.
9620120	9620760	And they do.
9620760	9625560	So were they, were they giving the poisons to these people and then assuming that these people
9625560	9629000	would, their immune system would react in a certain way and they could pull out,
9629960	9634600	like for lack of a better term, like the antibodies that we're using to fight the poison
9634600	9637560	and use that to put into other people.
9638120	9641320	I think that's what's happening when they talk about breast milk.
9642600	9643080	Yeah.
9643080	9645160	These priestesses will give off a breast milk.
9645160	9646360	They cut their arms.
9646360	9648520	And they would give themselves drugs and then they would use them.
9648520	9651080	They would give themselves the venom over time in a wrap.
9651880	9652760	And then they,
9652760	9655880	And their body would start fighting against it and then they would use,
9655880	9659000	they would pull out the breast milk and use that as an anti-venom.
9659000	9660760	As an anti-venom, yeah, essentially.
9660760	9661720	Already anti-Christ.
9661720	9664120	It's not really a anti-venom either.
9664120	9667640	It's a, it is a balancing drug.
9667640	9667960	Right.
9668680	9671480	So you're not stopping the venom.
9671480	9676360	You're, you're basically the physician say you're stopping the negative symptoms.
9677320	9678280	Oh, wow.
9679640	9681240	Yeah. Polypharmacy.
9681240	9681640	Wow.
9682920	9684440	Yeah. Yeah.
9684440	9685000	Good stuff.
9685000	9690520	Let's get some hemlock and some henbane, some aconite, some really poisonous stuff.
9690520	9690760	And then-
9690760	9695320	Do you think that they're pharmaceutical knowledge and their drug knowledge?
9696680	9700200	If we understood all of that today, do you think it would,
9701800	9704120	it would advance our knowledge currently
9705080	9712280	in science and, and pharmaceuticals and, and the treatments of illnesses and disease?
9712280	9713400	Yeah, undoubtedly.
9713400	9715240	And I tell people just that.
9716760	9724440	They're thinking of making the human body, the producer of the drug, right?
9724440	9728280	Your body becomes, they're not thinking, okay, this person is depressed.
9728280	9731240	Therefore, I'm going to hit him with this drug, right?
9731240	9734760	This one drug, I'm going to see what happens to him and watch him, you know what I mean?
9734760	9735800	They want to kill themselves?
9735800	9738360	Oh, that's not going to work, right?
9738360	9739640	That's not what they're doing.
9739640	9747240	They're looking at using multiple drugs to basically create the potential that the human
9747240	9755320	body has to make its own communion, to be a source of health, right?
9755320	9757080	Sacred name of Rome.
9757080	9757720	Right.
9757720	9759320	Is that health?
9759320	9760600	It is that power?
9761480	9764360	It is that extended capacity?
9764920	9767960	It's why we insist that the vessels are virgins.
9769160	9772600	Yeah, they direct us.
9772600	9775320	It's why we insist that the vessels are virgins?
9775320	9775720	Yeah.
9775720	9776920	What do you mean by that?
9776920	9780760	Yeah, it's why that they have to be in a certain physical state,
9781400	9784360	because the person becomes the vehicle of the drug.
9785240	9788360	The cup is full of herpania.
9788360	9790360	That's her adjailate.
9792360	9796360	We are talking about the communion that is the adjailate of a virgin.
9796360	9797160	Right.
9797160	9798840	An irracular virgin.
9800360	9801160	Right.
9801160	9801960	Yeah.
9801960	9807960	And when I say virgin, I mean the kind that they put up on the statues, right?
9807960	9813960	Remember Athena, Athena, that's the exact image that they put up on the statues.
9814280	9819960	The adolon that they're creating is Athena, the virgin, holy virgin.
9819960	9823160	You don't worship the holy virgin?
9825240	9825720	Do I?
9828600	9829960	What is your religion?
9829960	9831080	I'm not really religious.
9831080	9831960	Yeah, I didn't think so.
9831960	9833560	It's a bunch of crap, isn't it?
9833560	9834040	I don't know.
9835160	9836200	Not according to you.
9836200	9836920	No.
9836920	9840280	According to you, it's way more than I thought it was.
9841160	9851560	So why in the Bible do they explain that the guys who were being crucified next to Jesus were just thieves?
9852360	9854120	Yeah, that's how they translate it.
9854120	9855160	That's how they translate it.
9855160	9856840	And again, this is not on purpose.
9856840	9858440	They just accidentally did this.
9858440	9859560	How are you going to translate it?
9859560	9864680	But isn't it convenient for them that they left all this out?
9864680	9867080	You are right on top of it, detective.
9867080	9869320	No, seriously, write your dissertation now.
9870120	9876120	Why would you choose between a kid having a linen garment and a bandage on his parts?
9877000	9885960	And why would you choose to present Jesus in a way that's not accurate to the sources?
9885960	9888360	I'm not saying to anybody's interpretation.
9888360	9889960	There's no room for interpretation here.
9889960	9893720	It's just one of the sources saying he's a lacedace.
9893720	9894760	Which is a pimp.
9894760	9896920	Which is basically a trafficker.
9898600	9899080	Yeah.
9899080	9900280	Which was looked down upon.
9900280	9901720	Which was frowned upon back then.
9901720	9904600	Because it's an active organized crime.
9906440	9907400	But a civil crime.
9908680	9910440	You've got boys of Galilee.
9910440	9914600	And those boys of Galilee, they're entrenched in the...
9914600	9921560	But didn't you say that when the people approached Jesus in the park, you call them cops?
9921560	9923160	They were like ancient cops?
9923160	9923640	Wrong cops.
9924280	9925960	Did they have chess cams?
9925960	9928200	No, but they had big weapons.
9928760	9929480	He notes it.
9929480	9937800	And according to Matthew, the first thing he said is I am not a lacedace or a trafficker.
9937800	9938200	Right.
9938200	9939960	He said I'm not a lacedace, man.
9940520	9942440	He says, why did you come out here?
9943000	9945640	Why did you come out here with all your heavy weapons?
9945640	9947080	Like I'm a lacedace.
9950680	9951480	Well, maybe he wasn't.
9951480	9953240	Maybe he was just trying to get the antidote.
9953240	9954040	Well, it could be.
9954040	9956440	But he's making a big deal about it, right?
9956440	9957320	For some reason.
9957880	9959320	And he's standing there right next to...
9959320	9961400	Contextually right next to a kid.
9962600	9967160	So, you know, maybe he's trying to give an answer for why there's a kid with him in a
9967160	9969240	public park at 4 a.m. that...
9969240	9970840	If I'm his lawyer, that's what I'm going to say.
9970840	9971800	Yeah, exactly.
9972360	9973000	Exactly.
9973560	9973880	Yes.
9974760	9981400	No, more importantly, what's that kid actually doing?
9981400	9983240	And I think that's the question.
9983240	9983960	What do you think?
9984440	9994200	The evidence only shows that he could be one of these boys who's providing the people who
9994200	9995960	are in the cult with the glane.
9995960	9996600	Okay.
9996600	10002200	With the thing that's going to balance whatever it is that Jesus has taken that's put him into
10002200	10002760	a state.
10003800	10005320	And yeah, it doesn't work.
10005320	10006520	And he ends up getting...
10006520	10008040	He ends up dying on the cross.
10008040	10012040	And, you know, if you notice in the resurrection, we just had Easter, you know.
10012040	10013640	Did anybody notice that it's another ball?
10013640	10015640	We just had an Easter and we just had an eclipse.
10015640	10016200	Yeah.
10016200	10019960	Another boy with Jesus in the tomb.
10019960	10021240	Don't you remember?
10021240	10021800	No.
10021800	10022120	Yes.
10022120	10023160	I never read the Bible.
10024120	10024280	Yeah.
10024280	10025160	Oh, you didn't.
10025160	10025720	That's right.
10026280	10028120	Oh, we got to start reading the Bible.
10028120	10028760	Should I read it?
10028760	10029640	Yeah, I think you should.
10029640	10030840	Which version should I read?
10030840	10031560	The Greek version.
10033400	10033640	Yeah.
10034440	10034760	Yeah.
10034760	10035800	Come to my class.
10035800	10036600	Come to my class.
10036600	10039320	I'll have you 20 weeks, 20 weeks.
10039320	10042040	I'll have you just enough to be dangerous.
10042040	10042840	20 weeks.
10042840	10043400	Yeah.
10043480	10044920	Well, no, most of my students are...
10044920	10045960	How do I go to your class?
10045960	10046360	40.
10046360	10046920	Is it online?
10046920	10047800	Like 40 weeks.
10047800	10050360	You don't have to show up to a university.
10050360	10051640	I'm working for a...
10051640	10054360	I'm working for a tutoring company.
10055800	10059560	Because once you've been ejected, it turns out, from a university,
10059560	10062200	pretty much you're running from that point on.
10063160	10065400	And I had people that I applied for jobs that were like,
10065400	10067880	why would you want to have this job?
10067880	10069960	Do you just want to be around young people?
10069960	10070520	You know what I mean?
10070520	10072520	I'm like, skip you.
10073080	10075000	Show me the sources.
10075000	10076040	My students loved it.
10076040	10083000	My last semester, my last semester, I had 90-some students petitioned
10083720	10088520	the administration to take my class that was capped at 30.
10089320	10090600	They had to form a petition.
10090600	10091400	They wanted it.
10092440	10096440	For a small liberal arts university, that's not bad.
10097400	10099000	100 people is a big audience.
10099000	10105400	I had 270, 350 at University of Wisconsin when I taught history of medicine.
10106520	10110040	But as a grad student, and I can very proudly say I'm the only grad student
10110040	10115000	to ever teach the level of a professor at the University of Wisconsin,
10115000	10118200	I taught a whole course on medical history and medical terminology.
10119080	10120200	Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
10120200	10123080	They wanted to know the dirty stuff, though.
10123080	10125080	It's the dirty stuff you got to bring out.
10125720	10127800	Why do you have to bring it out?
10127800	10129720	Yeah, you got to have women having it.
10131240	10133240	How do you get an antiquity?
10134440	10135160	You're chemical.
10136120	10137560	They got all sorts of the midwives.
10137560	10138760	They have all sorts of...
10138760	10140040	You know, you can regulate your own...
10140040	10144520	Wouldn't it be cool if you were a woman and you could regulate your own...
10146600	10147720	Yeah, we do that now, right?
10147720	10148360	Yeah, it's called...
10148360	10151800	We have like IUDs, we have these like little metal prongs.
10151800	10153880	No, I mean, but chemically, chemically, so that you...
10153880	10155080	Yeah, those things have chemicals on them.
10155080	10160200	You could turn up your flow and turn down your flow, right?
10160200	10160760	Dial it.
10161720	10164280	Yeah, why would you want to be doing that?
10164280	10166200	Because there's a point of ecstasy.
10167160	10170040	People don't realize an antiquity in a woman's...
10170040	10172520	There's a point where she is close to the gods.
10173160	10174120	There's an eclipse.
10175240	10177640	Yeah, there's an eclipse and when you have the eclipse,
10177640	10180200	you have the power of that moon blocking that sun.
10180760	10184760	Is that why women, when right before they have their...
10184760	10185320	They get so...
10187000	10191640	Is it because of Aphrodite, they would say, and my answer would be yes.
10191640	10193560	Okay, that's the eclipse.
10193560	10195240	And you have to...
10195240	10196440	No, that's the pre-eclipse.
10196440	10206200	And you have to channel that within a woman's being in order to be a proper mate.
10208600	10209000	Yeah.
10209000	10213720	You have to channel that within a woman's being to be a proper mate.
10213720	10215080	You got to make her ovulate.
10218280	10220200	It's all about that production, right?
10220200	10222120	Even the city and women who hunt men.
10223000	10226120	The only reason they give them the satirian was to cause them to be able to...
10227800	10229400	Because they're already paralyzed.
10231000	10234760	Can you imagine being paralyzed in a...
10234760	10236280	No, how can...
10236360	10240520	After someone has given you a drug that induces psychosis,
10240520	10244280	they call it the pan, the fury, the fear.
10245000	10247560	So they've put you in a state of psychotic fear
10248200	10250280	and they've given you a drug that gives you...
10251880	10253720	And they manually bring you to...
10258040	10258600	For what?
10260680	10261560	Yeah, for what?
10261560	10262920	That's got to be a state to be...
10263480	10265480	I mean, if you could take somebody there.
10267480	10267960	Hmm.
10267960	10270040	Is that what caused the enlightenment?
10271880	10273400	Was it people sitting around?
10273400	10274040	You know what I mean?
10274040	10276040	Was it people sitting around who followed?
10276040	10278040	You got to the Templars.
10278040	10281160	Templars are licking an ant.
10281160	10283160	I mean, an ant head.
10285160	10285640	Yeah.
10285640	10286840	They're looking at them?
10286840	10287320	Licking.
10287320	10288040	Licking them.
10288040	10288520	Yeah.
10288520	10289000	Hmm.
10289000	10290440	Initiates lick.
10290760	10295800	There's a purple cross on the bottom of that...
10297640	10302040	Where they give the medicine, drizzles out in those initiates.
10302840	10304760	That's where they start to get exposed to it.
10304760	10307160	And you can do it, they said, in the papers,
10307160	10309240	that they're the court papers, so to speak.
10310760	10313480	The investigation papers.
10314680	10315080	You can...
10315080	10316040	The Templars were...
10316680	10318760	It's one of the reasons they were persecuted so heavily.
10319000	10320040	Hmm.
10320040	10322520	It's because they were having them lick their...
10322520	10324280	Or they could also lick the...
10324280	10324920	It's itself.
10325720	10327960	And get that purple stain.
10327960	10337240	What sort of pushback or backlash have you gotten from the mainstream academic institutions
10337240	10339160	for talking about all this stuff?
10339800	10340200	None.
10340840	10341320	None?
10341320	10341880	None.
10341880	10342120	No.
10343000	10344280	It's better to ignore.
10345000	10345240	Right?
10345240	10345800	It takes them...
10345800	10348120	A professor from Brown told me it'll take them 10 years
10348120	10349560	to catch up with your research.
10351080	10353000	And they're just behind...
10353000	10354600	Didn't something happen with the church?
10354600	10356280	Didn't the church or something come...
10356280	10358200	Make a statement about you specifically?
10358200	10360840	I was investigated by the Catholic Church.
10360840	10362920	You were investigated by the Catholic Church?
10362920	10363560	When?
10363560	10366840	For when I worked for the St. Mary's University.
10366840	10367640	Really?
10367640	10369080	And how did you find out about this?
10369640	10372840	I had a Monsignor come to me and say,
10372840	10374360	Hey, I've been to...
10374360	10376600	He was one of my students, right?
10377560	10380520	Keeping tabs on everything and learning Greek.
10380520	10382040	He got to learn Greek in the process.
10383080	10384520	I hope he kept it up to this day.
10385560	10388040	He told me, he said, I've been to five meetings about you.
10389400	10389800	What?
10392360	10394200	I couldn't help but laugh, you know what I mean?
10394200	10396200	At this time, my professor's coming to me going,
10396200	10397000	You're going to get fired.
10397560	10398520	You can't get fired.
10398520	10401160	And oh, by the way, we support what you're doing,
10401160	10403960	but we're not going to put our asses out there.
10403960	10404360	Right.
10405160	10407560	I thought, well, cowards, but whatever.
10407560	10409080	I had to stay true to the sources.
10409800	10410360	So I did.
10410360	10413960	So the Catholic Church, look, a student on campus
10414840	10418280	claimed that she woke up at 4.35 in the morning.
10419960	10422840	And that I was floating.
10424120	10426360	I floated through the door of her dorm
10426920	10431160	and hovered over her roommate and had a chat with her roommate
10431960	10433480	as I hovered over her bed.
10433480	10437480	And then she woke up and made a noise.
10437480	10441320	And I extended my hand and paralyzed her.
10442040	10452280	Now this student was released from school due to the mania.
10452840	10454600	It was a middle discharge.
10454600	10455880	This was one of your students.
10455880	10457320	No, she wasn't one of my students.
10457320	10459800	She was one of the students that was working on the play,
10460440	10465160	the medea that I was the contracted advisor for.
10465800	10470760	And the student that I allegedly hovered over and made cosmic love to
10473400	10477880	was the lead role as the younger form.
10477880	10478680	We had two forms.
10478680	10482040	We had a younger, the one that killed her brother, and then an older form.
10485080	10486920	And so they had a hearing.
10487880	10489960	So who did she tell this to?
10489960	10491000	Who did she tell the story to?
10491000	10492040	Administration.
10492040	10494600	And then how did the Catholic Church get involved?
10494600	10497320	The Catholic Church had an inquiry and the bishop had to come and sit.
10497320	10498440	I'm sure it was hilarious.
10499560	10501400	I had a group of people before.
10501400	10504040	The inquiry had a group of people come to me and say,
10504040	10505880	I was like, who are these people in my office?
10506520	10510440	And they said, we know who you are and we know what you're doing.
10511160	10513320	And the demons that you're working with.
10513320	10515000	And I was like, excuse me?
10515960	10517880	Right, excuse me?
10519400	10522520	And then there was the inquiry, the formal inquiry.
10522520	10524840	And it was two, I'm told it was two charges.
10525640	10529880	Number one was demon possession, which personally I think that's pretty cool.
10529880	10531080	That's pretty, that's pretty metal.
10531080	10531720	No, it is.
10531720	10532360	Yeah.
10532360	10538200	Number two, it was, I was opening portals to wear.
10540920	10541720	I don't know.
10541720	10543720	But do you think I would be a Catholic?
10544680	10545640	Can you find this?
10545640	10547080	Is this published anywhere?
10547080	10548040	Yeah, it is.
10550600	10554760	I got to finish though, so people can have a little sympathy for me.
10554760	10558520	I was fired after the production of the Medea.
10558520	10559720	It was wildly successful.
10559720	10562360	People said it was the best thing they ever produced, right?
10562360	10569080	But I had, I had furious choruses of Catholic university students pointing those.
10569640	10570200	What?
10570200	10573880	Yes. They said they wanted it accurate.
10573880	10576680	So we brought in the priapus.
10576680	10578840	We brought in what they call the faschinum.
10578840	10580600	It's a rum and implement.
10580600	10587400	It's a, and when you pointed at somebody, like a priest who's involved in doing naughty
10587400	10593240	things to children, you are throwing off from the stage that corruption.
10593240	10594840	You're purifying your audience.
10594840	10597480	And it was quite successful.
10598040	10604040	It succeeded to the point that, you know, the Monsignor that I knew, I probably shouldn't
10604040	10607160	put his, he probably couldn't put his, no, he's a big guy.
10610600	10613400	He said, look, you know, he brought up the book.
10613400	10620040	I had just published a book that was about ritual in the early church.
10621240	10623960	And apparently that was what was making all the hullabaloo.
10624680	10630600	The story of me flying through the air and all of that just kind of added a, added an
10630600	10634680	atmosphere of, it was like religious frenzy.
10635560	10642520	And the Monsignor just explained it to me that the charismatic wing was quite active in that
10642520	10645080	area. And he didn't like the way the direction it was going.
10645080	10646840	And I just happened to be one of their targets.
10647800	10650520	So that's why, you know, they, they did what they did.
10651320	10654760	And, you know, once you've been ejected, you can't go back.
10654760	10656440	There's no way. I'm Ronin now.
10656440	10659400	So what I do is I use the same skills.
10659400	10660920	You're what now? What was the word you used?
10660920	10661400	Ronin.
10661400	10662040	Ronin.
10662040	10665720	It's a Japanese samurai who's lost his lord.
10666440	10669720	He's got no protection of the institution, nothing like that.
10669720	10670040	Yeah.
10670680	10671480	What is this?
10671480	10672680	Okay. This is an article.
10673560	10676520	All right. So, I mean, I'm sure Hillman can put more.
10676520	10681640	Fired over the phallus, a junk to St. Mary's University of Minnesota says his contract
10681640	10686200	wasn't renewed and he was fired from a custodial job on campus due to a play prop.
10686760	10687000	All right.
10687000	10688440	This is, now get this.
10688440	10689880	During the week, this is it.
10690600	10694680	Hillman was contracted by the Catholic University this fall to translate
10695240	10700520	Senes' version of Medea, a story largely about a women's revenge on a husband who's abandoned her
10701080	10703480	for a more politically advantageous marriage.
10703480	10707320	But Hillman, technically the production's playwright also highlighted Medea's undertones
10707320	10714120	about greed and suggested that the cast members deliver admonishing lines about corporate greed
10714120	10721080	while pointing fascina at the audiences used in the ancient world in certain rights and
10722120	10730840	to ward off evil, fascina are supposed to embody the divina power of the phallus.
10731320	10737240	In that spirit, the props being prepared for the show looked distinctively like
10738920	10740920	one of the props pictured at the right.
10742120	10749240	There was one that was six feet long that they carried in procession into the performance.
10749240	10754200	Now remember, these are sold out too. All of our performances were totally sold out.
10754200	10754680	Really?
10754680	10760280	Yeah. And they said it was the best thing the theater department had ever produced.
10761640	10766760	So when I was fired after this, people were like, what's going on?
10766760	10774680	And when I was fired, the American professors, it's like a union,
10775320	10779080	the National Association of University Professors
10781720	10785560	sent a couple of people out to inquire about my termination.
10786520	10791480	And they ruled that I was improperly terminated.
10793080	10797160	This was just because of what I was teaching. I had nothing to do with anything else.
10798120	10804280	So I thought that was nice, that the AUP would come out and do that.
10804280	10806120	They had the international one do the same thing.
10806680	10813080	There's an article on fire, which is the freedom for free speech on campus.
10815640	10820280	The act of the St. Mary's University firing me got them put on the
10821000	10824360	top 10 list of bad places for free speech.
10824920	10825320	Really?
10825320	10829000	Yeah. The USA Today is the one that publishes it.
10829000	10830040	Can you find that?
10830040	10834600	Yeah. It's going to be on there. And they made the top 10 list because of what they did to me.
10835160	10836760	Wow. No way.
10836760	10841240	So, and there's quite an article. They had me in a place where I had to even work.
10842200	10846440	And I didn't mind because I don't mind doing dirty jobs, but I used to clean toilets.
10847560	10852040	I used to clean toilets because the professor's salary they paid me was not enough to feed my
10852040	10856360	children. So you can see why the Monsignor was like, okay.
10856920	10863080	How did that affect you personally after this all happened?
10863960	10874760	You know, it shut off my, you know, every time something happens, it's happened in my life.
10876680	10880520	It's helped to build, to forge my path ahead.
10880520	10885560	When my head of my department told me the Romans wouldn't do such a thing as take drugs.
10885560	10887480	He said, why would they do it back then?
10887480	10889960	Why would they do that back then when we don't do it today?
10889960	10891640	Right? Something to that effect?
10891720	10894200	She said they just wouldn't do such a thing.
10895400	10896840	They just wouldn't do such a thing.
10898680	10902840	When she said that, I realized, okay, I've got to go investigate everything there is to know
10902840	10909880	about drug use in the ancient world. I've got to find the question. I've got to dig the hole.
10909880	10916440	And I've got to find that reality that lies there beneath the ideas of scholars.
10917400	10920040	That real history. I want to see it. I want to see it.
10922840	10926120	One thing I wanted to ask you about that we haven't talked about is
10927480	10929880	Lucian's writing on Alexander the False Prophet.
10929880	10931320	Yes. Good. Good. Nice.
10932040	10935560	Can you talk about that? Who is Alexander the False Prophet?
10935560	10937560	A real person? Or was this just a story?
10937560	10942440	Yeah, no. He's a real person. And Lucian is a real person writing about another real person
10943080	10947960	in Cappadocia up on the Black Sea again. They're up on the Black Sea.
10947960	10958520	And he started a cult, an Iraqi cult. And Lucian says, you know, look, I hate to write to you
10958520	10961320	about bad people. History should be awful of good people.
10962120	10966040	Right? But just like this other guy, he says, wrote about this lace days. I'm going to write
10966040	10971080	to you about a lace days. Like, he's the worst. He's the worst of these guys.
10971080	10978360	And it turns out, when he's a boy, he's entered into the trade and he becomes,
10978360	10982520	because he's known for being very good looking. He's got a really good look to him.
10983320	10984440	Alexander the False Prophet.
10984440	10989080	Yeah. Right. Right. And he travels around. He gets the attention of a couple of very wealthy
10989080	10995880	women who set him up making oracles. And he has imported to himself boys,
10996280	11003160	young boys, who are exceptionally handsome. And he has a very specific list of what they should
11003160	11007320	and shouldn't look like. You know, they'll take the short ones, take the tall ones, you know?
11007960	11011880	Take the ones that have problems on their skin. Take the ones that are smooth.
11012680	11013880	Right? That kind of thing.
11013880	11015640	You're talking about like ancient eugenics.
11016440	11024680	Yeah. Kind of like, keep your lover, keep your lover in the best ideal form. Remember,
11024760	11028920	the gods are just the ideal. That's why you see a lot of depictions of the gods.
11028920	11033880	Is this, you know, jacked. Yeah. And young. And young.
11033880	11037320	Yeah. That's weird about the, about the god, the depictions of the gods and like,
11037320	11043800	even the sculpture, like David and Zeus is, they were all like these big jacked warriors,
11043800	11049720	but they had small wieners. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what happens when you spend time with the
11049720	11054600	Queen of the Amazons, man. Hercules did for a year. She made him walk around in a dress.
11055800	11058680	You know why? Wait, wait. Who made who walk around in a dress?
11058680	11063560	Oh, the Queen of the Amazons. And if you think the Amazons are myth, they're not.
11064360	11069960	We have Athenian graveyards full of people that they killed. So these are, again, those warring,
11071160	11076040	roaming tribes around the Black Sea that just plunder. They live by plunder. And by the way,
11076040	11081800	the Thracians, the Thracians are big on the eunuch trade. And making eunuchs is a big deal.
11081800	11086040	And that's why Odysseus is so. What's a eunuch? When I cut somebody's
11086840	11092120	off, I turn them into a eunuch. Got it. Because what am I doing? I'm changing the pharmacy.
11092120	11096440	Right. Right. That testosterone is going to change whatever the.
11096440	11098840	So when you cut off the eunuch, they have no more testosterone?
11098840	11102120	Yeah. And what, what's so good about that? Well, what's so great about a eunuch?
11102120	11106840	Because then you can use their s**t, right? You can't use it otherwise.
11107800	11110120	So it's got to have no, it's got to have no s**t for a minute.
11110120	11114120	Yeah. It's got to have no testosterone. That's what they need. So they're turning the person
11114120	11117800	into the dispensary. They're turning the person into this dispensary of drugs.
11117800	11119880	Right. And here. A drug factory, essentially.
11119880	11122040	Yeah. A communion. A place of communion.
11122040	11123960	Okay. Yeah.
11123960	11126760	Wow. Yeah. It's intricate tech.
11126760	11129320	So, okay. Alexander the False Prophet.
11129400	11132920	Yeah. He wanted these perfect looking people, tall, no skin abrasions.
11132920	11138040	Yeah. So he runs a business and it ends up, you know, in a bad way. One of the kids,
11138040	11143720	he thinks is murdered and, or he hasn't murdered and it's just, it's not good.
11143720	11148920	Looks bad for him. And that's the moral lesson that Lucian is trying to teach,
11149720	11155080	is what happens when you become profit driven and you have no, you have no,
11155960	11162040	you have nothing to stop you. No breaks. And that's this guy, Alexander the False Prophet.
11162040	11166360	But it's important to note that he's a prophet because that's what prophets are in antiquity.
11166360	11173080	There are not prophets that are not jacked in. Prophet, prophesying is taking drugs.
11174280	11180520	There's no, there's no way around it. It's a part of doing what they said, going into the
11180600	11185880	Eremon. And what is that Eremon? It's the wilderness. You know what I mean? When you're in that,
11186440	11193080	you're in that void. Mark talks about the void. Yeah. Where Jesus meets
11193880	11198840	Lucifer and converses with Lucifer. You didn't know, yeah, it's in the Bible. He, yeah.
11199560	11210040	Yeah. He, he sees Uranos split and out of Uranos comes that dove with that milk and he ends up
11210040	11216520	going into the Eremon where he is tempted, tested, tried by Lucifer.
11218680	11222520	Yeah. Yeah. So he's going through it. Jesus, good for him. He's going through the,
11223080	11227320	he's doing the whole right, right? He's, he's really practicing. That Baptist is really
11227320	11232600	practicing. And what is standard issue of every Baptist according to juvenile, the standard issue
11232600	11244920	is a shaped cup. You can put it, it's called the vitreum priapeum or the glass and every
11244920	11253720	Baptist carries them. That's why they take the kids out. It's the pedorasty of the ancient
11253720	11260600	Greek religion sleeping in. And that's why Paul is screaming, you can't do this. That dude is
11260600	11267640	sleeping with his stepmother. It's right. And that's what Paul says. Yeah. Paul's immune to
11267640	11273720	viper venom, right? Okay. Yeah. Yes. He gets bitten by a viper and the locals are like, you're gonna
11273720	11280920	die. And he doesn't. He's got the antidote. Yeah. Cause he's obviously using, right? Right. Mithridates
11280920	11287400	was the great king who couldn't be poisoned to death because he was taking the stereocall at
11287400	11292920	the time. He had constant antidote on board. Right. And Marcus Aurelius, when we get down to Marcus
11292920	11298680	Aurelius, people are saying about him that he's looking better ever since Galen started him on
11298680	11304760	the theriac. He's looking better. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's doing something like, whoa, nice improvement
11304760	11310120	there. And he said, Galen says in his treatise to Pisa, remember, this is not made up literature.
11310120	11316840	These are accounts of Roman medicine. And in it, he says, yeah, that's gonna, this was used after
11316840	11325000	Marcus Aurelius too. But they acknowledged it more. It's good stuff, man. He says Cleopatra
11325000	11332360	was in the game too. She couldn't. Who is Lucifer? He's the dawn bringer. Yeah. They first called
11332360	11340360	him Lucifer and he was a girl. You ever see a girl with a big beard? I mean, I saw a girl with a
11340360	11344600	little earlier. He showed me a statue of one. That's the morning star. What was her name again?
11344600	11349320	Venus. Tell me more about Lucifer. Yeah. He's the morning star and he's the one who guards the
11349320	11354280	gate. They call him, he's way older than Christianity, right? Or Judaism. He's way older. He's part of
11354280	11361560	the Saturnian religion. And what is that? That's the mystery that revolves around sun, moon, and earth.
11362200	11366440	So it's a very, it's all constellations and stuff like that and all solar stuff and
11367000	11372760	yearly festivals and whatnot. That's Saturnian, the worship of Cronus. They call it the golden age.
11372760	11380920	It's before the Zeus enters and takes over, right? Zeus. On Olympus, right? It's before he takes over.
11380920	11386600	So Lucifer comes from that older generation and he's a dawn bringer. What does everybody's
11386600	11391000	genre mean? What does that mean? It means you bring dawn. You herald. Bring the new day. Yes,
11391000	11396520	you herald the dawn. The dawn is that funny moment when you don't have any sunlight, direct sunlight
11396520	11399400	and it's kind of a, they talked about it as a spark in the ether,
11400200	11405000	spin theory. They call this spark. A spark in the ether. And that's what you're preserving.
11405560	11409880	When you meet as a Christian, you get up early in the morning. This is how they originally met.
11409880	11414840	They get up at sunrise, right? No, that's why you have the associations of sunrise with,
11414840	11419640	you know, Easter and all that kind of stuff like that. They get there early because they're dawn
11419640	11426520	bringers, right? Jesus is saying in the apocalypse, he says, I am the morning star.
11427160	11435240	Jesus says that. Yes. Yes. And he's got a bra on too. A what? A bra. A bra. Yeah. Yeah. It's
11435240	11442360	a special device. So what do you make of that? Why did he say he was the morning star? Because he
11442360	11447880	has to be. If he's going to be the Christ, if he's going to be what the one in the position
11448440	11453720	to be elevated as Christ, he's got to be the morning star. That's the title. They're all
11453720	11461640	dawn bringers, right? Christos is a dawn bringer, right? So yeah, he's got to. He's following at
11461640	11466920	least the people who are writing about him and John, John's apocalypse, at least they're making
11466920	11473080	that association. Yeah. Notice that they've got Filtra too. The angels, when an angel pours out
11473640	11480600	a Filtra, right? Or Filtron. When they pour it out, that's a drug containing device.
11481080	11491480	So the angels that pour out the plagues, those are drugs. The beast is called Therion.
11491480	11498600	So how did Lucifer become a bad guy? How did Lucifer become a bad guy? Because God's a liar.
11498600	11506680	Because God's Zeus? Yeah. Zeus. What did Zeus do to him? He lied. How? He closed the eyes of his
11506760	11516360	Ewa. That was what? That was Ewa, his Eve. In order to make the second Adam, right? Don't you know
11516360	11525960	we're dealing with sacrifice? Huh? Yeah. God killing his only son. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right? In order to
11525960	11532360	elevate him to what they call the Soter. That's the savior. That's where we get for savior.
11533080	11542360	Right? That's an old title for Lucifer, the female Donbringer. That's why he's wearing a bra.
11546760	11549160	This is hard to, a lot of this is really hard to digest.
11551560	11555160	That's what that boy thought, probably. What is the word Satan come from?
11555160	11558840	Now, people will say, oh. You always say in your videos or your
11558920	11563480	documentaries that you make on your YouTube channel, you always say Hail Satan. Right,
11564200	11568120	indeed. But you also claim that you don't worship Satan. I don't have a religion,
11568120	11577640	do you? I'm way too lazy for that. I don't think you're lazy, man. No, no. Yeah, no. I'm not promoting
11577640	11582360	a religion and that's something I tell everybody. I tell everybody don't. I don't want you to buy
11582360	11588040	my books. I don't have any reason to condescend. I don't have anything to set up here and pulled
11588040	11593720	up and say, you should buy this. No, what is out there is a lot of Greek texts and I'm a
11593720	11598920	classicist and my job is to protect those texts and to get you the integrity of what's in them.
11598920	11605720	And what you have read from the Bible that you have read in English is a mistranslation.
11605720	11614680	It's the best hack job. At worst, it's a purposeful obscuring obfuscation of the actual history.
11614760	11617000	And when you start looking at Jesus who's screaming,
11618840	11621640	you know, when he's getting arrested that he's not one of these
11622200	11629880	lacedaces. Yeah. Then he's, you know, you see the real, all of a sudden the real becomes obvious
11629880	11635240	and that's what I think is the job of a classical philosopher is to preserve these texts and get
11635240	11641800	them to you. So what does Hail Satan mean to you? It's the gadfly. What's the gadfly again?
11641800	11646360	It's the punch in somebody's face. It's the, it's the oistress that you need.
11646360	11652760	There's a reason you get beaten with whips. It does something. Yeah. It does something,
11652760	11657640	you know, not in a decide kind of way. It's shock, it shocks you. Yeah. It brings you,
11657640	11662600	I don't know, it does something chemically to you, right? Causes you to release something in your
11662600	11668120	blood. You ever get the thirst for the blood? Do you know what it's like to eat? Do you think,
11668120	11673080	first of all, do you think it's possible that you give me the address where they do this? But
11673880	11680600	they eat, they take that freckled red-haired kid, and what we have taxed for this, by the way,
11680600	11687400	is called the day ought to wallow on you and you take this red-haired freckled kid and you pump
11687400	11694360	him full of drugs and you roast him slowly raising his body temperature and you bleed him as his
11694360	11701560	body temperature rises and that blood is communion blood. That's what you get the taste for. Now,
11701560	11706680	why he has to be red-haired and freckled? I mean, not freckled, red-haired and pimpled. He's got
11706680	11710280	to have pimples, which makes you think, well, you got to use a teenage kid for this or something.
11710840	11714680	Something about the pimples, you know, it has to do with hormones because it's right at that time
11714680	11719560	that whatever is going on in his body is producing those, those pimples, but that's what you got to
11719640	11729160	use. Where does this come from? The day ought to wallow on you. It's a recipe for Medea's communion
11729880	11736520	and it is sandwiched in an Arthurian tale, which is terrible. It's terribly written. It's lightened,
11736520	11741800	12th century lightened and it's awful. It's awful. It's like torture to read it.
11743400	11749400	But what sort of Greek sources does it come from? We don't know. Oh, you don't know?
11749400	11753720	No, nobody knows. Is this what comes from these modern-day
11755480	11760200	conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family trying to
11761240	11767080	traffic young kids to drink their blood and to get an adrenochrome to make them young,
11767080	11773720	bohemian grove and all this stuff? Yeah. I have no idea, to be honest. Do you think maybe that
11773800	11780920	culturally influenced? Yeah, I have no idea, honestly. I don't. Do you pay attention to
11780920	11786360	any of that stuff? I see it and when I do, I laugh because it's like, look, they're talking about
11786360	11795400	cults that I can show you, right? Eustatius talks about the cult that takes that nine-month-old and
11795400	11800600	delivers it forcefully and then bleeds it. Yeah, flashing blood, man. How do you think?
11800600	11803800	Why do you think Jesus is sitting there and saying, you got to drink my flesh and eat my blood?
11804840	11810360	Right? It's part of the cult. Yeah, I'm glad he wasn't like the Ophite saying, you got to drink my
11811000	11816280	girls, you know, when you went to Catholic Church today, they would be giving you some rice pudding
11816280	11824120	or something. I don't know. How often are you reading new stuff and new texts? Every day.
11824120	11828520	Every day you read new stuff? Every day. The corpus metachorum gricorum is huge.
11829000	11834440	And it's got a whole bunch of works that nobody reads. Galen, I can never finish reading Galen.
11834440	11838920	I've just, you know, there's no way I'm going to. I'm just specializing on his drug works.
11839720	11844920	I think that's what I'm, you know, my future is. He's got lots of good stuff, but I'm looking at
11844920	11851640	Nicander. I'm looking at Nicander and I'm looking at a lot of Eretias of Cappadocia. These are all
11851640	11856680	pharmacologically oriented. Nicander is a priest, though. So he gets into the priestess, though.
11856680	11860920	It's pretty cool. So what does this all mean? Everything you've learned, everything we've
11860920	11865480	talked about today, all the drug use and all this cult rituals in the ancient world, what are the,
11867080	11872520	what would be the implications on the modern world today if we were to be enlightened by this
11872520	11882360	information? Yeah, it means our religious background is rooted in a guy that we venerate. And that guy
11883160	11896200	was somebody who used children. He was involved with drugs. It's a mystery that was nothing like
11897560	11901640	going to church today. At least I don't think it is. Maybe somebody's other, but
11901640	11907080	I don't think it's like that anymore. And the fact is we have built a society based on a lie,
11908040	11914040	on a complete lie. And it's such a hypocritical lie because the very guy that you venerate,
11914040	11920680	I mean, dude, he's arrested in a public park with a kid. Danny, if you got it, if you and I got
11920680	11927160	arrested in a public park with 12 kids, what do you think we would be? We sure as hell wouldn't
11927160	11932040	be right. Are you the only one that said, are you, are you the only one that's translating
11932040	11937000	this stuff this way? No, no, there's other people. I'm just the first one to have guts to do it.
11937000	11943960	Are there other classicists or linguists who can, who have translated these same texts you
11943960	11948120	are corroborating what you're saying? Yeah, Dr. Rock, for example, and that's why I always throw
11948120	11953800	him out as my corroborator. Dr. Rock will tell you, because he and I translated
11954600	11960600	apocalypse together and I showed him my breakdown and outline of it. And so he can tell you,
11960600	11965480	all I'm doing is translating. I'm not, none of this stuff is made up. It's just straight up
11965480	11971400	translations, but it's translations coming from somebody who's actually read the medical side
11971400	11978040	and read the science side and can talk about what the terms are actually doing until classes get
11978040	11984760	off their lazy rumps and stop trying to sell books. They're not going to, they're not going to,
11985560	11992520	classicists infamously hate Bible studies. Yeah, I mean, they're kind of a joke. Biblical scholars
11992520	11995800	are kind of a joke with classicists and they know that if they get into that
11996440	12000600	patty, there may be some landmines in there. You know what I mean? Are you ever going to write
12000600	12006040	another book? Dr. Rock asked me to write another book, but I think what I'm doing is with Lady
12006040	12011560	Babylon, I'm trying to write the book through a different medium. Yeah, a different medium. Yeah.
12012280	12016680	Yeah, hopefully Lady Babylon is your website and your YouTube channel. It's my YouTube channel.
12016680	12019400	Yeah, and I'm not. Why do you call it Lady Babylon?
12020280	12027640	Because Lady Babylon is that first Christ. I told you, I love Jesus, man. And Lady Babylon is that
12027640	12032200	first Bronze Age Christ. That's actually the oldest Greek that we have for Christ goes to her.
12033080	12038360	She's that Medwa, that Medea. She's the one who has that knowledge. It's such a breakthrough for
12038360	12045560	humans and brings that water of life. That's Lady Babylon. She was Queen of Babylon. The Lady Babylon
12045560	12052680	is, she's the one who holds up the cup and that cup is full of her. And that's what causes us,
12052680	12059640	that the beast is able to cause us to enter into that communion. So if that's the history,
12060440	12064520	because that's what the texts say, you can say, well, what does it, what does all of it mean? It
12064520	12070120	means that we have texts that say this and welcome to the museum. That's what's really important is
12070120	12078840	that you see these texts. You see Jesus arrested with a boy. I sent a letter to about 45 heads of
12078840	12087240	seminaries and professors asking them about these very passages saying, who is this kid? And what
12087240	12092120	is this? Have you ever seen this medicated bandage? And do you know anything about the mystery, the
12092120	12100360	pagan mystery? And the universal answer, except for from one woman was, that's interesting,
12100360	12104600	is what she said. Everybody else, you know, was negative. They're not going to get into this.
12105800	12110360	Biblical scholars can't handle it, first of all. And second of all, they don't want to,
12110360	12116440	because it's dangerous, man. What are people going to do? Back when this thing was in the,
12116680	12121960	when Pope Gregory came out in one of his homilies, he said, this is not,
12122760	12128680	we're going to excuse Mary for having the sex drugs, number one. And number two, that kid that
12128680	12136040	was with Jesus was his cousin. Kissing cousins. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. But it was
12136040	12142120	an excuse. It's a way to excuse it because the reality of what Jesus was is far harder to bear.
12142920	12147960	Right. And, but when you go back and read the gospels now, now people and people have told me
12147960	12153720	this, oh my God, other things suddenly make sense. Like why people were telling, we're saying, hey,
12153720	12161080	he's touching, stop touching. Right. All that stuff makes sense now. Why is Jesus saying, hey,
12161080	12165560	if you're a real Christian, you're going to lift up these vipers and you're going to drink
12165640	12173080	thanosemone, you're going to drink a drug, a death inducer. Jesus says you will drink
12173080	12179800	death inducer. That's a drug. And he's saying it. This is what you're going to do. People don't,
12179800	12184040	they read a fairy tale. I want the real Jesus. I don't want a fairy tale Jesus. I want the one
12184040	12189800	that was arrested with a kid. And I want to know that my society has based its morality on that,
12189800	12199480	dude. Wow. Powerful stuff, man. Where can people pirate your books?
12200120	12205640	Yeah. You know what? I think I'm just going to post my book somewhere in electronic copy because
12205640	12212760	my students found it. Don't buy my book. Just get an electronic copy if you really are interested.
12212760	12219080	And most importantly, what I want to draw people to is I bring these sources out there
12219080	12228120	in Lady Babylon. And yeah, it's my final portrait. And I hope that, you know, I hope to
12228920	12233880	that people will be able to appreciate the museum again, that people will worship and honor the
12233880	12239080	muse because that's what our society and our gorgeous democracy, our gorgeous democracy
12239080	12244280	is built on that. And I want to preserve that. Do you think everyone knowing this stuff and
12244280	12253320	basically, I mean, if people accepted this truth that you claim, do you think that that would be
12253320	12260840	a benefit to humanity to know this truth? Yeah, just like I assume that practicing
12260840	12266840	religions would collapse, right? Because who would want to, if you know that Jesus was a
12266840	12270840	no, would you really go? Right. Would you want to be involved? Would you want to give
12270920	12276600	you how do you think it would benefit our society? Freedom. I had a man in freedom. Yeah.
12277320	12282600	Nobody is above. No, nobody is above the democracy. Nobody is above your reason.
12283560	12290920	Nobody is above the mind that you've been given. And that nature is your, is your mom.
12291960	12298520	And the mystery brings you to a place where you know who you are. That's what it said on the
12298520	12306600	Temple of Apollo. It said, know yourself. Know yourself. So yeah, I think there would be a
12306600	12310360	renaissance and I would love it. I would love it, but you couldn't worship Jesus anymore. You
12310360	12314360	couldn't take the communion. If you knew what he was doing to that kid, you couldn't take that
12314360	12319640	communion anymore. I don't care what the priests say. I don't care if they're following that or
12319640	12326920	not. They're following that spirit. And, you know, yeah, needs to be stopped now. Yeah.
12326920	12330920	That's fascinating stuff, man. Well, Amen. Thank you so much for coming here and talking about
12330920	12335320	this stuff. I really appreciate your time. Danny, it's a huge, huge honor for me to come here.
12335320	12341800	And I want you to know I really, to your audience, you know, you're a really cool guy, man.
12342680	12348040	I appreciate it. You as well, man. I think what you're doing is, I think what you're doing is
12349000	12356920	exploration and it's like free. It's like university or, you know, salon grade
12358120	12364040	spirit that I get here. So kudos to you for being able to pull that off in this crap world.
12364040	12369160	Cheers, brother. I appreciate your time. And good night, folks.
