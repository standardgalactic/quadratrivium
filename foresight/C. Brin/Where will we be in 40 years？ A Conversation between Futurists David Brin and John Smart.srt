1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
We're here now to talk about the future.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:13,040
Yes, well, you know, we were just at a conference together about transhumanism, and it means

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,360
a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,320
For instance, we learned at this TEDx conference that there's, for instance, a Russian-based

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,720
program that wants us all to transcend by 2045.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Project 2045.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:41,320
Yes, we will, let's see, create avatars that are telepresent robots that we use from our

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,320
homes to go out and trans-live around the world, and then...

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,120
It sounds a little like my novel, Killin' People, but the idea of being able to have

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:04,120
a telepresence with your avatars that are first virtual, then robotic, then biorebotic,

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,320
and then the notion that you would dump...

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,680
Consciousness uploading, downloading, downloading.

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Consciousness uploading, yes.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,200
And these are all very familiar, fascinating notions out of sci-fi that are now being taken

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,440
seriously by people.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,640
And I find myself again and again at these conferences, it's interesting, if I'm around

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,000
people who are stuck in the myopic presence, I'm one of the gun-ho singularity guys.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Wake up, snap out of it, change happens, you know, you guys are flying through the sky.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,200
You ask somebody who's curmudgeon about the future, have you ever flown through the sky?

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Have you ever walked into a room and made light happen with your fingertip?

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,320
These are the powers of gods.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,800
And the reason we don't think of them as the powers of gods is that...

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Habituate.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
That's right.

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,800
The same reason that people actually got bored very quickly from the Apollo landings, and

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
that is they were shared immediately with everybody.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Well, that's painful to realize, but yeah, I guess you're right.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Oh yeah, yeah, look at all the people who put all that attention and adoration to the

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:33,040
Palantir Globe in Lord of the Rings, a magical, glassy thing on your desk that will let you

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,360
see any knowledge and converse with people far away.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Yes.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Woo!

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,360
And, of course, they're gushing over this thing while they have a magical screen on

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
their desk that lets them converse with people far away.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
That's exactly the same thing.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,360
And the only reason that the Palantir is better is because only the king and a couple of elfs

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,360
get it.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Restrict the supply.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Restrict the supply.

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
It's more valuable.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
One of the best hacks you can use at your university professor for a class that you

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,360
have a hard time getting people into is you put on the flyers that you circulate around

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
the school.

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Only 100 people.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Only 50 people are alive.

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
That's right.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
That's right.

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
When you get lines out the door.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Suddenly it becomes valuable.

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Well, you know, we saw this in the news just the other day that Peter Damondis and James

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Cameron and a number of other billionaires, Google billionaires.

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Yeah, it's very interesting.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Planetary resources.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah, planetary resources that are going to mine asteroids.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
And, of course, the biggest hoot was how this was received on Jon Stewart.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
People ought to look at the YouTube and that Jon Stewart episode.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Oh, it was amazing.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,360
He's saying, oh, do we have to talk politics again tonight?

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Wait, we don't have to.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,360
There's something cooler.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,360
They show a news report about mining asteroids and he says, are you freaking kidding me?

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Mining asteroids for trillions of dollars.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,360
And the audience of New Yorkers is just going ape.

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Just completely going ape.

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:36,360
This is the kind of news in 2012 that we all thought we'd see in 2012.

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Where's my jet pack future, boy?

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I know.

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Where is it?

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Last the future.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,360
This 2045 or 2050 that we're talking about.

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Yes.

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
The world in 40 years.

73
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Yeah, the world of your novel, Existence.

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Yeah, well, it's set then and the novel's coming out and it's set in 2050.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,360
And the thing about the 30, 40 year projection that makes it both more difficult and so cool.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I enjoyed this so much with my other projection called Earth was the notion that it's this mix.

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,360
If you said something just five, 10 years from now, it's today's world, familiar world,

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,360
with something has disrupted it.

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Something's changed.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Some one thing.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
The aliens have invaded.

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Maybe everybody's dead.

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,360
But some one thing, if you set it 200, 300, 400 years in the future, it's playing tennis

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
with the nut down.

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
You can say anything you want.

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,360
So many impacts, cross impact, second and third order consequences.

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,360
We've gone through one singularity and crashed and now we're on working on our second.

88
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
But the 30, 40 year projection.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Well, if I were to go back to 1962 and get my 12 year old self, pull him back up here 50 years,

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
he would spend half his time going, wow, we never thought of that.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,360
And the other half of the time he would be saying, I mean, you're still doing that.

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,360
And that's the sense that you have to be able to convey in these 30, 40, 50 year projections

93
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
is notion that some things will be disappointingly the same.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Yes.

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
No matter how some things change, others just stay the same.

96
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
That's right.

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,360
And figuring out which of those things are going to be so depressingly or in some cases

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
reassuringly stable.

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:36,360
And when we are uploaded into Android bodies with IQs of 496, adolescent males will still

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,360
spend one third of their time thinking about things they shouldn't and another one third

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,360
wincing over stupid things they said and still wincing about them 50 years later.

102
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Well said.

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Yeah.

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
But in any event, what else?

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
50 years from now.

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Well, you think we're going to transform?

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes.

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I appreciated your discussion.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You're calling me out on that in your presentation of TEDx talk.

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I do.

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:22,360
I believe that the history of intelligence in the universe involves colonizing ever smaller

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:32,360
scales, ever more local slices of space time, and using resources ever more efficiently per

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
computation.

114
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
So virtualizing our resources.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Getting to a place where we're doing virtually everything with virtually no physical resources.

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,360
And this seems to be the history of complexity development when you move from galaxies to

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,360
replicating special replicating stars within those galaxies to special surfaces and the

118
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
center of these special planets between magma and vacuum where all the interesting things

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
happening.

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,360
And then the special subsections of those that are most hospitable to replicating life.

121
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
And then these...

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Special life forms.

123
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Special life forms.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Now we're manipulating quantum computers.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,360
We're doing quantum encryption.

126
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,360
We've sent neutrino messages through solid Earth recently.

127
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
But this...

128
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
We're going into interspace.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,360
And this is all fabulous, but it runs contrary to the science fiction notion that our future,

130
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,360
our destiny, our final frontier is out there and doing mega structures in mega civilizations.

131
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,360
And you think that this is the answer to the so-called Fermi paradox, what I've called

132
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
the great silence.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Yes.

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Yeah.

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
And I don't know if it really does run counter.

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,360
What it does is it says that the frontier that was thought was the frontier, this expansion

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,360
into outer space is cold and sterile.

138
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
It may actually not be the frontier.

139
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,360
The frontier is still there, but the exploration, the discovery is really jumping into this

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
interspace world.

141
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,360
That's where the real computational resources, the real new ability to understand things,

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
the next level of sublime, if you will, seems to be...

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
We actually seem to be chasing into that as we're thinking.

144
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
As we're thinking about these grand explorations.

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Now, I do believe that there is what I call the next adjacent.

146
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,360
There's a next adjacent expansion that always happens in order to reach the next level of

147
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
interspace.

148
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Humans went through a next adjacent expansion from Africa, the modern human, expanding out

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
across the globe.

150
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
That was a next adjacent.

151
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
That was an outward, that was an outer space move.

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,360
But the reality is we were only colonizing a small subset of the space that the prokaryotes

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,360
had very effectively colonized long before us, miles deep into the crust of the Earth,

154
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,360
autolith, trophic bacteria, out to Venus and Mars on asteroids.

155
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
But they needed us to take them to the moon.

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Good point.

157
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Well, no.

158
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't know if they did.

159
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I would say the asteroids skipping off of Earth probably distributed spores of bacteria

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,360
all the way out to many of the other planets.

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Well, I talk about that to a large degree in the heart of the comet.

162
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
That's the panspermia notion.

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,360
But nevertheless, what you're talking about is going to depress some people in certain

164
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,360
ways because they see this as just an extension of the video game.

165
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,360
We're getting in and in and in and in and even if it becomes these vast virtual realms

166
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,360
to explore, it's nevertheless a turning away from an older dream.

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Well, it might not be.

168
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Well, of course you think it is because you think it explains the silence out there,

169
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,360
that almost every species out there discovers these inner realms and these inner realms

170
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
are more persuasive and attractive.

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Yes, and let me correct a small misunderstanding we seem to have with regard to this question

172
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
of does this answer Fermi's paradox.

173
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I believe that if we are diving into these things that look more and more like a black hole

174
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,360
from our perspective, these interspace highly dense realms,

175
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
censored from our observation.

176
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I do agree with your notion that there will be biker gangs.

177
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
There will be people who will disagree.

178
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
There will be exceptions.

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Committed colonizers, grand explorers who want to leave.

180
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,360
However, if the universe is not just evolving, it's also developing, as I've argued in my

181
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,360
double, double universe community discusses this, then it's quite possible that the

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:11,360
interspace attractor is an attractor that has a force proportionate to the complexity

183
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
of the organism.

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,360
In other words, they impose law on the galaxy and they curb the few exceptions who want

185
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,360
to expand and change and manipulate the cosmos.

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Certainly one thing is that we would do, there would be the prime directive that would

187
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
emerge in all these advanced planets.

188
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Don't go out and send, because if we're all going into this interspace world and let's

189
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,360
assume the physics work out so that we all instantaneously connect with all the others

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
in the civilization by doing that.

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
That's one thing that would make it highly attractive.

192
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I can go in and now I can instantaneously wormhole or whatever else that everybody else.

193
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,360
The speed of light and temporal coincidence both mitigate against that.

194
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
But we'll leave that aside and let's take your assumption.

195
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,360
In my paper, I argue that the weirdness of my paper, the Transition Hypothesis, which

196
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,360
was published in Act of Astronautica last year, I argue that the weirdness of black hole

197
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:22,360
time dilation is such that if we were able to go into a black hole, a black hole like

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,360
object, we would instantaneously, from our reference frame, merge gravitationally with

199
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
all the other black holes that are in the gravity well with us.

200
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Well, that's a perspective.

201
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I don't think Stephen Hawking or Kip Thorne would agree, but we can set that aside for

202
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
another time.

203
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Basically saying that when you enter into the realm near an event horizon, you're in

204
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
connection with all the other event horizons.

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm saying that the way space-time dilation works, the extreme space-time dilation that

206
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,360
happens at a black hole, and there's, of course, black hole physics is one of the hardest

207
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,360
things to get anybody around to agree on, but this is one of the oldest models of how

208
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
space-time works.

209
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,360
This is one of the most original classical, you know, Miesner talks about it in gravitation,

210
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,360
right, of how basically, you know, the astronaut that's moving into the, they basically are

211
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,360
frozen on the event horizon, and from your perspective, you're looking out at the universe,

212
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
everything in the universe instantaneously moves towards its heat depth.

213
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,360
So basically, a black hole event horizon is an instantaneous one-way forward-time travel

214
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
device in that perspective.

215
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Well, yeah, that's clear, but the business of being connected with all other singularities,

216
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
well, let's set that aside for another time.

217
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:55,360
The point you're driving at is that the exceptions to this business of being attracted into inner

218
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:03,360
space, and you believe that most civilizations, most races, are attracted to the inner world

219
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,360
of unlimited virtuality, that the exceptions, the motorcycle gangs who try to claim the

220
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,360
universe might be stopped from doing so by the vast power of those who want the maximum

221
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,360
diversity in the cosmos and have this power because they have this ultimate virtuality

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
and computational ability.

223
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Yeah, if we can make the claim that sending out a one-way message on your way into this

224
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,360
hole, this transcension, is going to condemn all the other civilizations that receive that

225
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,360
message, or probe, or whatever you send, to going down their holes in the same way you

226
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:53,360
did, then we can say that you've created cloneality in the computational, that sector of the galaxy.

227
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Okay, next time.

228
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,360
So you would end up seeing yourself, a clone of yourself, on the other side, right?

229
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I think...

230
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I wouldn't be the same to you, of course, but what you would have done is you would have

231
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,360
reduced the diversity, the remaining diversity, you would have taken away what Arthur C. Clarke

232
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,360
liked to say, I think it might make more sense for us to figure out our own problems than

233
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,360
to have them spoon fed to us from another alien.

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:37,360
And that may be very well why, irrespective of the black hole, mumbo-chumbo, that may be

235
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
why advanced races insist on a prime directive, a non-interference policy, in order to maximize

236
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,360
the diversity so that young races like us can have time to develop interesting differences.

237
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,360
And of course, that is very appealing to the culture that we came from, where we appreciate

238
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
argumentation, we appreciate difference, we appreciate diversity.

239
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,360
It's almost a religion in this culture where it wasn't in many human cultures.

240
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,360
But on that thought, I think maybe we'd better give our brains a little rest.

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Okay, we'll pour ourselves some more tea and welcome people back another time.
