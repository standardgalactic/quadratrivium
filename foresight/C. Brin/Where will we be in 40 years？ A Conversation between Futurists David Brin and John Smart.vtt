WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
We're here now to talk about the future.

00:05.480 --> 00:13.040
Yes, well, you know, we were just at a conference together about transhumanism, and it means

00:13.040 --> 00:16.360
a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

00:16.360 --> 00:24.320
For instance, we learned at this TEDx conference that there's, for instance, a Russian-based

00:24.320 --> 00:29.720
program that wants us all to transcend by 2045.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.720
Project 2045.

00:31.720 --> 00:41.320
Yes, we will, let's see, create avatars that are telepresent robots that we use from our

00:41.320 --> 00:45.320
homes to go out and trans-live around the world, and then...

00:45.320 --> 00:52.120
It sounds a little like my novel, Killin' People, but the idea of being able to have

00:52.120 --> 01:04.120
a telepresence with your avatars that are first virtual, then robotic, then biorebotic,

01:04.120 --> 01:07.320
and then the notion that you would dump...

01:07.320 --> 01:10.680
Consciousness uploading, downloading, downloading.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.680
Consciousness uploading, yes.

01:12.680 --> 01:19.200
And these are all very familiar, fascinating notions out of sci-fi that are now being taken

01:19.200 --> 01:21.440
seriously by people.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.640
And I find myself again and again at these conferences, it's interesting, if I'm around

01:26.640 --> 01:34.000
people who are stuck in the myopic presence, I'm one of the gun-ho singularity guys.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.800
Wake up, snap out of it, change happens, you know, you guys are flying through the sky.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.200
You ask somebody who's curmudgeon about the future, have you ever flown through the sky?

01:46.200 --> 01:52.200
Have you ever walked into a room and made light happen with your fingertip?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.320
These are the powers of gods.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.800
And the reason we don't think of them as the powers of gods is that...

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Habituate.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
That's right.

01:59.800 --> 02:06.800
The same reason that people actually got bored very quickly from the Apollo landings, and

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
that is they were shared immediately with everybody.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.800
Well, that's painful to realize, but yeah, I guess you're right.

02:11.800 --> 02:21.600
Oh yeah, yeah, look at all the people who put all that attention and adoration to the

02:21.600 --> 02:33.040
Palantir Globe in Lord of the Rings, a magical, glassy thing on your desk that will let you

02:33.040 --> 02:38.360
see any knowledge and converse with people far away.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.360
Yes.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.360
Woo!

02:41.360 --> 02:47.360
And, of course, they're gushing over this thing while they have a magical screen on

02:47.360 --> 02:51.360
their desk that lets them converse with people far away.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.360
That's exactly the same thing.

02:52.360 --> 02:58.360
And the only reason that the Palantir is better is because only the king and a couple of elfs

02:58.360 --> 03:02.360
get it.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.360
Restrict the supply.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
Restrict the supply.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
It's more valuable.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.360
One of the best hacks you can use at your university professor for a class that you

03:09.360 --> 03:14.360
have a hard time getting people into is you put on the flyers that you circulate around

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
the school.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
Only 100 people.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
Only 50 people are alive.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
That's right.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.360
That's right.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
When you get lines out the door.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.360
Suddenly it becomes valuable.

03:23.360 --> 03:31.360
Well, you know, we saw this in the news just the other day that Peter Damondis and James

03:31.360 --> 03:39.360
Cameron and a number of other billionaires, Google billionaires.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.360
Yeah, it's very interesting.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
Planetary resources.

03:42.360 --> 03:46.360
Yeah, planetary resources that are going to mine asteroids.

03:46.360 --> 03:51.360
And, of course, the biggest hoot was how this was received on Jon Stewart.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.360
People ought to look at the YouTube and that Jon Stewart episode.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.360
Oh, it was amazing.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.360
He's saying, oh, do we have to talk politics again tonight?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.360
Wait, we don't have to.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.360
There's something cooler.

04:08.360 --> 04:15.360
They show a news report about mining asteroids and he says, are you freaking kidding me?

04:15.360 --> 04:19.360
Mining asteroids for trillions of dollars.

04:19.360 --> 04:24.360
And the audience of New Yorkers is just going ape.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.360
Just completely going ape.

04:26.360 --> 04:36.360
This is the kind of news in 2012 that we all thought we'd see in 2012.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
Where's my jet pack future, boy?

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
I know.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
Where is it?

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
Last the future.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.360
This 2045 or 2050 that we're talking about.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
Yes.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.360
The world in 40 years.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.360
Yeah, the world of your novel, Existence.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.360
Yeah, well, it's set then and the novel's coming out and it's set in 2050.

04:53.360 --> 05:01.360
And the thing about the 30, 40 year projection that makes it both more difficult and so cool.

05:01.360 --> 05:09.360
I enjoyed this so much with my other projection called Earth was the notion that it's this mix.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.360
If you said something just five, 10 years from now, it's today's world, familiar world,

05:14.360 --> 05:18.360
with something has disrupted it.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
Something's changed.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
Some one thing.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
The aliens have invaded.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
Maybe everybody's dead.

05:22.360 --> 05:29.360
But some one thing, if you set it 200, 300, 400 years in the future, it's playing tennis

05:29.360 --> 05:30.360
with the nut down.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.360
You can say anything you want.

05:31.360 --> 05:36.360
So many impacts, cross impact, second and third order consequences.

05:36.360 --> 05:42.360
We've gone through one singularity and crashed and now we're on working on our second.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.360
But the 30, 40 year projection.

05:45.360 --> 05:55.360
Well, if I were to go back to 1962 and get my 12 year old self, pull him back up here 50 years,

05:55.360 --> 06:00.360
he would spend half his time going, wow, we never thought of that.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.360
And the other half of the time he would be saying, I mean, you're still doing that.

06:05.360 --> 06:12.360
And that's the sense that you have to be able to convey in these 30, 40, 50 year projections

06:12.360 --> 06:15.360
is notion that some things will be disappointingly the same.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
Yes.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.360
No matter how some things change, others just stay the same.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.360
That's right.

06:20.360 --> 06:26.360
And figuring out which of those things are going to be so depressingly or in some cases

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
reassuringly stable.

06:27.360 --> 06:36.360
And when we are uploaded into Android bodies with IQs of 496, adolescent males will still

06:36.360 --> 06:42.360
spend one third of their time thinking about things they shouldn't and another one third

06:42.360 --> 06:48.360
wincing over stupid things they said and still wincing about them 50 years later.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.360
Well said.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
Yeah.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.360
But in any event, what else?

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
50 years from now.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.360
Well, you think we're going to transform?

06:59.360 --> 07:00.360
Yes.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.360
I appreciated your discussion.

07:03.360 --> 07:09.360
You're calling me out on that in your presentation of TEDx talk.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.360
I do.

07:10.360 --> 07:22.360
I believe that the history of intelligence in the universe involves colonizing ever smaller

07:22.360 --> 07:32.360
scales, ever more local slices of space time, and using resources ever more efficiently per

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
computation.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.360
So virtualizing our resources.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.360
Getting to a place where we're doing virtually everything with virtually no physical resources.

07:39.360 --> 07:44.360
And this seems to be the history of complexity development when you move from galaxies to

07:44.360 --> 07:51.360
replicating special replicating stars within those galaxies to special surfaces and the

07:51.360 --> 07:55.360
center of these special planets between magma and vacuum where all the interesting things

07:55.360 --> 07:56.360
happening.

07:56.360 --> 08:01.360
And then the special subsections of those that are most hospitable to replicating life.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
And then these...

08:02.360 --> 08:03.360
Special life forms.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.360
Special life forms.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.360
Now we're manipulating quantum computers.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.360
We're doing quantum encryption.

08:10.360 --> 08:15.360
We've sent neutrino messages through solid Earth recently.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.360
But this...

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
We're going into interspace.

08:17.360 --> 08:23.360
And this is all fabulous, but it runs contrary to the science fiction notion that our future,

08:23.360 --> 08:30.360
our destiny, our final frontier is out there and doing mega structures in mega civilizations.

08:30.360 --> 08:35.360
And you think that this is the answer to the so-called Fermi paradox, what I've called

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
the great silence.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
Yes.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Yeah.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.360
And I don't know if it really does run counter.

08:40.360 --> 08:46.360
What it does is it says that the frontier that was thought was the frontier, this expansion

08:46.360 --> 08:50.360
into outer space is cold and sterile.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.360
It may actually not be the frontier.

08:52.360 --> 08:58.360
The frontier is still there, but the exploration, the discovery is really jumping into this

08:58.360 --> 08:59.360
interspace world.

08:59.360 --> 09:06.360
That's where the real computational resources, the real new ability to understand things,

09:06.360 --> 09:09.360
the next level of sublime, if you will, seems to be...

09:09.360 --> 09:13.360
We actually seem to be chasing into that as we're thinking.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.360
As we're thinking about these grand explorations.

09:17.360 --> 09:22.360
Now, I do believe that there is what I call the next adjacent.

09:22.360 --> 09:28.360
There's a next adjacent expansion that always happens in order to reach the next level of

09:28.360 --> 09:29.360
interspace.

09:29.360 --> 09:39.360
Humans went through a next adjacent expansion from Africa, the modern human, expanding out

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
across the globe.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.360
That was a next adjacent.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.360
That was an outward, that was an outer space move.

09:44.360 --> 09:51.360
But the reality is we were only colonizing a small subset of the space that the prokaryotes

09:51.360 --> 09:57.360
had very effectively colonized long before us, miles deep into the crust of the Earth,

09:57.360 --> 10:03.360
autolith, trophic bacteria, out to Venus and Mars on asteroids.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.360
But they needed us to take them to the moon.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.360
Good point.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
Well, no.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
I don't know if they did.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.360
I would say the asteroids skipping off of Earth probably distributed spores of bacteria

10:14.360 --> 10:18.360
all the way out to many of the other planets.

10:18.360 --> 10:23.360
Well, I talk about that to a large degree in the heart of the comet.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.360
That's the panspermia notion.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.360
But nevertheless, what you're talking about is going to depress some people in certain

10:30.360 --> 10:35.360
ways because they see this as just an extension of the video game.

10:36.360 --> 10:42.360
We're getting in and in and in and in and even if it becomes these vast virtual realms

10:42.360 --> 10:49.360
to explore, it's nevertheless a turning away from an older dream.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.360
Well, it might not be.

10:53.360 --> 10:58.360
Well, of course you think it is because you think it explains the silence out there,

10:58.360 --> 11:04.360
that almost every species out there discovers these inner realms and these inner realms

11:04.360 --> 11:07.360
are more persuasive and attractive.

11:07.360 --> 11:16.360
Yes, and let me correct a small misunderstanding we seem to have with regard to this question

11:16.360 --> 11:20.360
of does this answer Fermi's paradox.

11:20.360 --> 11:26.360
I believe that if we are diving into these things that look more and more like a black hole

11:26.360 --> 11:31.360
from our perspective, these interspace highly dense realms,

11:31.360 --> 11:35.360
censored from our observation.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.360
I do agree with your notion that there will be biker gangs.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.360
There will be people who will disagree.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.360
There will be exceptions.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.360
Committed colonizers, grand explorers who want to leave.

11:49.360 --> 11:55.360
However, if the universe is not just evolving, it's also developing, as I've argued in my

11:55.360 --> 12:01.360
double, double universe community discusses this, then it's quite possible that the

12:01.360 --> 12:11.360
interspace attractor is an attractor that has a force proportionate to the complexity

12:11.360 --> 12:13.360
of the organism.

12:13.360 --> 12:19.360
In other words, they impose law on the galaxy and they curb the few exceptions who want

12:19.360 --> 12:25.360
to expand and change and manipulate the cosmos.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.360
Certainly one thing is that we would do, there would be the prime directive that would

12:30.360 --> 12:32.360
emerge in all these advanced planets.

12:32.360 --> 12:37.360
Don't go out and send, because if we're all going into this interspace world and let's

12:37.360 --> 12:42.360
assume the physics work out so that we all instantaneously connect with all the others

12:42.360 --> 12:44.360
in the civilization by doing that.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.360
That's one thing that would make it highly attractive.

12:46.360 --> 12:51.360
I can go in and now I can instantaneously wormhole or whatever else that everybody else.

12:51.360 --> 12:59.360
The speed of light and temporal coincidence both mitigate against that.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.360
But we'll leave that aside and let's take your assumption.

13:01.360 --> 13:07.360
In my paper, I argue that the weirdness of my paper, the Transition Hypothesis, which

13:07.360 --> 13:14.360
was published in Act of Astronautica last year, I argue that the weirdness of black hole

13:14.360 --> 13:22.360
time dilation is such that if we were able to go into a black hole, a black hole like

13:22.360 --> 13:28.360
object, we would instantaneously, from our reference frame, merge gravitationally with

13:28.360 --> 13:31.360
all the other black holes that are in the gravity well with us.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.360
Well, that's a perspective.

13:34.360 --> 13:40.360
I don't think Stephen Hawking or Kip Thorne would agree, but we can set that aside for

13:40.360 --> 13:41.360
another time.

13:41.360 --> 13:46.360
Basically saying that when you enter into the realm near an event horizon, you're in

13:46.360 --> 13:48.360
connection with all the other event horizons.

13:48.360 --> 13:54.360
I'm saying that the way space-time dilation works, the extreme space-time dilation that

13:54.360 --> 13:58.360
happens at a black hole, and there's, of course, black hole physics is one of the hardest

13:58.360 --> 14:03.360
things to get anybody around to agree on, but this is one of the oldest models of how

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
space-time works.

14:04.360 --> 14:11.360
This is one of the most original classical, you know, Miesner talks about it in gravitation,

14:11.360 --> 14:17.360
right, of how basically, you know, the astronaut that's moving into the, they basically are

14:17.360 --> 14:23.360
frozen on the event horizon, and from your perspective, you're looking out at the universe,

14:23.360 --> 14:27.360
everything in the universe instantaneously moves towards its heat depth.

14:27.360 --> 14:34.360
So basically, a black hole event horizon is an instantaneous one-way forward-time travel

14:34.360 --> 14:35.360
device in that perspective.

14:35.360 --> 14:41.360
Well, yeah, that's clear, but the business of being connected with all other singularities,

14:41.360 --> 14:45.360
well, let's set that aside for another time.

14:45.360 --> 14:55.360
The point you're driving at is that the exceptions to this business of being attracted into inner

14:55.360 --> 15:03.360
space, and you believe that most civilizations, most races, are attracted to the inner world

15:03.360 --> 15:09.360
of unlimited virtuality, that the exceptions, the motorcycle gangs who try to claim the

15:09.360 --> 15:17.360
universe might be stopped from doing so by the vast power of those who want the maximum

15:17.360 --> 15:24.360
diversity in the cosmos and have this power because they have this ultimate virtuality

15:24.360 --> 15:27.360
and computational ability.

15:27.360 --> 15:34.360
Yeah, if we can make the claim that sending out a one-way message on your way into this

15:34.360 --> 15:39.360
hole, this transcension, is going to condemn all the other civilizations that receive that

15:39.360 --> 15:44.360
message, or probe, or whatever you send, to going down their holes in the same way you

15:44.360 --> 15:53.360
did, then we can say that you've created cloneality in the computational, that sector of the galaxy.

15:53.360 --> 16:00.360
Okay, next time.

16:00.360 --> 16:05.360
So you would end up seeing yourself, a clone of yourself, on the other side, right?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.360
I think...

16:07.360 --> 16:10.360
I wouldn't be the same to you, of course, but what you would have done is you would have

16:10.360 --> 16:16.360
reduced the diversity, the remaining diversity, you would have taken away what Arthur C. Clarke

16:16.360 --> 16:24.360
liked to say, I think it might make more sense for us to figure out our own problems than

16:24.360 --> 16:27.360
to have them spoon fed to us from another alien.

16:27.360 --> 16:37.360
And that may be very well why, irrespective of the black hole, mumbo-chumbo, that may be

16:37.360 --> 16:43.360
why advanced races insist on a prime directive, a non-interference policy, in order to maximize

16:43.360 --> 16:50.360
the diversity so that young races like us can have time to develop interesting differences.

16:50.360 --> 16:56.360
And of course, that is very appealing to the culture that we came from, where we appreciate

16:56.360 --> 17:00.360
argumentation, we appreciate difference, we appreciate diversity.

17:00.360 --> 17:06.360
It's almost a religion in this culture where it wasn't in many human cultures.

17:06.360 --> 17:12.360
But on that thought, I think maybe we'd better give our brains a little rest.

17:12.360 --> 17:18.360
Okay, we'll pour ourselves some more tea and welcome people back another time.
