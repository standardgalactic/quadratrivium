0	5480	We're here now to talk about the future.
5480	13040	Yes, well, you know, we were just at a conference together about transhumanism, and it means
13040	16360	a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
16360	24320	For instance, we learned at this TEDx conference that there's, for instance, a Russian-based
24320	29720	program that wants us all to transcend by 2045.
29720	31720	Project 2045.
31720	41320	Yes, we will, let's see, create avatars that are telepresent robots that we use from our
41320	45320	homes to go out and trans-live around the world, and then...
45320	52120	It sounds a little like my novel, Killin' People, but the idea of being able to have
52120	64120	a telepresence with your avatars that are first virtual, then robotic, then biorebotic,
64120	67320	and then the notion that you would dump...
67320	70680	Consciousness uploading, downloading, downloading.
70680	72680	Consciousness uploading, yes.
72680	79200	And these are all very familiar, fascinating notions out of sci-fi that are now being taken
79200	81440	seriously by people.
81440	86640	And I find myself again and again at these conferences, it's interesting, if I'm around
86640	94000	people who are stuck in the myopic presence, I'm one of the gun-ho singularity guys.
94000	100800	Wake up, snap out of it, change happens, you know, you guys are flying through the sky.
100800	106200	You ask somebody who's curmudgeon about the future, have you ever flown through the sky?
106200	112200	Have you ever walked into a room and made light happen with your fingertip?
112200	114320	These are the powers of gods.
114320	117800	And the reason we don't think of them as the powers of gods is that...
117800	118800	Habituate.
118800	119800	That's right.
119800	126800	The same reason that people actually got bored very quickly from the Apollo landings, and
126800	128800	that is they were shared immediately with everybody.
128800	131800	Well, that's painful to realize, but yeah, I guess you're right.
131800	141600	Oh yeah, yeah, look at all the people who put all that attention and adoration to the
141600	153040	Palantir Globe in Lord of the Rings, a magical, glassy thing on your desk that will let you
153040	158360	see any knowledge and converse with people far away.
158360	159360	Yes.
159360	160360	Woo!
161360	167360	And, of course, they're gushing over this thing while they have a magical screen on
167360	171360	their desk that lets them converse with people far away.
171360	172360	That's exactly the same thing.
172360	178360	And the only reason that the Palantir is better is because only the king and a couple of elfs
178360	182360	get it.
182360	183360	Restrict the supply.
183360	184360	Restrict the supply.
184360	185360	It's more valuable.
185360	189360	One of the best hacks you can use at your university professor for a class that you
189360	194360	have a hard time getting people into is you put on the flyers that you circulate around
194360	195360	the school.
195360	196360	Only 100 people.
196360	198360	Only 50 people are alive.
198360	199360	That's right.
199360	200360	That's right.
200360	201360	When you get lines out the door.
201360	203360	Suddenly it becomes valuable.
203360	211360	Well, you know, we saw this in the news just the other day that Peter Damondis and James
211360	219360	Cameron and a number of other billionaires, Google billionaires.
219360	221360	Yeah, it's very interesting.
221360	222360	Planetary resources.
222360	226360	Yeah, planetary resources that are going to mine asteroids.
226360	231360	And, of course, the biggest hoot was how this was received on Jon Stewart.
231360	235360	People ought to look at the YouTube and that Jon Stewart episode.
235360	237360	Oh, it was amazing.
238360	242360	He's saying, oh, do we have to talk politics again tonight?
242360	244360	Wait, we don't have to.
244360	248360	There's something cooler.
248360	255360	They show a news report about mining asteroids and he says, are you freaking kidding me?
255360	259360	Mining asteroids for trillions of dollars.
259360	264360	And the audience of New Yorkers is just going ape.
264360	266360	Just completely going ape.
266360	276360	This is the kind of news in 2012 that we all thought we'd see in 2012.
276360	278360	Where's my jet pack future, boy?
278360	279360	I know.
279360	280360	Where is it?
280360	281360	Last the future.
281360	284360	This 2045 or 2050 that we're talking about.
284360	285360	Yes.
285360	286360	The world in 40 years.
286360	288360	Yeah, the world of your novel, Existence.
288360	293360	Yeah, well, it's set then and the novel's coming out and it's set in 2050.
293360	301360	And the thing about the 30, 40 year projection that makes it both more difficult and so cool.
301360	309360	I enjoyed this so much with my other projection called Earth was the notion that it's this mix.
309360	314360	If you said something just five, 10 years from now, it's today's world, familiar world,
314360	318360	with something has disrupted it.
318360	319360	Something's changed.
319360	320360	Some one thing.
320360	321360	The aliens have invaded.
321360	322360	Maybe everybody's dead.
322360	329360	But some one thing, if you set it 200, 300, 400 years in the future, it's playing tennis
329360	330360	with the nut down.
330360	331360	You can say anything you want.
331360	336360	So many impacts, cross impact, second and third order consequences.
336360	342360	We've gone through one singularity and crashed and now we're on working on our second.
342360	345360	But the 30, 40 year projection.
345360	355360	Well, if I were to go back to 1962 and get my 12 year old self, pull him back up here 50 years,
355360	360360	he would spend half his time going, wow, we never thought of that.
360360	365360	And the other half of the time he would be saying, I mean, you're still doing that.
365360	372360	And that's the sense that you have to be able to convey in these 30, 40, 50 year projections
372360	375360	is notion that some things will be disappointingly the same.
375360	376360	Yes.
376360	379360	No matter how some things change, others just stay the same.
379360	380360	That's right.
380360	386360	And figuring out which of those things are going to be so depressingly or in some cases
386360	387360	reassuringly stable.
387360	396360	And when we are uploaded into Android bodies with IQs of 496, adolescent males will still
396360	402360	spend one third of their time thinking about things they shouldn't and another one third
402360	408360	wincing over stupid things they said and still wincing about them 50 years later.
408360	409360	Well said.
409360	410360	Yeah.
410360	413360	But in any event, what else?
413360	415360	50 years from now.
415360	419360	Well, you think we're going to transform?
419360	420360	Yes.
420360	423360	I appreciated your discussion.
423360	429360	You're calling me out on that in your presentation of TEDx talk.
429360	430360	I do.
430360	442360	I believe that the history of intelligence in the universe involves colonizing ever smaller
442360	452360	scales, ever more local slices of space time, and using resources ever more efficiently per
452360	453360	computation.
453360	455360	So virtualizing our resources.
455360	459360	Getting to a place where we're doing virtually everything with virtually no physical resources.
459360	464360	And this seems to be the history of complexity development when you move from galaxies to
464360	471360	replicating special replicating stars within those galaxies to special surfaces and the
471360	475360	center of these special planets between magma and vacuum where all the interesting things
475360	476360	happening.
476360	481360	And then the special subsections of those that are most hospitable to replicating life.
481360	482360	And then these...
482360	483360	Special life forms.
483360	484360	Special life forms.
484360	487360	Now we're manipulating quantum computers.
487360	490360	We're doing quantum encryption.
490360	495360	We've sent neutrino messages through solid Earth recently.
495360	496360	But this...
496360	497360	We're going into interspace.
497360	503360	And this is all fabulous, but it runs contrary to the science fiction notion that our future,
503360	510360	our destiny, our final frontier is out there and doing mega structures in mega civilizations.
510360	515360	And you think that this is the answer to the so-called Fermi paradox, what I've called
515360	516360	the great silence.
516360	517360	Yes.
517360	518360	Yeah.
518360	520360	And I don't know if it really does run counter.
520360	526360	What it does is it says that the frontier that was thought was the frontier, this expansion
526360	530360	into outer space is cold and sterile.
530360	532360	It may actually not be the frontier.
532360	538360	The frontier is still there, but the exploration, the discovery is really jumping into this
538360	539360	interspace world.
539360	546360	That's where the real computational resources, the real new ability to understand things,
546360	549360	the next level of sublime, if you will, seems to be...
549360	553360	We actually seem to be chasing into that as we're thinking.
553360	557360	As we're thinking about these grand explorations.
557360	562360	Now, I do believe that there is what I call the next adjacent.
562360	568360	There's a next adjacent expansion that always happens in order to reach the next level of
568360	569360	interspace.
569360	579360	Humans went through a next adjacent expansion from Africa, the modern human, expanding out
579360	580360	across the globe.
580360	581360	That was a next adjacent.
581360	584360	That was an outward, that was an outer space move.
584360	591360	But the reality is we were only colonizing a small subset of the space that the prokaryotes
591360	597360	had very effectively colonized long before us, miles deep into the crust of the Earth,
597360	603360	autolith, trophic bacteria, out to Venus and Mars on asteroids.
603360	606360	But they needed us to take them to the moon.
606360	607360	Good point.
607360	608360	Well, no.
608360	609360	I don't know if they did.
609360	614360	I would say the asteroids skipping off of Earth probably distributed spores of bacteria
614360	618360	all the way out to many of the other planets.
618360	623360	Well, I talk about that to a large degree in the heart of the comet.
623360	626360	That's the panspermia notion.
626360	630360	But nevertheless, what you're talking about is going to depress some people in certain
630360	635360	ways because they see this as just an extension of the video game.
636360	642360	We're getting in and in and in and in and even if it becomes these vast virtual realms
642360	649360	to explore, it's nevertheless a turning away from an older dream.
649360	653360	Well, it might not be.
653360	658360	Well, of course you think it is because you think it explains the silence out there,
658360	664360	that almost every species out there discovers these inner realms and these inner realms
664360	667360	are more persuasive and attractive.
667360	676360	Yes, and let me correct a small misunderstanding we seem to have with regard to this question
676360	680360	of does this answer Fermi's paradox.
680360	686360	I believe that if we are diving into these things that look more and more like a black hole
686360	691360	from our perspective, these interspace highly dense realms,
691360	695360	censored from our observation.
695360	699360	I do agree with your notion that there will be biker gangs.
699360	701360	There will be people who will disagree.
701360	703360	There will be exceptions.
703360	709360	Committed colonizers, grand explorers who want to leave.
709360	715360	However, if the universe is not just evolving, it's also developing, as I've argued in my
715360	721360	double, double universe community discusses this, then it's quite possible that the
721360	731360	interspace attractor is an attractor that has a force proportionate to the complexity
731360	733360	of the organism.
733360	739360	In other words, they impose law on the galaxy and they curb the few exceptions who want
739360	745360	to expand and change and manipulate the cosmos.
745360	750360	Certainly one thing is that we would do, there would be the prime directive that would
750360	752360	emerge in all these advanced planets.
752360	757360	Don't go out and send, because if we're all going into this interspace world and let's
757360	762360	assume the physics work out so that we all instantaneously connect with all the others
762360	764360	in the civilization by doing that.
764360	766360	That's one thing that would make it highly attractive.
766360	771360	I can go in and now I can instantaneously wormhole or whatever else that everybody else.
771360	779360	The speed of light and temporal coincidence both mitigate against that.
779360	781360	But we'll leave that aside and let's take your assumption.
781360	787360	In my paper, I argue that the weirdness of my paper, the Transition Hypothesis, which
787360	794360	was published in Act of Astronautica last year, I argue that the weirdness of black hole
794360	802360	time dilation is such that if we were able to go into a black hole, a black hole like
802360	808360	object, we would instantaneously, from our reference frame, merge gravitationally with
808360	811360	all the other black holes that are in the gravity well with us.
811360	814360	Well, that's a perspective.
814360	820360	I don't think Stephen Hawking or Kip Thorne would agree, but we can set that aside for
820360	821360	another time.
821360	826360	Basically saying that when you enter into the realm near an event horizon, you're in
826360	828360	connection with all the other event horizons.
828360	834360	I'm saying that the way space-time dilation works, the extreme space-time dilation that
834360	838360	happens at a black hole, and there's, of course, black hole physics is one of the hardest
838360	843360	things to get anybody around to agree on, but this is one of the oldest models of how
843360	844360	space-time works.
844360	851360	This is one of the most original classical, you know, Miesner talks about it in gravitation,
851360	857360	right, of how basically, you know, the astronaut that's moving into the, they basically are
857360	863360	frozen on the event horizon, and from your perspective, you're looking out at the universe,
863360	867360	everything in the universe instantaneously moves towards its heat depth.
867360	874360	So basically, a black hole event horizon is an instantaneous one-way forward-time travel
874360	875360	device in that perspective.
875360	881360	Well, yeah, that's clear, but the business of being connected with all other singularities,
881360	885360	well, let's set that aside for another time.
885360	895360	The point you're driving at is that the exceptions to this business of being attracted into inner
895360	903360	space, and you believe that most civilizations, most races, are attracted to the inner world
903360	909360	of unlimited virtuality, that the exceptions, the motorcycle gangs who try to claim the
909360	917360	universe might be stopped from doing so by the vast power of those who want the maximum
917360	924360	diversity in the cosmos and have this power because they have this ultimate virtuality
924360	927360	and computational ability.
927360	934360	Yeah, if we can make the claim that sending out a one-way message on your way into this
934360	939360	hole, this transcension, is going to condemn all the other civilizations that receive that
939360	944360	message, or probe, or whatever you send, to going down their holes in the same way you
944360	953360	did, then we can say that you've created cloneality in the computational, that sector of the galaxy.
953360	960360	Okay, next time.
960360	965360	So you would end up seeing yourself, a clone of yourself, on the other side, right?
965360	967360	I think...
967360	970360	I wouldn't be the same to you, of course, but what you would have done is you would have
970360	976360	reduced the diversity, the remaining diversity, you would have taken away what Arthur C. Clarke
976360	984360	liked to say, I think it might make more sense for us to figure out our own problems than
984360	987360	to have them spoon fed to us from another alien.
987360	997360	And that may be very well why, irrespective of the black hole, mumbo-chumbo, that may be
997360	1003360	why advanced races insist on a prime directive, a non-interference policy, in order to maximize
1003360	1010360	the diversity so that young races like us can have time to develop interesting differences.
1010360	1016360	And of course, that is very appealing to the culture that we came from, where we appreciate
1016360	1020360	argumentation, we appreciate difference, we appreciate diversity.
1020360	1026360	It's almost a religion in this culture where it wasn't in many human cultures.
1026360	1032360	But on that thought, I think maybe we'd better give our brains a little rest.
1032360	1038360	Okay, we'll pour ourselves some more tea and welcome people back another time.
