Processing Overview for AINIRO
============================
Checking AINIRO/Why we made Magic Closed Source.txt
1. **Background**: You started working on Magic (an open-source project) in 2019, which is built upon your earlier invention, Hyper Lambda, from 2013. Over the years, you've contributed nearly exclusively to the project, amassing over 8,000 commits and creating all of its intellectual property. Initially, you had angel or VC investment that allowed for a front-end developer to contribute to the dashboard. Magic has become a foundational tool for many, enabling them to significantly outperform traditional software development teams.

2. **Success with iNiro**: In the last six months, your company iNiro, which uses Magic, has seen revenue growth of 395%. This success is in stark contrast to the lack of financial return from Magic itself. Despite its widespread use (with over 10 million downloads of its packages), Magic has not generated any income for you.

3. **Open Source Challenges**: The open-source model has led to a situation where users benefit from Magic without contributing back in terms of code, financial support, or even public acknowledgment. This has become a source of frustration for you, as others are profiting while you have not.

4. **License Change**: As a result, you've decided to transition Magic from an open-source to a closed-source model. You own the intellectual property and thus have the right to change licensing terms. The new model requires payment for using Magic, with pricing starting at $5,000 per month for single server licenses and $20,000 per month for Kubernetes cluster licenses.

5. **Rationale**: The rationale behind this decision is to ensure that you receive compensation for the value Magic provides. It allows one person to replace an entire software development team, so the pricing reflects the significant cost-saving and efficiency gains it offers.

6. **Conclusion**: Magic is now closed source, and users must pay for access to the source code and to use it legally on servers or Kubernetes clusters. The new pricing structure aims to share the wealth generated by the tool with its original creator and maintainer.
