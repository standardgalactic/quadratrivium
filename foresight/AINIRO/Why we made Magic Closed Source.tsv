0	12880	I started Magic in 2019, Magic Cloud as an open source project.
12880	19240	Since then I have almost 8,000 commits to it.
19240	42240	During a small period I had an angel slash VC investor, which allowed me to have a little bit of help from a front-end developer who created parts of the new dashboard that was created a year ago.
42240	52240	However, besides from that, every single commit towards Magic's GitHub repository is mine.
52240	62240	99.99% of every single 98.5% of all commits are mine.
62240	69240	The intellectual property for Magic is mine, 100%.
69240	86240	During those four years of maintaining Magic as an open source project, I have had zero contributions outside of this.
86240	93240	And I have made zero money on Magic itself.
93240	113240	Even though I have 8,000 commits towards the core Magic repository, Magic also consists of 42 additional projects, which also contains thousands upon thousands of commits.
113240	131240	So I have basically made zero money directly on Magic. In fact, the only value Magic has provided us with is in the forms of being able to start iNiro, which is a hugely successful company.
131240	138240	The last six months we have grown our revenue by 395%.
139240	153240	However, Magic as an open source project has made nothing for me or us in any ways whatsoever. However, it has made a lot of money for a lot of other people.
153240	163240	Magic has 10 million, 10.5 million downloads of its nugget packages.
163240	176240	Now, of course, this is divided between 42 packages.
176240	188240	And also, of course, the way continuous integrations and continuous deployment works, it downloads the nugget packages, unless you explicitly cache them, etc.
189240	196240	So it doesn't have 10 million users, but it has a lot of users. There's a lot of people using Magic today.
196240	202240	And they all have one thing in common, or actually they have three things in common.
202240	213240	A, they're not contributing to Magic with source code or commits or marketing or anything.
213240	220240	B, they're not contributing money in any ways whatsoever.
220240	230240	And C, I'm not entirely sure about this, but I'm like 99% sure about this. They don't tell anybody they're using Magic.
230240	252240	Magic is kind of like a secret. And the reasons for that is because a single software developer with a couple of months of training in Hyper Lambda and Magic can outperform entire software development departments with 20 plus software developers.
252240	259240	So nobody wants to publicly admit they're using Magic.
259240	285240	Because if they don't admit it, they can invoice as if they have 20 people working in their software department, while actually there's only one guy sitting, clicking the credit fire on the back-end generator and, you know, using workflows to add business logic.
286240	296240	Now, that has created the realization in me that I need to stop Magic as an open source project.
296240	302240	So Magic is no longer open source. I'm sorry. I apologize. It's just the way it is.
302240	312240	You know, if somebody out there wants to pay me eight figures a month to re-open source license it again.
312240	319240	Then by all means, I'm willing to discuss that. However, I want my payday.
319240	330240	You see, when I started Magic in 2019, it was the continuation of Phosphorus V. Phosphorus V, again, was the invention of Hyper Lambda.
330240	336240	I invented Hyper Lambda in 2013, implying I've been working on this thing for 11 years.
336240	343240	And so far, I haven't seen as much as a single dollar.
346240	352240	And I haven't even seen a single contribution, you know.
352240	363240	So Magic is like the secret that everybody's using, that's making everybody else rich. Everybody else but me.
364240	372240	I know at least one guy. He's got his own company. I'm not going to disclose who or anything like that.
372240	381240	But he's got a company. He's got some three, four consultants working for him as, you know, on a consultancy basis.
381240	391240	And then he's got a lot of hardware that he's probably paying like, I don't know, $20,000, $30,000 a month for.
391240	398240	But he's invoicing his clients $180,000 per month.
398240	404240	He's driving a $200,000 car.
404240	410240	I'm driving a 22 year old wreck.
410240	414240	And I made him rich.
414240	424240	Now, of course, he's using additional things, but Magic is one of the core building blocks he's using in his business.
424240	431240	And there are thousands of these guys out there.
431240	437240	They're not contributing to me. They're not contributing with monetary funds.
437240	444240	They're not contributing with contributions to the source code.
444240	449240	And they're not even publicly admitting on Facebook that they're using Magic.
449240	453240	They're not even helping us marketing the thing at all.
453240	463240	I mean, it's like as if they cringe to simply click like on the GitHub profile because they don't want the project to become popular.
463240	470240	They want it to be like their secret. They want it to be like, oh, I discovered something.
470240	473240	I'm not going to tell anybody about it. It's freaking brilliant.
473240	480240	It made me a billionaire and I'm going to be the only one who's able to use it and nobody's going to understand shit.
480240	485240	And I can invoice like $20,000 per hour I'm working.
485240	490240	Well, it's not funny. It's not funny for me.
490240	497240	So we have changed the license terms of magic, which we can.
497240	507240	We cannot do this revocably backwards in time, but since the entirety of the intellectual property belongs to me,
507240	515240	I can change the licensing terms of magic and I've changed it to a closed source project.
515240	527240	If you want access to the source codes and or you want to install it on your own servers or in your own Kubernetes cluster, et cetera, et cetera,
527240	532240	you need to start paying me. It's really that simple.
532240	535240	I want a piece of the pie. I made you rich.
535240	540240	You know, you got to start sharing the wealth with the guy who facilitated for it.
540240	553240	So magic is as of now closed source and we're charging $5,000 per month, per month for a single server license,
553240	566240	which will give you further record access to the source code, but you will only have the legal license terms to use it on one single server.
566240	577240	If you want to deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster, you're going to have to pay us $20,000 per month.
577240	585240	And the reasons for that is quite simple. If you are using magic and you know how to leverage it,
585240	596240	one single human being can replace 50 senior software back end developers.
596240	604240	So I mean, even for $20,000 a month, as far as I'm concerned, it's a bargain.
604240	606240	Have a nice day.
