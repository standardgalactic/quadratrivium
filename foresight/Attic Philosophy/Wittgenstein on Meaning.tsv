0	7000	What is language? What is meaning? And how does language come to have its meaning in the first place?
7000	14500	Today, we're going to look at probably the most influential philosopher of all time to write on this subject, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
14500	23000	We're going to focus in on his second great philosophical work, the Philosophical Investigations, where he really tries to focus in on the question of
23000	29500	what is a language and how does it get its meaning. Wittgenstein is looking at previous theories of language and meaning,
29500	36500	and basically saying they all try to claim that language has this or that basic purpose or essence.
36500	45000	Wittgenstein's going to say, language doesn't really have a single essence. There is no one way we can sum up what language is all about.
45000	54000	Nevertheless, he's not going to say that language doesn't have any meaning as a consequence. Rather, he's going to make sense or try to make sense of what language
54000	58000	means without thinking of it as having a single essence.
58000	67000	Okay, that's where we're going to be going. Let's get straight to it. Wittgenstein was working on the Philosophical Investigations through the late 1930s and 1940s,
67000	76500	but it was only published posthumously in 1953. He starts it in a pretty surprising way, with a long quote from the philosopher St. Augustine.
76500	86000	Wittgenstein's trying to describe a view of language, a historical philosophy of language, which he calls the Augustinian view, and he describes it like this.
86000	95500	The individual words in the language name objects, sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language, we find the roots of the following idea.
95500	102500	Each word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.
102500	111500	Okay, so this is the view that Wittgenstein calls the Augustinian view. He's not defending that view. He's going to go on and criticize that view.
111500	117500	Why is Wittgenstein interested in this philosopher, St. Augustine? Well, really, he's not.
117500	126500	What he's interested in is a picture of language that he thinks is completely pervasive in the history of our thinking about language and meaning.
126500	134500	When we start thinking about what language means, we tend to think, oh, here's a word and the word picks out some object in the world and sentences.
134500	143500	They're just combinations of these words, so ultimately what language is doing is it's describing the world, it's picking out objects in the world.
143500	155500	Wittgenstein is going to say that's not how language works, or rather, sometimes language works like that, but that's not really the main story about how language gets its meaning.
155500	163500	So first up, let's just say a little bit more about what Wittgenstein has in mind by what he's calling the Augustinian view of language.
163500	172500	So the basic view is that words stand for objects in the world, and a word gets its meaning by correlating the word with an object.
172500	178500	And on this picture, how would we explain these meanings to one another? How would we learn a language in the first place?
178500	186500	Well, says Wittgenstein, ostensive definition is going to be the key to this theory of language.
186500	193500	What's an ostensive definition? It's when we point at an object and we go, that thing is called whatever.
193500	201500	So here I am sitting in my attic at the moment. That thing over there, that's a camera. That thing up there, that's a light.
201500	207500	This thing here, that's a person. That's how we would explain what words mean.
207500	214500	We would point to the object that is the meaning of the word, and we would say the word, ostensive definition.
214500	221500	And just to be clear here, Wittgenstein isn't endorsing this view, he's explaining the view and he's going to go on to criticise it.
221500	227500	Why is Wittgenstein talking about this really kind of, you know, far back in the past historical figure, St Augustine,
227500	230500	who we don't often think of as a philosopher of language?
230500	236500	Really what Wittgenstein's trying to do here is not pick on this one particular philosopher, St Augustine,
236500	241500	rather he's trying to stress the universality of this picture of language.
241500	246500	So many philosophers throughout the history of philosophy, you know, Descartes, Locke, loads of them,
246500	250500	basically assume this picture of how language works.
250500	259500	What Wittgenstein's trying to do here is just emphasise how universal this view is and how uncritically accepted the view is within the history of philosophy.
259500	261500	Then he's going to go on to criticise it.
261500	270500	One of the philosophers that Wittgenstein is setting out to criticise alongside Augustine and Descartes and Locke is Wittgenstein himself.
270500	278500	So he's going to criticise the view of language that he's set out in his previous book, The Tractatus Logico Philosophicus.
278500	282500	OK, but if he'd started his second book, The Philosophical Investigations, by saying,
282500	286500	I'm going to criticise what I previously said in my first book.
286500	289500	You know, that kind of seems a bit narrow and people might legitimately say,
289500	294500	well, you know, OK, you're admitting you're wrong, but why should I care?
294500	303500	It's much more interesting for him to say, I think most philosophers in the past held this view of language and I'm going to tell you what's wrong with it.
303500	307500	Before we go any further, I'd just like to jump in here and say, I hope you're enjoying this content.
307500	311500	If you'd like to help me out to make more educational, academic content like this,
311500	315500	go and take a look at my Ko-Fi page and see how you can help me out.
315500	322500	OK, so first up, what does Wittgenstein think is wrong with the Augustinian view of language?
322500	328500	Wittgenstein gives a number of different objections and the first one is based around this idea of extensive definition.
328500	336500	The idea that extensive definitions pointing to an object and saying the associated word are meant to be the foundations of language learning.
336500	339500	Wittgenstein thinks that just can't be right.
339500	341500	The basic problem he brings up is this.
341500	346500	Suppose we point to an object like I point to the camera over there and I say, that's a camera.
346500	349500	I could be pointing to any number of things.
349500	355500	I could be pointing to the object, the camera, or I could be pointing to another object like the lens,
355500	361500	or I could be pointing to the shape or the color or the size of the thing.
361500	363500	I could be saying there's one thing there.
363500	365500	I could be saying that belongs to me.
365500	372500	If we don't know the function of the word camera, how do we know what kind of thing I'm trying to talk about?
372500	374500	Or even am I talking about a thing at all?
374500	377500	Am I talking about the fact that I own it?
377500	382500	Or am I talking about an expression of, you know, I like that thing or I don't like that thing?
382500	387500	Unless we know how the word camera is meant to function, you know, is it meant to pick out an object?
387500	390500	Is it meant to describe how I feel about it?
390500	395500	Unless we know those things, we can't really hope to use an ostensive definition,
395500	398500	a pointing gesture to explain what the word means.
398500	404500	Now, Wittgenstein's not denying that we ever use ostensive definitions to convey what a word means, right?
404500	410500	Once we know that the word camera is a word that picks out a kind of object,
410500	415500	then you might go, oh, well, what kind of object does the word camera pick out?
415500	419500	And I'll go, that kind. See that object over there? That's a camera.
419500	425500	Okay, so once we've got that set up, once we know the function, the grammatical purpose of the word,
425500	430500	then I can use it, I can use an ostensive definition to tell you what the word means.
430500	435500	But really Wittgenstein is saying there, it's not the ostensive definition itself,
435500	439500	rather it's the whole process, learning the grammatical function of the word.
439500	444500	Together with this process of you understanding that I'm now going to point to an object,
444500	448500	it's that whole kind of interaction that gives the word its meaning,
448500	451500	that allows me to communicate what that word means.
451500	454500	It's not just the ostensive definition.
454500	463500	So says Wittgenstein, ostensive definitions can't be the one and only foundation of language use.
463500	466500	So that's Wittgenstein's first objection to the Augustinian picture of language.
466500	468500	But then he raises some other worries, okay?
468500	473500	Think about all the words that don't stand for an object in the world.
473500	478500	Let's just take one particular example, names that don't pick out a particular existing object,
478500	483500	names like Robin Hood or Superman, they name fictitious entities, right?
483500	487500	I can't point to any particular existing person and say, oh, that's Robin Hood.
487500	491500	You know, I can point to a story or a picture or whatever, but you know,
491500	494500	the word Robin Hood doesn't pick out the picture.
494500	496500	It's not like the picture is called Robin Hood.
496500	502500	Robin Hood is the name for a person who may be existed in the past, but doesn't exist anymore,
502500	504500	maybe never existed at all.
504500	510500	Superman doesn't pick out any existing entity, you know, it's merely a fictional creation.
510500	516500	Okay, so if the word is meant to stand for an object in the world and there's no object in the world,
516500	520500	what on earth does that word or that name mean?
520500	526500	So this is the problem of empty reference or fictional names or, you know, got lots of different names.
526500	533500	What Wittgenstein's pointing out here is that even in the case of words that function grammatically as names,
533500	537500	their purpose is usually to pick out a particular person or object.
537500	541500	They needn't do it, but we can still communicate meaningfully with them.
541500	547500	Sometimes we use meaning and reference as synonymous concepts, but they're not always.
547500	551500	Words can have a meaning even if they don't have a reference,
551500	556500	as in there's no object in the world that that word stands for.
556500	560500	Third kind of objection that Wittgenstein gives to the Augustinian picture of language,
560500	563500	it's a very restrictive view of language.
563500	571500	It basically says the one and only function of language is to describe objects in the world,
571500	573500	to describe the ways that the world is.
573500	579500	And then Wittgenstein starts pointing out, look at all the different ways that we use language.
579500	584500	Look at all the different functions and purposes we might have in using bits of language.
584500	586500	So he gives the following examples.
586500	591500	Giving orders and obeying them, reporting an event, forming and testing a hypothesis,
591500	596500	making up a story and reading it, play acting, guessing riddles, making a joke.
596500	603500	Telling it, translating from one language into another, requesting, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.
603500	610500	Okay, so this is just a list of a whole bunch of different things that we can do by using language.
610500	613500	What is the argument that Wittgenstein's giving here?
613500	619500	Well, he's basically encouraging us to think about all of these different kinds of language use
619500	626500	and saying, do they really fit this picture of taking a word and using it to name an object in the world?
626500	627500	Not really.
627500	635500	We're doing many different kinds of things with words, with trying to communicate different things
635500	641500	or bring about different effects in our audience or sometimes just get people to laugh or whatever.
641500	648500	It's very, very difficult to boil all of these very, very different uses of language down to just one function,
648500	652500	like describing the way that objects in the world are.
652500	657500	This is a technique that Wittgenstein uses again and again throughout the philosophical investigations.
657500	662500	He's basically saying, look, you know, your theory says that this thing works this way or that way,
662500	669500	but just look, just go out there and think about all the different ways that language gets used.
669500	676500	It's going to be super hard to bring all of those diverse uses under one particular theory.
676500	677500	So he's not going to try and do that.
677500	683500	He's not going to try and give one theory that kind of unifies all of the diverse uses of language.
683500	688500	He's basically going to say, let's just look at the way language is in fact used.
688500	693500	We'll get into the details of what Wittgenstein says on those kind of issues later in the video,
693500	694500	so stick around for that.
695500	703500	Before we get to that, let's have a think about what Wittgenstein says about the relationship between language and the mind are thoughts.
703500	707500	So there's this idea of the Cartesian model of the mind.
707500	709500	Cartesian meaning coming from Descartes.
709500	717500	So Wittgenstein thinks the Cartesian model of the mind is an idea that underlies a lot of theories of language.
717500	719500	Wittgenstein thinks it's pervasive.
719500	720500	He thinks it's wrong.
720500	723500	So let's see what Wittgenstein says about that.
723500	729500	So according to the Cartesian model of the mind, the mind is like a private sphere.
729500	736500	Here I am inside my own mind, inside my own head, and that's something that I've got access to, but you don't.
736500	738500	You access your own mind, your own thoughts.
738500	739500	I can't access your mind.
739500	741500	You can't access my mind.
741500	748500	The best we can do is communicate our thoughts, our feelings, our beliefs, et cetera, using language.
748500	754500	So Wittgenstein's original target here in the Philosophical Investigations in Augustine, he wrote,
754500	765500	I want to make my wishes known to others, but this I could not do because my wishes were inside me while other people were outside and they had no faculty which could penetrate my mind.
765500	768500	And along similar lines, here's John Locke.
768500	777500	Words as they are used by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker.
777500	785500	Okay, so these are just examples of the kind of targets that Wittgenstein's got in mind, Descartes, Augustine Locke, basically saying,
785500	798500	here we have these private thoughts, these private ideas in our own minds, they're kind of locked away there, and it's language that we're using to label ideas in our minds and to communicate them with one another.
798500	800500	Okay, so we've got two ideas there.
800500	809500	One is private mental entities hidden away from everybody else, only I can access mine, only you can access yours, and language is the bridge.
809500	816500	Language is the tool that we use to communicate hidden private thoughts from one person to another.
816500	827500	So on this view, the purpose of language is kind of not just to label objects in the world, rather it's to communicate thoughts from one person to another.
827500	834500	It's like the bridge between hidden entities. Wittgenstein thinks that's just not what's going on at all.
834500	842500	All of this rests on a big philosophical misunderstanding, not just of language, but also of the mind.
842500	852500	So Wittgenstein says, Augustine describes the learning of human language as if the child came into a strange country and did not understand the language of that country.
853500	858500	That is, as if it already had a language, only not this one.
858500	868500	Or again, as if the child could already think, only not yet speak, and think would here mean something like talk to itself.
868500	871500	So Wittgenstein doesn't like this picture at all.
871500	877500	It's not the right picture of language, but it's also not the right way to think about the mind.
877500	882500	So these passages are the start of the famous private language argument.
882500	887500	I've done another video that does a deep dive on that. You can go and see that at this link here.
887500	896500	The idea is basically we're sometimes tempted to think that thoughts, ideas, emotions, etc. are these private entities in our minds.
896500	899500	Wittgenstein just thinks that is a big, big confusion.
899500	904500	Even if there were such things, we couldn't talk about them meaningfully.
904500	914500	OK, let's sum up where we've got so far. Wittgenstein has been criticising and rejecting two quite pervasive theories or ideas about how language works.
914500	922500	One is the Augustinian view with ostensive definition, words work by labelling and describing objects in the world,
922500	931500	and the other is the Cartesian model on which words work by labelling and describing private mental objects, thoughts and such.
931500	939500	OK, so what is Wittgenstein's positive view? What does he put in place of these views that he doesn't like?
939500	947500	So now Wittgenstein's going to start telling us about the way he thinks language does work, and he starts off in a pretty unusual way.
947500	952500	He says, think about games. Think about the concept of a game.
952500	957500	What does it take for something to be a game? Take all the different kind of games out there.
957500	963500	Do they all have to be competitive? Do they all have to have different teams fighting against each other?
963500	966500	Well, no, you don't have to have teams. They can be single-player games.
966500	973500	Do they have to be competitive? Maybe, but there are lots of competitive things like exams that aren't games.
973500	978500	It's actually really, really hard to say what something has to be to be a game.
978500	983500	That is to give a definition that all and only the games share.
983500	989500	It's difficult, in other words, to give a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for being a game.
989500	995500	Wittgenstein admits this and he says, OK, but is the concept of a game meaningless?
995500	1000500	No, of course not. We understand perfectly well what we mean by a game.
1000500	1005500	We understand what games are, even though we can't give a nice, sharp definition.
1005500	1008500	The concept itself isn't nice and sharp.
1008500	1017500	And his point here is that we don't have to have perfectly sharp, precise concepts in order for words to be meaningful.
1017500	1021500	The concept of a game, it's what he calls a family resemblance.
1021500	1026500	This idea of family resemblances is a pretty important Wittgensteinian notion.
1026500	1034500	According to Wittgenstein, a family resemblance is a complicated network of similarities overlapping and crisscrossing.
1034500	1041500	So for instance, I've got my mum's height, I've got my dad's chin, I've got my granddad's kind of pedantic streak.
1041500	1046500	You know, these aren't features that are shared by absolutely everyone in my family,
1046500	1050500	but anyone who knew my family well and then comes to know me will be like,
1050500	1055500	yep, he's pedantic just like his granddad was, or they might go, oh, you've got your dad's chin.
1055500	1058500	OK, so this is the idea of family resemblances.
1058500	1064500	But there might be no one single feature that every single member of that family has
1064500	1069500	that differentiates them from any other unrelated families.
1069500	1075500	OK, so we're not looking for one characteristic that all and only the members of this family have,
1075500	1080500	but nevertheless we can pick out various different physical features that allow us to say,
1080500	1083500	oh yeah, I can see that those two people are related.
1083500	1086500	Wittgenstein says it's pretty much the same with games.
1086500	1094500	We can say that this thing counts as a game because it relates to these other clear concepts of games in this or that way.
1094500	1100500	But in so doing, we're not saying that every single possible game out there has to have these features
1100500	1105500	because there might be other ways in which other games resemble these games that we know and love.
1105500	1108500	There's no one feature that unites all the games.
1108500	1118500	Nevertheless, anything that we think of as being a game is going to resemble the things that we take to be the paradigm games in one or two or more ways.
1118500	1123500	So in practice, we have a perfectly good working concept of a game.
1123500	1128500	We can meaningfully use that word even though we haven't given it precise boundaries.
1128500	1131500	We haven't given it a set of necessary and sufficient conditions.
1131500	1137500	So we've got this idea of the paradigm games, the kind of central exemplars of the concept.
1137500	1143500	So in our case, that might include physical sports like football, rugby, cricket.
1143500	1147500	It might include the ball games that you learn when you're a kid.
1147500	1149500	You're growing up. You play these games with your family.
1149500	1153500	These all count as paradigm games, paradigm examples of the concept.
1153500	1158500	And then we can say, oh, this other thing, well, it counts as a game because it resembles this paradigm.
1158500	1165500	And this other thing counts as a game because it resembles this other paradigm game, perhaps in completely different ways.
1165500	1171500	So the concept is vague. We don't have to give it sharp boundaries for it to count as being meaningful.
1171500	1181500	And then Wittgenstein is expanding this analysis, not just to the concept of a game, but to the concept of language use in totality.
1181500	1187500	Vagueness is an inherent feature of language, not just in the words themselves, but in the way that we use language.
1187500	1193500	There is no precise definition of what using language is or the purposes that language can have.
1193500	1196500	We use language in many, many different ways.
1196500	1203500	And this use of language and that use of language, well, they might bear a family resemblance to one another.
1203500	1211500	They don't have to fit a very narrow template of what language is all about, like it is on the Augustinian view of language
1211500	1214500	and like it is in the Cartesian model of the mind.
1214500	1219500	Wittgenstein takes this example of a game really quite seriously.
1219500	1228500	He talks about language games. Basically, when we are using a language, using a language in a certain way, it's like we're playing a game.
1228500	1238500	And just like we can't say the one thing that all the games have in common, similarly, we can't say the one thing that all the language games have in common.
1238500	1247500	Nevertheless, all the different language games out there, asking a question, telling a joke, making up a story and telling it and so on,
1247500	1252500	they all bear a family resemblance to the paradigm cases of language use.
1252500	1264500	Wittgenstein says, here, the term language game is meant to bring into prominence the fact that speaking a language is part of an activity or of a form of life.
1264500	1270500	So we've hit on another central Wittgensteinian concept here, this idea of a form of life.
1270500	1278500	And I think this is one of the most confusing and contested ideas that we get out of Wittgenstein in this part of the philosophical investigations.
1278500	1284500	What does he mean by a form of life and why is it important to understanding language use?
1284500	1292500	Well, to try and get a handle on that, let's start off by setting up a potential problem with this Wittgensteinian understanding of language.
1292500	1299500	Games are governed by rules. That's really what makes them games rather than just like random doings of stuff.
1299500	1304500	And similarly, Wittgenstein says, language games, language use, it's based on rules.
1304500	1311500	Okay, but if that's the case, and we're taking this analogy with games seriously, the rules of the game, they're up to us.
1311500	1316500	So if the rules of language are up to us, why can't we just change them willy-nilly?
1316500	1320500	Think about what Humpty Dumpty says in Alice in Wonderland.
1320500	1328500	When I use a word Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.
1328500	1335500	The question is, said Alice, whether you can make words mean so many different things.
1335500	1340500	The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be master, that's all.
1340500	1347500	So what's going on here? Wittgenstein wants to say, yes, we are responsible for the rules of language.
1347500	1356500	The meaning of language is up to us, but me or you as individuals, we can't just use words however we want as Humpty Dumpty tried to do.
1356500	1364500	The fact that we use language in a meaningful way means that we have to have some kind of shared principles.
1364500	1367500	And this is what he calls the shared form of life.
1367500	1375500	One way of thinking about it is, it's the way we do things as a community, as a community of speakers, a language community.
1375500	1387500	Wittgenstein says, if language is to be a means of communication, there must be agreement, not only in definitions, but also, queer as this may sound, in judgments.
1387500	1395500	So in order for us to use a language meaningfully, Wittgenstein thinks we first have to agree on certain basic things.
1395500	1402500	And that doesn't mean that we have to kind of get together and say, OK, we agree on this, this, this and this, now we can use language.
1402500	1407500	Rather, it just means that we have to, as a community, kind of rub along together.
1407500	1415500	And now at this point, you might be thinking, well, that seems kind of really problematic because on loads of big issues, we don't agree.
1415500	1417500	We don't have shared interests.
1417500	1424500	So, you know, Wittgenstein here, he's not talking about, oh, we have to agree, you know, politically or anything like that.
1424500	1429500	Obviously, we can use language meaningfully to express these disagreements we have.
1429500	1439500	What Wittgenstein's trying to get at here is that there are embedded in our society, you know, certain principles that are so foundational that we don't really think about them.
1439500	1450500	But, you know, ideas like, there is a world out there, there are other people and we have to communicate with each other both about our wants and our needs and our feelings and about the stuff out there in the world.
1450500	1458500	According to Wittgenstein, if there was a community out there that just didn't have any of these shared principles, we really wouldn't be able to communicate with them at all.
1458500	1462500	We wouldn't be able to communicate with a completely different form of life.
1462500	1467500	He says at one point, if a lion could talk, we could not understand him.
1467500	1472500	This is one of the most confusing things I think he says in the philosophical investigations.
1472500	1479500	You know, are we saying that we are a shared form of life because we share a biology that the lion doesn't share?
1479500	1483500	Or is it more to do with social and cultural principles?
1483500	1487500	Different Wittgenstein scholars have taken different interpretations here.
1487500	1491500	You know, Wittgenstein isn't completely precise in what he says.
1491500	1494500	He doesn't set out his theory and try to avoid all misunderstandings.
1494500	1497500	That's just not the way he does philosophy.
1497500	1507500	So I think, you know, there is definitely lots of leeway to interpret Wittgenstein in different ways on this point, on this particular point about what he means by a form of life.
1507500	1516500	But what we should definitely agree is that Wittgenstein thinks that form of life, whatever it means, is really essential to language having a meaning at all.
1516500	1524500	And you know, Wittgenstein isn't really trying to give us a precise theory, a model of how language gets its meaning.
1524500	1542500	Rather, he's trying to get us to go out there and look at how language is used in practice and through looking, through looking carefully to understand how language gets its meaning, how all the different uses of language interact.
1542500	1551500	He says, for a large class of cases, though not for all in which we employ the word meaning, it can be defined thus.
1551500	1554500	The meaning of a word is its use in the language.
1554500	1561500	So this is probably one of the most famous ideas that Wittgenstein gives us, the idea of meaning as use.
1561500	1573500	It's the idea that language gets its meaning not through describing objects out there in the world or through picking out private hidden ideas in our minds, but by being used.
1573500	1582500	And because there are lots of different ways of using language, lots of different language games, there's not going to be one unified account of meaning.
1582500	1584500	You know, language means this or language means that.
1584500	1585500	That's how we understand it.
1585500	1589500	Language isn't going to have this one unified essence.
1589500	1597500	Really Wittgenstein says the best we can do as philosophers of language is to say, there's this language game here and this is how this one works.
1597500	1600500	And there's this language game over there and that's how this one works.
1600500	1605500	They're both language games because they bear a family resemblance to one another.
1605500	1606500	What do they have in common?
1606500	1609500	What is the theory of meaning that encompasses all of them?
1609500	1611500	Well, that's where we can't really go.
1611500	1615500	All we can do is describe how this one works and how that one works.
1615500	1624500	And once we've said what their use is, that's really all we can say about the meaning of language to attempt to go further than that.
1624500	1637500	According to Wittgenstein is really to fall into this trap of the Augustinian picture of language or the Cartesian model of the mind in thinking that language has this unified essence when it doesn't.
1637500	1639500	Well, that's what Wittgenstein says.
1639500	1641500	It's a really controversial view.
1641500	1642500	Not everybody agrees with it.
1642500	1643500	What do you think?
1643500	1645500	Leave me your thoughts down in the comments.
1645500	1647500	I'm going to try to reply to all of them.
1647500	1656500	You know, I don't always agree with Wittgenstein on all this stuff, but I hope I've convinced you what a fascinating and influential philosopher of language he is.
