00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What is language? What is meaning? And how does language come to have its meaning in the first place?

00:07.000 --> 00:14.500
Today, we're going to look at probably the most influential philosopher of all time to write on this subject, Ludwig Wittgenstein.

00:14.500 --> 00:23.000
We're going to focus in on his second great philosophical work, the Philosophical Investigations, where he really tries to focus in on the question of

00:23.000 --> 00:29.500
what is a language and how does it get its meaning. Wittgenstein is looking at previous theories of language and meaning,

00:29.500 --> 00:36.500
and basically saying they all try to claim that language has this or that basic purpose or essence.

00:36.500 --> 00:45.000
Wittgenstein's going to say, language doesn't really have a single essence. There is no one way we can sum up what language is all about.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
Nevertheless, he's not going to say that language doesn't have any meaning as a consequence. Rather, he's going to make sense or try to make sense of what language

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
means without thinking of it as having a single essence.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, that's where we're going to be going. Let's get straight to it. Wittgenstein was working on the Philosophical Investigations through the late 1930s and 1940s,

01:07.000 --> 01:16.500
but it was only published posthumously in 1953. He starts it in a pretty surprising way, with a long quote from the philosopher St. Augustine.

01:16.500 --> 01:26.000
Wittgenstein's trying to describe a view of language, a historical philosophy of language, which he calls the Augustinian view, and he describes it like this.

01:26.000 --> 01:35.500
The individual words in the language name objects, sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language, we find the roots of the following idea.

01:35.500 --> 01:42.500
Each word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.

01:42.500 --> 01:51.500
Okay, so this is the view that Wittgenstein calls the Augustinian view. He's not defending that view. He's going to go on and criticize that view.

01:51.500 --> 01:57.500
Why is Wittgenstein interested in this philosopher, St. Augustine? Well, really, he's not.

01:57.500 --> 02:06.500
What he's interested in is a picture of language that he thinks is completely pervasive in the history of our thinking about language and meaning.

02:06.500 --> 02:14.500
When we start thinking about what language means, we tend to think, oh, here's a word and the word picks out some object in the world and sentences.

02:14.500 --> 02:23.500
They're just combinations of these words, so ultimately what language is doing is it's describing the world, it's picking out objects in the world.

02:23.500 --> 02:35.500
Wittgenstein is going to say that's not how language works, or rather, sometimes language works like that, but that's not really the main story about how language gets its meaning.

02:35.500 --> 02:43.500
So first up, let's just say a little bit more about what Wittgenstein has in mind by what he's calling the Augustinian view of language.

02:43.500 --> 02:52.500
So the basic view is that words stand for objects in the world, and a word gets its meaning by correlating the word with an object.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.500
And on this picture, how would we explain these meanings to one another? How would we learn a language in the first place?

02:58.500 --> 03:06.500
Well, says Wittgenstein, ostensive definition is going to be the key to this theory of language.

03:06.500 --> 03:13.500
What's an ostensive definition? It's when we point at an object and we go, that thing is called whatever.

03:13.500 --> 03:21.500
So here I am sitting in my attic at the moment. That thing over there, that's a camera. That thing up there, that's a light.

03:21.500 --> 03:27.500
This thing here, that's a person. That's how we would explain what words mean.

03:27.500 --> 03:34.500
We would point to the object that is the meaning of the word, and we would say the word, ostensive definition.

03:34.500 --> 03:41.500
And just to be clear here, Wittgenstein isn't endorsing this view, he's explaining the view and he's going to go on to criticise it.

03:41.500 --> 03:47.500
Why is Wittgenstein talking about this really kind of, you know, far back in the past historical figure, St Augustine,

03:47.500 --> 03:50.500
who we don't often think of as a philosopher of language?

03:50.500 --> 03:56.500
Really what Wittgenstein's trying to do here is not pick on this one particular philosopher, St Augustine,

03:56.500 --> 04:01.500
rather he's trying to stress the universality of this picture of language.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.500
So many philosophers throughout the history of philosophy, you know, Descartes, Locke, loads of them,

04:06.500 --> 04:10.500
basically assume this picture of how language works.

04:10.500 --> 04:19.500
What Wittgenstein's trying to do here is just emphasise how universal this view is and how uncritically accepted the view is within the history of philosophy.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.500
Then he's going to go on to criticise it.

04:21.500 --> 04:30.500
One of the philosophers that Wittgenstein is setting out to criticise alongside Augustine and Descartes and Locke is Wittgenstein himself.

04:30.500 --> 04:38.500
So he's going to criticise the view of language that he's set out in his previous book, The Tractatus Logico Philosophicus.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.500
OK, but if he'd started his second book, The Philosophical Investigations, by saying,

04:42.500 --> 04:46.500
I'm going to criticise what I previously said in my first book.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.500
You know, that kind of seems a bit narrow and people might legitimately say,

04:49.500 --> 04:54.500
well, you know, OK, you're admitting you're wrong, but why should I care?

04:54.500 --> 05:03.500
It's much more interesting for him to say, I think most philosophers in the past held this view of language and I'm going to tell you what's wrong with it.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.500
Before we go any further, I'd just like to jump in here and say, I hope you're enjoying this content.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.500
If you'd like to help me out to make more educational, academic content like this,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.500
go and take a look at my Ko-Fi page and see how you can help me out.

05:15.500 --> 05:22.500
OK, so first up, what does Wittgenstein think is wrong with the Augustinian view of language?

05:22.500 --> 05:28.500
Wittgenstein gives a number of different objections and the first one is based around this idea of extensive definition.

05:28.500 --> 05:36.500
The idea that extensive definitions pointing to an object and saying the associated word are meant to be the foundations of language learning.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
Wittgenstein thinks that just can't be right.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
The basic problem he brings up is this.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.500
Suppose we point to an object like I point to the camera over there and I say, that's a camera.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
I could be pointing to any number of things.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.500
I could be pointing to the object, the camera, or I could be pointing to another object like the lens,

05:55.500 --> 06:01.500
or I could be pointing to the shape or the color or the size of the thing.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
I could be saying there's one thing there.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
I could be saying that belongs to me.

06:05.500 --> 06:12.500
If we don't know the function of the word camera, how do we know what kind of thing I'm trying to talk about?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Or even am I talking about a thing at all?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.500
Am I talking about the fact that I own it?

06:17.500 --> 06:22.500
Or am I talking about an expression of, you know, I like that thing or I don't like that thing?

06:22.500 --> 06:27.500
Unless we know how the word camera is meant to function, you know, is it meant to pick out an object?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.500
Is it meant to describe how I feel about it?

06:30.500 --> 06:35.500
Unless we know those things, we can't really hope to use an ostensive definition,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
a pointing gesture to explain what the word means.

06:38.500 --> 06:44.500
Now, Wittgenstein's not denying that we ever use ostensive definitions to convey what a word means, right?

06:44.500 --> 06:50.500
Once we know that the word camera is a word that picks out a kind of object,

06:50.500 --> 06:55.500
then you might go, oh, well, what kind of object does the word camera pick out?

06:55.500 --> 06:59.500
And I'll go, that kind. See that object over there? That's a camera.

06:59.500 --> 07:05.500
Okay, so once we've got that set up, once we know the function, the grammatical purpose of the word,

07:05.500 --> 07:10.500
then I can use it, I can use an ostensive definition to tell you what the word means.

07:10.500 --> 07:15.500
But really Wittgenstein is saying there, it's not the ostensive definition itself,

07:15.500 --> 07:19.500
rather it's the whole process, learning the grammatical function of the word.

07:19.500 --> 07:24.500
Together with this process of you understanding that I'm now going to point to an object,

07:24.500 --> 07:28.500
it's that whole kind of interaction that gives the word its meaning,

07:28.500 --> 07:31.500
that allows me to communicate what that word means.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.500
It's not just the ostensive definition.

07:34.500 --> 07:43.500
So says Wittgenstein, ostensive definitions can't be the one and only foundation of language use.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.500
So that's Wittgenstein's first objection to the Augustinian picture of language.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
But then he raises some other worries, okay?

07:48.500 --> 07:53.500
Think about all the words that don't stand for an object in the world.

07:53.500 --> 07:58.500
Let's just take one particular example, names that don't pick out a particular existing object,

07:58.500 --> 08:03.500
names like Robin Hood or Superman, they name fictitious entities, right?

08:03.500 --> 08:07.500
I can't point to any particular existing person and say, oh, that's Robin Hood.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.500
You know, I can point to a story or a picture or whatever, but you know,

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
the word Robin Hood doesn't pick out the picture.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
It's not like the picture is called Robin Hood.

08:16.500 --> 08:22.500
Robin Hood is the name for a person who may be existed in the past, but doesn't exist anymore,

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
maybe never existed at all.

08:24.500 --> 08:30.500
Superman doesn't pick out any existing entity, you know, it's merely a fictional creation.

08:30.500 --> 08:36.500
Okay, so if the word is meant to stand for an object in the world and there's no object in the world,

08:36.500 --> 08:40.500
what on earth does that word or that name mean?

08:40.500 --> 08:46.500
So this is the problem of empty reference or fictional names or, you know, got lots of different names.

08:46.500 --> 08:53.500
What Wittgenstein's pointing out here is that even in the case of words that function grammatically as names,

08:53.500 --> 08:57.500
their purpose is usually to pick out a particular person or object.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.500
They needn't do it, but we can still communicate meaningfully with them.

09:01.500 --> 09:07.500
Sometimes we use meaning and reference as synonymous concepts, but they're not always.

09:07.500 --> 09:11.500
Words can have a meaning even if they don't have a reference,

09:11.500 --> 09:16.500
as in there's no object in the world that that word stands for.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.500
Third kind of objection that Wittgenstein gives to the Augustinian picture of language,

09:20.500 --> 09:23.500
it's a very restrictive view of language.

09:23.500 --> 09:31.500
It basically says the one and only function of language is to describe objects in the world,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
to describe the ways that the world is.

09:33.500 --> 09:39.500
And then Wittgenstein starts pointing out, look at all the different ways that we use language.

09:39.500 --> 09:44.500
Look at all the different functions and purposes we might have in using bits of language.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
So he gives the following examples.

09:46.500 --> 09:51.500
Giving orders and obeying them, reporting an event, forming and testing a hypothesis,

09:51.500 --> 09:56.500
making up a story and reading it, play acting, guessing riddles, making a joke.

09:56.500 --> 10:03.500
Telling it, translating from one language into another, requesting, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.

10:03.500 --> 10:10.500
Okay, so this is just a list of a whole bunch of different things that we can do by using language.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.500
What is the argument that Wittgenstein's giving here?

10:13.500 --> 10:19.500
Well, he's basically encouraging us to think about all of these different kinds of language use

10:19.500 --> 10:26.500
and saying, do they really fit this picture of taking a word and using it to name an object in the world?

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Not really.

10:27.500 --> 10:35.500
We're doing many different kinds of things with words, with trying to communicate different things

10:35.500 --> 10:41.500
or bring about different effects in our audience or sometimes just get people to laugh or whatever.

10:41.500 --> 10:48.500
It's very, very difficult to boil all of these very, very different uses of language down to just one function,

10:48.500 --> 10:52.500
like describing the way that objects in the world are.

10:52.500 --> 10:57.500
This is a technique that Wittgenstein uses again and again throughout the philosophical investigations.

10:57.500 --> 11:02.500
He's basically saying, look, you know, your theory says that this thing works this way or that way,

11:02.500 --> 11:09.500
but just look, just go out there and think about all the different ways that language gets used.

11:09.500 --> 11:16.500
It's going to be super hard to bring all of those diverse uses under one particular theory.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
So he's not going to try and do that.

11:17.500 --> 11:23.500
He's not going to try and give one theory that kind of unifies all of the diverse uses of language.

11:23.500 --> 11:28.500
He's basically going to say, let's just look at the way language is in fact used.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
We'll get into the details of what Wittgenstein says on those kind of issues later in the video,

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
so stick around for that.

11:35.500 --> 11:43.500
Before we get to that, let's have a think about what Wittgenstein says about the relationship between language and the mind are thoughts.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.500
So there's this idea of the Cartesian model of the mind.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
Cartesian meaning coming from Descartes.

11:49.500 --> 11:57.500
So Wittgenstein thinks the Cartesian model of the mind is an idea that underlies a lot of theories of language.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
Wittgenstein thinks it's pervasive.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
He thinks it's wrong.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.500
So let's see what Wittgenstein says about that.

12:03.500 --> 12:09.500
So according to the Cartesian model of the mind, the mind is like a private sphere.

12:09.500 --> 12:16.500
Here I am inside my own mind, inside my own head, and that's something that I've got access to, but you don't.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
You access your own mind, your own thoughts.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
I can't access your mind.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
You can't access my mind.

12:21.500 --> 12:28.500
The best we can do is communicate our thoughts, our feelings, our beliefs, et cetera, using language.

12:28.500 --> 12:34.500
So Wittgenstein's original target here in the Philosophical Investigations in Augustine, he wrote,

12:34.500 --> 12:45.500
I want to make my wishes known to others, but this I could not do because my wishes were inside me while other people were outside and they had no faculty which could penetrate my mind.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.500
And along similar lines, here's John Locke.

12:48.500 --> 12:57.500
Words as they are used by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker.

12:57.500 --> 13:05.500
Okay, so these are just examples of the kind of targets that Wittgenstein's got in mind, Descartes, Augustine Locke, basically saying,

13:05.500 --> 13:18.500
here we have these private thoughts, these private ideas in our own minds, they're kind of locked away there, and it's language that we're using to label ideas in our minds and to communicate them with one another.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.500
Okay, so we've got two ideas there.

13:20.500 --> 13:29.500
One is private mental entities hidden away from everybody else, only I can access mine, only you can access yours, and language is the bridge.

13:29.500 --> 13:36.500
Language is the tool that we use to communicate hidden private thoughts from one person to another.

13:36.500 --> 13:47.500
So on this view, the purpose of language is kind of not just to label objects in the world, rather it's to communicate thoughts from one person to another.

13:47.500 --> 13:54.500
It's like the bridge between hidden entities. Wittgenstein thinks that's just not what's going on at all.

13:54.500 --> 14:02.500
All of this rests on a big philosophical misunderstanding, not just of language, but also of the mind.

14:02.500 --> 14:12.500
So Wittgenstein says, Augustine describes the learning of human language as if the child came into a strange country and did not understand the language of that country.

14:13.500 --> 14:18.500
That is, as if it already had a language, only not this one.

14:18.500 --> 14:28.500
Or again, as if the child could already think, only not yet speak, and think would here mean something like talk to itself.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.500
So Wittgenstein doesn't like this picture at all.

14:31.500 --> 14:37.500
It's not the right picture of language, but it's also not the right way to think about the mind.

14:37.500 --> 14:42.500
So these passages are the start of the famous private language argument.

14:42.500 --> 14:47.500
I've done another video that does a deep dive on that. You can go and see that at this link here.

14:47.500 --> 14:56.500
The idea is basically we're sometimes tempted to think that thoughts, ideas, emotions, etc. are these private entities in our minds.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.500
Wittgenstein just thinks that is a big, big confusion.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.500
Even if there were such things, we couldn't talk about them meaningfully.

15:04.500 --> 15:14.500
OK, let's sum up where we've got so far. Wittgenstein has been criticising and rejecting two quite pervasive theories or ideas about how language works.

15:14.500 --> 15:22.500
One is the Augustinian view with ostensive definition, words work by labelling and describing objects in the world,

15:22.500 --> 15:31.500
and the other is the Cartesian model on which words work by labelling and describing private mental objects, thoughts and such.

15:31.500 --> 15:39.500
OK, so what is Wittgenstein's positive view? What does he put in place of these views that he doesn't like?

15:39.500 --> 15:47.500
So now Wittgenstein's going to start telling us about the way he thinks language does work, and he starts off in a pretty unusual way.

15:47.500 --> 15:52.500
He says, think about games. Think about the concept of a game.

15:52.500 --> 15:57.500
What does it take for something to be a game? Take all the different kind of games out there.

15:57.500 --> 16:03.500
Do they all have to be competitive? Do they all have to have different teams fighting against each other?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.500
Well, no, you don't have to have teams. They can be single-player games.

16:06.500 --> 16:13.500
Do they have to be competitive? Maybe, but there are lots of competitive things like exams that aren't games.

16:13.500 --> 16:18.500
It's actually really, really hard to say what something has to be to be a game.

16:18.500 --> 16:23.500
That is to give a definition that all and only the games share.

16:23.500 --> 16:29.500
It's difficult, in other words, to give a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for being a game.

16:29.500 --> 16:35.500
Wittgenstein admits this and he says, OK, but is the concept of a game meaningless?

16:35.500 --> 16:40.500
No, of course not. We understand perfectly well what we mean by a game.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.500
We understand what games are, even though we can't give a nice, sharp definition.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
The concept itself isn't nice and sharp.

16:48.500 --> 16:57.500
And his point here is that we don't have to have perfectly sharp, precise concepts in order for words to be meaningful.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.500
The concept of a game, it's what he calls a family resemblance.

17:01.500 --> 17:06.500
This idea of family resemblances is a pretty important Wittgensteinian notion.

17:06.500 --> 17:14.500
According to Wittgenstein, a family resemblance is a complicated network of similarities overlapping and crisscrossing.

17:14.500 --> 17:21.500
So for instance, I've got my mum's height, I've got my dad's chin, I've got my granddad's kind of pedantic streak.

17:21.500 --> 17:26.500
You know, these aren't features that are shared by absolutely everyone in my family,

17:26.500 --> 17:30.500
but anyone who knew my family well and then comes to know me will be like,

17:30.500 --> 17:35.500
yep, he's pedantic just like his granddad was, or they might go, oh, you've got your dad's chin.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.500
OK, so this is the idea of family resemblances.

17:38.500 --> 17:44.500
But there might be no one single feature that every single member of that family has

17:44.500 --> 17:49.500
that differentiates them from any other unrelated families.

17:49.500 --> 17:55.500
OK, so we're not looking for one characteristic that all and only the members of this family have,

17:55.500 --> 18:00.500
but nevertheless we can pick out various different physical features that allow us to say,

18:00.500 --> 18:03.500
oh yeah, I can see that those two people are related.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.500
Wittgenstein says it's pretty much the same with games.

18:06.500 --> 18:14.500
We can say that this thing counts as a game because it relates to these other clear concepts of games in this or that way.

18:14.500 --> 18:20.500
But in so doing, we're not saying that every single possible game out there has to have these features

18:20.500 --> 18:25.500
because there might be other ways in which other games resemble these games that we know and love.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.500
There's no one feature that unites all the games.

18:28.500 --> 18:38.500
Nevertheless, anything that we think of as being a game is going to resemble the things that we take to be the paradigm games in one or two or more ways.

18:38.500 --> 18:43.500
So in practice, we have a perfectly good working concept of a game.

18:43.500 --> 18:48.500
We can meaningfully use that word even though we haven't given it precise boundaries.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.500
We haven't given it a set of necessary and sufficient conditions.

18:51.500 --> 18:57.500
So we've got this idea of the paradigm games, the kind of central exemplars of the concept.

18:57.500 --> 19:03.500
So in our case, that might include physical sports like football, rugby, cricket.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.500
It might include the ball games that you learn when you're a kid.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
You're growing up. You play these games with your family.

19:09.500 --> 19:13.500
These all count as paradigm games, paradigm examples of the concept.

19:13.500 --> 19:18.500
And then we can say, oh, this other thing, well, it counts as a game because it resembles this paradigm.

19:18.500 --> 19:25.500
And this other thing counts as a game because it resembles this other paradigm game, perhaps in completely different ways.

19:25.500 --> 19:31.500
So the concept is vague. We don't have to give it sharp boundaries for it to count as being meaningful.

19:31.500 --> 19:41.500
And then Wittgenstein is expanding this analysis, not just to the concept of a game, but to the concept of language use in totality.

19:41.500 --> 19:47.500
Vagueness is an inherent feature of language, not just in the words themselves, but in the way that we use language.

19:47.500 --> 19:53.500
There is no precise definition of what using language is or the purposes that language can have.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.500
We use language in many, many different ways.

19:56.500 --> 20:03.500
And this use of language and that use of language, well, they might bear a family resemblance to one another.

20:03.500 --> 20:11.500
They don't have to fit a very narrow template of what language is all about, like it is on the Augustinian view of language

20:11.500 --> 20:14.500
and like it is in the Cartesian model of the mind.

20:14.500 --> 20:19.500
Wittgenstein takes this example of a game really quite seriously.

20:19.500 --> 20:28.500
He talks about language games. Basically, when we are using a language, using a language in a certain way, it's like we're playing a game.

20:28.500 --> 20:38.500
And just like we can't say the one thing that all the games have in common, similarly, we can't say the one thing that all the language games have in common.

20:38.500 --> 20:47.500
Nevertheless, all the different language games out there, asking a question, telling a joke, making up a story and telling it and so on,

20:47.500 --> 20:52.500
they all bear a family resemblance to the paradigm cases of language use.

20:52.500 --> 21:04.500
Wittgenstein says, here, the term language game is meant to bring into prominence the fact that speaking a language is part of an activity or of a form of life.

21:04.500 --> 21:10.500
So we've hit on another central Wittgensteinian concept here, this idea of a form of life.

21:10.500 --> 21:18.500
And I think this is one of the most confusing and contested ideas that we get out of Wittgenstein in this part of the philosophical investigations.

21:18.500 --> 21:24.500
What does he mean by a form of life and why is it important to understanding language use?

21:24.500 --> 21:32.500
Well, to try and get a handle on that, let's start off by setting up a potential problem with this Wittgensteinian understanding of language.

21:32.500 --> 21:39.500
Games are governed by rules. That's really what makes them games rather than just like random doings of stuff.

21:39.500 --> 21:44.500
And similarly, Wittgenstein says, language games, language use, it's based on rules.

21:44.500 --> 21:51.500
Okay, but if that's the case, and we're taking this analogy with games seriously, the rules of the game, they're up to us.

21:51.500 --> 21:56.500
So if the rules of language are up to us, why can't we just change them willy-nilly?

21:56.500 --> 22:00.500
Think about what Humpty Dumpty says in Alice in Wonderland.

22:00.500 --> 22:08.500
When I use a word Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.

22:08.500 --> 22:15.500
The question is, said Alice, whether you can make words mean so many different things.

22:15.500 --> 22:20.500
The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be master, that's all.

22:20.500 --> 22:27.500
So what's going on here? Wittgenstein wants to say, yes, we are responsible for the rules of language.

22:27.500 --> 22:36.500
The meaning of language is up to us, but me or you as individuals, we can't just use words however we want as Humpty Dumpty tried to do.

22:36.500 --> 22:44.500
The fact that we use language in a meaningful way means that we have to have some kind of shared principles.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.500
And this is what he calls the shared form of life.

22:47.500 --> 22:55.500
One way of thinking about it is, it's the way we do things as a community, as a community of speakers, a language community.

22:55.500 --> 23:07.500
Wittgenstein says, if language is to be a means of communication, there must be agreement, not only in definitions, but also, queer as this may sound, in judgments.

23:07.500 --> 23:15.500
So in order for us to use a language meaningfully, Wittgenstein thinks we first have to agree on certain basic things.

23:15.500 --> 23:22.500
And that doesn't mean that we have to kind of get together and say, OK, we agree on this, this, this and this, now we can use language.

23:22.500 --> 23:27.500
Rather, it just means that we have to, as a community, kind of rub along together.

23:27.500 --> 23:35.500
And now at this point, you might be thinking, well, that seems kind of really problematic because on loads of big issues, we don't agree.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
We don't have shared interests.

23:37.500 --> 23:44.500
So, you know, Wittgenstein here, he's not talking about, oh, we have to agree, you know, politically or anything like that.

23:44.500 --> 23:49.500
Obviously, we can use language meaningfully to express these disagreements we have.

23:49.500 --> 23:59.500
What Wittgenstein's trying to get at here is that there are embedded in our society, you know, certain principles that are so foundational that we don't really think about them.

23:59.500 --> 24:10.500
But, you know, ideas like, there is a world out there, there are other people and we have to communicate with each other both about our wants and our needs and our feelings and about the stuff out there in the world.

24:10.500 --> 24:18.500
According to Wittgenstein, if there was a community out there that just didn't have any of these shared principles, we really wouldn't be able to communicate with them at all.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.500
We wouldn't be able to communicate with a completely different form of life.

24:22.500 --> 24:27.500
He says at one point, if a lion could talk, we could not understand him.

24:27.500 --> 24:32.500
This is one of the most confusing things I think he says in the philosophical investigations.

24:32.500 --> 24:39.500
You know, are we saying that we are a shared form of life because we share a biology that the lion doesn't share?

24:39.500 --> 24:43.500
Or is it more to do with social and cultural principles?

24:43.500 --> 24:47.500
Different Wittgenstein scholars have taken different interpretations here.

24:47.500 --> 24:51.500
You know, Wittgenstein isn't completely precise in what he says.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.500
He doesn't set out his theory and try to avoid all misunderstandings.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.500
That's just not the way he does philosophy.

24:57.500 --> 25:07.500
So I think, you know, there is definitely lots of leeway to interpret Wittgenstein in different ways on this point, on this particular point about what he means by a form of life.

25:07.500 --> 25:16.500
But what we should definitely agree is that Wittgenstein thinks that form of life, whatever it means, is really essential to language having a meaning at all.

25:16.500 --> 25:24.500
And you know, Wittgenstein isn't really trying to give us a precise theory, a model of how language gets its meaning.

25:24.500 --> 25:42.500
Rather, he's trying to get us to go out there and look at how language is used in practice and through looking, through looking carefully to understand how language gets its meaning, how all the different uses of language interact.

25:42.500 --> 25:51.500
He says, for a large class of cases, though not for all in which we employ the word meaning, it can be defined thus.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.500
The meaning of a word is its use in the language.

25:54.500 --> 26:01.500
So this is probably one of the most famous ideas that Wittgenstein gives us, the idea of meaning as use.

26:01.500 --> 26:13.500
It's the idea that language gets its meaning not through describing objects out there in the world or through picking out private hidden ideas in our minds, but by being used.

26:13.500 --> 26:22.500
And because there are lots of different ways of using language, lots of different language games, there's not going to be one unified account of meaning.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
You know, language means this or language means that.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
That's how we understand it.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.500
Language isn't going to have this one unified essence.

26:29.500 --> 26:37.500
Really Wittgenstein says the best we can do as philosophers of language is to say, there's this language game here and this is how this one works.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.500
And there's this language game over there and that's how this one works.

26:40.500 --> 26:45.500
They're both language games because they bear a family resemblance to one another.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
What do they have in common?

26:46.500 --> 26:49.500
What is the theory of meaning that encompasses all of them?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
Well, that's where we can't really go.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.500
All we can do is describe how this one works and how that one works.

26:55.500 --> 27:04.500
And once we've said what their use is, that's really all we can say about the meaning of language to attempt to go further than that.

27:04.500 --> 27:17.500
According to Wittgenstein is really to fall into this trap of the Augustinian picture of language or the Cartesian model of the mind in thinking that language has this unified essence when it doesn't.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
Well, that's what Wittgenstein says.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.500
It's a really controversial view.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.500
Not everybody agrees with it.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.500
What do you think?

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
Leave me your thoughts down in the comments.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
I'm going to try to reply to all of them.

27:27.500 --> 27:36.500
You know, I don't always agree with Wittgenstein on all this stuff, but I hope I've convinced you what a fascinating and influential philosopher of language he is.

27:36.500 --> 27:43.500
