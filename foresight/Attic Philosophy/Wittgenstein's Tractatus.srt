00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Wittgenstein's Tractatus is one of the most baffling and mysterious and mystical and brilliant

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,920
and difficult works of philosophy ever written. It baffles pretty much everyone who's ever picked

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,280
it up. But the main ideas, the main lines of thought are actually relatively simple to explain.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,960
So that's what I'm going to try and do in this video today and we're going to get going with

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,320
that right now. Ludwig Wittgenstein produced two great works of philosophy, the Tractatus

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,440
Logico Philosophicus, published in 1921-22 and the Philosophical Investigations,

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,480
published posthumously in 1953. The Tractatus is a very, very unusual work of philosophy.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,800
It's a remarkably short work for a great work of philosophy and that's in part due to Wittgenstein's

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
condensed writing style which has put off many readers and confused a good number of philosophers.

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,680
So Wittgenstein wanted to express himself in as concise and as logical a way as possible. He was

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,040
influenced in that by the work of the great logicians, particularly Frager. Whether he was

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,720
successful in this, well you've got to read it and judge for yourself. The Tractatus is also unusual

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,200
in its layout so its paragraphs use a system of decimal notation which aims to make explicit

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
whether a new paragraph expands on the previous one or whether it's making a brand new point.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,080
The Tractatus contains a range of different philosophical topics but we can divide it up

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,800
into four main areas. There's the metaphysics of objects, Wittgenstein's idea that the world

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,040
is made up of facts, not of things. Then there's his picture theory of language and related to that

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,400
there's his philosophical account of meaning and meaninglessness and then there's his reflections

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,600
on the purpose of philosophy. Before we go any further I'd just like to jump in here and say

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,760
I hope you're enjoying this content. If you'd like to help me out to make more educational

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,840
So let's start where the Tractatus starts with the metaphysics, the logical structure of reality.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
The Tractatus begins with these words. The world is all that is the case. The world is the totality

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,880
of facts, not of things. The world is determined by facts and by there being all the facts.

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,040
For the totality of facts determines what is the case and also whatever is not the case.

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,480
You see what I mean about this being really complicated to read? What on earth does Wittgenstein

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,920
mean by that? Well really what he's talking about here is the way the world is okay? By fact Wittgenstein

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
doesn't mean something in language a true sentence like we would often say that's a fact. He means

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
something like a state of affairs, something in the world. The world being a certain way

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,800
like I am sitting down right now that is one fact. It's sunny outside in Nottingham right now that

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,840
is another fact. These are all different facts and together Wittgenstein says these facts make up

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,440
the world what we mean by reality and the contrast here that he brings out is it's not just things

33
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,480
or objects that make up reality you know me, you, the camera and stuff like that because if we just

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,680
had things we would just have a collection of stuff right? What's important when we think about

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,240
reality is not just the things but the way those things are the properties they have like me sitting

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,520
down like the camera being on and the relationships between them. I'm talking into the camera,

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,400
you're watching me talk into the camera and so on. All of these facts together make up the

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
totality of reality. So this way of thinking of the world breaking it down into its constituent

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,320
facts is basically related to the logical atomism that Wittgenstein developed alongside his teacher

40
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,160
Bertrand Russell. Russell taught Wittgenstein when Wittgenstein was an undergraduate at Cambridge

41
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,720
in the early decade of the 20th century 1912 he started there and they became friends and they

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,920
worked closely together on philosophy developing this idea of logical atomism. So atomism in general

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,480
is the view that the world is made up of distinct units of existence and logical atomism adds to

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,480
the view that this view has arrived at through logical means rather than through empirical

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,520
investigation through logical means we can break down facts into their basic constituents and

46
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,800
really this is one of the peculiar traits of Wittgenstein's approach. In the Tractatus he

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,480
simply insists that if thought and language are to represent the world then thought language in the

48
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,280
world must be structured in the same way this would only be possible according to Wittgenstein

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,920
if there were basic units of existence the states of affairs that could be picked out by the basic

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,480
elements of our language the primitive propositions the picture theory. So Wittgenstein puts forward

51
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,520
what he calls the picture theory of meaning the idea very roughly speaking is that the function of

52
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,840
language is to form pictures or models of reality that's how language gets its meaning.

53
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
So Wittgenstein develops an account of how language works of how it gets its meaning

54
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,720
based on an analogy with the way he thinks about pictures. So although pictures can have many

55
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,440
purposes it really helps to focus in on a very basic type of picture or diagram like you know if

56
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm trying to show you the way to drive to my house I might sketch you a quick diagram

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,640
and to do that I don't have to include every detail along the way like you know what the view

58
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,120
is going to look like or anything like that I might just draw a very basic diagram showing you

59
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,920
like here's where you live here's the road in between here's where I live and like there's the

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,000
traffic lights you're going to turn left at the lights and I might draw this by putting little

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,200
arrows on the road or whatever. So a diagram like this presents a situation to us according to Wittgenstein

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,480
it tells us that certain things are the case and certain other things are not the case so

63
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,720
suppose my diagram indicates that to get to my house you've got to take the second right after

64
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,200
the lights the diagram is presenting a situation in which my house is on that very road it tells us

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,640
that it's not the case that my house is the second left after the lights so this is basically what

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,120
Wittgenstein means when he says a picture is a model of reality so in constructing a picture

67
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,600
like this we're not constrained by what is actually the case okay by the facts by the actual facts

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
although my house is on the second road on the right let's say I'm perfectly able to draw a

69
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,040
diagram in which the house is on the second left after the lights so the situation that a picture

70
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,840
presents thus exists in logical space according to Wittgenstein it's existing in the space of

71
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,400
all possibilities not necessarily just corresponding to the actual situation of how things really are

72
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,200
a picture represents a possible situation when the structure of the picture mirrors the structure

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,640
of that situation okay so in our example that would mean that when I draw parallel lines quite

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,880
close together in the diagram they're representing the road and when I draw a little symbol with a

75
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,000
little kind of hat on it that's going to represent the house and a little rectangle that I draw with

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,440
some circles in it that's going to represent the traffic lights and you know if I put some arrows

77
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,000
on it they're not really representing any feature of reality other than that's the way you should go

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,240
to get to my house so here we have various symbols corresponding to objects in reality

79
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,960
and moreover the way in which the symbols are related in the picture mirrors the way in which

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,280
the corresponding objects are related in the given situation real or merely possible so in

81
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,160
this way Wittgenstein says the meaning and the truth or the falsity are two different aspects

82
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,360
of the picture so the meaning or as Wittgenstein sometimes calls it the sense of the picture

83
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,160
is the situation that it represents whereas on the other hand the agreement or disagreement of

84
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,000
its sense with reality constitutes its truth or falsity so we can usually tell what a picture

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,840
means just by looking at it if we're familiar with the notation that's being used but in order to tell

86
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,520
whether a picture is true or false we must compare it with reality we must actually look and see what

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,120
the picture represents and whether that's actually the case or not so according to Wittgenstein

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,400
language works in pretty much exactly the same way so we're setting up this analogy between

89
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,520
language the way language works and the way pictures represent reality so according to Wittgenstein

90
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,960
in the tractatus language gets its meaning pretty much wholly by representing possible states of

91
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,440
affairs in logical space meaning and nonsense so according to the picture theory it's the job

92
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,520
of meaningful language to picture actual possible states of affairs so for Wittgenstein logic sets

93
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,680
the limits to meaning the tautologies and contradictions of logic are not themselves meaningful

94
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,800
they are limiting cases without sense Wittgenstein treats mathematics the same way but other cases

95
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,960
have an even deeper grade of meaninglessness being utterly nonsensical to understand them

96
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Wittgenstein says we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere

97
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,840
outside logic that is to say outside the world and Wittgenstein thinks that a consequence of this

98
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,200
is that language which doesn't picture any concrete state of affairs is going to be meaningless

99
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,320
so one of the main aims of the tractatus it becomes apparent is to show what is meaningful

100
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,160
and what is not so in the preface to the tractatus Wittgenstein writes this book will draw a limit to

101
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,080
thinking or rather not to thinking but to the expression of thoughts the limit can only be

102
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,160
drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense so here

103
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,240
Wittgenstein includes any talk about value including ethics religion and philosophy itself

104
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,520
language can't meaningfully address these issues Wittgenstein thinks that value somehow

105
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,160
lies outside the world and famously he says the limits of language mean the limits of my world

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,280
and in particular as Wittgenstein was very well aware the tractatus itself is meaningless the very

107
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,920
theory that Wittgenstein seems to be putting forward here about how language gets meaning

108
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,120
is itself meaningless by its own likes Wittgenstein is very aware of this but that doesn't mean that

109
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,600
he thinks that philosophy itself is pointless according to Wittgenstein the tractatus is

110
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,280
a lucidatory activity by this he means that anyone who comes to understand the tractatus

111
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,720
thereby understands that it's senseless but since understanding has been achieved one no longer

112
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,640
needs the propositions of the tractatus he must so to speak throw away the ladder after he has

113
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,560
climbed up on it so in this way it doesn't matter that the tractatus is meaningless its value is in

114
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,560
the activity of reading through it thinking through it and coming to understand it not in its content

115
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,960
so a key idea here for Wittgenstein is the distinction that he draws between saying and

116
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,640
showing so according to Wittgenstein often we can't say such and such but we can show it so

117
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,360
according to Wittgenstein there are important things that we can't meaningfully say in language

118
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,880
but nevertheless we can show them Wittgenstein says what finds its reflection in language language

119
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,160
cannot represent what expresses itself in language we cannot express by means of language

120
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,240
propositions show the logical form of reality they display it by showing that a number of

121
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,800
propositions that we might otherwise take to be meaningful are actually nonsense Wittgenstein hoped

122
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,120
that philosophy could lead to the clarification of our thoughts so what Wittgenstein's trying to do

123
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,000
here really is to show that there are a number of propositions that we might otherwise take to be

124
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,400
meaningful but to be philosophically problematic and what he's really trying to show us here

125
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,560
is that really these propositions are just meaningless right and then if they're meaningless

126
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,800
well they can't really be problems because if they were problems we would be able to

127
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,000
meaningfully express those problems in language but we can't so they're not the purpose of philosophy

128
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,320
this according to Wittgenstein is the object of philosophy okay so Wittgenstein's conception of

129
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,080
philosophy really differs from many traditional views of what philosophy is which go right back to

130
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,120
ancient times so on many conceptions of philosophy what we're trying to do is we're trying to use

131
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,160
rational thought to clarify problems and to solve problems to come to an understanding of the way

132
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,840
reality is perhaps in its most fundamental aspects by using our rational thought to solve those problems

133
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,680
but that's not how it is on Wittgenstein's conception of what philosophy is rather for

134
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,040
Wittgenstein philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity a philosophical work consists

135
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,720
essentially of elucidations philosophy does not result in philosophical propositions but rather in

136
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,280
the clarification of propositions so Wittgenstein then concludes with his seventh thesis to which

137
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:01,280
he offers no further explanation where of one cannot speak thereof one must be silent the

138
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:08,080
empiricist interpretation okay so let's break off for a moment from what Wittgenstein says

139
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,720
in The Tract Artist to one way in which it can be interpreted and whether that interpretation is

140
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,600
right or wrong so there's an influential interpretation of The Tract Artist that tries

141
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,760
to place it along empiricist lines so empiricism in philosophy it's a viewpoint in epistemology

142
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,040
in the theory of knowledge that says ultimately all our knowledge and understanding of the world

143
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,400
comes from our experience we don't have any a priori knowledge that we get you know independently

144
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,040
of our experience to understand the world to gain knowledge we have to go out there

145
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,480
and really experience the world from scratch without any experience our mind is just a blank

146
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,960
slate to be filled up and then systematized with experience so one person who attempts this

147
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,800
empiricist interpretation of The Tract Artist was Carl Popper who was an influential philosopher

148
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,640
of science okay so he attempts to interpret The Tract Artist as an empiricist doctrine

149
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Popper sums up The Tract Artist as follows all genuine or meaningful propositions were

150
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,240
true functions of the elementary or atomic propositions which described atomic facts

151
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,240
which could be in principle established or rejected by observation okay so that's a pretty

152
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,760
accurate summary of The Tract Artist up to the point where we get to which could in principle

153
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,160
be established or rejected by observation so this last bit is added by Popper and it's not

154
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,000
in The Tract Artist the phrase observation statement which is a key idea in empiricism

155
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,960
doesn't occur anywhere in The Tract Artist. Wittgenstein just isn't really concerned with

156
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,720
epistemology he's not concerned really with the theory of knowledge he hardly talks about it at all

157
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,920
it seems to me that Wittgenstein made a purposeful decision to exclude any discussion of any epistemic

158
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,480
any matters relating to the theory of knowledge from The Tract Artist okay and because of that

159
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,160
we can't really attribute this epistemic interpretation of The Tract Artist to Wittgenstein

160
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,480
I just don't think it's an accurate understanding of what Wittgenstein was trying to do at all

161
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,640
nevertheless the empiricist interpretation of the picture theory of meaning was itself

162
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,440
influential as an understanding of The Tract Artist so the the empiricist interpretation it

163
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,440
was picked up by the logical positivist philosophers of the Vienna Circle so that's including philosophers

164
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,520
like Maurice Schlick, Frederick Weissmann and Rudolf Carnap so these philosophers they assumed

165
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,680
that Wittgenstein was supporting the verification principle the principle that only those propositions

166
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,360
that are empirically verifiable are meaningful so according to verificationists according to

167
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,880
the verificationist principle there's a large class of propositions including ones about

168
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:03,920
ethics and theology and philosophy that aren't verifiable and hence aren't meaningful now Wittgenstein

169
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,800
does agree with this he does agree that there's a large class of propositions you know including

170
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,600
ethics and theology and lots of philosophy and that stuff just isn't meaningful but Wittgenstein gets

171
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,000
to this conclusion for rather different reasons than the verificationists he's not really an

172
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,360
adherent of the verificationist principle he's got quite a different theory of meaning he doesn't

173
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,120
say that there's something to be meaningful it has to be verifiable rather he's saying I've got

174
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
this picture theory of meaning that sets out the limits of meaning and whatever lies on the other

175
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,760
side of those limits is meaningless so Wittgenstein is not really a verificationist the Tract Artist

176
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,240
is one of the masterpieces of analytic philosophy in terms of its influence on later philosophy

177
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,200
the picture is kind of difficult to assess not least because it wasn't that long from the

178
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,040
publication of the Tract Artist to the publication of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations

179
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,560
where he basically takes back a lot of the viewpoints that he expresses in the Tract Artist

180
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,320
so he was basically disavowing his own philosophy and I think it's fair to say that Wittgenstein's

181
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,200
philosophical investigations and the picture of philosophy that he presents in the philosophical

182
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,520
investigations really set the tone for analytic philosophy philosophy of language in the second

183
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,720
half of the 20th century so in some sense the philosophical investigations overshadowed the

184
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,080
influence of the Tract Artist nevertheless there are lots of individual bits of the Tract Artist

185
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,520
that went on to influence important bits of analytic philosophy on the metaphysics side

186
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,200
there is the metaphysics of states of affairs which influence people like David Armstrong

187
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,160
there's the account of meaning which went on to influence lots of philosophers and linguists

188
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,920
perhaps not the picture theory of meaning itself but Wittgenstein's broader idea that we understand

189
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,320
the meaning of a sentence in terms of its possible truth values its truth conditions that's a really

190
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,720
really influential idea in analytic philosophy of language and linguistics the way we relate the

191
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,240
meaning or content of a sentence to the possible situations or the possible worlds at which that

192
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,240
sentence is true that's a really influential idea in modal logic and the kind of areas of philosophy

193
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,320
that tie in nicely with modal logic so analytic philosophy of language Wittgenstein's conception

194
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,640
of philosophy is something that is ultimately meaningless but that somehow it's okay to say

195
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,880
that it's meaningless or rather to show that it's meaningless I think has had a much more

196
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,960
mixed reaction Frank Ramsey in his critical notice of the Tract Artist I think expresses this idea

197
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,760
this criticism the best when he says what we can't say we can't say or we can't whistle it either

198
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,760
so Wittgenstein was known at the time for being a very proficient whistler he could

199
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,680
whistle his way accurately through an entire symphony and what Ramsey is really saying here is

200
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,280
you know you can't have your cake and eat it you can't say that this stuff this philosophy is somehow

201
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,080
important but also say that it's meaningless right if it's going to be important it has to mean

202
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,080
something and you know I guess he's saying philosophy is important and thus it is meaningful

203
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,320
so Wittgenstein's theory that says philosophy isn't meaningful well there's something wrong

204
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,520
with that but you know I think this point brings out something very very interesting about Wittgenstein's

205
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,880
character and I guess in his self-belief as a person and as a philosopher so if you or me I guess

206
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,400
came up with a theory and then we realized that this theory had this really crazy consequence

207
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,480
we might say to ourselves hmm yeah that's probably a problem for my theory I better go

208
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
back to the drawing board and revise the theory Wittgenstein realized that his picture theory has

209
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,440
this crazy consequence that all the stuff he was saying is actually meaningless but he really believed

210
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,680
in what he was saying and he trusted his own ability as a philosopher to such a degree that he

211
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,680
could say well my theory tells us that everything we're saying is meaningless and thus it is so

212
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,080
all of this stuff is ultimately meaningless and he extracted from that a whole way of looking at

213
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,720
philosophy so ultimately I don't think that tells us that much about philosophy itself but it does

214
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,320
tell us something very interesting about Wittgenstein as a thinker so there is so much more to say

215
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,280
about Wittgenstein about his thought and about his philosophy if you want to see some more videos

216
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,320
about that go and have a look at this one over here thank you so much to all my kofi supporters
