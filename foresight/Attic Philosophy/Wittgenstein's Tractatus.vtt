00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Wittgenstein's Tractatus is one of the most baffling and mysterious and mystical and brilliant

00:06.720 --> 00:13.920
and difficult works of philosophy ever written. It baffles pretty much everyone who's ever picked

00:13.920 --> 00:21.280
it up. But the main ideas, the main lines of thought are actually relatively simple to explain.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.960
So that's what I'm going to try and do in this video today and we're going to get going with

00:25.360 --> 00:32.320
that right now. Ludwig Wittgenstein produced two great works of philosophy, the Tractatus

00:32.320 --> 00:39.440
Logico Philosophicus, published in 1921-22 and the Philosophical Investigations,

00:39.440 --> 00:46.480
published posthumously in 1953. The Tractatus is a very, very unusual work of philosophy.

00:46.480 --> 00:52.800
It's a remarkably short work for a great work of philosophy and that's in part due to Wittgenstein's

00:52.800 --> 00:57.680
condensed writing style which has put off many readers and confused a good number of philosophers.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.680
So Wittgenstein wanted to express himself in as concise and as logical a way as possible. He was

01:03.680 --> 01:09.040
influenced in that by the work of the great logicians, particularly Frager. Whether he was

01:09.040 --> 01:14.720
successful in this, well you've got to read it and judge for yourself. The Tractatus is also unusual

01:14.720 --> 01:21.200
in its layout so its paragraphs use a system of decimal notation which aims to make explicit

01:21.200 --> 01:26.720
whether a new paragraph expands on the previous one or whether it's making a brand new point.

01:26.720 --> 01:32.080
The Tractatus contains a range of different philosophical topics but we can divide it up

01:32.080 --> 01:38.800
into four main areas. There's the metaphysics of objects, Wittgenstein's idea that the world

01:38.800 --> 01:45.040
is made up of facts, not of things. Then there's his picture theory of language and related to that

01:45.040 --> 01:50.400
there's his philosophical account of meaning and meaninglessness and then there's his reflections

01:50.480 --> 01:55.600
on the purpose of philosophy. Before we go any further I'd just like to jump in here and say

01:55.600 --> 01:59.760
I hope you're enjoying this content. If you'd like to help me out to make more educational

01:59.760 --> 02:04.800
academic content like this go and take a look at my Ko-fi page and see how you can help me out.

02:04.800 --> 02:11.840
So let's start where the Tractatus starts with the metaphysics, the logical structure of reality.

02:11.840 --> 02:17.920
The Tractatus begins with these words. The world is all that is the case. The world is the totality

02:18.320 --> 02:24.880
of facts, not of things. The world is determined by facts and by there being all the facts.

02:24.880 --> 02:31.040
For the totality of facts determines what is the case and also whatever is not the case.

02:31.040 --> 02:36.480
You see what I mean about this being really complicated to read? What on earth does Wittgenstein

02:36.480 --> 02:43.920
mean by that? Well really what he's talking about here is the way the world is okay? By fact Wittgenstein

02:43.920 --> 02:48.720
doesn't mean something in language a true sentence like we would often say that's a fact. He means

02:48.720 --> 02:54.720
something like a state of affairs, something in the world. The world being a certain way

02:54.720 --> 03:00.800
like I am sitting down right now that is one fact. It's sunny outside in Nottingham right now that

03:00.800 --> 03:07.840
is another fact. These are all different facts and together Wittgenstein says these facts make up

03:07.840 --> 03:15.440
the world what we mean by reality and the contrast here that he brings out is it's not just things

03:15.440 --> 03:22.480
or objects that make up reality you know me, you, the camera and stuff like that because if we just

03:22.480 --> 03:27.680
had things we would just have a collection of stuff right? What's important when we think about

03:27.680 --> 03:34.240
reality is not just the things but the way those things are the properties they have like me sitting

03:34.240 --> 03:39.520
down like the camera being on and the relationships between them. I'm talking into the camera,

03:39.520 --> 03:46.400
you're watching me talk into the camera and so on. All of these facts together make up the

03:46.400 --> 03:51.840
totality of reality. So this way of thinking of the world breaking it down into its constituent

03:51.840 --> 03:58.320
facts is basically related to the logical atomism that Wittgenstein developed alongside his teacher

03:58.320 --> 04:04.160
Bertrand Russell. Russell taught Wittgenstein when Wittgenstein was an undergraduate at Cambridge

04:04.160 --> 04:10.720
in the early decade of the 20th century 1912 he started there and they became friends and they

04:10.720 --> 04:17.920
worked closely together on philosophy developing this idea of logical atomism. So atomism in general

04:17.920 --> 04:24.480
is the view that the world is made up of distinct units of existence and logical atomism adds to

04:24.480 --> 04:30.480
the view that this view has arrived at through logical means rather than through empirical

04:30.480 --> 04:37.520
investigation through logical means we can break down facts into their basic constituents and

04:37.520 --> 04:42.800
really this is one of the peculiar traits of Wittgenstein's approach. In the Tractatus he

04:42.800 --> 04:48.480
simply insists that if thought and language are to represent the world then thought language in the

04:48.480 --> 04:55.280
world must be structured in the same way this would only be possible according to Wittgenstein

04:55.280 --> 05:01.920
if there were basic units of existence the states of affairs that could be picked out by the basic

05:01.920 --> 05:08.480
elements of our language the primitive propositions the picture theory. So Wittgenstein puts forward

05:08.480 --> 05:13.520
what he calls the picture theory of meaning the idea very roughly speaking is that the function of

05:13.520 --> 05:19.840
language is to form pictures or models of reality that's how language gets its meaning.

05:19.840 --> 05:25.120
So Wittgenstein develops an account of how language works of how it gets its meaning

05:25.120 --> 05:30.720
based on an analogy with the way he thinks about pictures. So although pictures can have many

05:30.720 --> 05:37.440
purposes it really helps to focus in on a very basic type of picture or diagram like you know if

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
I'm trying to show you the way to drive to my house I might sketch you a quick diagram

05:41.440 --> 05:46.640
and to do that I don't have to include every detail along the way like you know what the view

05:46.640 --> 05:51.120
is going to look like or anything like that I might just draw a very basic diagram showing you

05:51.120 --> 05:55.920
like here's where you live here's the road in between here's where I live and like there's the

05:55.920 --> 06:00.000
traffic lights you're going to turn left at the lights and I might draw this by putting little

06:00.000 --> 06:07.200
arrows on the road or whatever. So a diagram like this presents a situation to us according to Wittgenstein

06:07.200 --> 06:12.480
it tells us that certain things are the case and certain other things are not the case so

06:12.480 --> 06:16.720
suppose my diagram indicates that to get to my house you've got to take the second right after

06:16.720 --> 06:23.200
the lights the diagram is presenting a situation in which my house is on that very road it tells us

06:23.200 --> 06:28.640
that it's not the case that my house is the second left after the lights so this is basically what

06:28.640 --> 06:35.120
Wittgenstein means when he says a picture is a model of reality so in constructing a picture

06:35.120 --> 06:41.600
like this we're not constrained by what is actually the case okay by the facts by the actual facts

06:41.600 --> 06:46.560
although my house is on the second road on the right let's say I'm perfectly able to draw a

06:46.560 --> 06:53.040
diagram in which the house is on the second left after the lights so the situation that a picture

06:53.040 --> 06:59.840
presents thus exists in logical space according to Wittgenstein it's existing in the space of

06:59.840 --> 07:06.400
all possibilities not necessarily just corresponding to the actual situation of how things really are

07:06.400 --> 07:13.200
a picture represents a possible situation when the structure of the picture mirrors the structure

07:13.200 --> 07:18.640
of that situation okay so in our example that would mean that when I draw parallel lines quite

07:18.640 --> 07:22.880
close together in the diagram they're representing the road and when I draw a little symbol with a

07:22.880 --> 07:28.000
little kind of hat on it that's going to represent the house and a little rectangle that I draw with

07:28.000 --> 07:33.440
some circles in it that's going to represent the traffic lights and you know if I put some arrows

07:33.440 --> 07:40.000
on it they're not really representing any feature of reality other than that's the way you should go

07:40.000 --> 07:46.240
to get to my house so here we have various symbols corresponding to objects in reality

07:46.240 --> 07:52.960
and moreover the way in which the symbols are related in the picture mirrors the way in which

07:53.040 --> 07:59.280
the corresponding objects are related in the given situation real or merely possible so in

07:59.280 --> 08:06.160
this way Wittgenstein says the meaning and the truth or the falsity are two different aspects

08:06.160 --> 08:11.360
of the picture so the meaning or as Wittgenstein sometimes calls it the sense of the picture

08:12.080 --> 08:18.160
is the situation that it represents whereas on the other hand the agreement or disagreement of

08:18.160 --> 08:24.000
its sense with reality constitutes its truth or falsity so we can usually tell what a picture

08:24.000 --> 08:29.840
means just by looking at it if we're familiar with the notation that's being used but in order to tell

08:29.840 --> 08:35.520
whether a picture is true or false we must compare it with reality we must actually look and see what

08:35.520 --> 08:41.120
the picture represents and whether that's actually the case or not so according to Wittgenstein

08:41.120 --> 08:46.400
language works in pretty much exactly the same way so we're setting up this analogy between

08:46.400 --> 08:53.520
language the way language works and the way pictures represent reality so according to Wittgenstein

08:53.520 --> 09:00.960
in the tractatus language gets its meaning pretty much wholly by representing possible states of

09:00.960 --> 09:07.440
affairs in logical space meaning and nonsense so according to the picture theory it's the job

09:07.440 --> 09:13.520
of meaningful language to picture actual possible states of affairs so for Wittgenstein logic sets

09:13.520 --> 09:19.680
the limits to meaning the tautologies and contradictions of logic are not themselves meaningful

09:19.680 --> 09:26.800
they are limiting cases without sense Wittgenstein treats mathematics the same way but other cases

09:26.800 --> 09:32.960
have an even deeper grade of meaninglessness being utterly nonsensical to understand them

09:32.960 --> 09:39.280
Wittgenstein says we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere

09:39.280 --> 09:45.840
outside logic that is to say outside the world and Wittgenstein thinks that a consequence of this

09:45.840 --> 09:51.200
is that language which doesn't picture any concrete state of affairs is going to be meaningless

09:51.200 --> 09:56.320
so one of the main aims of the tractatus it becomes apparent is to show what is meaningful

09:56.320 --> 10:02.160
and what is not so in the preface to the tractatus Wittgenstein writes this book will draw a limit to

10:02.160 --> 10:08.080
thinking or rather not to thinking but to the expression of thoughts the limit can only be

10:08.080 --> 10:14.160
drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense so here

10:14.160 --> 10:20.240
Wittgenstein includes any talk about value including ethics religion and philosophy itself

10:20.240 --> 10:25.520
language can't meaningfully address these issues Wittgenstein thinks that value somehow

10:25.520 --> 10:32.160
lies outside the world and famously he says the limits of language mean the limits of my world

10:32.160 --> 10:39.280
and in particular as Wittgenstein was very well aware the tractatus itself is meaningless the very

10:39.280 --> 10:43.920
theory that Wittgenstein seems to be putting forward here about how language gets meaning

10:43.920 --> 10:51.120
is itself meaningless by its own likes Wittgenstein is very aware of this but that doesn't mean that

10:51.120 --> 10:57.600
he thinks that philosophy itself is pointless according to Wittgenstein the tractatus is

10:57.680 --> 11:03.280
a lucidatory activity by this he means that anyone who comes to understand the tractatus

11:03.280 --> 11:08.720
thereby understands that it's senseless but since understanding has been achieved one no longer

11:08.720 --> 11:14.640
needs the propositions of the tractatus he must so to speak throw away the ladder after he has

11:14.640 --> 11:20.560
climbed up on it so in this way it doesn't matter that the tractatus is meaningless its value is in

11:20.560 --> 11:26.560
the activity of reading through it thinking through it and coming to understand it not in its content

11:26.560 --> 11:32.960
so a key idea here for Wittgenstein is the distinction that he draws between saying and

11:32.960 --> 11:40.640
showing so according to Wittgenstein often we can't say such and such but we can show it so

11:40.640 --> 11:47.360
according to Wittgenstein there are important things that we can't meaningfully say in language

11:47.360 --> 11:54.880
but nevertheless we can show them Wittgenstein says what finds its reflection in language language

11:54.880 --> 12:02.160
cannot represent what expresses itself in language we cannot express by means of language

12:02.160 --> 12:08.240
propositions show the logical form of reality they display it by showing that a number of

12:08.240 --> 12:14.800
propositions that we might otherwise take to be meaningful are actually nonsense Wittgenstein hoped

12:14.800 --> 12:21.120
that philosophy could lead to the clarification of our thoughts so what Wittgenstein's trying to do

12:21.120 --> 12:28.000
here really is to show that there are a number of propositions that we might otherwise take to be

12:28.000 --> 12:34.400
meaningful but to be philosophically problematic and what he's really trying to show us here

12:34.400 --> 12:40.560
is that really these propositions are just meaningless right and then if they're meaningless

12:40.560 --> 12:46.800
well they can't really be problems because if they were problems we would be able to

12:46.800 --> 12:54.000
meaningfully express those problems in language but we can't so they're not the purpose of philosophy

12:54.000 --> 13:00.320
this according to Wittgenstein is the object of philosophy okay so Wittgenstein's conception of

13:00.320 --> 13:06.080
philosophy really differs from many traditional views of what philosophy is which go right back to

13:06.080 --> 13:11.120
ancient times so on many conceptions of philosophy what we're trying to do is we're trying to use

13:11.120 --> 13:18.160
rational thought to clarify problems and to solve problems to come to an understanding of the way

13:18.160 --> 13:25.840
reality is perhaps in its most fundamental aspects by using our rational thought to solve those problems

13:25.840 --> 13:31.680
but that's not how it is on Wittgenstein's conception of what philosophy is rather for

13:31.680 --> 13:39.040
Wittgenstein philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity a philosophical work consists

13:39.040 --> 13:46.720
essentially of elucidations philosophy does not result in philosophical propositions but rather in

13:46.720 --> 13:53.280
the clarification of propositions so Wittgenstein then concludes with his seventh thesis to which

13:53.280 --> 14:01.280
he offers no further explanation where of one cannot speak thereof one must be silent the

14:01.280 --> 14:08.080
empiricist interpretation okay so let's break off for a moment from what Wittgenstein says

14:08.080 --> 14:14.720
in The Tract Artist to one way in which it can be interpreted and whether that interpretation is

14:15.280 --> 14:19.600
right or wrong so there's an influential interpretation of The Tract Artist that tries

14:19.600 --> 14:25.760
to place it along empiricist lines so empiricism in philosophy it's a viewpoint in epistemology

14:25.760 --> 14:31.040
in the theory of knowledge that says ultimately all our knowledge and understanding of the world

14:31.040 --> 14:36.400
comes from our experience we don't have any a priori knowledge that we get you know independently

14:36.480 --> 14:41.040
of our experience to understand the world to gain knowledge we have to go out there

14:41.040 --> 14:46.480
and really experience the world from scratch without any experience our mind is just a blank

14:46.480 --> 14:52.960
slate to be filled up and then systematized with experience so one person who attempts this

14:52.960 --> 14:58.800
empiricist interpretation of The Tract Artist was Carl Popper who was an influential philosopher

14:58.800 --> 15:04.640
of science okay so he attempts to interpret The Tract Artist as an empiricist doctrine

15:04.640 --> 15:10.480
Popper sums up The Tract Artist as follows all genuine or meaningful propositions were

15:10.480 --> 15:16.240
true functions of the elementary or atomic propositions which described atomic facts

15:16.240 --> 15:22.240
which could be in principle established or rejected by observation okay so that's a pretty

15:22.240 --> 15:27.760
accurate summary of The Tract Artist up to the point where we get to which could in principle

15:27.760 --> 15:34.160
be established or rejected by observation so this last bit is added by Popper and it's not

15:34.160 --> 15:40.000
in The Tract Artist the phrase observation statement which is a key idea in empiricism

15:40.000 --> 15:44.960
doesn't occur anywhere in The Tract Artist. Wittgenstein just isn't really concerned with

15:44.960 --> 15:50.720
epistemology he's not concerned really with the theory of knowledge he hardly talks about it at all

15:50.720 --> 15:57.920
it seems to me that Wittgenstein made a purposeful decision to exclude any discussion of any epistemic

15:57.920 --> 16:04.480
any matters relating to the theory of knowledge from The Tract Artist okay and because of that

16:04.480 --> 16:10.160
we can't really attribute this epistemic interpretation of The Tract Artist to Wittgenstein

16:10.160 --> 16:16.480
I just don't think it's an accurate understanding of what Wittgenstein was trying to do at all

16:16.480 --> 16:22.640
nevertheless the empiricist interpretation of the picture theory of meaning was itself

16:22.640 --> 16:27.440
influential as an understanding of The Tract Artist so the the empiricist interpretation it

16:27.440 --> 16:33.440
was picked up by the logical positivist philosophers of the Vienna Circle so that's including philosophers

16:33.440 --> 16:39.520
like Maurice Schlick, Frederick Weissmann and Rudolf Carnap so these philosophers they assumed

16:39.520 --> 16:45.680
that Wittgenstein was supporting the verification principle the principle that only those propositions

16:45.680 --> 16:51.360
that are empirically verifiable are meaningful so according to verificationists according to

16:51.360 --> 16:56.880
the verificationist principle there's a large class of propositions including ones about

16:56.960 --> 17:03.920
ethics and theology and philosophy that aren't verifiable and hence aren't meaningful now Wittgenstein

17:03.920 --> 17:08.800
does agree with this he does agree that there's a large class of propositions you know including

17:08.800 --> 17:15.600
ethics and theology and lots of philosophy and that stuff just isn't meaningful but Wittgenstein gets

17:15.600 --> 17:22.000
to this conclusion for rather different reasons than the verificationists he's not really an

17:22.000 --> 17:27.360
adherent of the verificationist principle he's got quite a different theory of meaning he doesn't

17:27.360 --> 17:33.120
say that there's something to be meaningful it has to be verifiable rather he's saying I've got

17:33.120 --> 17:38.080
this picture theory of meaning that sets out the limits of meaning and whatever lies on the other

17:38.080 --> 17:45.760
side of those limits is meaningless so Wittgenstein is not really a verificationist the Tract Artist

17:45.760 --> 17:52.240
is one of the masterpieces of analytic philosophy in terms of its influence on later philosophy

17:52.240 --> 17:59.200
the picture is kind of difficult to assess not least because it wasn't that long from the

17:59.200 --> 18:05.040
publication of the Tract Artist to the publication of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations

18:05.040 --> 18:10.560
where he basically takes back a lot of the viewpoints that he expresses in the Tract Artist

18:10.560 --> 18:16.320
so he was basically disavowing his own philosophy and I think it's fair to say that Wittgenstein's

18:16.320 --> 18:21.200
philosophical investigations and the picture of philosophy that he presents in the philosophical

18:21.200 --> 18:27.520
investigations really set the tone for analytic philosophy philosophy of language in the second

18:27.520 --> 18:34.720
half of the 20th century so in some sense the philosophical investigations overshadowed the

18:34.720 --> 18:40.080
influence of the Tract Artist nevertheless there are lots of individual bits of the Tract Artist

18:40.080 --> 18:45.520
that went on to influence important bits of analytic philosophy on the metaphysics side

18:45.520 --> 18:51.200
there is the metaphysics of states of affairs which influence people like David Armstrong

18:51.200 --> 18:56.160
there's the account of meaning which went on to influence lots of philosophers and linguists

18:56.160 --> 19:01.920
perhaps not the picture theory of meaning itself but Wittgenstein's broader idea that we understand

19:01.920 --> 19:08.320
the meaning of a sentence in terms of its possible truth values its truth conditions that's a really

19:08.320 --> 19:14.720
really influential idea in analytic philosophy of language and linguistics the way we relate the

19:14.720 --> 19:20.240
meaning or content of a sentence to the possible situations or the possible worlds at which that

19:20.240 --> 19:26.240
sentence is true that's a really influential idea in modal logic and the kind of areas of philosophy

19:26.240 --> 19:32.320
that tie in nicely with modal logic so analytic philosophy of language Wittgenstein's conception

19:32.320 --> 19:38.640
of philosophy is something that is ultimately meaningless but that somehow it's okay to say

19:38.640 --> 19:42.880
that it's meaningless or rather to show that it's meaningless I think has had a much more

19:42.880 --> 19:48.960
mixed reaction Frank Ramsey in his critical notice of the Tract Artist I think expresses this idea

19:48.960 --> 19:55.760
this criticism the best when he says what we can't say we can't say or we can't whistle it either

19:56.320 --> 20:01.760
so Wittgenstein was known at the time for being a very proficient whistler he could

20:01.760 --> 20:07.680
whistle his way accurately through an entire symphony and what Ramsey is really saying here is

20:07.680 --> 20:13.280
you know you can't have your cake and eat it you can't say that this stuff this philosophy is somehow

20:13.280 --> 20:20.080
important but also say that it's meaningless right if it's going to be important it has to mean

20:20.160 --> 20:26.080
something and you know I guess he's saying philosophy is important and thus it is meaningful

20:26.800 --> 20:32.320
so Wittgenstein's theory that says philosophy isn't meaningful well there's something wrong

20:32.320 --> 20:37.520
with that but you know I think this point brings out something very very interesting about Wittgenstein's

20:37.520 --> 20:44.880
character and I guess in his self-belief as a person and as a philosopher so if you or me I guess

20:44.880 --> 20:50.400
came up with a theory and then we realized that this theory had this really crazy consequence

20:51.120 --> 20:56.480
we might say to ourselves hmm yeah that's probably a problem for my theory I better go

20:56.480 --> 21:01.280
back to the drawing board and revise the theory Wittgenstein realized that his picture theory has

21:01.280 --> 21:07.440
this crazy consequence that all the stuff he was saying is actually meaningless but he really believed

21:07.440 --> 21:13.680
in what he was saying and he trusted his own ability as a philosopher to such a degree that he

21:13.680 --> 21:19.680
could say well my theory tells us that everything we're saying is meaningless and thus it is so

21:19.680 --> 21:26.080
all of this stuff is ultimately meaningless and he extracted from that a whole way of looking at

21:26.080 --> 21:32.720
philosophy so ultimately I don't think that tells us that much about philosophy itself but it does

21:32.720 --> 21:38.320
tell us something very interesting about Wittgenstein as a thinker so there is so much more to say

21:38.320 --> 21:43.280
about Wittgenstein about his thought and about his philosophy if you want to see some more videos

21:43.280 --> 21:48.320
about that go and have a look at this one over here thank you so much to all my kofi supporters
