0	6720	Wittgenstein's Tractatus is one of the most baffling and mysterious and mystical and brilliant
6720	13920	and difficult works of philosophy ever written. It baffles pretty much everyone who's ever picked
13920	21280	it up. But the main ideas, the main lines of thought are actually relatively simple to explain.
21280	24960	So that's what I'm going to try and do in this video today and we're going to get going with
25360	32320	that right now. Ludwig Wittgenstein produced two great works of philosophy, the Tractatus
32320	39440	Logico Philosophicus, published in 1921-22 and the Philosophical Investigations,
39440	46480	published posthumously in 1953. The Tractatus is a very, very unusual work of philosophy.
46480	52800	It's a remarkably short work for a great work of philosophy and that's in part due to Wittgenstein's
52800	57680	condensed writing style which has put off many readers and confused a good number of philosophers.
57680	63680	So Wittgenstein wanted to express himself in as concise and as logical a way as possible. He was
63680	69040	influenced in that by the work of the great logicians, particularly Frager. Whether he was
69040	74720	successful in this, well you've got to read it and judge for yourself. The Tractatus is also unusual
74720	81200	in its layout so its paragraphs use a system of decimal notation which aims to make explicit
81200	86720	whether a new paragraph expands on the previous one or whether it's making a brand new point.
86720	92080	The Tractatus contains a range of different philosophical topics but we can divide it up
92080	98800	into four main areas. There's the metaphysics of objects, Wittgenstein's idea that the world
98800	105040	is made up of facts, not of things. Then there's his picture theory of language and related to that
105040	110400	there's his philosophical account of meaning and meaninglessness and then there's his reflections
110480	115600	on the purpose of philosophy. Before we go any further I'd just like to jump in here and say
115600	119760	I hope you're enjoying this content. If you'd like to help me out to make more educational
119760	124800	academic content like this go and take a look at my Ko-fi page and see how you can help me out.
124800	131840	So let's start where the Tractatus starts with the metaphysics, the logical structure of reality.
131840	137920	The Tractatus begins with these words. The world is all that is the case. The world is the totality
138320	144880	of facts, not of things. The world is determined by facts and by there being all the facts.
144880	151040	For the totality of facts determines what is the case and also whatever is not the case.
151040	156480	You see what I mean about this being really complicated to read? What on earth does Wittgenstein
156480	163920	mean by that? Well really what he's talking about here is the way the world is okay? By fact Wittgenstein
163920	168720	doesn't mean something in language a true sentence like we would often say that's a fact. He means
168720	174720	something like a state of affairs, something in the world. The world being a certain way
174720	180800	like I am sitting down right now that is one fact. It's sunny outside in Nottingham right now that
180800	187840	is another fact. These are all different facts and together Wittgenstein says these facts make up
187840	195440	the world what we mean by reality and the contrast here that he brings out is it's not just things
195440	202480	or objects that make up reality you know me, you, the camera and stuff like that because if we just
202480	207680	had things we would just have a collection of stuff right? What's important when we think about
207680	214240	reality is not just the things but the way those things are the properties they have like me sitting
214240	219520	down like the camera being on and the relationships between them. I'm talking into the camera,
219520	226400	you're watching me talk into the camera and so on. All of these facts together make up the
226400	231840	totality of reality. So this way of thinking of the world breaking it down into its constituent
231840	238320	facts is basically related to the logical atomism that Wittgenstein developed alongside his teacher
238320	244160	Bertrand Russell. Russell taught Wittgenstein when Wittgenstein was an undergraduate at Cambridge
244160	250720	in the early decade of the 20th century 1912 he started there and they became friends and they
250720	257920	worked closely together on philosophy developing this idea of logical atomism. So atomism in general
257920	264480	is the view that the world is made up of distinct units of existence and logical atomism adds to
264480	270480	the view that this view has arrived at through logical means rather than through empirical
270480	277520	investigation through logical means we can break down facts into their basic constituents and
277520	282800	really this is one of the peculiar traits of Wittgenstein's approach. In the Tractatus he
282800	288480	simply insists that if thought and language are to represent the world then thought language in the
288480	295280	world must be structured in the same way this would only be possible according to Wittgenstein
295280	301920	if there were basic units of existence the states of affairs that could be picked out by the basic
301920	308480	elements of our language the primitive propositions the picture theory. So Wittgenstein puts forward
308480	313520	what he calls the picture theory of meaning the idea very roughly speaking is that the function of
313520	319840	language is to form pictures or models of reality that's how language gets its meaning.
319840	325120	So Wittgenstein develops an account of how language works of how it gets its meaning
325120	330720	based on an analogy with the way he thinks about pictures. So although pictures can have many
330720	337440	purposes it really helps to focus in on a very basic type of picture or diagram like you know if
337440	341440	I'm trying to show you the way to drive to my house I might sketch you a quick diagram
341440	346640	and to do that I don't have to include every detail along the way like you know what the view
346640	351120	is going to look like or anything like that I might just draw a very basic diagram showing you
351120	355920	like here's where you live here's the road in between here's where I live and like there's the
355920	360000	traffic lights you're going to turn left at the lights and I might draw this by putting little
360000	367200	arrows on the road or whatever. So a diagram like this presents a situation to us according to Wittgenstein
367200	372480	it tells us that certain things are the case and certain other things are not the case so
372480	376720	suppose my diagram indicates that to get to my house you've got to take the second right after
376720	383200	the lights the diagram is presenting a situation in which my house is on that very road it tells us
383200	388640	that it's not the case that my house is the second left after the lights so this is basically what
388640	395120	Wittgenstein means when he says a picture is a model of reality so in constructing a picture
395120	401600	like this we're not constrained by what is actually the case okay by the facts by the actual facts
401600	406560	although my house is on the second road on the right let's say I'm perfectly able to draw a
406560	413040	diagram in which the house is on the second left after the lights so the situation that a picture
413040	419840	presents thus exists in logical space according to Wittgenstein it's existing in the space of
419840	426400	all possibilities not necessarily just corresponding to the actual situation of how things really are
426400	433200	a picture represents a possible situation when the structure of the picture mirrors the structure
433200	438640	of that situation okay so in our example that would mean that when I draw parallel lines quite
438640	442880	close together in the diagram they're representing the road and when I draw a little symbol with a
442880	448000	little kind of hat on it that's going to represent the house and a little rectangle that I draw with
448000	453440	some circles in it that's going to represent the traffic lights and you know if I put some arrows
453440	460000	on it they're not really representing any feature of reality other than that's the way you should go
460000	466240	to get to my house so here we have various symbols corresponding to objects in reality
466240	472960	and moreover the way in which the symbols are related in the picture mirrors the way in which
473040	479280	the corresponding objects are related in the given situation real or merely possible so in
479280	486160	this way Wittgenstein says the meaning and the truth or the falsity are two different aspects
486160	491360	of the picture so the meaning or as Wittgenstein sometimes calls it the sense of the picture
492080	498160	is the situation that it represents whereas on the other hand the agreement or disagreement of
498160	504000	its sense with reality constitutes its truth or falsity so we can usually tell what a picture
504000	509840	means just by looking at it if we're familiar with the notation that's being used but in order to tell
509840	515520	whether a picture is true or false we must compare it with reality we must actually look and see what
515520	521120	the picture represents and whether that's actually the case or not so according to Wittgenstein
521120	526400	language works in pretty much exactly the same way so we're setting up this analogy between
526400	533520	language the way language works and the way pictures represent reality so according to Wittgenstein
533520	540960	in the tractatus language gets its meaning pretty much wholly by representing possible states of
540960	547440	affairs in logical space meaning and nonsense so according to the picture theory it's the job
547440	553520	of meaningful language to picture actual possible states of affairs so for Wittgenstein logic sets
553520	559680	the limits to meaning the tautologies and contradictions of logic are not themselves meaningful
559680	566800	they are limiting cases without sense Wittgenstein treats mathematics the same way but other cases
566800	572960	have an even deeper grade of meaninglessness being utterly nonsensical to understand them
572960	579280	Wittgenstein says we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere
579280	585840	outside logic that is to say outside the world and Wittgenstein thinks that a consequence of this
585840	591200	is that language which doesn't picture any concrete state of affairs is going to be meaningless
591200	596320	so one of the main aims of the tractatus it becomes apparent is to show what is meaningful
596320	602160	and what is not so in the preface to the tractatus Wittgenstein writes this book will draw a limit to
602160	608080	thinking or rather not to thinking but to the expression of thoughts the limit can only be
608080	614160	drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense so here
614160	620240	Wittgenstein includes any talk about value including ethics religion and philosophy itself
620240	625520	language can't meaningfully address these issues Wittgenstein thinks that value somehow
625520	632160	lies outside the world and famously he says the limits of language mean the limits of my world
632160	639280	and in particular as Wittgenstein was very well aware the tractatus itself is meaningless the very
639280	643920	theory that Wittgenstein seems to be putting forward here about how language gets meaning
643920	651120	is itself meaningless by its own likes Wittgenstein is very aware of this but that doesn't mean that
651120	657600	he thinks that philosophy itself is pointless according to Wittgenstein the tractatus is
657680	663280	a lucidatory activity by this he means that anyone who comes to understand the tractatus
663280	668720	thereby understands that it's senseless but since understanding has been achieved one no longer
668720	674640	needs the propositions of the tractatus he must so to speak throw away the ladder after he has
674640	680560	climbed up on it so in this way it doesn't matter that the tractatus is meaningless its value is in
680560	686560	the activity of reading through it thinking through it and coming to understand it not in its content
686560	692960	so a key idea here for Wittgenstein is the distinction that he draws between saying and
692960	700640	showing so according to Wittgenstein often we can't say such and such but we can show it so
700640	707360	according to Wittgenstein there are important things that we can't meaningfully say in language
707360	714880	but nevertheless we can show them Wittgenstein says what finds its reflection in language language
714880	722160	cannot represent what expresses itself in language we cannot express by means of language
722160	728240	propositions show the logical form of reality they display it by showing that a number of
728240	734800	propositions that we might otherwise take to be meaningful are actually nonsense Wittgenstein hoped
734800	741120	that philosophy could lead to the clarification of our thoughts so what Wittgenstein's trying to do
741120	748000	here really is to show that there are a number of propositions that we might otherwise take to be
748000	754400	meaningful but to be philosophically problematic and what he's really trying to show us here
754400	760560	is that really these propositions are just meaningless right and then if they're meaningless
760560	766800	well they can't really be problems because if they were problems we would be able to
766800	774000	meaningfully express those problems in language but we can't so they're not the purpose of philosophy
774000	780320	this according to Wittgenstein is the object of philosophy okay so Wittgenstein's conception of
780320	786080	philosophy really differs from many traditional views of what philosophy is which go right back to
786080	791120	ancient times so on many conceptions of philosophy what we're trying to do is we're trying to use
791120	798160	rational thought to clarify problems and to solve problems to come to an understanding of the way
798160	805840	reality is perhaps in its most fundamental aspects by using our rational thought to solve those problems
805840	811680	but that's not how it is on Wittgenstein's conception of what philosophy is rather for
811680	819040	Wittgenstein philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity a philosophical work consists
819040	826720	essentially of elucidations philosophy does not result in philosophical propositions but rather in
826720	833280	the clarification of propositions so Wittgenstein then concludes with his seventh thesis to which
833280	841280	he offers no further explanation where of one cannot speak thereof one must be silent the
841280	848080	empiricist interpretation okay so let's break off for a moment from what Wittgenstein says
848080	854720	in The Tract Artist to one way in which it can be interpreted and whether that interpretation is
855280	859600	right or wrong so there's an influential interpretation of The Tract Artist that tries
859600	865760	to place it along empiricist lines so empiricism in philosophy it's a viewpoint in epistemology
865760	871040	in the theory of knowledge that says ultimately all our knowledge and understanding of the world
871040	876400	comes from our experience we don't have any a priori knowledge that we get you know independently
876480	881040	of our experience to understand the world to gain knowledge we have to go out there
881040	886480	and really experience the world from scratch without any experience our mind is just a blank
886480	892960	slate to be filled up and then systematized with experience so one person who attempts this
892960	898800	empiricist interpretation of The Tract Artist was Carl Popper who was an influential philosopher
898800	904640	of science okay so he attempts to interpret The Tract Artist as an empiricist doctrine
904640	910480	Popper sums up The Tract Artist as follows all genuine or meaningful propositions were
910480	916240	true functions of the elementary or atomic propositions which described atomic facts
916240	922240	which could be in principle established or rejected by observation okay so that's a pretty
922240	927760	accurate summary of The Tract Artist up to the point where we get to which could in principle
927760	934160	be established or rejected by observation so this last bit is added by Popper and it's not
934160	940000	in The Tract Artist the phrase observation statement which is a key idea in empiricism
940000	944960	doesn't occur anywhere in The Tract Artist. Wittgenstein just isn't really concerned with
944960	950720	epistemology he's not concerned really with the theory of knowledge he hardly talks about it at all
950720	957920	it seems to me that Wittgenstein made a purposeful decision to exclude any discussion of any epistemic
957920	964480	any matters relating to the theory of knowledge from The Tract Artist okay and because of that
964480	970160	we can't really attribute this epistemic interpretation of The Tract Artist to Wittgenstein
970160	976480	I just don't think it's an accurate understanding of what Wittgenstein was trying to do at all
976480	982640	nevertheless the empiricist interpretation of the picture theory of meaning was itself
982640	987440	influential as an understanding of The Tract Artist so the the empiricist interpretation it
987440	993440	was picked up by the logical positivist philosophers of the Vienna Circle so that's including philosophers
993440	999520	like Maurice Schlick, Frederick Weissmann and Rudolf Carnap so these philosophers they assumed
999520	1005680	that Wittgenstein was supporting the verification principle the principle that only those propositions
1005680	1011360	that are empirically verifiable are meaningful so according to verificationists according to
1011360	1016880	the verificationist principle there's a large class of propositions including ones about
1016960	1023920	ethics and theology and philosophy that aren't verifiable and hence aren't meaningful now Wittgenstein
1023920	1028800	does agree with this he does agree that there's a large class of propositions you know including
1028800	1035600	ethics and theology and lots of philosophy and that stuff just isn't meaningful but Wittgenstein gets
1035600	1042000	to this conclusion for rather different reasons than the verificationists he's not really an
1042000	1047360	adherent of the verificationist principle he's got quite a different theory of meaning he doesn't
1047360	1053120	say that there's something to be meaningful it has to be verifiable rather he's saying I've got
1053120	1058080	this picture theory of meaning that sets out the limits of meaning and whatever lies on the other
1058080	1065760	side of those limits is meaningless so Wittgenstein is not really a verificationist the Tract Artist
1065760	1072240	is one of the masterpieces of analytic philosophy in terms of its influence on later philosophy
1072240	1079200	the picture is kind of difficult to assess not least because it wasn't that long from the
1079200	1085040	publication of the Tract Artist to the publication of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations
1085040	1090560	where he basically takes back a lot of the viewpoints that he expresses in the Tract Artist
1090560	1096320	so he was basically disavowing his own philosophy and I think it's fair to say that Wittgenstein's
1096320	1101200	philosophical investigations and the picture of philosophy that he presents in the philosophical
1101200	1107520	investigations really set the tone for analytic philosophy philosophy of language in the second
1107520	1114720	half of the 20th century so in some sense the philosophical investigations overshadowed the
1114720	1120080	influence of the Tract Artist nevertheless there are lots of individual bits of the Tract Artist
1120080	1125520	that went on to influence important bits of analytic philosophy on the metaphysics side
1125520	1131200	there is the metaphysics of states of affairs which influence people like David Armstrong
1131200	1136160	there's the account of meaning which went on to influence lots of philosophers and linguists
1136160	1141920	perhaps not the picture theory of meaning itself but Wittgenstein's broader idea that we understand
1141920	1148320	the meaning of a sentence in terms of its possible truth values its truth conditions that's a really
1148320	1154720	really influential idea in analytic philosophy of language and linguistics the way we relate the
1154720	1160240	meaning or content of a sentence to the possible situations or the possible worlds at which that
1160240	1166240	sentence is true that's a really influential idea in modal logic and the kind of areas of philosophy
1166240	1172320	that tie in nicely with modal logic so analytic philosophy of language Wittgenstein's conception
1172320	1178640	of philosophy is something that is ultimately meaningless but that somehow it's okay to say
1178640	1182880	that it's meaningless or rather to show that it's meaningless I think has had a much more
1182880	1188960	mixed reaction Frank Ramsey in his critical notice of the Tract Artist I think expresses this idea
1188960	1195760	this criticism the best when he says what we can't say we can't say or we can't whistle it either
1196320	1201760	so Wittgenstein was known at the time for being a very proficient whistler he could
1201760	1207680	whistle his way accurately through an entire symphony and what Ramsey is really saying here is
1207680	1213280	you know you can't have your cake and eat it you can't say that this stuff this philosophy is somehow
1213280	1220080	important but also say that it's meaningless right if it's going to be important it has to mean
1220160	1226080	something and you know I guess he's saying philosophy is important and thus it is meaningful
1226800	1232320	so Wittgenstein's theory that says philosophy isn't meaningful well there's something wrong
1232320	1237520	with that but you know I think this point brings out something very very interesting about Wittgenstein's
1237520	1244880	character and I guess in his self-belief as a person and as a philosopher so if you or me I guess
1244880	1250400	came up with a theory and then we realized that this theory had this really crazy consequence
1251120	1256480	we might say to ourselves hmm yeah that's probably a problem for my theory I better go
1256480	1261280	back to the drawing board and revise the theory Wittgenstein realized that his picture theory has
1261280	1267440	this crazy consequence that all the stuff he was saying is actually meaningless but he really believed
1267440	1273680	in what he was saying and he trusted his own ability as a philosopher to such a degree that he
1273680	1279680	could say well my theory tells us that everything we're saying is meaningless and thus it is so
1279680	1286080	all of this stuff is ultimately meaningless and he extracted from that a whole way of looking at
1286080	1292720	philosophy so ultimately I don't think that tells us that much about philosophy itself but it does
1292720	1298320	tell us something very interesting about Wittgenstein as a thinker so there is so much more to say
1298320	1303280	about Wittgenstein about his thought and about his philosophy if you want to see some more videos
1303280	1308320	about that go and have a look at this one over here thank you so much to all my kofi supporters
1308320	1313840	for making this content possible and thank you to you for watching this far I really appreciate it
1313840	1315760	and I'll see you guys back here soon
