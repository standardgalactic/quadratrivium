1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
That miracle journey was during the night time and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sent a

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,320
beautiful heavenly baby white horse named Barak to take the profit through the journey.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,360
Isra was known as the journey between the Kaaba and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Palestine.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,480
And the Miraj was known as the journey between Al Aqsa Mosque and the heaven.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,080
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala mentioned that night in Surah Isra verse 1 or another name

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,080
of that Surah is Surah Bani Israel.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,720
The details of this story is very big and that's why we found several different versions

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,640
of the stories from different Sahabas who were all mentioned in the great Tafsir ibn

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,760
Qathir.

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,840
After a really long time of studying and researching the story, inshallah we will try

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,880
to tell you the most logical version of the story from ibn Qathir but as always Allah

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,440
subhanahu wa ta'ala knows the best.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,400
During the 10th and the 13th year of Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's prophethood, one night

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:31,840
in Makkah after praying his ishah prayer, the prophet was taking a rest next to the Kaaba.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,960
At that time angel Jibril peace be upon him came with a small white horse and it was called

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Al Burak.

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:48,440
First, Jibril peace be upon him opened Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's chest and cleaned his

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:57,240
heart with the Zamzam water, afterwards he put it back into his chest.

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,720
The angel requested Muhammad sallallahu wasallam to ride the Burak, instantly the Burak started

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
to fly.

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,960
One step of the magical creature covered a great long distance and because of that within

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,920
a very short time they reached a holy place which was Masjid al Aqsa.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,560
Then prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam went inside the mosque and prayed to Raka to respect

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,200
the mosque.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,280
That prayer that he prayed is called tahiyat al masjid.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Then Jibril peace be upon him offered a glass of milk and a glass of wine to Muhammad sallallahu

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,000
wasallam as a guest.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,560
The prophet rejected the glass of wine and instead accepted the milk.

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Jibril peace be upon him became very happy and said that that was a very good decision

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,520
to accept milk and reject the wine.

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Even though the prophet had just went on a journey from Mecca to the Masjid al Aqsa,

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,040
there was still another journey that was waiting for Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.

33
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,320
Then after they were well rested, angel Jibril and the prophet started their journey to

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
the sky.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,080
When they reached the first sky, Jibril peace be upon him requested angels to open the

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,960
sky door.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,840
Many different books use the word sky and heaven as the same thing, but many scholars

38
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,720
agree that the sky and the heaven are two different things.

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,840
So after they went through the first sky door, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw our father

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,120
of mankind, prophet Adam peace be upon him.

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,120
They were both very happy and gave salam to one another.

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw that all of the good people's soul were on the side

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,640
of Adam peace be upon him and all the bad people's soul were on his other side.

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:22,520
So Muhammad sallallahu wasallam became very sad and started to cry.

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and angel Jibril peace be upon them continued on with their

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,480
journey to the second sky.

47
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,720
Jibril peace be upon him again requested the door angels to open the gate.

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,880
After entering the second sky, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw two prophets, Isa or in English

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,240
Jesus and Yahya peace be upon them.

50
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,880
They all gave salam to one another as soon as they met.

51
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,600
Then Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and Jibril peace be upon them moved their journey up

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,040
to the third sky.

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:09,800
After the third sky gate opened, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met the most beautiful

54
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:18,080
and handsome prophet in the world which was use of peace be upon him.

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,360
But the fourth sky prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met prophet Idris peace be upon him.

56
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,760
Then in the fifth sky the prophet met Haroon peace be upon him and then after that the

57
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,600
great prophet Musa peace be upon him on the sixth sky.

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,120
When he saw prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam, Musa peace be upon him started to cry that

59
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,400
he had less followers in the heaven and he also said that Muhammad sallallahu wasallam

60
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
would have more followers in the heaven.

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,040
When Muhammad sallallahu wasallam reached the seventh sky, he saw prophet Ibrahim peace

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,200
be upon him.

63
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:11,800
He was rest next to the Baitul Mu'mur mosque which was located directly on top of the Kaaba.

64
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:22,000
But every day only 70,000 angels are allowed to pray in that mosque and that is a chance

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
that they only get once in their lifetime.

66
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,560
How does the Baitul Mu'mur mosque look like?

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,080
According to some scholars, Baitul Mu'mur looks just like the Kaaba.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,840
After meeting prophet Ibrahim peace be upon him, angel Jibrael and Muhammad sallallahu

69
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:57,720
wasallam both went to the highest point of limit of all creation and then they saw Sidra

70
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,680
which was the biggest tree in paradise.

71
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Its size of its fruits and leaves were extremely big.

72
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,600
It was also covered by golden butterflies.

73
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,680
It was so beautiful that no one could ever explain it.

74
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Over there Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw angel Jibrael peace be upon him in his real

75
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,360
form and shape.

76
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:39,640
He was very big and the prophet saw that the angel Jibrael had 600 wings.

77
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:47,440
At that point Allah s.w.t. talked to Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.

78
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,440
According to some scholars, angel Jibrael peace be upon him stopped there and Muhammad

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,400
sallallahu wasallam went beyond the tree to talk to Allah s.w.t.

80
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
But Allah s.w.t. knows the best.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,720
Did Muhammad sallallahu wasallam see Allah s.w.t. with his own eyes?

82
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,120
No Muhammad sallallahu wasallam did not see Allah s.w.t.

83
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,400
No human eye can ever see Allah s.w.t.

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Allah s.w.t. talked to him like Musa peace be upon him and gave him a special message to

85
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
the muslims.

86
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Allah s.w.t. and Muhammad sallallahu wasallam were there talking about the daily prayer.

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,880
At first the daily prayer was 50 times a day.

88
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,840
After receiving Allah s.w.t. message, Muhammad and Jibrael peace be upon them started their

89
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,120
journey to come back to the earth.

90
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,720
On their way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and wanted to know what that special

91
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,480
message was.

92
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,360
When Musa peace be upon him knew about 50 times daily prayer, he advised Muhammad s.w.t.

93
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,080
to go back to Allah s.w.t. and request to have a less number of daily prayers.

94
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,720
Muhammad s.w.t. did not know what to do.

95
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,800
Then he turned to Jibrael peace be upon him for his advice.

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,440
Jibrael peace be upon him told Muhammad s.w.t. that he could go back and request for less

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,320
prayers.

98
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,680
So then he went back to the sidratul muntaha and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number

99
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
of prayers.

100
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Allah s.w.t. accepted his request and lowered it to 10 times of daily prayer.

101
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,400
And then the prophet started their journey back to Makkah again.

102
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,320
Again Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised him to request Allah s.w.t. to have

103
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,480
less number of daily prayers.

104
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,320
Muhammad s.w.t. went back again and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number of prayers.

105
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:22,560
This time as a gift to Muslims Allah s.w.t. gave only 5 times of a daily prayer.

106
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,160
Again on the way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised for less.

107
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,880
Musa peace be upon him told that Allah s.w.t. wanted his people to do less but still his

108
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,760
people did not do their duties.

109
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:46,080
At that point Muhammad s.w.t. did not feel comfortable to go back again and ask for less

110
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,280
daily prayers.

111
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,560
Suddenly the prophets could hear Allah s.w.t. voice.

112
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,640
And then Allah s.w.t. told them that it was an easy order to follow for Muslims.

113
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,560
Allah s.w.t. also said that if we pray our 5 times daily prayer Allah s.w.t. will give

114
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:20,840
us the same reward as praying 50 times a day and his order was final.

115
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,960
In the journey of the Mar'aj Jibrail peace be upon him showed hell and heaven to Muhammad

116
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,680
s.w.t.

117
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,760
Scholars have different opinions about that but Allah s.w.t. knows the best.

118
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,640
Jibrail peace be upon him also showed the most beautiful qawthar river and stream which

119
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:52,120
Allah s.w.t. gave Muhammad s.w.t. as a gift after his youngest son Abdullah had died.

120
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,360
On his journey he also saw the angel named Malik without a smile.

121
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,400
He was the angel who was the guard for hell.

122
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,400
In different hadiths we know Allah s.w.t. showed some examples of the bad people's punishments.

123
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:16,840
Muhammad s.w.t. once again returned to the Masjid al-Aqsa before the morning prayer Fajr

124
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,720
time.

125
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,400
All of the prophets came and got together for the first mandatory prayer of the day which

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,120
was Fajr prayer.

127
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,640
That prayer was the first official prayer that was prayed in Islam after Allah s.w.t. finalized

128
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,600
the daily 5 times prayer.

129
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,120
Angel Jibrail peace be upon him asked Muhammad s.w.t. to lead the prayer and because of that

130
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:54,800
it was proof that Prophet Muhammad s.w.t. was the leader of all the prophets.

131
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,720
Then after the prayer Jibrail peace be upon him and Muhammad s.w.t. started their journey

132
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,160
back to Makkah.

133
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,000
On their way Muhammad s.w.t. saw a group of people who were coming to Makkah.

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,920
Muhammad and Jibrail peace be upon them returned to Makkah before sunrise.
