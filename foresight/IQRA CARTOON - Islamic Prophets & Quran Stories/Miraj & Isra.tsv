0	11680	That miracle journey was during the night time and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sent a
11680	20320	beautiful heavenly baby white horse named Barak to take the profit through the journey.
20320	28360	Isra was known as the journey between the Kaaba and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Palestine.
28360	34480	And the Miraj was known as the journey between Al Aqsa Mosque and the heaven.
34480	41080	Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala mentioned that night in Surah Isra verse 1 or another name
41080	45080	of that Surah is Surah Bani Israel.
45080	52720	The details of this story is very big and that's why we found several different versions
52720	58640	of the stories from different Sahabas who were all mentioned in the great Tafsir ibn
58640	60760	Qathir.
60760	67840	After a really long time of studying and researching the story, inshallah we will try
67840	74880	to tell you the most logical version of the story from ibn Qathir but as always Allah
74880	77440	subhanahu wa ta'ala knows the best.
77440	83400	During the 10th and the 13th year of Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's prophethood, one night
83400	91840	in Makkah after praying his ishah prayer, the prophet was taking a rest next to the Kaaba.
91840	98960	At that time angel Jibril peace be upon him came with a small white horse and it was called
98960	100960	Al Burak.
101480	108440	First, Jibril peace be upon him opened Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's chest and cleaned his
108440	117240	heart with the Zamzam water, afterwards he put it back into his chest.
117240	124720	The angel requested Muhammad sallallahu wasallam to ride the Burak, instantly the Burak started
124720	126800	to fly.
126800	133960	One step of the magical creature covered a great long distance and because of that within
133960	140920	a very short time they reached a holy place which was Masjid al Aqsa.
140920	147560	Then prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam went inside the mosque and prayed to Raka to respect
147560	149200	the mosque.
149200	154280	That prayer that he prayed is called tahiyat al masjid.
154280	160400	Then Jibril peace be upon him offered a glass of milk and a glass of wine to Muhammad sallallahu
160400	163000	wasallam as a guest.
163000	169560	The prophet rejected the glass of wine and instead accepted the milk.
169560	176360	Jibril peace be upon him became very happy and said that that was a very good decision
176360	180520	to accept milk and reject the wine.
180520	185920	Even though the prophet had just went on a journey from Mecca to the Masjid al Aqsa,
185920	194040	there was still another journey that was waiting for Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.
194040	200320	Then after they were well rested, angel Jibril and the prophet started their journey to
200320	202120	the sky.
202120	208080	When they reached the first sky, Jibril peace be upon him requested angels to open the
208080	210960	sky door.
210960	216840	Many different books use the word sky and heaven as the same thing, but many scholars
216840	222720	agree that the sky and the heaven are two different things.
222720	229840	So after they went through the first sky door, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw our father
229840	234120	of mankind, prophet Adam peace be upon him.
234640	240120	They were both very happy and gave salam to one another.
240120	246280	Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw that all of the good people's soul were on the side
246280	254640	of Adam peace be upon him and all the bad people's soul were on his other side.
254640	262520	So Muhammad sallallahu wasallam became very sad and started to cry.
262520	268520	Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and angel Jibril peace be upon them continued on with their
268520	271480	journey to the second sky.
271480	277720	Jibril peace be upon him again requested the door angels to open the gate.
277720	284880	After entering the second sky, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw two prophets, Isa or in English
284880	289240	Jesus and Yahya peace be upon them.
289240	293880	They all gave salam to one another as soon as they met.
293880	299600	Then Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and Jibril peace be upon them moved their journey up
299600	302040	to the third sky.
302040	309800	After the third sky gate opened, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met the most beautiful
309800	318080	and handsome prophet in the world which was use of peace be upon him.
318080	326360	But the fourth sky prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met prophet Idris peace be upon him.
326360	332760	Then in the fifth sky the prophet met Haroon peace be upon him and then after that the
332760	337600	great prophet Musa peace be upon him on the sixth sky.
337600	344120	When he saw prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam, Musa peace be upon him started to cry that
344120	350400	he had less followers in the heaven and he also said that Muhammad sallallahu wasallam
350400	354720	would have more followers in the heaven.
354720	362040	When Muhammad sallallahu wasallam reached the seventh sky, he saw prophet Ibrahim peace
362040	363200	be upon him.
363200	371800	He was rest next to the Baitul Mu'mur mosque which was located directly on top of the Kaaba.
371800	382000	But every day only 70,000 angels are allowed to pray in that mosque and that is a chance
382000	387360	that they only get once in their lifetime.
387360	392560	How does the Baitul Mu'mur mosque look like?
392560	399080	According to some scholars, Baitul Mu'mur looks just like the Kaaba.
399440	407840	After meeting prophet Ibrahim peace be upon him, angel Jibrael and Muhammad sallallahu
407840	417720	wasallam both went to the highest point of limit of all creation and then they saw Sidra
418720	424680	which was the biggest tree in paradise.
424680	430840	Its size of its fruits and leaves were extremely big.
430840	435600	It was also covered by golden butterflies.
435600	440680	It was so beautiful that no one could ever explain it.
440680	447680	Over there Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw angel Jibrael peace be upon him in his real
447680	450360	form and shape.
450360	459640	He was very big and the prophet saw that the angel Jibrael had 600 wings.
459640	467440	At that point Allah s.w.t. talked to Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.
467520	473440	According to some scholars, angel Jibrael peace be upon him stopped there and Muhammad
473440	480400	sallallahu wasallam went beyond the tree to talk to Allah s.w.t.
480400	484000	But Allah s.w.t. knows the best.
484000	492720	Did Muhammad sallallahu wasallam see Allah s.w.t. with his own eyes?
493520	499120	No Muhammad sallallahu wasallam did not see Allah s.w.t.
499120	504400	No human eye can ever see Allah s.w.t.
504400	511400	Allah s.w.t. talked to him like Musa peace be upon him and gave him a special message to
511400	513400	the muslims.
513400	520000	Allah s.w.t. and Muhammad sallallahu wasallam were there talking about the daily prayer.
520000	524880	At first the daily prayer was 50 times a day.
524880	530840	After receiving Allah s.w.t. message, Muhammad and Jibrael peace be upon them started their
530840	534120	journey to come back to the earth.
534120	539720	On their way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and wanted to know what that special
539720	541480	message was.
541480	548360	When Musa peace be upon him knew about 50 times daily prayer, he advised Muhammad s.w.t.
548360	556080	to go back to Allah s.w.t. and request to have a less number of daily prayers.
556080	560720	Muhammad s.w.t. did not know what to do.
560720	564800	Then he turned to Jibrael peace be upon him for his advice.
564800	571440	Jibrael peace be upon him told Muhammad s.w.t. that he could go back and request for less
571440	573320	prayers.
573320	579680	So then he went back to the sidratul muntaha and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number
579680	580680	of prayers.
580680	588960	Allah s.w.t. accepted his request and lowered it to 10 times of daily prayer.
588960	594400	And then the prophet started their journey back to Makkah again.
594400	600320	Again Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised him to request Allah s.w.t. to have
600320	603480	less number of daily prayers.
603480	612320	Muhammad s.w.t. went back again and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number of prayers.
612320	622560	This time as a gift to Muslims Allah s.w.t. gave only 5 times of a daily prayer.
622560	628160	Again on the way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised for less.
628160	634880	Musa peace be upon him told that Allah s.w.t. wanted his people to do less but still his
634880	638760	people did not do their duties.
638760	646080	At that point Muhammad s.w.t. did not feel comfortable to go back again and ask for less
646080	648280	daily prayers.
648280	654560	Suddenly the prophets could hear Allah s.w.t. voice.
654560	662640	And then Allah s.w.t. told them that it was an easy order to follow for Muslims.
662640	670560	Allah s.w.t. also said that if we pray our 5 times daily prayer Allah s.w.t. will give
670560	680840	us the same reward as praying 50 times a day and his order was final.
680840	687960	In the journey of the Mar'aj Jibrail peace be upon him showed hell and heaven to Muhammad
687960	691680	s.w.t.
691680	696760	Scholars have different opinions about that but Allah s.w.t. knows the best.
696760	703640	Jibrail peace be upon him also showed the most beautiful qawthar river and stream which
703640	712120	Allah s.w.t. gave Muhammad s.w.t. as a gift after his youngest son Abdullah had died.
712120	717360	On his journey he also saw the angel named Malik without a smile.
717360	721400	He was the angel who was the guard for hell.
721400	729400	In different hadiths we know Allah s.w.t. showed some examples of the bad people's punishments.
729400	736840	Muhammad s.w.t. once again returned to the Masjid al-Aqsa before the morning prayer Fajr
736840	738720	time.
738720	745400	All of the prophets came and got together for the first mandatory prayer of the day which
745400	748120	was Fajr prayer.
748120	755640	That prayer was the first official prayer that was prayed in Islam after Allah s.w.t. finalized
755640	759600	the daily 5 times prayer.
759600	766120	Angel Jibrail peace be upon him asked Muhammad s.w.t. to lead the prayer and because of that
766120	774800	it was proof that Prophet Muhammad s.w.t. was the leader of all the prophets.
774800	781720	Then after the prayer Jibrail peace be upon him and Muhammad s.w.t. started their journey
781720	784160	back to Makkah.
784160	790000	On their way Muhammad s.w.t. saw a group of people who were coming to Makkah.
790000	794920	Muhammad and Jibrail peace be upon them returned to Makkah before sunrise.
