00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
That miracle journey was during the night time and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sent a

00:11.680 --> 00:20.320
beautiful heavenly baby white horse named Barak to take the profit through the journey.

00:20.320 --> 00:28.360
Isra was known as the journey between the Kaaba and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Palestine.

00:28.360 --> 00:34.480
And the Miraj was known as the journey between Al Aqsa Mosque and the heaven.

00:34.480 --> 00:41.080
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala mentioned that night in Surah Isra verse 1 or another name

00:41.080 --> 00:45.080
of that Surah is Surah Bani Israel.

00:45.080 --> 00:52.720
The details of this story is very big and that's why we found several different versions

00:52.720 --> 00:58.640
of the stories from different Sahabas who were all mentioned in the great Tafsir ibn

00:58.640 --> 01:00.760
Qathir.

01:00.760 --> 01:07.840
After a really long time of studying and researching the story, inshallah we will try

01:07.840 --> 01:14.880
to tell you the most logical version of the story from ibn Qathir but as always Allah

01:14.880 --> 01:17.440
subhanahu wa ta'ala knows the best.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.400
During the 10th and the 13th year of Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's prophethood, one night

01:23.400 --> 01:31.840
in Makkah after praying his ishah prayer, the prophet was taking a rest next to the Kaaba.

01:31.840 --> 01:38.960
At that time angel Jibril peace be upon him came with a small white horse and it was called

01:38.960 --> 01:40.960
Al Burak.

01:41.480 --> 01:48.440
First, Jibril peace be upon him opened Muhammad sallallahu wasallam's chest and cleaned his

01:48.440 --> 01:57.240
heart with the Zamzam water, afterwards he put it back into his chest.

01:57.240 --> 02:04.720
The angel requested Muhammad sallallahu wasallam to ride the Burak, instantly the Burak started

02:04.720 --> 02:06.800
to fly.

02:06.800 --> 02:13.960
One step of the magical creature covered a great long distance and because of that within

02:13.960 --> 02:20.920
a very short time they reached a holy place which was Masjid al Aqsa.

02:20.920 --> 02:27.560
Then prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam went inside the mosque and prayed to Raka to respect

02:27.560 --> 02:29.200
the mosque.

02:29.200 --> 02:34.280
That prayer that he prayed is called tahiyat al masjid.

02:34.280 --> 02:40.400
Then Jibril peace be upon him offered a glass of milk and a glass of wine to Muhammad sallallahu

02:40.400 --> 02:43.000
wasallam as a guest.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.560
The prophet rejected the glass of wine and instead accepted the milk.

02:49.560 --> 02:56.360
Jibril peace be upon him became very happy and said that that was a very good decision

02:56.360 --> 03:00.520
to accept milk and reject the wine.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.920
Even though the prophet had just went on a journey from Mecca to the Masjid al Aqsa,

03:05.920 --> 03:14.040
there was still another journey that was waiting for Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.

03:14.040 --> 03:20.320
Then after they were well rested, angel Jibril and the prophet started their journey to

03:20.320 --> 03:22.120
the sky.

03:22.120 --> 03:28.080
When they reached the first sky, Jibril peace be upon him requested angels to open the

03:28.080 --> 03:30.960
sky door.

03:30.960 --> 03:36.840
Many different books use the word sky and heaven as the same thing, but many scholars

03:36.840 --> 03:42.720
agree that the sky and the heaven are two different things.

03:42.720 --> 03:49.840
So after they went through the first sky door, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw our father

03:49.840 --> 03:54.120
of mankind, prophet Adam peace be upon him.

03:54.640 --> 04:00.120
They were both very happy and gave salam to one another.

04:00.120 --> 04:06.280
Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw that all of the good people's soul were on the side

04:06.280 --> 04:14.640
of Adam peace be upon him and all the bad people's soul were on his other side.

04:14.640 --> 04:22.520
So Muhammad sallallahu wasallam became very sad and started to cry.

04:22.520 --> 04:28.520
Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and angel Jibril peace be upon them continued on with their

04:28.520 --> 04:31.480
journey to the second sky.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.720
Jibril peace be upon him again requested the door angels to open the gate.

04:37.720 --> 04:44.880
After entering the second sky, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw two prophets, Isa or in English

04:44.880 --> 04:49.240
Jesus and Yahya peace be upon them.

04:49.240 --> 04:53.880
They all gave salam to one another as soon as they met.

04:53.880 --> 04:59.600
Then Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and Jibril peace be upon them moved their journey up

04:59.600 --> 05:02.040
to the third sky.

05:02.040 --> 05:09.800
After the third sky gate opened, Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met the most beautiful

05:09.800 --> 05:18.080
and handsome prophet in the world which was use of peace be upon him.

05:18.080 --> 05:26.360
But the fourth sky prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam met prophet Idris peace be upon him.

05:26.360 --> 05:32.760
Then in the fifth sky the prophet met Haroon peace be upon him and then after that the

05:32.760 --> 05:37.600
great prophet Musa peace be upon him on the sixth sky.

05:37.600 --> 05:44.120
When he saw prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam, Musa peace be upon him started to cry that

05:44.120 --> 05:50.400
he had less followers in the heaven and he also said that Muhammad sallallahu wasallam

05:50.400 --> 05:54.720
would have more followers in the heaven.

05:54.720 --> 06:02.040
When Muhammad sallallahu wasallam reached the seventh sky, he saw prophet Ibrahim peace

06:02.040 --> 06:03.200
be upon him.

06:03.200 --> 06:11.800
He was rest next to the Baitul Mu'mur mosque which was located directly on top of the Kaaba.

06:11.800 --> 06:22.000
But every day only 70,000 angels are allowed to pray in that mosque and that is a chance

06:22.000 --> 06:27.360
that they only get once in their lifetime.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.560
How does the Baitul Mu'mur mosque look like?

06:32.560 --> 06:39.080
According to some scholars, Baitul Mu'mur looks just like the Kaaba.

06:39.440 --> 06:47.840
After meeting prophet Ibrahim peace be upon him, angel Jibrael and Muhammad sallallahu

06:47.840 --> 06:57.720
wasallam both went to the highest point of limit of all creation and then they saw Sidra

06:58.720 --> 07:04.680
which was the biggest tree in paradise.

07:04.680 --> 07:10.840
Its size of its fruits and leaves were extremely big.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.600
It was also covered by golden butterflies.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.680
It was so beautiful that no one could ever explain it.

07:20.680 --> 07:27.680
Over there Muhammad sallallahu wasallam saw angel Jibrael peace be upon him in his real

07:27.680 --> 07:30.360
form and shape.

07:30.360 --> 07:39.640
He was very big and the prophet saw that the angel Jibrael had 600 wings.

07:39.640 --> 07:47.440
At that point Allah s.w.t. talked to Muhammad sallallahu wasallam.

07:47.520 --> 07:53.440
According to some scholars, angel Jibrael peace be upon him stopped there and Muhammad

07:53.440 --> 08:00.400
sallallahu wasallam went beyond the tree to talk to Allah s.w.t.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.000
But Allah s.w.t. knows the best.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.720
Did Muhammad sallallahu wasallam see Allah s.w.t. with his own eyes?

08:13.520 --> 08:19.120
No Muhammad sallallahu wasallam did not see Allah s.w.t.

08:19.120 --> 08:24.400
No human eye can ever see Allah s.w.t.

08:24.400 --> 08:31.400
Allah s.w.t. talked to him like Musa peace be upon him and gave him a special message to

08:31.400 --> 08:33.400
the muslims.

08:33.400 --> 08:40.000
Allah s.w.t. and Muhammad sallallahu wasallam were there talking about the daily prayer.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.880
At first the daily prayer was 50 times a day.

08:44.880 --> 08:50.840
After receiving Allah s.w.t. message, Muhammad and Jibrael peace be upon them started their

08:50.840 --> 08:54.120
journey to come back to the earth.

08:54.120 --> 08:59.720
On their way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and wanted to know what that special

08:59.720 --> 09:01.480
message was.

09:01.480 --> 09:08.360
When Musa peace be upon him knew about 50 times daily prayer, he advised Muhammad s.w.t.

09:08.360 --> 09:16.080
to go back to Allah s.w.t. and request to have a less number of daily prayers.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.720
Muhammad s.w.t. did not know what to do.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.800
Then he turned to Jibrael peace be upon him for his advice.

09:24.800 --> 09:31.440
Jibrael peace be upon him told Muhammad s.w.t. that he could go back and request for less

09:31.440 --> 09:33.320
prayers.

09:33.320 --> 09:39.680
So then he went back to the sidratul muntaha and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
of prayers.

09:40.680 --> 09:48.960
Allah s.w.t. accepted his request and lowered it to 10 times of daily prayer.

09:48.960 --> 09:54.400
And then the prophet started their journey back to Makkah again.

09:54.400 --> 10:00.320
Again Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised him to request Allah s.w.t. to have

10:00.320 --> 10:03.480
less number of daily prayers.

10:03.480 --> 10:12.320
Muhammad s.w.t. went back again and requested Allah s.w.t. for less number of prayers.

10:12.320 --> 10:22.560
This time as a gift to Muslims Allah s.w.t. gave only 5 times of a daily prayer.

10:22.560 --> 10:28.160
Again on the way Musa peace be upon him stopped them and advised for less.

10:28.160 --> 10:34.880
Musa peace be upon him told that Allah s.w.t. wanted his people to do less but still his

10:34.880 --> 10:38.760
people did not do their duties.

10:38.760 --> 10:46.080
At that point Muhammad s.w.t. did not feel comfortable to go back again and ask for less

10:46.080 --> 10:48.280
daily prayers.

10:48.280 --> 10:54.560
Suddenly the prophets could hear Allah s.w.t. voice.

10:54.560 --> 11:02.640
And then Allah s.w.t. told them that it was an easy order to follow for Muslims.

11:02.640 --> 11:10.560
Allah s.w.t. also said that if we pray our 5 times daily prayer Allah s.w.t. will give

11:10.560 --> 11:20.840
us the same reward as praying 50 times a day and his order was final.

11:20.840 --> 11:27.960
In the journey of the Mar'aj Jibrail peace be upon him showed hell and heaven to Muhammad

11:27.960 --> 11:31.680
s.w.t.

11:31.680 --> 11:36.760
Scholars have different opinions about that but Allah s.w.t. knows the best.

11:36.760 --> 11:43.640
Jibrail peace be upon him also showed the most beautiful qawthar river and stream which

11:43.640 --> 11:52.120
Allah s.w.t. gave Muhammad s.w.t. as a gift after his youngest son Abdullah had died.

11:52.120 --> 11:57.360
On his journey he also saw the angel named Malik without a smile.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.400
He was the angel who was the guard for hell.

12:01.400 --> 12:09.400
In different hadiths we know Allah s.w.t. showed some examples of the bad people's punishments.

12:09.400 --> 12:16.840
Muhammad s.w.t. once again returned to the Masjid al-Aqsa before the morning prayer Fajr

12:16.840 --> 12:18.720
time.

12:18.720 --> 12:25.400
All of the prophets came and got together for the first mandatory prayer of the day which

12:25.400 --> 12:28.120
was Fajr prayer.

12:28.120 --> 12:35.640
That prayer was the first official prayer that was prayed in Islam after Allah s.w.t. finalized

12:35.640 --> 12:39.600
the daily 5 times prayer.

12:39.600 --> 12:46.120
Angel Jibrail peace be upon him asked Muhammad s.w.t. to lead the prayer and because of that

12:46.120 --> 12:54.800
it was proof that Prophet Muhammad s.w.t. was the leader of all the prophets.

12:54.800 --> 13:01.720
Then after the prayer Jibrail peace be upon him and Muhammad s.w.t. started their journey

13:01.720 --> 13:04.160
back to Makkah.

13:04.160 --> 13:10.000
On their way Muhammad s.w.t. saw a group of people who were coming to Makkah.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.920
Muhammad and Jibrail peace be upon them returned to Makkah before sunrise.
