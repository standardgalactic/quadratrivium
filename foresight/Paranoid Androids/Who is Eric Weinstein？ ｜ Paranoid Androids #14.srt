1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The science cares about you no matter whether you love science or hate science.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,200
As people come to understand the power of it, everyone's going to care.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,000
What we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive of.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,300
While many things stagnate, the unforgivable thing that's stagnated,

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,500
the singular unforgivable thing is our understanding of the most basic notion of who we are.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,900
If we are going to, every time there's a border dispute, go to a thermonuclear standoff.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,500
It's just Russian roulette with smaller and smaller numbers of empty chambers.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
These are the precursors of genocide, make no mistake.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,200
You're friendly college students with blue hair chanting from the river to the sea

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,900
or talking about the deaths of people.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,400
People will hear that and they'll say,

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,700
Oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust and fear.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
I'm a pastor.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Shoot the messenger all you want.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,600
All right.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
All right.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome back.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Welcome back.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,300
Hello, my fellow CCP member.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,500
CCP member is male, but I sponsor money.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,100
It's fucking sweet, bro.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up, comrade?

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,100
What's up, comrades?

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,800
That's right.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,900
Okay, let's get into it.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,700
Let's jump straight in.

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,600
Let's give a little background on the on the subject of today's episode.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,000
Sure.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Big favorite of mine.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:36,500
Mr. Eric Weinstein, Los Angeles, Los Angeles born a mathematician specializing in mathematical physics.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Also an economist, a commentator, gained prominence as a managing director of teal capital.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,800
Investment firm founded by Peter teal, who we mentioned a few times already.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Additionally, he's known for his involvement in the intellectual dark web.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,200
And he's been featured on various podcasts and platforms discussing topics,

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,400
ranging from economics and science to culture and politics.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:15,200
So where does your introduction to Mr. Eric Weinstein start?

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,500
Random short clips from Joe Rogan experience.

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,400
That's for one.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,700
Secondly, he made a lot of interesting comments, including the, you know, in in those podcasts,

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,500
including the one that we watched with Clint about Chris Williamson about, you know, the virus.

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,300
Yeah, that was I found out that was very interesting.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,600
Overall, like also he started the proto, proto.

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,100
A podcast, right?

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
But I think that's no longer available.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Yeah, it's defunct.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
It's just on hold.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,900
It's been on hold for a while.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,300
The portal, the portal, the portal.

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Yeah, they they stopped.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,800
I mean, they him, he stopped doing it just as the epidemic was gathering speed because

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Brett was his brother, Brett Weinstein.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,300
He was running his mouth a lot.

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,800
I think he was actually the biggest advocates for the lot for the dangers of, you know,

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
against the response of the for the pandemic.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
And he got not canceled, but he kind of his channel got demonetized.

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
So Eric stopped.

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,000
I think he only did 20 or 30 episodes.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,100
Have you seen any?

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Oh, no, I haven't.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
But I just know they exist.

61
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, it's it's still on.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
You can still see it.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,900
It's less than 30 episodes.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,700
Very good podcast, maybe even the best one I've ever seen.

65
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,100
Right.

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Great guests, the usual bunch and some new faces that I haven't seen anywhere else.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,400
It's movie directors, sports personalities, porn stars.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, nice.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
Riley Reid.

70
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,900
Oh, she she was on there and Riley Reid was a she's fairly new, right?

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,400
Or is she like our cheaped milk status already?

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,000
She she's she's young.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,400
I know that she's not a mouth yet.

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Don't ask me how I know.

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,700
But I'm familiar with her work.

76
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Nice.

77
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Yeah, me as well.

78
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,400
I think I first saw him on on on Rogan and on the Rubin report.

79
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,900
They were podcast.

80
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,800
I think he was the first time I saw he was there on with Peterson.

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,700
I think it's the first time I saw Peterson listening to somebody like giving them their full attention.

82
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,300
Who is this guy?

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,700
And then later on, I saw him on on Lex.

84
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,400
He's been on Lex like five, four, five times now.

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
That's where I really got into him and recently on Chris Williams and podcast.

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Very, very good.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,000
Very excellent, excellent conversations.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I like the fact that, you know, how we introduced him.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We introduced him in a style as if like he's right here with us.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Of course, he's you know, Eric, we all good.

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,100
Yeah, I was like, he doesn't want people to know that he come to China.

92
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,800
Anyways, that's a so what's a what's a dark?

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Internet, internet, the intellectual dark web, intellectual dark web.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay.

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,900
Intellectual dark web was first jokingly coined by Weinstein himself in the mid 2010s.

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:25,840
But the term became popular after after an article opinion piece was published in the

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,280
New York Times by staff by correction by then staff editor Barry Weiss in the New York

98
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,540
Times titled meet the renegades of the intellectual dark web.

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,060
So the the term itself, it's, it's supposed to describe the group of intellectuals or

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:51,340
commentators that oppose ideas such as identity politics, political correctness and cancel

101
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,880
culture in higher education and news media across Western countries.

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,400
They are just famous for discussing ideas that are outside mainstream mainstream discourse.

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
So who do you know from the intellectual dark web?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
Can you guess who's in it?

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,600
I would say like, I don't know if anybody I don't know for sure if somebody's in it,

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
but I can guess like, I mean, it's not like a real club.

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,340
It was just a group of a group of people.

108
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,780
I probably think like Chijic is probably in it.

109
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,780
No.

110
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
No, not Chijic.

111
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,780
All right.

112
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Jordan Peterson.

113
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,140
Peterson is Sam Harrison, Sam Harris, right?

114
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,100
The Weinstein Brothers, the Weinstein Brothers, Ben Shapiro, Douglas Murray, Douglas Murray

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
are a few of these.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,700
So the entire podcast podcast.

117
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Exactly.

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
Exactly.

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Exactly.

120
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
There's Christina Hoff summers.

121
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,020
I think she's a philosopher slash author.

122
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,920
Like I said, they were, they had in common what they were against, but some internal

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:06,000
and external factors, mainly the 2016 presidential U.S. presidential election and the COVID again,

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
correction, the response to the COVID-19 epidemic are said to have caused some internal fractures

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
within the group.

126
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,300
And some other stuff, because you have on one side, you have Sam Harris, who's a big

127
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,720
atheist in the same group with Peterson, who's a, you know, basically a Christian.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,940
Basically a full blown Christian right now.

129
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,380
And I think they also, I think COVID was one of the breaking points for them, especially

130
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
with Sam Harris.

131
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,460
He really distanced himself from the Weinstein Brothers, from Brett mainly and criticized

132
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:48,040
him a lot him and both him and Rogan for what they did during the pandemic.

133
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,600
And also they disagree, I think on free speech as well, on the levels of free speech, you

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,720
have the Weinstein Brothers who are not like free speech absolutists where you have Rogan

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,080
and let's say, especially Ben Shapiro, who really are.

136
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,200
So there's like a lot of, I mean, the gang fell apart.

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah.

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah.

139
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Yeah.

140
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Yeah.

141
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Yeah.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,880
They got popularized like that.

143
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,900
And if you think about it for the past, I would say the past five to eight years.

144
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,740
I think Joe Rogan put it very beautifully.

145
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,620
It's like we need to stop called mainstream media, mainstream media because they're not

146
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
big anymore.

147
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,420
They're corporate media right now.

148
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,020
Like everybody legacy media, the legacy media.

149
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Exactly.

150
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,420
Now, more people are interested in what's going on on the internet and on the TV or

151
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,660
on the newspaper, on the magazines,

152
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,900
but for the past eight to five to eight years,

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,700
we see all these intellectuals,

154
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,740
they became like celebrities,

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,780
like they became like rock stars.

156
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,060
You know, they can go on tours,

157
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,340
they sell out stadiums and theaters to give out speech.

158
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,060
I think that's generally a good thing.

159
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,460
I would say it's like nothing against Taylor Swift

160
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,660
or Ariana Grande, but it's like, you know,

161
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,140
I know they make good music,

162
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,180
but at the same times,

163
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,900
like there are very important people

164
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
that are spreading these like very important ideas,

165
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
but they need, they finally gain that necessary,

166
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,140
you know, attention from the general public.

167
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,460
So I think it's a good thing overall.

168
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,860
And by the way, it's a,

169
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,260
since we touched on the COVID a lot, you know,

170
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,340
Eric Dina, Chris Williamson podcast, like he,

171
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,540
I think he was the first person that I heard

172
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,820
that brought up that the US sponsored

173
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,940
that the COVID research in Wuhan lab and then,

174
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,860
and he was asking the questions, like, did we started it?

175
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,940
Like, you know, that was the first person

176
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,900
that I heard like, you know,

177
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,780
a proper intellectual talking about that.

178
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,140
So yeah, that's a, that's another thing.

179
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,020
Yeah, like we did on that episode,

180
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,700
we did on the podcast.

181
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,380
I think you said it right that time,

182
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,740
like there's a hunger in the general public,

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,100
like you said a hunger for insights.

184
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,740
So yeah, they definitely provided that,

185
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,380
that this collective,

186
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,180
but I heard Rogan at one point saying,

187
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,980
talking disparagingly about it, you know,

188
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,060
it seemed like they were, when you,

189
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,860
when you say this IDW intellectual dark web,

190
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,340
it seemed like there were like some group

191
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,380
of superheroes or something.

192
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,540
Because that, that New York times piece that came out,

193
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,780
there was like, I saw like some,

194
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,860
some scanned versions on it online,

195
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,540
like a spread, they did this photo shoot really dramatic.

196
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,380
All of them like singled out,

197
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,660
like posing in front of some mysterious backdrops.

198
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,660
It's a nighttime with the stars in the nature desert.

199
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,580
It's, it's for, it's theoretical.

200
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Yeah, very, very theatrical.

201
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,660
Yeah, but they fell apart even though I, like I said,

202
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,300
that the biggest one was Sam Harris distancing himself

203
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,260
due to the, because a lot of them supported Trump,

204
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,940
even though like we don't support Trump,

205
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,940
but you know, the lesser of two evils and paraphrasing.

206
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,260
So because of that, and because of COVID,

207
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,380
Brett and his wife, they have that dark horse podcast.

208
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,180
And during the pandemic,

209
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,900
they had, I think like bi-weekly episodes

210
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
for like a year and a half.

211
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,660
I mean, the podcast is still on,

212
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,900
but their whole content was putting down the,

213
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,180
I mean, the response to the pandemic should be told.

214
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Both of them, I think by trade are evolutionary biologists.

215
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,220
So they kind of know what they're talking about in a way.

216
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,500
So what were they suggesting?

217
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,380
Like, you know, stop quarantining people.

218
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
Like stop.

219
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Stop quarantining people.

220
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,060
Stop the lockdown.

221
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,900
The thing with the masks,

222
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,580
be upfront about the origins of COVID enough

223
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,460
with the lockdown, don't get vaccinated

224
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,220
because it's gonna produce some bad responses.

225
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,260
Right.

226
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,380
Lots of stuff.

227
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,660
Like really contrary.

228
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,180
And I'm not saying I'm not a doctor or a scientist.

229
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,740
There's some, obviously, there must be some truth, you know,

230
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,420
in what they said, I think they were proven right.

231
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,540
But at the time, I don't think they were helping

232
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
with the whole thing.

233
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,300
So they got demonetized very quick.

234
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,060
You know, two things about intellectuals.

235
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,580
The first of all, it's really difficult for them to form

236
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,740
sort of some sort of alliances, you know,

237
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,300
on every single aspect of it.

238
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,140
Exactly.

239
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,780
You know, because they're so smart, you know,

240
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,900
they look at everything issue by issue.

241
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,060
You know, when you are like that,

242
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,540
you became a very unreliable ally, right?

243
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,100
So that's an idea that I think Chris Williamson

244
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,780
first brought up.

245
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,100
At least that's the first time I heard it.

246
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
And the secondly is that because they value their thoughts

247
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,500
and truth a little bit too much.

248
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
So in a crisis like that, I'm pretty sure everybody,

249
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,220
the majority of them said whatever they feel like to say

250
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,100
for the betterment of the general public,

251
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,860
but the general public is not gonna take that

252
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
in a way that they hope they will take.

253
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,860
So, you know, I would understand like why they got

254
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,460
demonetized and why, you know, a lot of people seeing them

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,580
as like, you know, public enemies

256
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,780
or whatever intellectual enemies on that front, you know,

257
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,660
there's definitely a price you should pay

258
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,260
when you are that smart.

259
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,700
So yeah, there's a, but what I thought about the, you know,

260
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,300
this group of people, I think that, you know,

261
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,140
when I was doing a little bit of research on, you know,

262
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,660
all these podcast intellectuals, right?

263
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,500
The people that go on podcasts regularly,

264
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,660
they, you know, doing shows or,

265
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,100
they aren't necessarily the most welcome figures

266
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,980
in the academia.

267
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
That's what I found out.

268
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,700
You know, like a lot of people in the academia,

269
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,540
they are-

270
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,380
Like exiled from academia?

271
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Yeah.

272
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,020
A lot of them that they're, you know, like,

273
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,100
I think Eric, one thing, one thing he talked about,

274
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,940
like he, something that happened between him and Harvard,

275
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,740
you know, a bread, obviously.

276
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
Jordan Peterson lost his tenure, like in lessons,

277
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,160
like all that shit.

278
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Like, and then there were group,

279
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,840
the majority of the academia, like, you know,

280
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,480
the key opinion that they have is like,

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
they are famous for, they have this,

282
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,200
they gain the glamour by tackling some very controversial

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,360
issues, but when it comes down to

284
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
doing research in their field, they're like,

285
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
they're not that, you know, far head or whatever.

286
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
So there is definitely an idea of the renegades

287
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,920
versus the establishment.

288
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,960
It's weird that they were all united by one of the things

289
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,880
that they were united behind is, you know,

290
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,640
cancel culture within higher education.

291
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,440
And most, if not all of them ended up being exiled

292
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
from academia.

293
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,880
Exiled, exactly.

294
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,720
Maybe not,

295
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,360
what's his name?

296
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
The atheist, the new atheist, what's his name?

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,080
Didn't my-

298
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,920
Dawkins?

299
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
That's an old-

300
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
No, no, no.

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
Sam Harris, yeah.

302
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,080
Sam Harris, Sam Harris.

303
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,240
And I think I saw something,

304
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,680
do you remember this was just like before Trump,

305
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,000
maybe like a year or maybe the same year

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,520
that this term started gathering some speed,

307
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,200
this intellectual dark web?

308
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you remember that interview that Sam Harris,

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,600
I think it was Bill Maher with Ben Affleck?

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,440
Have you seen that?

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
Oh yeah, I've seen it.

312
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,440
Like Ben Affleck went Batman mode on it.

313
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was at that time.

314
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,720
He was a Muslim question.

315
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,880
Right, he was like,

316
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,840
I think he was accusing a lot of guys

317
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,760
on their shows like being Islamic phobic, you know?

318
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,600
Yeah, I know that.

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
What about it?

320
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,320
I think I just remembered that

321
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,920
because you know, that started at the same time as this.

322
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah, it's weird that they all got thrown together

323
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,760
in this-

324
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,320
I think a perfect counter example

325
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
would be Andrew Schuberman.

326
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,440
Like I don't think he's part of the dark web, right?

327
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,160
No, he's not, but I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up.

328
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,280
I mean, we can put him in the same pot with Gorgons.

329
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,200
There's probably a new batch of renegades.

330
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
We can call him intellectuals,

331
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,080
but like improvement gurus.

332
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
The all the information I found about Andrew

333
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
is overwhelmingly positive.

334
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,360
Like both from the general public,

335
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,760
like how many we have the Andrew Schuberman husband now

336
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
and also from the academia.

337
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,800
Like he's a very solid researcher.

338
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,120
But at the same time, like he's very smart

339
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,800
that he never talked about any controversial issues.

340
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
And people are,

341
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,480
I know there are a lot of people are very eager

342
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,760
to sort of construct a trap for him

343
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
so that he will accidentally say something

344
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,640
that he wasn't planning on saying

345
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,920
so we can take him down or put him in one of those categories.

346
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,360
But so far, the guy's been smart.

347
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,320
Like he's been on top of his game.

348
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,080
So it just shows you he's like, yeah, that's a thing.

349
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,840
They bring you up and then they put you down.

350
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,680
Exactly.

351
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,320
I told you, I think he's,

352
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,640
we're gonna see him come out as a closeted Christian.

353
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Like big time.

354
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Right.

355
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,920
Do you feel like, you know, I got this feeling,

356
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,360
I don't know what you feel about it.

357
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,320
And I feel like Eric Weinstein

358
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
is just one of those smartest people on the planet

359
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,880
that his resume doesn't feel real to me.

360
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,880
Like I understand like you started off your academic career

361
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
with mathematics

362
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,680
and that's basically the universal language of science

363
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,280
so we can tap into all the fields.

364
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,120
I understand that.

365
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
But to become a theoretical physicist,

366
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,120
a mathematical physicist and economist at the same time,

367
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,600
that just like for me, it would be like Andrew Huberman

368
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
was a neurologist,

369
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,520
but at the same time, he's also a economist.

370
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,640
Like what, you know what I mean?

371
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,920
You should, the first episode of the portal

372
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,680
is Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.

373
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,880
That's the interview where I heard that

374
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
when you subtract all the screens,

375
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,600
where's the 99.

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,520
He brought a similar point in the Chris Williamson podcast.

377
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,360
You should look at that.

378
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,480
It's a great, great conversation.

379
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,120
He was, he was canceled as well by the left for being,

380
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,280
you know, accused of all these things,

381
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,240
you know, bigot and Nazi, even though he's a gay

382
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,600
and in the open gay, I mean, gay, homosexual,

383
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,320
but they put him down.

384
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,960
They found a way to put him down.

385
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, I don't think he cares.

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
He has the fuck you money.

387
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,320
So, and the credentials.

388
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,960
So I don't really think he's bothered too much about it.

389
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,320
Speaking of science, how did you,

390
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,520
how was your, what's your experience with physics

391
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,680
during your formative study years?

392
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,360
It was a, it was a mess.

393
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Like I, the years I was there,

394
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,360
I think that the string theorists were doing the last push.

395
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,000
You know, that's when you see Brian Gray

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,960
and all those cock-cool.

397
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Mitchell cock-cool.

398
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Mitchell cock-cool.

399
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,560
Like all these professors, they were doing like

400
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,880
a lot of documentaries about string theories.

401
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,640
They were going on TED talks.

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,920
And then back then I was like, you know,

403
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,600
I thought it was just try to promote science.

404
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
But now I thought about it.

405
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,920
I think that definitely did it to gather more attention

406
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
and also try to grab more funds.

407
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,680
It was a mess because I remembered,

408
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,280
I talked with a lot of my schoolmates

409
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,640
from the physics department and they're not buying,

410
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,680
it was never part of the formal, you know,

411
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,080
education curriculum where like, you know,

412
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,720
you study general relativity and quantum physics

413
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,960
and then you have to learn a string theory.

414
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,320
It was a never, it was more of a thought experiment

415
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,160
for a lot of people.

416
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,880
Like they never took it very seriously.

417
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay, I want to talk about that.

418
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,240
But what I meant, how did you,

419
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
did you have physics during your,

420
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,560
in high school here in China or?

421
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh yeah, like since middle school.

422
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Did you do well?

423
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,040
Yeah, pretty, pretty okay.

424
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
Man, I barely passed physics.

425
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
Really?

426
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,960
I clawed my way through high school in physics.

427
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I had like all like these social sciences and languages.

428
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,480
History, geography, everything.

429
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,440
I was like a grade A student,

430
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,160
but like math and physics, barely a D.

431
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,280
I mean the equivalent,

432
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
a Serbian equivalent of a D.

433
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I seriously, I crawled my way through those classes.

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I mean, I was just,

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
I was thinking today if my professors

436
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,880
from high school and university could see me now

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,480
about to talk about string theory,

438
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,040
I would love to see their reaction.

439
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,560
Right, that's amazing.

440
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,920
It's like I had a,

441
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,800
I would say like a high school physics for me

442
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
was really tough.

443
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,960
Like I didn't do that well.

444
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,240
Like when I was in middle school, I did pretty okay.

445
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,360
But high school, the Chinese high school physics

446
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,640
is just full of like these pretty nuanced

447
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,620
and unnecessarily complicated problems

448
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,460
that you have to solve.

449
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,320
And then there's nothing interesting in there.

450
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
College, I think the Americans,

451
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
they don't teach that hard.

452
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,040
At least for public undergraduate studies,

453
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,000
but I always had an interest in the ideas in physics,

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,240
but I just don't want to turn myself into a physicist.

455
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,320
Like I feel like that's really, really, really stressful.

456
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,680
But yeah, like, but like things told to those guys,

457
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,920
like everybody was, you know, it's very cultivating, you know?

458
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,280
Do you think that we are like live amount

459
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,940
like 11 fucking strings around us like all the time?

460
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,140
That's crazy.

461
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,140
So I was, he always, Weinstein always talks about string theory.

462
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,820
Every time he shows up on a podcast or a lecture

463
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,140
or something.

464
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,540
So I've been rewatching and trying to figure out

465
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
what he's saying.

466
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,260
He's basically saying that string theory doesn't work

467
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,260
neither technically nor in the approach of its physicists.

468
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,140
So the point that he's trying to make,

469
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,740
the way I understood it,

470
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,940
is that string theorists are very arrogant

471
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,980
in their approach in the way that they don't,

472
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,500
they don't want to recognize

473
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,700
that there might be something else outside their field.

474
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,660
And he says that this approach of theirs

475
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,580
is unscientific and analytical

476
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,380
because they refuse to admit that they might be wrong.

477
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,060
And like you said, despite all this money spent,

478
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,140
brain power and time invested

479
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
during the last half a century,

480
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,060
the field hasn't produced any tangible results

481
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,140
outside of some theoretical stuff,

482
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,900
nothing that's applicable in the real world.

483
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,740
That's how I understood it.

484
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,660
I watched, I used to watch a lot of like

485
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,460
these scientific documentaries like the Neil,

486
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,780
Neil deGrasse Tyson?

487
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,180
Neil deGrasse Tyson, like I need to repeat a name

488
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,780
a hundred times so I can memorize it.

489
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,940
Also alongside with Tarke Clarkson,

490
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,020
Carlson, like-

491
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,100
Kelly Clarkson?

492
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,660
Chris Tarke or whatever.

493
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,140
But anyway, so I watched a lot of these documentaries

494
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,660
and what I found out was that

495
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,820
their starting point is definitely very, very interesting.

496
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,220
So you have 11 universal constants,

497
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,500
like the constant for gravity or whatever.

498
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,660
And then it's like maybe that's,

499
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,580
one constant represents the dimensions

500
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,420
or we have 11 dimensions at the very macroscopic level.

501
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,540
And I'm like, yeah, at a quantum level,

502
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,060
it's just these strings reverberate

503
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,340
at a very specific frequency

504
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,540
and I'll create a constant.

505
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,380
I'm like, all right, cool, we'll understand that.

506
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,780
That's very interesting.

507
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,540
But then again, if you look at how string theory

508
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,100
square off in front of other really dominant

509
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,580
physics theories, right?

510
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,860
Like the general relativity, the quantum mechanics,

511
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,140
like it was way, way, way lower.

512
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,980
I don't think that Einstein started the relativity theory,

513
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,260
the theory of relativity like off of the imaginary,

514
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,420
imagination at that level.

515
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,060
And then compared to string theory,

516
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,500
and then the other two were like really,

517
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,700
really well grounded, you can use it.

518
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,900
I think that GPS use that,

519
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,260
the general theory of relativity

520
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,060
and then the quantum mechanics were used

521
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,460
creating quantum computers now.

522
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,820
But like, even though they make a breakthrough,

523
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,060
like exactly like you said,

524
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,340
what are we gonna do with it?

525
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,620
Make a fucking quantum violin,

526
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,620
all of the fucking strings or whatever?

527
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,860
Yeah, he's saying that they basically took the spotlight

528
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,180
away within physics from theoretical physics

529
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,260
all the way to just purely on string theory.

530
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,900
And they're not asking these big questions,

531
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,780
ideas of the universe, whether or not we can traverse it,

532
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,820
leave the planet, find new sources of energy,

533
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,540
become a multi-plan, multi-solar civilization

534
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,020
or something like that.

535
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,940
That's what I find interesting about him.

536
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,580
When he talks about, I think I heard him,

537
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,340
when he talks about Einstein,

538
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,180
he said that this whole idea,

539
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm not sure if this is Einstein's concept,

540
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,420
so that's what I, but this space time.

541
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,780
Is this Einstein's space time?

542
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,420
That he said this numerous times,

543
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,540
he says space time, it's a map, it's not a territory.

544
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,460
And that we are, that's we,

545
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,060
that scientists, physicists are shackled by this.

546
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,660
They're not thinking outside the box,

547
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,340
what might be outside of that.

548
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,140
I really like how he phrased that.

549
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,380
Right, I just, it always amazed me to,

550
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,620
you remember who was that guy's name

551
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,700
that he constantly mentioned,

552
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,740
like the most feared character, you know?

553
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,380
I don't know, but I know who you mean.

554
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,100
He's just retiring now.

555
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,580
Yeah, he's part of that whole string theory,

556
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,740
like bandwagon, right?

557
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,060
Yeah, he's the Godfather.

558
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,060
Right, and I feel like there is a,

559
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,700
there is a sense of urgency among physicists.

560
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,420
Like, you know, we haven't progressed any further

561
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,780
after the discovery of, you know,

562
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,580
what Einstein discovered and also the quantum physics.

563
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,460
And then they feel this sense of urgency

564
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,740
and then the string theorists are just, you know,

565
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,220
according to Eric, it's like they exactly,

566
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,100
like you said, they waste a lot of resource

567
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,140
and funding and spotlight and attention

568
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,900
on a concept that's probably not gonna lead us to anywhere.

569
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,900
But at the same time, I always feel like, you know,

570
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,420
maybe for him, this is very, very important,

571
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,620
a very, you know, potent issue.

572
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,860
But for us, like, you know, we don't understand how much.

573
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,220
It's like we really, really, really hope to see

574
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,180
that maybe, you know, the conventional physicists

575
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,340
can make some sort of breakthrough

576
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,260
and then just like use actual signs to be done,

577
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,860
like these string theorists, like as they claim,

578
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,540
like in the end, like we can move on for this.

579
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,140
But like when I was listening to the podcast,

580
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,740
I'm like, yeah, I understand that you are not happy

581
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,620
about this, but how's that gonna relate it

582
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,540
to my mortgage, man?

583
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,860
Like, you know, I really wish I could know.

584
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
Okay, but he thinks he thinks big.

585
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,900
He thinks. Yeah, he definitely.

586
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,260
Very, very, very, very big.

587
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,980
I don't know when I think about physics,

588
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,540
I'm like Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project,

589
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,180
the atom bomb, and that's it.

590
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,700
Like you said, I know GPS systems,

591
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,100
they function on some, they came from physics, right?

592
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,940
All right, yeah.

593
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,780
What else?

594
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,820
I think that they found that like hard evidence

595
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,340
on the astronauts in the International Space Stations,

596
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,060
like how slow, how much like there are times.

597
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,900
Time dilation.

598
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,740
Time dilation.

599
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,700
Gave us a solid, good movie called Interstellar,

601
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
that's for sure.

602
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,540
Yeah, some physicists worked on that.

603
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,700
The rendering of that black hole,

605
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,340
like I think it took them like months

606
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,700
to render the black hole like that.

607
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,580
And then it was the most accurate depiction

608
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,380
of what a black hole really looks like.

609
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,940
Apparently Oppenheimer, he was the first one

610
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,700
to propose the existence of black holes.

611
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

612
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,700
Yeah, you were absolutely right.

613
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,980
I was shocked when I was watching Oppenheimer

614
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,340
and he said like,

615
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,180
I'll check it.

616
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,020
There's a small comment.

617
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

618
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,620
But like most people sort of give Stephen Hawking

619
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,980
a little bit too much credit on the whole black hole thing,

620
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,980
but like Hawking discovered a Hawking radiation,

621
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,020
which is also important.

622
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,180
Like he basically said like there,

623
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,820
maybe we can get some information

624
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,460
out of the black hole and it's not completely black.

625
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,580
And then he actually,

626
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,100
we found evidence about that.

627
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,460
Black holes can evaporate,

628
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,940
but yeah, Oppenheimer was definitely the first guy.

629
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,540
I would say that he was one of the group of scientists

630
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,100
who went that far and started to think

631
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,660
that maybe we can find an object that dense

632
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,740
in a universe that you can stop spacetime,

633
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,380
which is a weird thing to say if you think about it.

634
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,780
It's super weird.

635
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,940
It breaks my mind every time I try to think about it.

636
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,660
Last few nights, I've been trying to listen

637
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,180
to some physics podcasts.

638
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,020
It's fascinating, but as soon as I catch on

639
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,460
to something they're talking about

640
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,300
and start thinking about it,

641
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,580
the conversation just moves on away from me.

642
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,300
By the time I get back, I'm already lost.

643
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,500
It's like weightlifting for a brain sort of.

644
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,140
I mean, the most I know about physics

645
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,380
is from the Big Bang Theory.

646
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,020
Yeah.

647
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,980
So one of the, I guess not one of the,

648
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,900
one of the the most famous,

649
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,900
most notable idea that Weinstein has is geometric unity.

650
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,140
That it's a, how do you say?

651
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,260
It's a theoretical framework that he introduced

652
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,540
in this mathematical physics.

653
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,980
So from what I understand, he is trying to,

654
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,660
this idea of geometric unity,

655
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,780
he's trying to merge Einstein's theory

656
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,500
of general relativity,

657
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,340
which explains gravity on a large scale, right?

658
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,380
With, like you said, with particle behavior,

659
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,180
which deals with quantum mechanics,

660
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,180
which deals with particle behavior on a small scale.

661
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,780
And so far, this theory has been met

662
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,540
with a little bit of skepticism, but also interest.

663
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,900
And he's still working on it.

664
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,460
I don't know if you remember,

665
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,460
this was like the previous time Weinstein was on Rogan.

666
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,420
He presented this idea.

667
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,420
Anyone can see it, it's on pull that up Jamie.com.

668
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,260
But it's, I mean, it's serious science.

669
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,620
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend

670
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,140
like I know what he's talking about,

671
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,140
but he's trying to, I think he sees himself in this theory

672
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,380
that he can make another breakthrough

673
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,460
and walk in the footsteps maybe of Weinstein.

674
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,420
So I guess that's what he's trying to do.

675
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,540
I'm like, you know,

676
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,460
to give a new map.

677
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,420
Exactly.

678
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,500
I think that the vibe I'm getting

679
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,740
when he was talking about this

680
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,300
in the Chris Williamson podcast was that,

681
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,700
you know, that's why for me,

682
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,740
like Brian Cox was still my favorite physicist.

683
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,420
Are you sure it's Brian Cox?

684
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,260
Brian Cox.

685
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,940
I've heard you say this now a few times.

686
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Is it Cox?

687
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,060
Yes, it is Cox.

688
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,660
Is that the guy who's always smiling?

689
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,900
Yeah.

690
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,740
C.O.X.

691
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,580
Oh, okay.

692
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,420
C.O.X.

693
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,940
You know, like how else do you want to pronounce it?

694
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,900
I also watched a few times, a physicist also,

695
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,340
he was also on the podcast circuit, Brian Keating.

696
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,660
There are a lot of Brian's in there.

697
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,980
He's a colleague of Weinstein's,

698
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,700
very, very cool guy, very interesting.

699
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,060
But I don't, I hope that he can make some like contribution,

700
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,820
but I would say that just based on his tone

701
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,140
and all he described it,

702
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,020
like all these big ass problems

703
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,700
that he's tackling with right now.

704
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,940
You know, one of my professors told me,

705
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,820
it's like in academia,

706
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,700
rarely you can find a area

707
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,060
where you can build an entire building upon.

708
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,660
Most people are just trying to add one additional brick

709
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,220
to the pre-existing building at a time

710
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,220
and then you would make the building as tall as possible.

711
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,420
When he was talking like that,

712
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,980
it really gives people the feeling

713
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,300
that he found this new territory where you can,

714
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,100
you know, there's a bright future ahead of this,

715
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,740
but I was kind of skeptical.

716
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,500
I know that for sure,

717
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,180
his theory might be very brilliant,

718
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,380
may make some really good contribution towards this,

719
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,820
but I had the same,

720
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,900
and I'm pretty happy for the fact

721
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,420
that he was pretty passionate about this,

722
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,340
but the thing I wanna say is that,

723
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,980
don't expect that we can go to fucking Mars

724
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,940
in two seconds in the next year or something.

725
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,860
It's gonna take a colossal amount of effort.

726
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,900
Yeah, but he's saying like, okay, we went to the moon,

727
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,140
we can go to Mars,

728
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,900
maybe one of the moons of Jupiter,

729
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,940
and then what, like game over.

730
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,860
So we probably do need somebody who's thinking

731
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,220
that maybe it's not him,

732
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,900
but I think maybe what he's trying to argue

733
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,540
that the physics community should encourage

734
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,700
outside the box thinkers and support them,

735
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,460
because maybe these breakthroughs

736
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,420
will come from one of these people who think like this.

737
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,780
Then those who are indoctrinated into the field of string tier

738
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,220
and just following the footsteps of those who can't be.

739
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,420
Exactly, exactly.

740
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,460
You need a lot, like a thousand bodies

741
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,460
to basically form the foundation

742
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,540
of just one significant breakthrough.

743
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,780
And if you look at Einstein,

744
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,500
he wasn't, he didn't came out of nowhere.

745
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,660
He didn't come out of nowhere.

746
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,340
Like he's breakthroughs also built upon

747
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,460
like at least Newton's idea about gravity and all that.

748
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,340
And then before him,

749
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,340
I would say like the most common understanding

750
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,340
about gravity was that gravity was a sort of like a field,

751
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,740
like an electronic magnetic field.

752
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,260
And then Einstein was basically saying like,

753
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,540
probably it's not, it's something different.

754
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,120
You know, so I'm definitely glad to see

755
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,660
that he's still working on this problem.

756
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,300
It's like, because I know a lot of people have quit.

757
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,100
I think that a lot of string theorists,

758
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,240
you know, who bought into this,

759
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,720
a lot of them were once upon a time

760
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,520
trying to solve this thing.

761
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
Like they want to put their effort in,

762
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,960
but it's just so damn difficult.

763
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,480
And then they sort of, you know,

764
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,320
if you think about it,

765
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,000
string theory was originally also a thinking

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,520
also after the box idea.

767
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,360
Fringe, yeah.

768
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,600
Yeah, so it's like.

769
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,880
But yeah, like when you look at those old movies

770
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
and those old books, you know, this is not the future.

771
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,640
We were, I'm not gonna say promised,

772
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,400
but that we all envisioned, you know,

773
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,160
like Teal said, when you subtract all the screens,

774
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,720
we're still living in 1970s.

775
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,320
We haven't really made anything except these things.

776
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,200
Yeah, exactly.

777
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,760
This is the furthest we've, we haven't sent.

778
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
I think a man hasn't been on the moon since 1972

779
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,080
was the last manned moon mission.

780
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,840
And, you know, this, the late mid sixties,

781
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,860
we started this age of space exploration

782
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,520
and then just withered out.

783
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Nothing happened.

784
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,920
If your mask didn't reboot it,

785
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,320
I mean, NASA basically clothed, you know,

786
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,960
we're sending their astronauts to Russia to go to space.

787
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,560
Yeah, there is a.

788
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,760
What I'm trying to say, there's no,

789
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,080
it seems like there's no imagination in science.

790
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,440
There is no imagination.

791
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,360
And I feel like there was just,

792
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,240
science just went through a huge period of

793
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,440
like self-indulged in depression, in a sense.

794
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah, it's like, I know that NASA made a lot of,

795
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,880
you know, NASA actually made a lot of progress

796
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,160
in terms of, you know, we had a first picture

797
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,560
of the black hole in 2016.

798
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
That was huge.

799
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
The detection of the gravitational waves,

800
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,280
that's also huge.

801
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,600
But we were just at that, I would say,

802
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,040
it's like the darkness before the down type of time

803
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,760
where, you know, everything seems so hopeless

804
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,520
and boring that, you know,

805
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,080
and every problem seems so urgent to solve

806
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,880
and everybody's having this huge amount of stress

807
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,560
on their shoulders.

808
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,680
Yeah, we just need to get through that, but.

809
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,160
When I, we talked about this ad nauseam,

810
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,120
it's my new word.

811
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,040
The three body problem.

812
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,960
I mean, the ideas in those books are out there.

813
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
Yeah.

814
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,640
Fascinating.

815
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,760
That's physics, right?

816
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,240
Really, really interesting.

817
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,240
The show is coming out next month, the Netflix version.

818
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,560
I saw the trailer.

819
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
I think they're doing all three books at the same time

820
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
based on the trailer.

821
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
I think so too.

822
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,520
I think there were some elements from the other two books

823
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,640
and they also brought it in.

824
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,920
Like, I don't know if that's a good idea.

825
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,720
Maybe from a narrative point of view,

826
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,880
they want to set up some kind of cliffhangers.

827
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,680
Like, you know, sometimes the TV shows does that,

828
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,160
like show you something that wait down in the future

829
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,520
and then bring back the story afterwards.

830
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,560
Could be.

831
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
Yeah.

832
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,640
Okay, so let's connect all these two things,

833
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,040
physics and the three body problem.

834
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,000
For the past four years now,

835
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,200
I think ever since he stopped doing the portal podcast,

836
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,360
Weinstein has dedicated himself

837
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,040
in investing the UFO phenomena.

838
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,400
He has interacted with various experts in this field.

839
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,480
And after four years,

840
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,720
he says he remains skeptical about the existence

841
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,760
of UFOs themselves.

842
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,600
But that's...

843
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
Just skeptical?

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,320
Yeah, pessimistic skeptical.

845
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
You know, they actually exist,

846
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,680
but he points out there's like concrete evidence

847
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,680
that points to existence of decades-long

848
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,840
secret government programs

849
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,440
that are shrouded in like UFO secrecy.

850
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,320
And he says that these programs

851
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,240
could actually might be just the front

852
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,080
for testing new weapons

853
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,480
or conducting retrieval missions behind enemy lines

854
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,720
or experimenting with aerospace technology.

855
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,120
And he said, even though he didn't see any concrete evidence,

856
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
it's the only area,

857
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,040
because you know, he's outspoken on all topics

858
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,360
where he can't provide like a single explanation

859
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,680
what's going on.

860
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,960
And what is weird about it, and he mentioned it,

861
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,440
and I also believe this is very weird,

862
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,760
that you have in the United States,

863
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,960
for example, for the last two years,

864
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
you have these whistleblowers

865
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,240
and all this news coming out.

866
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,080
And the idea that the United States

867
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,000
have lost control of their airspace

868
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,440
has reached the highest level of US Congress

869
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,280
and all these officials.

870
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,040
And they are entertaining this idea.

871
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,360
So either, like he said, bringing the scientists,

872
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,360
debunk this in an afternoon, or sending the military.

873
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,040
So which one is it?

874
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,120
And they're not doing anything.

875
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,600
It's like now wrapped up in all this bureaucracy

876
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,320
and they made the aliens now kind of boring, you know?

877
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,440
But something is going on there.

879
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,280
There is a, that's actually a very strange thing.

880
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,360
Like, did you ever watch one of those Congress hearings

881
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
about that?

882
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, I did, yeah, I watched the David Grosh one, yeah.

883
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,720
Do you feel like it's so fucking surreal?

884
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
It's uber bizarre.

885
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,320
It's uber bizarre, right?

886
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,120
It's like, it feel, to me,

887
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,200
it's one of those like dreamlike sequences

888
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,080
that happened in these couple of years

889
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,760
as everything is so fucking over the top.

890
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,240
You know, any, those people that showed up at the hearings

891
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,360
claiming that they worked with the government,

892
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
they worked for the government,

893
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,760
they had actual aliens, somebody contact with the aliens.

894
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,560
And if you watch these people from a different setting,

895
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,760
you probably think that guy is probably fucking,

896
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,320
you know, he's out there, like he's delusional,

897
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,560
like he's crazy.

898
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,240
And then you have a per people talking like that

899
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,760
in front of some ultra serious Congress people.

900
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,800
And then it's just these two elements combined together.

901
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm like, y'all really don't have anything better to do

902
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,680
right now, like, wow.

903
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,120
It's unreal, it's literally unreal.

904
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,000
Like, like you said, it's like brought up to a serious level

905
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that this, at this level is just,

906
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,960
it doesn't make any sense.

907
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,480
Like he said, like every time,

908
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,080
because he really went deep into this,

909
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,000
he met with all these people.

910
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,040
And he says, every time people say like,

911
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,800
these things are defying the laws of physics.

912
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,960
He says, okay, how do you know they're defying

913
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,800
the laws of physics?

914
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
He's like, well, we can see like, okay,

915
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
if they're defying the laws of physics,

916
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,440
give me a physicist to tell me that.

917
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,920
And upon his investigation,

918
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,520
he found out there are no physicists working on this.

919
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,040
He says, if anyone's gonna debunk it,

920
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,200
it's gonna be the physicist.

921
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,040
They're gonna debunk it.

922
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,280
Like I said, in an afternoon,

923
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,120
they're gonna say, okay.

924
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,640
That was like 15 minutes conversation.

925
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,680
15 minutes, yeah.

926
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,080
He said, I'm not even in it

927
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,960
and I'm like the only physicist.

928
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
But to entertain the idea,

929
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,640
I like when he made this interesting observation.

930
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,560
He said, if you take like this kind of thing,

931
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,960
this, let's say UFO cover up,

932
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,400
if it was real, how he know it's not real,

933
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,000
how he knows it's not real.

934
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,080
Let's say this would be a Manhattan type project

935
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,920
in terms of scale.

936
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,880
And he says like, take the NSA,

937
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,480
National Security Agency, for example.

938
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,240
Like it was secret for a long time.

939
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,840
Now they know, now we all know that it exists.

940
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,480
These people deal with numbers there, right?

941
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,120
They're also mathematicians.

942
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,400
So he said, you would go to,

943
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
you would see a whole generation of students

944
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,120
in the United States that got their PhDs for this.

945
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,320
You would check the whole,

946
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,060
like that year who graduated.

947
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,840
You would see that all these students are missing.

948
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,000
You would find their addresses.

949
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,520
You will see they're all working in the same city.

950
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,120
Then you would know there's like an operation going on there.

951
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,680
They're working on something.

952
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,160
And he says, he was looking into,

953
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,000
he says, if aliens exist,

954
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,280
there are like three different areas of physics,

955
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,840
which would require people from there to work on this.

956
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,920
And he did the math.

957
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,960
He did his homework and his nobody is missing.

958
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,040
So there's no like real big project going on.

959
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,420
You would be surprised about like how open

960
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,600
or non secretive the American academia really is.

961
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,320
It's like, and also Chinese academia in some regards.

962
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,240
I think the China past that period of time

963
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,640
where like we need to locked up 5,000 physicists

964
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,360
and high school students, college students,

965
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,080
because we need a nuclear bomb.

966
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,880
That's what we did in the sixties.

967
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,840
Exactly like you said,

968
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,920
a whole generation of college physics students disappeared

969
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,600
and it went shipped into that gunswil province.

970
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,560
And then next thing you know,

971
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,200
we had a big mushroom cloud and they were figured out.

972
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,760
Oh yeah, that's how they went.

973
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,760
But no, like we passed that.

974
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,840
Like I admit a lot of,

975
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,040
I basically know some people that are working

976
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,000
some of the very sensitive industry.

977
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,080
And then they can talk about it's like,

978
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,400
yeah, we're making somethings.

979
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,920
That's technically not internationally legal.

980
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,360
You know, and then in the U.S.

981
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,800
and then they talk about like,

982
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,240
oh, I'm working with the co-fusion project here

983
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,600
or I'm working with the NASA or something like it.

984
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,520
They're very open.

985
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,280
There is not that much of a secret to, you know,

986
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,440
attach to them.

987
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,840
And then what's funny about this whole ADIAN thing is that

988
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,000
if there is actual ADIAN, so like on the planet,

989
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,160
U.S. wouldn't be the only group of,

990
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,440
or the only country that knows about this.

991
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
You know, like everybody's watching.

992
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,840
It would have to be a global cover up.

993
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Exactly.

994
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,840
It's like, everybody has to cover it up.

995
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,720
Like for what?

996
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,560
You know what I mean?

997
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,680
What's so potentially catastrophic that?

998
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,160
When you look at the failure,

999
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,240
the global failure in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic,

1000
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,520
if they couldn't control that,

1001
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,560
how would they be able to cover up the existence

1002
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,920
of extraterrestrial life?

1003
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,880
Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense, man.

1004
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,960
There's like ADIAN's question.

1005
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,120
Like the idea that some civilization figured out

1006
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,120
how to do interstellar travel and visiting us, you know,

1007
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,920
we're basically in terms of civilization,

1008
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,120
we're pre-kindergarten.

1009
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,480
Like, what for?

1010
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,360
Like, what's so valuable on the planet?

1011
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,720
And then I heard somebody like, you know,

1012
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,360
one of those people that witnessed on a congress hearing

1013
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,000
is like, ah, they came here for the water.

1014
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,560
Like seriously, water?

1015
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
It's too over.

1016
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,840
It's a movie plot.

1017
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,320
Exactly, it's like water.

1018
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,040
Like y'all figured out how to travel the universe

1019
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
and then you don't know how to combine hydrogen

1020
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,480
and oxygen to go.

1021
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,480
But he did say that we made some cool observations.

1022
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,440
He said like, if we, like when we humans studied,

1023
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,160
for example, orcas, which are like the smartest beings

1024
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,080
next to us in the food chain, I guess,

1025
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,760
like how do we approach them?

1026
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,280
You know, we observed them, we build,

1027
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,400
how do you say, what's the opposite of natural?

1028
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,160
Artificial habitats for them, we studied them,

1029
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,760
we hide from them.

1030
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,360
You know, maybe somebody, if they are here,

1031
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,640
why would they show themselves?

1032
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,880
He made also a very cool observation about,

1033
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,600
you know, the Sentinel Islands.

1034
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,880
Sentinel, yeah, islands south of India.

1035
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,720
That island with like a few hundreds of inhabitants

1036
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,000
that killed everyone who showed up there

1037
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,240
in the last few hundred years.

1038
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,640
Basically the Indian government,

1039
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,680
because the island belongs to India,

1040
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,600
have put it like, not like a protection around it,

1041
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,240
nobody's allowed to go there.

1042
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,760
They're basically living in the Stone Age there.

1043
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,480
So for them, but like the whole world is studying them,

1044
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,720
but they're not aware of the existence

1045
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,720
of even India, let alone the continents.

1046
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,240
So he's saying like, maybe we are like the Sentinel Islands

1047
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,240
inhabitants and the aliens are like India.

1048
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,360
So how would we even know?

1050
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,160
Yeah, I could be mad.

1051
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,360
We assume that they would want to communicate with us.

1052
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,840
And there's always this thing in the UFO lore

1053
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,040
that all these visitations started

1054
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,560
after we detonated the nuclear weapons.

1055
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,320
That's where all this activity like started.

1056
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,320
So maybe, I don't know, I want to believe.

1057
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,880
Part of me believes, but if it's really like a cover-up,

1058
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,680
I think like Musk would be the first one to,

1059
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,240
I mean, he has satellites going around here.

1060
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,400
He would know, he would say something.

1061
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,880
Right, I think that there is a,

1062
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
there are definitely, I've read this,

1063
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,480
and these aren't really like conspiracy theory or anything,

1064
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,640
but there are like discoveries in astrology.

1065
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,200
Astrophysics, yeah, astrology.

1066
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,040
Or, you know, just physics in general

1067
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,360
that we figured out that maybe there's some...

1068
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Astrophysics?

1069
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,080
Astrophysics. Astrology is something different.

1070
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah, the wrong word, man.

1071
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,120
That's a MBTI shit.

1072
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,080
Anyway, so there were some discoveries

1073
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,560
that implied that maybe we're being watched

1074
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,600
by some other civilization.

1075
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,160
You know, there was a book before,

1076
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,320
we talked about this before the three body problem,

1077
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,080
like how they found out that the aliens are watching

1078
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,160
was that they conduct the experiment with no observer.

1079
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,480
And according to quantum mechanics,

1080
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,120
you know, when you don't have observer,

1081
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,040
they behave like waves.

1082
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,120
And then they found out, it's like,

1083
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,680
why are these particles behaving like particles?

1084
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,520
Somebody's watching.

1085
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,800
And then that set up the actual stage

1086
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,720
for what happened during the three body problems.

1087
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,640
Like, oh yeah, there are aliens watching us.

1088
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,200
But there are discoveries like that.

1089
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,760
The author didn't make it happen out of the blue.

1090
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,520
But I would say that I wanna believe that,

1091
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,000
you know, some other galaxies that they discovered

1092
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,320
a lot of things that we just aren't capable

1093
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,840
of even contemplate yet.

1094
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,920
And they may be watching us.

1095
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,640
And it's so amazing to think about it.

1096
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,760
Like, you know, because we know that, you know,

1097
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,640
at least maybe like tens of a thousand light years

1098
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,800
around us, there is no civilization found.

1099
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
We have found zero evidence.

1100
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,880
So which means that if there's a civilization watching us,

1101
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,880
that's like, you know, millions or even more than that,

1102
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,080
like thousands of millions of light years away.

1103
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,120
They're watching us as like,

1104
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,960
what they're watching like dinosaurs right now.

1105
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,960
Oh, okay.

1106
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,680
You know, they're like, oh, these are dinosaurs.

1107
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,800
Like, but if imagine a civilization

1108
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,720
that can watch us live,

1109
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,440
that they're also watching this podcast

1110
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,960
for some reason, like these two idiots

1111
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,000
are talking about us right now.

1112
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,840
Hey, let's go.

1113
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,680
Mom, come on, come on.

1114
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,520
They're breaking the code.

1115
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Yeah, yeah, but that means that they've figured out

1116
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,880
a space time to such level

1117
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,200
they can literally see into the future in a HD,

1118
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,520
you know, in a 4K definition, basically.

1119
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,480
That's crazy.

1120
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,720
Yeah, but okay, at the end of the day,

1121
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,560
we're always applying our understanding of science

1122
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,320
that they operate on the same basis.

1123
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,440
Yeah.

1124
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,920
The best alien movie I've found.

1125
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,760
Number one.

1126
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,600
Mars Attacks.

1127
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,520
Mars Attacks.

1128
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,360
No, fifth elements, man.

1129
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,200
Fifth elements.

1130
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,040
I thought that was pretty damn good movie.

1131
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,240
In terms of space opera is like, yeah.

1132
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,840
And arrival, like arrival and annihilation,

1133
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,480
these two films are, you know,

1134
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
like the aliens won't behave like us.

1135
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
And arrival, they just like, yo, we can't even talk.

1136
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,840
You know, we, our language are so complex.

1137
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,120
Like, give it up, man.

1138
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,960
Like, go away.

1139
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,920
Arrival is out there.

1140
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,960
Definitely the best one out there.

1141
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,800
Yeah, exactly.

1142
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,760
But for guilty pleasure, fifth element, you know.

1143
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,880
Yeah, it's a good one.

1144
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,560
It's, I mean, 90s schlock, but it's a good movie.

1145
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,400
It's good.

1146
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,880
And also, you know, back to the Eric,

1147
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,240
what he was saying is like, I was so surprised

1148
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,200
like an actual scientist that went that far too.

1149
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,680
Yeah, he gave it some legitimacy

1150
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,360
by him going into the field and investigating.

1151
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,120
That's what I liked.

1152
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,640
I was hoping he's going to come.

1153
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
I was like, oh, Weinstein is on Rogan.

1154
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,640
Let's go.

1155
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,240
Disclosure is coming.

1156
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,280
He's going to say something.

1157
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,760
And then he's like, nah, there is no real evidence.

1158
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,800
But if he had one point he said,

1159
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
if the aliens were here,

1160
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,120
I would be the only person to understand

1161
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,560
how they got to here.

1162
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,120
Yeah, I remember that.

1163
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,760
I'm like, wow, that's a,

1164
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,880
wow, that's American confidence right there, man.

1165
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,600
Like, okay, let's continue.

1166
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,320
What did I want to say?

1167
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,160
Yeah.

1168
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,800
What Weinstein has one of these ideas

1169
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,840
of also one of the things I like about him,

1170
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,800
the idea he calls it,

1171
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,480
he always makes up these terms,

1172
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,440
the idea of managed reality.

1173
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,000
And by that, he means that those

1174
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,040
in the highest positions of power

1175
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,520
are actively deceiving the general public

1176
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,800
regarding the most crucial aspects of society.

1177
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,360
And by that, biology, science, economics, politics,

1178
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,480
journalism, global warming,

1179
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,760
anything you can come up with.

1180
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,600
So, and again, he has these analogies,

1181
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,320
which I really love about him.

1182
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,680
He really paints a picture.

1183
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,320
He likened this situation as a,

1184
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,040
he said this on Chris's podcast, the last one,

1185
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,400
as a tanker that flipped over on a highway.

1186
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,520
It's burning, the chemicals are coming out,

1187
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,080
there are dead bodies left and right.

1188
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,280
The police or the government is standing there

1189
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,040
and saying, nothing to see here, just move along.

1190
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
And I guess by that,

1191
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,440
That's a powerful example.

1192
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,000
It's a powerful example, it is, it is.

1193
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,520
And there's a lot of, like for us,

1194
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,600
there's a lot of evidence that points to the contrary.

1195
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,600
And, but people are being encouraged to ignore the truth

1196
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,000
and to not only that,

1197
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,080
but also to put down those who dare to question things,

1198
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,080
branding them, grifters, charlatans, conspiracy theorists.

1199
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,320
And we've seen that a lot in the last 10 years, I think.

1200
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,760
Yeah, that's a, I'm glad that he brought it up

1201
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,320
because for one, where we're at,

1202
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,160
that's a freaking perfect example of what's going on

1203
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,480
during the COVID three years,

1204
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,640
why we're still doing those tests and all that.

1205
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,080
But it's everywhere, isn't it?

1206
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,920
Is it not?

1207
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,800
It's not, no, it is everywhere.

1208
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,680
It's like, especially in the West, right?

1209
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,520
What do you think that, in your opinion,

1210
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,040
it's like, give us an example,

1211
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,240
like where you feel like your reality is being managed

1212
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,800
and you found out it's actually managed,

1213
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,120
reality is not real?

1214
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,600
Like back home, there's an open secret

1215
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,200
that our government has been stealing the elections

1216
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,680
for the last 10 years.

1217
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,960
Everyone you ask, nobody is voting for them.

1218
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,360
And every time the elections come around,

1219
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,600
they win the elections.

1220
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,680
So that's for one.

1221
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,240
In terms of, I mean, we operate,

1222
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,640
we deal with very existential problems back home,

1223
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,400
but what's going on in the West

1224
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,520
has started spilling over all over the planet.

1225
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,160
So like biology, for example,

1226
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,080
what they're saying now about men and women,

1227
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,920
they're rewriting history, global warming,

1228
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,040
it's happening, it's not happening.

1229
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,840
You have the money, you have the funds,

1230
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,600
get a group of scientists, make a consensus, sit down,

1231
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,240
is it happening or is it not happening?

1232
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,600
Why do we have to debate this all over and over again?

1233
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,480
There's a lot of these topics that we are constantly debating,

1234
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,920
is it or is it not?

1235
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,040
Right, right, sure.

1236
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,800
Same as with these aliens, okay, now I'm going out there,

1237
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,040
you know, it doesn't really affect me,

1238
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,800
but like example from back home would be this.

1239
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:50,080
I think that the, how am I gonna put this?

1240
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,440
So you have basically a mega industry on the planet

1241
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,680
that their entire profit came from

1242
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,080
making people arguing against each other.

1243
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,560
That's why, you know, racism is a great example.

1244
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,840
I think that America could have solved racism

1245
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,840
a long time ago, but they didn't.

1246
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,160
It's not because the Americans are full of like neo-Nazis

1247
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,560
that just believe that there are white superiority

1248
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,680
or all that bullshit, it's because when you have people

1249
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,800
that are debating on the national television,

1250
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,440
you got views, you can sell advertisement,

1251
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,880
it's like solving the issue will basically say

1252
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,560
that you can no longer make money in that way.

1253
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,400
And it's very similar to the wars, you know, conflicts,

1254
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,920
you know what I mean is like the,

1255
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,640
I had this opinion on, you know,

1256
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,400
we probably make more money by threatening,

1257
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,680
threatening the fucking island of unification

1258
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,760
than actually unify with them.

1259
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,320
You know, like Americans at the same time,

1260
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,080
it's like, but definitely more profitable

1261
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,200
that they keep spreading fear about like, you know,

1262
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,200
what we're gonna do, what the rush is gonna do.

1263
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,400
That's why it's like, we never solve anything.

1264
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,880
The same thing goes with the climate change, you know.

1265
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,840
You, do you feel it's actually kind of strange

1266
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,720
that the moment of Paris, you know,

1267
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,640
China and United States signed a Paris Accord

1268
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,120
to combat climate change, almost the next day

1269
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,360
we became the evilest country on the planet.

1270
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,720
Like we actually wanna do some solid policy change

1271
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,400
to promote green energy, renewable energy.

1272
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,000
You look at a Chinese street right now,

1273
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,400
it's like how many electronic cars,

1274
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,880
it's way more than any advanced economy on the planet.

1275
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,920
Yeah, people tend to think outside of China,

1276
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,640
that China is this big polluter.

1277
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,000
I mean, truth be told, you have a lot of factories

1278
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,400
and all this stuff, but when I travel China,

1279
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,080
I see these wind turbines everywhere.

1280
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,560
Like you said, electric cars left and right,

1281
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,640
more so than outside of China, so much more.

1282
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,640
We, they never talked about like in the, you know,

1283
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,840
2015, 2016 when we shut down all those like really,

1284
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,240
we call it the industrialization basically.

1285
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,600
We need to shut down a lot of those old ass factories

1286
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,560
so we can stop the pollution at the same time.

1287
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,560
We wanna cut back on our production capabilities

1288
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,800
because we're making goods that's so cheap

1289
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,720
that nobody is making or making money out of it.

1290
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,200
So, and then there were so much employment

1291
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,000
that the Chinese economy had to suffer through that.

1292
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,440
There's a reason that right now,

1293
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,080
if you order food on the internet,

1294
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,280
like it will be delivered in the fucking 10 minutes.

1295
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,400
It's because all these people, they're working on this

1296
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,960
and they can't find jobs in traditional

1297
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,120
and manufacturer sectors, right?

1298
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,000
So, you know, like when somebody actually tried

1299
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,480
to solve it, all of a sudden,

1300
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,000
because you were ending the debate,

1301
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,800
like in China, global warming is not a freaking debate.

1302
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,120
You know, and then you can't make money off of debates

1303
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,440
and arguing each other and then just like bringing

1304
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,080
out new perspectives and whatnot.

1305
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,520
And people hate you for that.

1306
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,240
Like people will literally hate you for that.

1307
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Like I think that the manager reality either,

1308
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,920
I think that it's not like, you know, how Eric described it,

1309
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,280
you know, there's just huge powerful people.

1310
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,280
They just try to, you know, push us away from the truth

1311
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,440
and then, you know, like turn us into mindless pigs,

1312
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
whatever.

1313
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,120
I think that the powerful people just want to make us feel

1314
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,920
confused all the time, you know, that's why.

1315
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,160
Like that's why a lot of people buy in propaganda.

1316
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,480
It's because it's easier to understand.

1317
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,200
And then if you don't listen to propagandas

1318
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,080
and you really want to pursue like what's real

1319
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,960
and what's actually in the real, like your brain

1320
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,840
will burn out like on a daily basis

1321
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,560
and nobody wants that, you know what I mean?

1322
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,400
I do.

1323
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,640
I don't think they are like some evil doers

1324
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,200
who have this new world government, you know,

1325
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,200
one world government, this apocalyptic ideas of the future,

1326
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,840
these big conspiracy theorists,

1327
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
but they're just sowing division

1328
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,040
and they're reaping the profits

1329
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,760
because division is they're monetizing our division.

1330
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,760
We are divided on every single issue.

1331
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,080
We are, I mean, all at the end of the day,

1332
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,160
also citizens of the world

1333
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,080
and we all participate in these conversations

1334
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,160
and every single question we are divided.

1335
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,160
And when you, this thing you mentioned,

1336
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,360
the global warming and this, I think this is also part

1337
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,880
of this Western self-righteous liberalism.

1338
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,840
Putin said it best, like you guys in the West,

1339
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,080
you have already industrialized,

1340
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,480
you've arrived in the future.

1341
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,920
It's like, tell Asian countries or African countries

1342
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,400
who are just starting the process

1343
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,400
of industrializing their nations to go green, like FU.

1344
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,120
Yeah, exactly.

1345
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,520
Like the African, like lithium mine, that's a perfect example.

1346
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,360
It's like in order for us to drive electronic cars,

1347
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,560
like how many Africans lives are being sacrificed

1348
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,600
on a fucking ritualistic level, you know,

1349
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,720
just to make sure that we have enough material

1350
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,000
to build a car batteries.

1351
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,040
Like this is hypocritical, man.

1352
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Hypocritical, they're all tweeting in the West

1353
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,600
from their phones, let's go green.

1354
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,480
This dash, hashtag, that, but somebody is dying

1355
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,560
in Africa mining that coal belt or whatever it is in,

1356
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:26,080
you know, buy a Starbucks coffee, tax,

1357
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,040
I don't know, half a dollar goes to this cause

1358
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,520
and then you feel good about yourself.

1359
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,520
You can go and protest and whatnot.

1360
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,160
But also the thing you asked me about,

1361
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,960
where do I see this playing out, this managed reality?

1362
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:42,960
Also with the news, I think most, I see it there.

1363
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,280
There are, there's no, I mean, journalistic integrity,

1364
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,120
like what, journalistic, what went out the window?

1365
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,120
I mean, it's obvious when you go,

1366
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,000
like you can go on these apps like Telegram

1367
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,360
and you know, these dark web apps

1368
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,920
and you can see news that you can't see on legacy media,

1369
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,800
not even legacy that you can maybe even see

1370
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,240
on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube.

1371
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,560
Like we are, I do believe, I don't think,

1372
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,000
and I personally don't think Eric was implying

1373
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,160
that they're like these evil doers that are controlling,

1374
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
but we are being deceived or at least we are being

1375
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,840
conditioned or trained not to think,

1376
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,120
not to question too much.

1377
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,440
There's a lot of things that are happening that are absurd.

1378
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,320
I think that's the main point.

1379
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,400
Yeah.

1380
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,200
You know, don't ask question.

1381
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,600
There's nothing, just move along, you know.

1382
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,360
Just move along while somebody is profiting.

1383
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,360
I personally feel like, you know, for one,

1384
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,680
the legacy media, the news are just so freaking

1385
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,040
narrative-driven, which is something that Eric also talked

1386
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,800
about, the narrative-driven media

1387
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,600
and also the narrative-driven academics.

1388
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,840
It's like you have this built-in story

1389
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,880
that you wanna promote or you wanna spread

1390
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,280
and then you find evidence that fits

1391
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,600
that particular narrative.

1392
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,200
For one, the legacy media is definitely,

1393
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,520
I still have subscriptions to some pretty major news media,

1394
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,560
like New York Times.

1395
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,320
I just read the title.

1396
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,160
I don't wanna read the freaking commentary on that.

1397
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,800
It's like absolutely garbage.

1398
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,000
And then you have the underground news.

1399
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,080
And underground news sometimes is like so fucking

1400
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,080
mind-boggling, stupid, conspiracy, theory-filled,

1401
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,840
you know, successful.

1402
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,720
Have you heard of ground news?

1403
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,680
Yeah, I'm using it.

1404
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,520
Are you using it?

1405
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,360
Yeah.

1406
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,400
Is it good?

1407
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,360
It's a little bit overwhelming.

1408
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,680
It gets a little bit repetitive

1409
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,640
because they try to, it's not a news agency,

1410
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,000
but it's sort of like a combinator.

1411
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,120
You know, you combine all the news agency,

1412
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,360
what he said, what he said together

1413
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,640
and you make your own calls.

1414
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,160
Be very careful of what you set up,

1415
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,080
you're interested in it.

1416
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,200
Cause like I accidentally set an election

1417
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,600
and my entire front page is all about like fucking election.

1418
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,160
I don't really care about this anymore,

1419
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,000
but in terms of bias,

1420
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,600
they have a bias meter on it.

1421
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,360
So you can tell us like, okay, this is-

1422
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,960
Who's reporting more?

1423
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,800
Okay.

1424
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,720
And this managed reality.

1425
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,160
Also we talked about it last time

1426
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,560
about the war in Ukraine.

1427
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,240
That seems like a very managed picture

1428
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,840
of what's really going on.

1429
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,520
Obviously being sold a narrative.

1430
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,160
Very obviously.

1431
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,560
I think that, like I said last time,

1432
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,920
it's like there's no way that according to the West,

1433
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,280
if Russia has lost that much manpower,

1434
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,240
it's still going.

1435
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,680
Like there's no way.

1436
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,200
It's not China that we were talking about.

1437
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,680
Like Russia doesn't have a lot of people, right?

1438
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,800
So yeah, there's a-

1439
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,560
During the Chris Williamson podcast,

1440
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,480
maybe you know something about this.

1441
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,320
He was talking about some CPI question.

1442
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,800
Right.

1443
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,640
Yeah.

1444
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,080
The Eric was attacking how the brew of liver statistics

1445
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,680
manipulate a CPI number.

1446
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,760
What does it stand for?

1447
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,720
Consumer?

1448
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,040
Consumer price index.

1449
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,440
What it represents is that it take a basket of goods

1450
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,480
and services that you will,

1451
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,880
an average consumer would consume,

1452
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,000
and take a look at the price level,

1453
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,840
and then compare this price level after a period of time,

1454
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,360
and then see like the percentage rise or decrease.

1455
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,560
So if it's a positive number,

1456
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,640
it means it's inflation,

1457
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,000
and the negative number is the deflation.

1458
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,640
That's how I learned from my college years.

1459
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,400
And what Eric basically said is that they created

1460
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,400
a inflation number to fit a specific political interest.

1461
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,960
And I found that,

1462
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,800
man, it's so hard to believe that.

1463
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,760
It's really difficult to believe that.

1464
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,680
Because if that's the case,

1465
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,920
you will see that CPI doesn't correlate

1466
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,880
with other economic indicators,

1467
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,760
unless they fix like everything, right?

1468
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,360
And I would say in terms of number fixing,

1469
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,360
like the Americans are not as good as us.

1470
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,880
Like we can make our economic scoresheet like box score

1471
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,240
like perfect, right?

1472
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,480
But I don't think that he,

1473
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,960
I don't know what he meant that he said like,

1474
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,120
the CPI number is wrong.

1475
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,440
You know, like that's the part is like,

1476
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,960
he didn't elaborate on this.

1477
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,640
He didn't give out his own understanding about it.

1478
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,680
Like what he thought should be the right formula.

1479
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,000
He just said like the Federal Reserve

1480
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,240
and then there was just, you know,

1481
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,560
this star chamber people,

1482
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,160
they're just fixing all these numbers.

1483
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,680
I'm like, all right, cool.

1484
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,480
Speaking of Federal Reserve and money,

1485
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,360
and again, going back a little bit,

1486
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,200
if you don't mind to this managed reality thing.

1487
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,840
Like when people mention UBI,

1488
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,600
this Universal Basic Income,

1489
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,400
and how much poverty we have in the world today,

1490
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,120
when people talk about that, you know,

1491
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:17,200
it's met with like, you guys are utopians, you know,

1492
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,120
this is like next level socialism,

1493
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,120
you know, that this is not gonna happen.

1494
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,600
But when you look at like when these,

1495
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,320
we talked about the financial,

1496
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,240
you know, the crashes that happened in 2007

1497
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,600
and now at the beginning of this decade.

1498
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,680
And every time this happens,

1499
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,240
like I know it happened in Europe,

1500
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,040
especially in the United States,

1501
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,240
every time they build them out,

1502
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,760
they print trillions of dollars every single time.

1503
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,880
So what I'm trying to say,

1504
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,200
like how do they have money for this all the time,

1505
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,560
but they don't have money to fix

1506
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,080
like these real world problems

1507
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,920
that we all, you know, suffer from?

1508
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,440
Yeah, the idea of printing money,

1509
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,280
that's from, that's a Keyesian economic approach.

1510
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,880
Like that's what the United States did.

1511
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,160
What economic approach?

1512
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,800
So I forgot his first name,

1513
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,680
but his last name is Kane's.

1514
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,320
He's a very famous economist

1515
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,600
in during the Great Depression.

1516
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,040
Stateside?

1517
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,640
I think he's from UK, he's from UK.

1518
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,120
Like UK were, same thing as Eric said,

1519
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,800
like UK people should feel more proud.

1520
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,460
Like they did something pretty amazing.

1521
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:34,840
But in economics back then, they had this, you know,

1522
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,920
they had this blind belief, this credility,

1523
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,520
of, you know, if you let the free market run,

1524
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,240
it will solve all the problems itself.

1525
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,160
So you don't have to interfere.

1526
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,240
The government doesn't have to do anything.

1527
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,240
And that's basically fundamental belief

1528
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,520
of all the right wing people,

1529
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,040
like who believe in the smaller government

1530
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,320
because the market will sell for the sell file.

1531
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,160
But during the Great Depression,

1532
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,920
we found out that no, the market won't sell.

1533
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,960
Like there's market failure, you know,

1534
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,720
like there are, you can produce so much goods

1535
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,480
to the point that nobody's consuming

1536
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,120
and it created deflation.

1537
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,200
And deflation is very, very dangerous

1538
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,080
to modern economy, like to any country.

1539
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,800
Like we think the Zimbabwe is bad

1540
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,360
because they had a hyperinflation.

1541
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,200
So did we?

1542
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,040
Yeah, yeah, so.

1543
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,880
So did we?

1544
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,680
Yeah, but if you compare that to what happened in Japan,

1545
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,520
the longevity of the crisis, it's like hyperinflation,

1546
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,280
it's relatively easy to stop,

1547
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,880
but like deflation, you can't really stop it.

1548
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,360
So they're afraid of that.

1549
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,160
So that's why they're printing money.

1550
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,080
But contrary to a lot of people's belief

1551
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,520
that they're just printing cash out there,

1552
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,800
what they're believing is that if you increase people's

1553
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,360
spending and then just lower the interest rate,

1554
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,160
you will, it will stimulus the economy

1555
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,520
and then make it back to, you know,

1556
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,640
if you give people more money,

1557
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,840
they will like to spend on something.

1558
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,600
And then, you know, it's stabilized the price level.

1559
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,520
What you don't wanna see is that you're sitting

1560
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,760
on a bunch of cash and its value is actually increasing.

1561
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,440
That's what deflation means.

1562
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,840
It's actually very horrible.

1563
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,360
Like that's what China is going through right now.

1564
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,720
So if like every day,

1565
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,200
like me and my wife, we talked about this,

1566
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,200
it's like every time we see a nice restaurant

1567
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,000
and a very expensive,

1568
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,360
we are not going to spend money to that restaurant.

1569
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,120
We're just gonna wait it out

1570
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,040
until like eventually that restaurant has zero customers,

1571
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,360
it will drop down some discount

1572
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,720
and then we'll just go eat there.

1573
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,320
But in terms of the restaurant's,

1574
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,760
from the restaurant's perspective,

1575
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,080
it's absolutely horrible.

1576
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,360
So deflation is definitely more scarier.

1577
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,960
It's much scarier than the inflation.

1578
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,600
That's why they print money all the time.

1579
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,920
Like I don't agree on,

1580
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,920
but the thing I don't agree is that

1581
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,440
I'm all for you bailed out the banks,

1582
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,120
but you still need to hold those bankers accountable

1583
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,960
afterwards.

1584
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,920
Like we solve your problem now,

1585
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,480
here's somebody who got to go to jail.

1586
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,440
Like whatever you guys did was wrong.

1587
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,280
It was a fraud.

1588
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,840
Like what happened in 2007?

1589
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,680
It was just-

1590
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,920
I think like two people went to jail maybe.

1591
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,520
Yeah, it's just two or three people went to jail

1592
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
and all these bankers,

1593
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,800
they walk off with all these like big ass bonuses.

1594
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,120
I thought that was absolutely wrong.

1595
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,360
Like that set us example so bad that,

1596
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,480
you know, now I thought about it,

1597
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,960
I think the America lost,

1598
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,080
I would say 60% of its credibility internationally,

1599
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,800
based solely based on how they reacted in the 2007.

1600
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,000
And then now we're just dealing

1601
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,240
with the repercussions really.

1602
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,520
Like everything on the planet is like,

1603
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,360
if you think about it,

1604
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,160
it's just dealing with the repercussions of 2007.

1605
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,560
It has such a strong ripples in the history

1606
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,760
that it's just like, you know,

1607
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,680
I think that was probably one of the reasons

1608
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,520
to why all these elites want to make us stupid

1609
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,440
and don't think about this.

1610
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,600
Cause like how are you going to get away with this, man?

1611
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,400
Like seriously, like you have all these money

1612
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,680
all these people that made so much money illegally

1613
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,160
and they can walk away from this.

1614
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,560
And then you call it a moral hazard.

1615
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,800
I'm like, bro, like, look,

1616
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,160
if there's a famine and the people on the streets

1617
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,280
are eating each other,

1618
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,800
like because they have to survive,

1619
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,120
like I would want to call that a moral hazard.

1620
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,600
You got a group of the most well-educated people

1621
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,760
on the fucking planet made some conscious decision

1622
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,480
to exploit people.

1623
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,720
That's not a moral hazard.

1624
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,640
It's not just illegal.

1625
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,480
That's like,

1626
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,080
you know.

1627
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,880
So speaking of Eric verdict,

1628
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,720
verdict, what's your opinion of him overall?

1629
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm going to pull Eric card.

1630
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,320
Like, what do you think?

1631
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,480
Nice. Okay.

1632
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,480
Well, the most frequent criticism I've heard of him

1633
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,280
is that he holds a very high opinion of himself.

1634
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,720
On several podcasts, I've heard him say,

1635
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,960
I've heard him mention that within his own family,

1636
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,680
there are like two or three Nobel winning ideas.

1637
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,680
I've even heard him entertain thoughts

1638
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,520
of running the government by himself.

1639
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,760
People say that he talks in circles,

1640
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,360
that he has an answer for everything.

1641
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,920
I also once, the only thing I think they might,

1642
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,320
they didn't really, I'm nitpicking here,

1643
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,200
but since we're talking,

1644
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,720
the way he responded to comments made by Tim Dillon,

1645
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,000
which was, which were obviously intended as a joke.

1646
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,840
Remember that?

1647
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,760
Tim Dillon said like, you know,

1648
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,280
people always say Eric Weinstein is, you know, so smart.

1649
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,320
What has he ever invented?

1650
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,200
What did he ever do, you know?

1651
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,760
And he was a guest on Rogan after that,

1652
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,880
and he really kind of embarrassed himself in his reaction.

1653
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,920
He went hard on Tim Dillon, right?

1654
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,880
Yeah, he really took it seriously, took it to heart.

1655
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,880
But disregarding all of that, similar to Peterson,

1656
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,400
what I, the thing I like the most about Weinstein

1657
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,960
is his sense of urgency when he talks about

1658
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,760
these critical issues over time,

1659
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,840
particularly the failure of institutions.

1660
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,880
That's what I really like.

1661
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880
I also, I highly, I told you this many times,

1662
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,080
I highly admire his eloquence, his intellect,

1663
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:37,000
his ability to not only to talk about,

1664
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,560
but also to communicate these big ideas.

1665
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,160
In terms of this physics stuff and science,

1666
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,840
I think he really has a visionary mind.

1667
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,440
He's consistently thinking outside the box on all topics.

1668
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,120
And his passion for physics has brought up,

1669
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,960
has sparked an interest in me.

1670
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,280
Like I told you, I've been watching these physics podcasts

1671
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,920
even though I don't understand anything, but...

1672
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,240
It's so intriguing though.

1673
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1674
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,080
They all have like amazing visuals all the time.

1675
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,280
They do.

1676
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,960
I think he will be well remembered in history,

1677
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,440
even if nothing comes off of this geometric unity.

1678
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,440
I think, you know, people like him are needed.

1679
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:25,000
I don't think, I mean, he pulled away when he was kind of getting

1680
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
not too big, but too loud in his criticisms of many things.

1681
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,800
So I admire him for that as well.

1682
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,200
And from where I'm sitting is just my subjective point of view.

1683
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,720
I'm nobody to talk on this, but from where I'm sitting,

1684
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,320
he, to me, he seems like one of the smartest people

1685
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,160
in the world.

1686
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,120
I think that I agree with you.

1687
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,840
Like, do you feel like personally that he's, you know,

1688
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,160
he really thinks we're very high off of himself?

1689
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,320
Do you got an impression from him?

1690
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,320
I do, but do you think like if Einstein was alive today

1691
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,720
and he went...

1692
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,800
Bro, that would be amazing.

1693
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,440
We see Einstein on the podcast.

1694
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,640
If we had the opportunity to see hours and hours

1695
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,280
of Einstein talking, we can only see,

1696
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,360
I think maybe there's only a few short videos of Einstein.

1697
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,360
There's, you know, books and articles, but I'm pretty sure

1698
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,480
we would say he's full of himself.

1699
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,320
Yeah.

1700
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,360
How can you not be?

1701
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,400
Exactly.

1702
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,640
I feel like it's a necessary flaw to have.

1703
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,480
Yeah.

1704
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,040
Expose yourself like that in the public.

1705
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,840
All the artists, sorry for interrupting.

1706
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,920
When we look at all these, that we had the opportunity,

1707
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,320
now we have recordings and now in the modern age

1708
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,680
of these artists, like musicians,

1709
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,080
and they're all full of themselves.

1710
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1711
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,280
I think one goes with the other.

1712
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,640
I was, I had the same impression.

1713
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,520
And also I think that kind of contradicts

1714
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,240
to what he said about the exclusivity,

1715
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,640
the necessary exclusivity of academia.

1716
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,880
I think that what exactly are you doing right now

1717
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,080
is attracting a lot of unqualified people to the academia.

1718
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,120
You know, academia for me always has been this kind

1719
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,680
behind the door, like very secretive type of,

1720
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,160
you know, society.

1721
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,040
It requires a lot of intellect

1722
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,960
and a lot of time and effort to set a step into this.

1723
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,160
It's not that, you know,

1724
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,600
but at the same time, it's like,

1725
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,000
I feel like he set a lot of good examples

1726
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,560
on how we should approach various,

1727
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,240
very controversial issues.

1728
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,160
Like I was summing it up with this one thing

1729
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,000
that he talked about.

1730
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,520
It's about the gender issue.

1731
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,320
And he didn't go as like, you know,

1732
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,280
oh, there are only two gender issues.

1733
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,120
Yes, yes.

1734
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,360
He actually find a very solid middle ground.

1735
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,360
It's like the nature before binary gender setups

1736
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,040
like male and female, like we're good,

1737
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,480
but they are all liars.

1738
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,520
You don't want those all liars to feel

1739
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,560
unloved and excluded from a society.

1740
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,520
I'm like, that's such a solid point.

1741
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,400
I think everybody can write it behind that.

1742
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,760
How difficult is it to come

1743
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,480
towards a common understanding on that level?

1744
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,880
It's not difficult to understand.

1745
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,760
We know that there are some people who are in a,

1746
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,480
they have, you know, they're the borderline problems.

1747
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,560
Like, you know, they're neither male or female, like.

1748
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,400
Asexual.

1749
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,120
Asexual, like we know they exist.

1750
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,720
You know, we know that somebody has gendered.

1751
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,560
Dysphoria.

1752
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,600
Dysphoria.

1753
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,480
So like the way he, the way he elaborate his ideas

1754
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,080
on that particular issue is just such amazing.

1755
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,840
With understanding and compassion.

1756
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,600
With understanding and compassion.

1757
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,840
And also he didn't compromise his scientific understanding

1758
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,160
about the issue.

1759
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,280
You know, he didn't go ultra like, you know,

1760
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,840
Jordan Peterson on Chris Williamson's ass.

1761
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,920
Like, I wish like, at least on that aspect,

1762
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,120
I definitely hope that more, you know, intellectuals

1763
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,040
or scientists can be more Eric.

1764
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,400
Like we can, we can handle.

1765
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,320
Like if you were just like appear to be a very egoistic,

1766
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,720
like, yeah, we, yeah, sure.

1767
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,560
Why not?

1768
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,920
You know, I feel like Kanye West already set the bar,

1769
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,920
like really, really, really,

1770
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,720
appropriate so far as to accept those figures.

1771
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,200
But anyways, all right, man.

1772
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,520
All right.

1773
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,480
That was solid, man.

1774
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,640
Always.

1775
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,480
Nice.
