0	3600	The science cares about you no matter whether you love science or hate science.
3600	8200	As people come to understand the power of it, everyone's going to care.
8200	15000	What we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive of.
15000	19300	While many things stagnate, the unforgivable thing that's stagnated,
19300	24500	the singular unforgivable thing is our understanding of the most basic notion of who we are.
24500	32900	If we are going to, every time there's a border dispute, go to a thermonuclear standoff.
32900	37500	It's just Russian roulette with smaller and smaller numbers of empty chambers.
37500	40500	These are the precursors of genocide, make no mistake.
40500	44200	You're friendly college students with blue hair chanting from the river to the sea
44200	46900	or talking about the deaths of people.
46900	48400	People will hear that and they'll say,
48400	51700	Oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust and fear.
52300	53300	I'm a pastor.
53300	54900	Shoot the messenger all you want.
59900	60600	All right.
60600	61200	All right.
61200	62000	Welcome back.
62000	62800	Welcome back.
62800	65300	Hello, my fellow CCP member.
65300	67500	CCP member is male, but I sponsor money.
67500	69100	It's fucking sweet, bro.
69100	70400	What's up, comrade?
70400	72100	What's up, comrades?
72100	72800	That's right.
72800	73900	Okay, let's get into it.
73900	78700	Let's jump straight in.
78700	82600	Let's give a little background on the on the subject of today's episode.
82600	83000	Sure.
83000	85200	Big favorite of mine.
85200	96500	Mr. Eric Weinstein, Los Angeles, Los Angeles born a mathematician specializing in mathematical physics.
96500	105500	Also an economist, a commentator, gained prominence as a managing director of teal capital.
105500	110800	Investment firm founded by Peter teal, who we mentioned a few times already.
110800	117200	Additionally, he's known for his involvement in the intellectual dark web.
117200	123200	And he's been featured on various podcasts and platforms discussing topics,
123200	127400	ranging from economics and science to culture and politics.
127400	135200	So where does your introduction to Mr. Eric Weinstein start?
135200	137500	Random short clips from Joe Rogan experience.
137500	138400	That's for one.
138400	146700	Secondly, he made a lot of interesting comments, including the, you know, in in those podcasts,
146700	152500	including the one that we watched with Clint about Chris Williamson about, you know, the virus.
152500	156300	Yeah, that was I found out that was very interesting.
156300	160600	Overall, like also he started the proto, proto.
160600	162100	A podcast, right?
162100	164000	But I think that's no longer available.
164000	165400	Yeah, it's defunct.
165400	166600	It's just on hold.
166600	167900	It's been on hold for a while.
167900	170300	The portal, the portal, the portal.
170300	171500	Yeah, they they stopped.
171500	177800	I mean, they him, he stopped doing it just as the epidemic was gathering speed because
177800	181200	Brett was his brother, Brett Weinstein.
181200	183300	He was running his mouth a lot.
183300	190800	I think he was actually the biggest advocates for the lot for the dangers of, you know,
190800	194000	against the response of the for the pandemic.
194000	198800	And he got not canceled, but he kind of his channel got demonetized.
198800	200300	So Eric stopped.
200300	203000	I think he only did 20 or 30 episodes.
203000	204100	Have you seen any?
204100	205400	Oh, no, I haven't.
205400	207300	But I just know they exist.
207300	208600	Yeah, it's it's still on.
208600	210000	You can still see it.
210000	211900	It's less than 30 episodes.
211900	215700	Very good podcast, maybe even the best one I've ever seen.
215700	216100	Right.
216100	222300	Great guests, the usual bunch and some new faces that I haven't seen anywhere else.
222300	226400	It's movie directors, sports personalities, porn stars.
226400	227000	Oh, nice.
227000	228500	Riley Reid.
228500	233900	Oh, she she was on there and Riley Reid was a she's fairly new, right?
233900	236400	Or is she like our cheaped milk status already?
236400	241000	She she's she's young.
241000	243400	I know that she's not a mouth yet.
243400	245600	Don't ask me how I know.
245600	248700	But I'm familiar with her work.
248700	249700	Nice.
249700	250700	Yeah, me as well.
250700	256400	I think I first saw him on on on Rogan and on the Rubin report.
256400	257900	They were podcast.
257900	263800	I think he was the first time I saw he was there on with Peterson.
263800	269700	I think it's the first time I saw Peterson listening to somebody like giving them their full attention.
269700	271300	Who is this guy?
271300	273700	And then later on, I saw him on on Lex.
273700	276400	He's been on Lex like five, four, five times now.
276400	281600	That's where I really got into him and recently on Chris Williams and podcast.
281600	282600	Very, very good.
282600	286000	Very excellent, excellent conversations.
286000	289000	I like the fact that, you know, how we introduced him.
289000	293000	We introduced him in a style as if like he's right here with us.
293000	295400	Of course, he's you know, Eric, we all good.
295400	301100	Yeah, I was like, he doesn't want people to know that he come to China.
301100	304800	Anyways, that's a so what's a what's a dark?
304800	309200	Internet, internet, the intellectual dark web, intellectual dark web.
309200	310200	Okay.
310200	317900	Intellectual dark web was first jokingly coined by Weinstein himself in the mid 2010s.
317900	325840	But the term became popular after after an article opinion piece was published in the
325840	332280	New York Times by staff by correction by then staff editor Barry Weiss in the New York
332280	336540	Times titled meet the renegades of the intellectual dark web.
336540	342060	So the the term itself, it's, it's supposed to describe the group of intellectuals or
342060	351340	commentators that oppose ideas such as identity politics, political correctness and cancel
351340	356880	culture in higher education and news media across Western countries.
356880	364400	They are just famous for discussing ideas that are outside mainstream mainstream discourse.
364400	368000	So who do you know from the intellectual dark web?
368000	370080	Can you guess who's in it?
370080	375600	I would say like, I don't know if anybody I don't know for sure if somebody's in it,
375600	379280	but I can guess like, I mean, it's not like a real club.
379280	382340	It was just a group of a group of people.
382340	384780	I probably think like Chijic is probably in it.
384780	385780	No.
385780	386780	No, not Chijic.
386780	387780	All right.
387780	388780	Jordan Peterson.
388780	393140	Peterson is Sam Harrison, Sam Harris, right?
393140	398100	The Weinstein Brothers, the Weinstein Brothers, Ben Shapiro, Douglas Murray, Douglas Murray
398100	400100	are a few of these.
400100	401700	So the entire podcast podcast.
401700	402700	Exactly.
402700	403700	Exactly.
403700	404700	Exactly.
404700	405700	There's Christina Hoff summers.
405700	409020	I think she's a philosopher slash author.
409020	415920	Like I said, they were, they had in common what they were against, but some internal
415920	426000	and external factors, mainly the 2016 presidential U.S. presidential election and the COVID again,
426000	432000	correction, the response to the COVID-19 epidemic are said to have caused some internal fractures
432000	434200	within the group.
434200	439300	And some other stuff, because you have on one side, you have Sam Harris, who's a big
439300	445720	atheist in the same group with Peterson, who's a, you know, basically a Christian.
445720	448940	Basically a full blown Christian right now.
448940	454380	And I think they also, I think COVID was one of the breaking points for them, especially
454380	455380	with Sam Harris.
455380	461460	He really distanced himself from the Weinstein Brothers, from Brett mainly and criticized
461460	468040	him a lot him and both him and Rogan for what they did during the pandemic.
468040	474600	And also they disagree, I think on free speech as well, on the levels of free speech, you
474600	479720	have the Weinstein Brothers who are not like free speech absolutists where you have Rogan
479720	483080	and let's say, especially Ben Shapiro, who really are.
483080	486200	So there's like a lot of, I mean, the gang fell apart.
486200	487200	Yeah.
487200	488200	Yeah.
488200	489200	Yeah.
489200	490200	Yeah.
490200	491200	Yeah.
491200	492880	They got popularized like that.
492880	500900	And if you think about it for the past, I would say the past five to eight years.
500900	502740	I think Joe Rogan put it very beautifully.
502740	506620	It's like we need to stop called mainstream media, mainstream media because they're not
506620	507620	big anymore.
507620	509420	They're corporate media right now.
509420	513020	Like everybody legacy media, the legacy media.
513020	514020	Exactly.
514020	520420	Now, more people are interested in what's going on on the internet and on the TV or
520420	522660	on the newspaper, on the magazines,
522660	525900	but for the past eight to five to eight years,
525900	527700	we see all these intellectuals,
527700	529740	they became like celebrities,
529740	531780	like they became like rock stars.
531780	533060	You know, they can go on tours,
533060	537340	they sell out stadiums and theaters to give out speech.
537340	540060	I think that's generally a good thing.
540060	542460	I would say it's like nothing against Taylor Swift
542460	545660	or Ariana Grande, but it's like, you know,
547300	549140	I know they make good music,
549140	550180	but at the same times,
550180	551900	like there are very important people
551900	553900	that are spreading these like very important ideas,
553900	556900	but they need, they finally gain that necessary,
556900	559140	you know, attention from the general public.
559140	561460	So I think it's a good thing overall.
561460	562860	And by the way, it's a,
562860	565260	since we touched on the COVID a lot, you know,
565260	569340	Eric Dina, Chris Williamson podcast, like he,
569340	571540	I think he was the first person that I heard
571540	573820	that brought up that the US sponsored
573820	577940	that the COVID research in Wuhan lab and then,
577940	580860	and he was asking the questions, like, did we started it?
580860	582940	Like, you know, that was the first person
582940	583900	that I heard like, you know,
583900	585780	a proper intellectual talking about that.
585780	589140	So yeah, that's a, that's another thing.
589140	592020	Yeah, like we did on that episode,
592020	593700	we did on the podcast.
593700	596380	I think you said it right that time,
596380	599740	like there's a hunger in the general public,
599740	603100	like you said a hunger for insights.
603100	606740	So yeah, they definitely provided that,
606740	608380	that this collective,
608380	611180	but I heard Rogan at one point saying,
611180	612980	talking disparagingly about it, you know,
612980	615060	it seemed like they were, when you,
615060	617860	when you say this IDW intellectual dark web,
617860	619340	it seemed like there were like some group
619340	621380	of superheroes or something.
621380	624540	Because that, that New York times piece that came out,
624540	627780	there was like, I saw like some,
627780	629860	some scanned versions on it online,
629860	633540	like a spread, they did this photo shoot really dramatic.
633540	635380	All of them like singled out,
635380	639660	like posing in front of some mysterious backdrops.
639660	643660	It's a nighttime with the stars in the nature desert.
643660	647580	It's, it's for, it's theoretical.
647580	649580	Yeah, very, very theatrical.
649580	653660	Yeah, but they fell apart even though I, like I said,
653660	657300	that the biggest one was Sam Harris distancing himself
657300	661260	due to the, because a lot of them supported Trump,
661260	662940	even though like we don't support Trump,
662940	666940	but you know, the lesser of two evils and paraphrasing.
666940	669260	So because of that, and because of COVID,
669260	673380	Brett and his wife, they have that dark horse podcast.
673380	675180	And during the pandemic,
675180	677900	they had, I think like bi-weekly episodes
677900	679740	for like a year and a half.
679740	681660	I mean, the podcast is still on,
681660	685900	but their whole content was putting down the,
685900	689180	I mean, the response to the pandemic should be told.
689180	694180	Both of them, I think by trade are evolutionary biologists.
694700	697220	So they kind of know what they're talking about in a way.
697220	699500	So what were they suggesting?
699500	701380	Like, you know, stop quarantining people.
701380	702220	Like stop.
702220	703220	Stop quarantining people.
703220	704060	Stop the lockdown.
704060	704900	The thing with the masks,
704900	708580	be upfront about the origins of COVID enough
708580	711460	with the lockdown, don't get vaccinated
711460	716220	because it's gonna produce some bad responses.
716220	717260	Right.
717260	718380	Lots of stuff.
718380	719660	Like really contrary.
719660	724180	And I'm not saying I'm not a doctor or a scientist.
724180	727740	There's some, obviously, there must be some truth, you know,
727740	732420	in what they said, I think they were proven right.
732420	735540	But at the time, I don't think they were helping
735540	736740	with the whole thing.
736740	739300	So they got demonetized very quick.
739300	741060	You know, two things about intellectuals.
741060	745580	The first of all, it's really difficult for them to form
745580	747740	sort of some sort of alliances, you know,
747740	749300	on every single aspect of it.
749300	750140	Exactly.
750140	751780	You know, because they're so smart, you know,
751780	753900	they look at everything issue by issue.
756420	758060	You know, when you are like that,
758060	761540	you became a very unreliable ally, right?
761540	764100	So that's an idea that I think Chris Williamson
764100	765780	first brought up.
765780	767100	At least that's the first time I heard it.
767100	772100	And the secondly is that because they value their thoughts
772460	776500	and truth a little bit too much.
776500	781500	So in a crisis like that, I'm pretty sure everybody,
781660	785220	the majority of them said whatever they feel like to say
785220	787100	for the betterment of the general public,
787100	789860	but the general public is not gonna take that
789860	791860	in a way that they hope they will take.
791860	796860	So, you know, I would understand like why they got
797340	800460	demonetized and why, you know, a lot of people seeing them
800500	802580	as like, you know, public enemies
802580	805780	or whatever intellectual enemies on that front, you know,
805780	807660	there's definitely a price you should pay
807660	809260	when you are that smart.
809260	813700	So yeah, there's a, but what I thought about the, you know,
813700	816300	this group of people, I think that, you know,
816300	819140	when I was doing a little bit of research on, you know,
819140	821660	all these podcast intellectuals, right?
821660	823500	The people that go on podcasts regularly,
823500	825660	they, you know, doing shows or,
826100	831100	they aren't necessarily the most welcome figures
833260	834980	in the academia.
834980	836340	That's what I found out.
836340	839700	You know, like a lot of people in the academia,
839700	840540	they are-
840540	841380	Like exiled from academia?
841380	842380	Yeah.
842380	844020	A lot of them that they're, you know, like,
844020	846100	I think Eric, one thing, one thing he talked about,
846100	849940	like he, something that happened between him and Harvard,
849940	851740	you know, a bread, obviously.
852700	855200	Jordan Peterson lost his tenure, like in lessons,
855200	856160	like all that shit.
856160	858760	Like, and then there were group,
858760	861840	the majority of the academia, like, you know,
862680	866480	the key opinion that they have is like,
866480	871040	they are famous for, they have this,
871040	874200	they gain the glamour by tackling some very controversial
874200	876360	issues, but when it comes down to
877360	879440	doing research in their field, they're like,
879440	882160	they're not that, you know, far head or whatever.
882160	884320	So there is definitely an idea of the renegades
884360	885920	versus the establishment.
887040	889960	It's weird that they were all united by one of the things
889960	891880	that they were united behind is, you know,
891880	894640	cancel culture within higher education.
894640	898440	And most, if not all of them ended up being exiled
898440	899280	from academia.
899280	900880	Exiled, exactly.
900880	901720	Maybe not,
903440	904360	what's his name?
906480	908720	The atheist, the new atheist, what's his name?
910000	911080	Didn't my-
911080	911920	Dawkins?
911920	912760	That's an old-
912760	913600	No, no, no.
913680	914520	Sam Harris, yeah.
914520	916080	Sam Harris, Sam Harris.
916080	918240	And I think I saw something,
919680	924680	do you remember this was just like before Trump,
924760	927000	maybe like a year or maybe the same year
927000	930520	that this term started gathering some speed,
930520	932200	this intellectual dark web?
932200	935000	Do you remember that interview that Sam Harris,
935000	938600	I think it was Bill Maher with Ben Affleck?
938600	939440	Have you seen that?
939440	940280	Oh yeah, I've seen it.
940280	942440	Like Ben Affleck went Batman mode on it.
942440	944320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was at that time.
944320	947720	He was a Muslim question.
947720	949880	Right, he was like,
951160	952840	I think he was accusing a lot of guys
952840	955760	on their shows like being Islamic phobic, you know?
955760	956600	Yeah, I know that.
956600	957600	What about it?
957600	959320	I think I just remembered that
959320	962920	because you know, that started at the same time as this.
962920	967240	Yeah, it's weird that they all got thrown together
967240	968760	in this-
968760	970320	I think a perfect counter example
970320	971680	would be Andrew Schuberman.
971680	975440	Like I don't think he's part of the dark web, right?
975440	979160	No, he's not, but I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up.
979160	983280	I mean, we can put him in the same pot with Gorgons.
983280	988200	There's probably a new batch of renegades.
988200	990200	We can call him intellectuals,
990200	994080	but like improvement gurus.
996560	999360	The all the information I found about Andrew
999360	1001200	is overwhelmingly positive.
1001200	1003360	Like both from the general public,
1003360	1006760	like how many we have the Andrew Schuberman husband now
1006760	1008080	and also from the academia.
1008080	1010800	Like he's a very solid researcher.
1012200	1014120	But at the same time, like he's very smart
1014120	1016800	that he never talked about any controversial issues.
1017920	1019200	And people are,
1019200	1021480	I know there are a lot of people are very eager
1021480	1025760	to sort of construct a trap for him
1025760	1027760	so that he will accidentally say something
1027760	1029640	that he wasn't planning on saying
1029640	1032920	so we can take him down or put him in one of those categories.
1032920	1034360	But so far, the guy's been smart.
1034360	1036320	Like he's been on top of his game.
1036320	1040080	So it just shows you he's like, yeah, that's a thing.
1040080	1041840	They bring you up and then they put you down.
1041840	1042680	Exactly.
1043360	1045320	I told you, I think he's,
1045320	1049640	we're gonna see him come out as a closeted Christian.
1049640	1050640	Like big time.
1050640	1051640	Right.
1051640	1053920	Do you feel like, you know, I got this feeling,
1053920	1055360	I don't know what you feel about it.
1055360	1058320	And I feel like Eric Weinstein
1058320	1061360	is just one of those smartest people on the planet
1061360	1063880	that his resume doesn't feel real to me.
1064840	1067880	Like I understand like you started off your academic career
1067880	1068760	with mathematics
1068760	1071680	and that's basically the universal language of science
1071680	1074280	so we can tap into all the fields.
1074280	1075120	I understand that.
1075120	1078080	But to become a theoretical physicist,
1078080	1082120	a mathematical physicist and economist at the same time,
1082120	1085600	that just like for me, it would be like Andrew Huberman
1085600	1086600	was a neurologist,
1086600	1088520	but at the same time, he's also a economist.
1088520	1091640	Like what, you know what I mean?
1091640	1093920	You should, the first episode of the portal
1093920	1097680	is Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.
1097680	1100880	That's the interview where I heard that
1100880	1102560	when you subtract all the screens,
1102560	1103600	where's the 99.
1103600	1106520	He brought a similar point in the Chris Williamson podcast.
1106520	1107360	You should look at that.
1107360	1109480	It's a great, great conversation.
1109480	1114120	He was, he was canceled as well by the left for being,
1114120	1116280	you know, accused of all these things,
1116280	1120240	you know, bigot and Nazi, even though he's a gay
1120240	1124600	and in the open gay, I mean, gay, homosexual,
1124600	1126320	but they put him down.
1126320	1127960	They found a way to put him down.
1127960	1129000	I mean, I don't think he cares.
1129000	1130040	He has the fuck you money.
1130040	1132320	So, and the credentials.
1132320	1135960	So I don't really think he's bothered too much about it.
1135960	1139320	Speaking of science, how did you,
1139320	1143520	how was your, what's your experience with physics
1143520	1146680	during your formative study years?
1146680	1148360	It was a, it was a mess.
1148360	1150600	Like I, the years I was there,
1151480	1156360	I think that the string theorists were doing the last push.
1156360	1158000	You know, that's when you see Brian Gray
1158000	1159960	and all those cock-cool.
1159960	1160960	Mitchell cock-cool.
1160960	1161800	Mitchell cock-cool.
1161800	1163560	Like all these professors, they were doing like
1163560	1165880	a lot of documentaries about string theories.
1165880	1167640	They were going on TED talks.
1167640	1169920	And then back then I was like, you know,
1169920	1172600	I thought it was just try to promote science.
1172600	1173800	But now I thought about it.
1173800	1176920	I think that definitely did it to gather more attention
1176920	1179120	and also try to grab more funds.
1180240	1183680	It was a mess because I remembered,
1183680	1186280	I talked with a lot of my schoolmates
1186280	1189640	from the physics department and they're not buying,
1189640	1192680	it was never part of the formal, you know,
1192680	1195080	education curriculum where like, you know,
1195080	1197720	you study general relativity and quantum physics
1197720	1199960	and then you have to learn a string theory.
1199960	1204320	It was a never, it was more of a thought experiment
1204320	1205160	for a lot of people.
1205160	1206880	Like they never took it very seriously.
1206880	1208040	Okay, I want to talk about that.
1208040	1210240	But what I meant, how did you,
1210240	1211800	did you have physics during your,
1211800	1213560	in high school here in China or?
1213560	1215200	Oh yeah, like since middle school.
1215200	1216200	Did you do well?
1216200	1218040	Yeah, pretty, pretty okay.
1218040	1219880	Man, I barely passed physics.
1219880	1220720	Really?
1220720	1223960	I clawed my way through high school in physics.
1223960	1228960	I had like all like these social sciences and languages.
1229960	1231480	History, geography, everything.
1231480	1234440	I was like a grade A student,
1234440	1238160	but like math and physics, barely a D.
1238160	1239280	I mean the equivalent,
1239280	1241600	a Serbian equivalent of a D.
1241600	1246600	I seriously, I crawled my way through those classes.
1247000	1248000	I mean, I was just,
1248000	1251440	I was thinking today if my professors
1251440	1254880	from high school and university could see me now
1255880	1258480	about to talk about string theory,
1258520	1260040	I would love to see their reaction.
1260040	1262560	Right, that's amazing.
1262560	1264920	It's like I had a,
1264920	1266800	I would say like a high school physics for me
1266800	1268600	was really tough.
1268600	1269960	Like I didn't do that well.
1269960	1272240	Like when I was in middle school, I did pretty okay.
1272240	1274360	But high school, the Chinese high school physics
1274360	1276640	is just full of like these pretty nuanced
1276640	1279620	and unnecessarily complicated problems
1279620	1280460	that you have to solve.
1280460	1283320	And then there's nothing interesting in there.
1284520	1286160	College, I think the Americans,
1286160	1287560	they don't teach that hard.
1289080	1292040	At least for public undergraduate studies,
1292040	1297000	but I always had an interest in the ideas in physics,
1297000	1300240	but I just don't want to turn myself into a physicist.
1300240	1303320	Like I feel like that's really, really, really stressful.
1304840	1308680	But yeah, like, but like things told to those guys,
1308680	1311920	like everybody was, you know, it's very cultivating, you know?
1311920	1314280	Do you think that we are like live amount
1314280	1316940	like 11 fucking strings around us like all the time?
1316980	1319140	That's crazy.
1319140	1324140	So I was, he always, Weinstein always talks about string theory.
1325140	1327820	Every time he shows up on a podcast or a lecture
1327820	1329140	or something.
1329140	1332540	So I've been rewatching and trying to figure out
1332540	1334540	what he's saying.
1334540	1338260	He's basically saying that string theory doesn't work
1338260	1343260	neither technically nor in the approach of its physicists.
1343260	1346140	So the point that he's trying to make,
1346140	1347740	the way I understood it,
1347740	1351940	is that string theorists are very arrogant
1351940	1354980	in their approach in the way that they don't,
1354980	1356500	they don't want to recognize
1356500	1359700	that there might be something else outside their field.
1359700	1362660	And he says that this approach of theirs
1362660	1364580	is unscientific and analytical
1364580	1367380	because they refuse to admit that they might be wrong.
1367380	1371060	And like you said, despite all this money spent,
1371060	1373140	brain power and time invested
1373140	1375140	during the last half a century,
1375140	1379060	the field hasn't produced any tangible results
1379060	1382140	outside of some theoretical stuff,
1382140	1384900	nothing that's applicable in the real world.
1384900	1386740	That's how I understood it.
1386740	1388660	I watched, I used to watch a lot of like
1388660	1391460	these scientific documentaries like the Neil,
1392820	1393780	Neil deGrasse Tyson?
1393780	1396180	Neil deGrasse Tyson, like I need to repeat a name
1396180	1397780	a hundred times so I can memorize it.
1397780	1399940	Also alongside with Tarke Clarkson,
1399940	1401020	Carlson, like-
1401020	1402100	Kelly Clarkson?
1402100	1403660	Chris Tarke or whatever.
1404660	1408140	But anyway, so I watched a lot of these documentaries
1408140	1409660	and what I found out was that
1410500	1413820	their starting point is definitely very, very interesting.
1413820	1416220	So you have 11 universal constants,
1416220	1419500	like the constant for gravity or whatever.
1419500	1420660	And then it's like maybe that's,
1420660	1422580	one constant represents the dimensions
1422580	1427420	or we have 11 dimensions at the very macroscopic level.
1427420	1429540	And I'm like, yeah, at a quantum level,
1429540	1431060	it's just these strings reverberate
1431060	1433340	at a very specific frequency
1433340	1434540	and I'll create a constant.
1434540	1437380	I'm like, all right, cool, we'll understand that.
1437380	1438780	That's very interesting.
1438780	1442540	But then again, if you look at how string theory
1444060	1448100	square off in front of other really dominant
1449180	1450580	physics theories, right?
1450580	1453860	Like the general relativity, the quantum mechanics,
1453860	1456140	like it was way, way, way lower.
1458140	1460980	I don't think that Einstein started the relativity theory,
1461020	1465260	the theory of relativity like off of the imaginary,
1465260	1467420	imagination at that level.
1468740	1470060	And then compared to string theory,
1470060	1472500	and then the other two were like really,
1472500	1475700	really well grounded, you can use it.
1475700	1477900	I think that GPS use that,
1477900	1480260	the general theory of relativity
1480260	1483060	and then the quantum mechanics were used
1483060	1485460	creating quantum computers now.
1485460	1487820	But like, even though they make a breakthrough,
1487820	1489060	like exactly like you said,
1489060	1490340	what are we gonna do with it?
1490820	1492620	Make a fucking quantum violin,
1492620	1494620	all of the fucking strings or whatever?
1494620	1498860	Yeah, he's saying that they basically took the spotlight
1498860	1502180	away within physics from theoretical physics
1502180	1506260	all the way to just purely on string theory.
1506260	1509900	And they're not asking these big questions,
1509900	1513780	ideas of the universe, whether or not we can traverse it,
1513780	1517820	leave the planet, find new sources of energy,
1517860	1522540	become a multi-plan, multi-solar civilization
1522540	1524020	or something like that.
1524020	1526940	That's what I find interesting about him.
1526940	1529580	When he talks about, I think I heard him,
1529580	1531340	when he talks about Einstein,
1531340	1534180	he said that this whole idea,
1534180	1537420	I'm not sure if this is Einstein's concept,
1537420	1542420	so that's what I, but this space time.
1543340	1545780	Is this Einstein's space time?
1545780	1549420	That he said this numerous times,
1549420	1553540	he says space time, it's a map, it's not a territory.
1553540	1555460	And that we are, that's we,
1555460	1559060	that scientists, physicists are shackled by this.
1559060	1560660	They're not thinking outside the box,
1560660	1563340	what might be outside of that.
1563340	1565140	I really like how he phrased that.
1565140	1568380	Right, I just, it always amazed me to,
1568380	1570620	you remember who was that guy's name
1570620	1571700	that he constantly mentioned,
1571700	1573740	like the most feared character, you know?
1573740	1575380	I don't know, but I know who you mean.
1575380	1577100	He's just retiring now.
1577100	1580580	Yeah, he's part of that whole string theory,
1580580	1581740	like bandwagon, right?
1581740	1585060	Yeah, he's the Godfather.
1585060	1588060	Right, and I feel like there is a,
1590020	1594700	there is a sense of urgency among physicists.
1594700	1598420	Like, you know, we haven't progressed any further
1598420	1601780	after the discovery of, you know,
1601780	1605580	what Einstein discovered and also the quantum physics.
1605580	1607460	And then they feel this sense of urgency
1607460	1609740	and then the string theorists are just, you know,
1609740	1612220	according to Eric, it's like they exactly,
1612220	1614100	like you said, they waste a lot of resource
1614100	1617140	and funding and spotlight and attention
1617140	1621900	on a concept that's probably not gonna lead us to anywhere.
1621900	1625900	But at the same time, I always feel like, you know,
1627900	1630420	maybe for him, this is very, very important,
1630420	1633620	a very, you know, potent issue.
1633620	1636860	But for us, like, you know, we don't understand how much.
1636860	1639220	It's like we really, really, really hope to see
1639220	1643180	that maybe, you know, the conventional physicists
1643180	1645340	can make some sort of breakthrough
1645340	1648260	and then just like use actual signs to be done,
1648260	1651860	like these string theorists, like as they claim,
1651860	1654540	like in the end, like we can move on for this.
1654540	1656140	But like when I was listening to the podcast,
1656140	1658740	I'm like, yeah, I understand that you are not happy
1658740	1660620	about this, but how's that gonna relate it
1660620	1661540	to my mortgage, man?
1661540	1664860	Like, you know, I really wish I could know.
1664860	1666660	Okay, but he thinks he thinks big.
1666660	1667900	He thinks. Yeah, he definitely.
1667900	1670260	Very, very, very, very big.
1670260	1671980	I don't know when I think about physics,
1671980	1674540	I'm like Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project,
1674540	1677180	the atom bomb, and that's it.
1677180	1679700	Like you said, I know GPS systems,
1679700	1684100	they function on some, they came from physics, right?
1684100	1684940	All right, yeah.
1684940	1685780	What else?
1686700	1689820	I think that they found that like hard evidence
1689820	1693340	on the astronauts in the International Space Stations,
1693340	1697060	like how slow, how much like there are times.
1697060	1697900	Time dilation.
1697900	1698740	Time dilation.
1698740	1700020	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1700020	1702700	Gave us a solid, good movie called Interstellar,
1702700	1703700	that's for sure.
1703700	1705540	Yeah, some physicists worked on that.
1705540	1707380	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1707380	1708700	The rendering of that black hole,
1708700	1710340	like I think it took them like months
1710340	1711700	to render the black hole like that.
1711700	1713580	And then it was the most accurate depiction
1713580	1715380	of what a black hole really looks like.
1715380	1717940	Apparently Oppenheimer, he was the first one
1717940	1719700	to propose the existence of black holes.
1719700	1721620	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
1721620	1723700	Yeah, you were absolutely right.
1723700	1726980	I was shocked when I was watching Oppenheimer
1726980	1728340	and he said like,
1728340	1729180	I'll check it.
1729180	1730020	There's a small comment.
1730020	1731380	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1731380	1734620	But like most people sort of give Stephen Hawking
1734620	1737980	a little bit too much credit on the whole black hole thing,
1737980	1740980	but like Hawking discovered a Hawking radiation,
1740980	1742020	which is also important.
1742020	1744180	Like he basically said like there,
1744220	1745820	maybe we can get some information
1745820	1748460	out of the black hole and it's not completely black.
1750060	1751580	And then he actually,
1751580	1753100	we found evidence about that.
1753100	1754460	Black holes can evaporate,
1754460	1757940	but yeah, Oppenheimer was definitely the first guy.
1757940	1761540	I would say that he was one of the group of scientists
1761540	1764100	who went that far and started to think
1764100	1767660	that maybe we can find an object that dense
1767660	1769740	in a universe that you can stop spacetime,
1769740	1772380	which is a weird thing to say if you think about it.
1772380	1773780	It's super weird.
1773780	1776940	It breaks my mind every time I try to think about it.
1776940	1778660	Last few nights, I've been trying to listen
1778660	1781180	to some physics podcasts.
1782700	1786020	It's fascinating, but as soon as I catch on
1786020	1787460	to something they're talking about
1787460	1789300	and start thinking about it,
1789300	1791580	the conversation just moves on away from me.
1791580	1794300	By the time I get back, I'm already lost.
1794300	1797500	It's like weightlifting for a brain sort of.
1797500	1799140	I mean, the most I know about physics
1799140	1801380	is from the Big Bang Theory.
1801700	1804020	Yeah.
1804020	1806980	So one of the, I guess not one of the,
1806980	1809900	one of the the most famous,
1809900	1814900	most notable idea that Weinstein has is geometric unity.
1816020	1819140	That it's a, how do you say?
1819140	1822260	It's a theoretical framework that he introduced
1822260	1824540	in this mathematical physics.
1824540	1827980	So from what I understand, he is trying to,
1828740	1830660	this idea of geometric unity,
1830660	1834780	he's trying to merge Einstein's theory
1834780	1836500	of general relativity,
1836500	1840340	which explains gravity on a large scale, right?
1840340	1843380	With, like you said, with particle behavior,
1843380	1846180	which deals with quantum mechanics,
1846180	1849180	which deals with particle behavior on a small scale.
1849180	1851780	And so far, this theory has been met
1851780	1854540	with a little bit of skepticism, but also interest.
1854540	1855900	And he's still working on it.
1855900	1857460	I don't know if you remember,
1857460	1862460	this was like the previous time Weinstein was on Rogan.
1862780	1866420	He presented this idea.
1867980	1871420	Anyone can see it, it's on pull that up Jamie.com.
1873260	1877260	But it's, I mean, it's serious science.
1877260	1878620	I'm not gonna sit here and pretend
1878620	1880140	like I know what he's talking about,
1880140	1885140	but he's trying to, I think he sees himself in this theory
1885420	1888380	that he can make another breakthrough
1888380	1891460	and walk in the footsteps maybe of Weinstein.
1891460	1894420	So I guess that's what he's trying to do.
1894420	1896540	I'm like, you know,
1899820	1901460	to give a new map.
1901460	1902420	Exactly.
1902420	1905500	I think that the vibe I'm getting
1905500	1906740	when he was talking about this
1906740	1909300	in the Chris Williamson podcast was that,
1910260	1912700	you know, that's why for me,
1912700	1915740	like Brian Cox was still my favorite physicist.
1916940	1919420	Are you sure it's Brian Cox?
1919420	1920260	Brian Cox.
1920260	1921940	I've heard you say this now a few times.
1921940	1922940	Is it Cox?
1922940	1924060	Yes, it is Cox.
1924060	1925660	Is that the guy who's always smiling?
1925660	1926900	Yeah.
1926900	1927740	C.O.X.
1927740	1928580	Oh, okay.
1928580	1929420	C.O.X.
1929420	1931940	You know, like how else do you want to pronounce it?
1931940	1934900	I also watched a few times, a physicist also,
1934900	1938340	he was also on the podcast circuit, Brian Keating.
1938340	1939660	There are a lot of Brian's in there.
1939700	1941980	He's a colleague of Weinstein's,
1941980	1945700	very, very cool guy, very interesting.
1945700	1949060	But I don't, I hope that he can make some like contribution,
1949060	1952820	but I would say that just based on his tone
1952820	1954140	and all he described it,
1954140	1956020	like all these big ass problems
1956020	1957700	that he's tackling with right now.
1959860	1962940	You know, one of my professors told me,
1962940	1964820	it's like in academia,
1965820	1970700	rarely you can find a area
1970700	1973060	where you can build an entire building upon.
1973060	1976660	Most people are just trying to add one additional brick
1976660	1979220	to the pre-existing building at a time
1979220	1982220	and then you would make the building as tall as possible.
1982220	1983420	When he was talking like that,
1983420	1984980	it really gives people the feeling
1984980	1989300	that he found this new territory where you can,
1989300	1992100	you know, there's a bright future ahead of this,
1992100	1994740	but I was kind of skeptical.
1994740	1997500	I know that for sure,
1997500	1999180	his theory might be very brilliant,
1999180	2002380	may make some really good contribution towards this,
2002380	2003820	but I had the same,
2003820	2005900	and I'm pretty happy for the fact
2005900	2008420	that he was pretty passionate about this,
2008420	2012340	but the thing I wanna say is that,
2012340	2014980	don't expect that we can go to fucking Mars
2014980	2016940	in two seconds in the next year or something.
2016940	2019860	It's gonna take a colossal amount of effort.
2019860	2021900	Yeah, but he's saying like, okay, we went to the moon,
2021900	2023140	we can go to Mars,
2023140	2024900	maybe one of the moons of Jupiter,
2024900	2026940	and then what, like game over.
2027980	2030860	So we probably do need somebody who's thinking
2030860	2032220	that maybe it's not him,
2032220	2035900	but I think maybe what he's trying to argue
2035900	2039540	that the physics community should encourage
2039540	2042700	outside the box thinkers and support them,
2042700	2044460	because maybe these breakthroughs
2044460	2048420	will come from one of these people who think like this.
2048420	2052780	Then those who are indoctrinated into the field of string tier
2052820	2055220	and just following the footsteps of those who can't be.
2055220	2056420	Exactly, exactly.
2056420	2059460	You need a lot, like a thousand bodies
2059460	2064460	to basically form the foundation
2064500	2066540	of just one significant breakthrough.
2066540	2067780	And if you look at Einstein,
2067780	2070500	he wasn't, he didn't came out of nowhere.
2070500	2071660	He didn't come out of nowhere.
2071660	2075340	Like he's breakthroughs also built upon
2075340	2079460	like at least Newton's idea about gravity and all that.
2079460	2081340	And then before him,
2081340	2086340	I would say like the most common understanding
2086860	2090340	about gravity was that gravity was a sort of like a field,
2090340	2092740	like an electronic magnetic field.
2092740	2095260	And then Einstein was basically saying like,
2095260	2097540	probably it's not, it's something different.
2097540	2101120	You know, so I'm definitely glad to see
2101120	2102660	that he's still working on this problem.
2102660	2105300	It's like, because I know a lot of people have quit.
2105300	2108100	I think that a lot of string theorists,
2108100	2109240	you know, who bought into this,
2109280	2111720	a lot of them were once upon a time
2111720	2113520	trying to solve this thing.
2113520	2114880	Like they want to put their effort in,
2114880	2116960	but it's just so damn difficult.
2116960	2118480	And then they sort of, you know,
2118480	2119320	if you think about it,
2119320	2122000	string theory was originally also a thinking
2122000	2123520	also after the box idea.
2123520	2124360	Fringe, yeah.
2124360	2125600	Yeah, so it's like.
2126800	2130880	But yeah, like when you look at those old movies
2130880	2133280	and those old books, you know, this is not the future.
2133280	2135640	We were, I'm not gonna say promised,
2135640	2138400	but that we all envisioned, you know,
2138400	2141160	like Teal said, when you subtract all the screens,
2141160	2142720	we're still living in 1970s.
2142720	2146320	We haven't really made anything except these things.
2146320	2147200	Yeah, exactly.
2147200	2149760	This is the furthest we've, we haven't sent.
2149760	2152960	I think a man hasn't been on the moon since 1972
2152960	2156080	was the last manned moon mission.
2156080	2159840	And, you know, this, the late mid sixties,
2159840	2163860	we started this age of space exploration
2163860	2165520	and then just withered out.
2165520	2166520	Nothing happened.
2166520	2168920	If your mask didn't reboot it,
2168920	2172320	I mean, NASA basically clothed, you know,
2172320	2175960	we're sending their astronauts to Russia to go to space.
2175960	2177560	Yeah, there is a.
2177560	2178760	What I'm trying to say, there's no,
2178760	2182080	it seems like there's no imagination in science.
2182080	2183440	There is no imagination.
2183440	2187360	And I feel like there was just,
2187360	2190240	science just went through a huge period of
2192240	2195440	like self-indulged in depression, in a sense.
2196440	2201120	Yeah, it's like, I know that NASA made a lot of,
2201120	2204880	you know, NASA actually made a lot of progress
2204880	2207160	in terms of, you know, we had a first picture
2207160	2208560	of the black hole in 2016.
2208560	2210160	That was huge.
2210160	2212480	The detection of the gravitational waves,
2212480	2214280	that's also huge.
2214280	2216600	But we were just at that, I would say,
2216600	2220040	it's like the darkness before the down type of time
2220040	2222760	where, you know, everything seems so hopeless
2223040	2225520	and boring that, you know,
2226520	2229080	and every problem seems so urgent to solve
2229080	2231880	and everybody's having this huge amount of stress
2231880	2233560	on their shoulders.
2233560	2235680	Yeah, we just need to get through that, but.
2235680	2240160	When I, we talked about this ad nauseam,
2240160	2241120	it's my new word.
2243520	2246040	The three body problem.
2246040	2249960	I mean, the ideas in those books are out there.
2249960	2250800	Yeah.
2250800	2251640	Fascinating.
2251880	2253760	That's physics, right?
2253760	2255240	Really, really interesting.
2255240	2259240	The show is coming out next month, the Netflix version.
2259240	2260560	I saw the trailer.
2260560	2263440	I think they're doing all three books at the same time
2263440	2264960	based on the trailer.
2264960	2265920	I think so too.
2265920	2268520	I think there were some elements from the other two books
2268520	2269640	and they also brought it in.
2269640	2271920	Like, I don't know if that's a good idea.
2271920	2274720	Maybe from a narrative point of view,
2274720	2277880	they want to set up some kind of cliffhangers.
2277880	2280680	Like, you know, sometimes the TV shows does that,
2280680	2283160	like show you something that wait down in the future
2283160	2285520	and then bring back the story afterwards.
2285520	2286560	Could be.
2286560	2287400	Yeah.
2287400	2289640	Okay, so let's connect all these two things,
2289640	2293040	physics and the three body problem.
2293040	2295000	For the past four years now,
2295000	2299200	I think ever since he stopped doing the portal podcast,
2299200	2301360	Weinstein has dedicated himself
2301360	2304040	in investing the UFO phenomena.
2304040	2308400	He has interacted with various experts in this field.
2308400	2311480	And after four years,
2311480	2315720	he says he remains skeptical about the existence
2315720	2317760	of UFOs themselves.
2317760	2318600	But that's...
2318600	2320000	Just skeptical?
2320000	2322320	Yeah, pessimistic skeptical.
2322320	2323800	You know, they actually exist,
2323800	2326680	but he points out there's like concrete evidence
2326680	2331680	that points to existence of decades-long
2332560	2334840	secret government programs
2334840	2338440	that are shrouded in like UFO secrecy.
2338440	2341320	And he says that these programs
2341320	2343240	could actually might be just the front
2343240	2346080	for testing new weapons
2346080	2349480	or conducting retrieval missions behind enemy lines
2349480	2353720	or experimenting with aerospace technology.
2353720	2358120	And he said, even though he didn't see any concrete evidence,
2358120	2359520	it's the only area,
2359520	2362040	because you know, he's outspoken on all topics
2362040	2365360	where he can't provide like a single explanation
2365360	2366680	what's going on.
2366680	2368960	And what is weird about it, and he mentioned it,
2368960	2372440	and I also believe this is very weird,
2372440	2373760	that you have in the United States,
2373760	2375960	for example, for the last two years,
2375960	2377320	you have these whistleblowers
2377320	2379240	and all this news coming out.
2379240	2382080	And the idea that the United States
2382080	2385000	have lost control of their airspace
2385000	2387440	has reached the highest level of US Congress
2387440	2389280	and all these officials.
2389280	2392040	And they are entertaining this idea.
2392040	2396360	So either, like he said, bringing the scientists,
2396360	2401360	debunk this in an afternoon, or sending the military.
2401560	2403040	So which one is it?
2403040	2405120	And they're not doing anything.
2405120	2408600	It's like now wrapped up in all this bureaucracy
2408600	2412320	and they made the aliens now kind of boring, you know?
2412320	2413840	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2413840	2415440	But something is going on there.
2415440	2418280	There is a, that's actually a very strange thing.
2418280	2421360	Like, did you ever watch one of those Congress hearings
2421360	2422200	about that?
2422200	2424000	Yes, I did, yeah, I watched the David Grosh one, yeah.
2424000	2426720	Do you feel like it's so fucking surreal?
2426720	2428240	It's uber bizarre.
2428240	2429320	It's uber bizarre, right?
2429320	2433120	It's like, it feel, to me,
2433120	2435200	it's one of those like dreamlike sequences
2435200	2437080	that happened in these couple of years
2437080	2440760	as everything is so fucking over the top.
2440760	2444240	You know, any, those people that showed up at the hearings
2444240	2446360	claiming that they worked with the government,
2446360	2447600	they worked for the government,
2447600	2450760	they had actual aliens, somebody contact with the aliens.
2451800	2454560	And if you watch these people from a different setting,
2454560	2456760	you probably think that guy is probably fucking,
2456760	2459320	you know, he's out there, like he's delusional,
2459320	2461560	like he's crazy.
2461560	2464240	And then you have a per people talking like that
2464240	2467760	in front of some ultra serious Congress people.
2467760	2471800	And then it's just these two elements combined together.
2471800	2474400	I'm like, y'all really don't have anything better to do
2474400	2476680	right now, like, wow.
2476720	2479120	It's unreal, it's literally unreal.
2479120	2482000	Like, like you said, it's like brought up to a serious level
2482000	2485000	that this, at this level is just,
2485000	2485960	it doesn't make any sense.
2485960	2487480	Like he said, like every time,
2487480	2489080	because he really went deep into this,
2489080	2491000	he met with all these people.
2491000	2493040	And he says, every time people say like,
2493040	2495800	these things are defying the laws of physics.
2495800	2497960	He says, okay, how do you know they're defying
2497960	2498800	the laws of physics?
2498800	2500640	He's like, well, we can see like, okay,
2500640	2502640	if they're defying the laws of physics,
2502640	2506440	give me a physicist to tell me that.
2506440	2507920	And upon his investigation,
2507920	2512520	he found out there are no physicists working on this.
2512520	2515040	He says, if anyone's gonna debunk it,
2515040	2516200	it's gonna be the physicist.
2516200	2517040	They're gonna debunk it.
2517040	2518280	Like I said, in an afternoon,
2518280	2519120	they're gonna say, okay.
2519120	2520640	That was like 15 minutes conversation.
2520640	2521680	15 minutes, yeah.
2521680	2525080	He said, I'm not even in it
2525080	2526960	and I'm like the only physicist.
2528800	2530800	But to entertain the idea,
2530800	2535640	I like when he made this interesting observation.
2535680	2540560	He said, if you take like this kind of thing,
2540560	2542960	this, let's say UFO cover up,
2542960	2545400	if it was real, how he know it's not real,
2545400	2547000	how he knows it's not real.
2547000	2550080	Let's say this would be a Manhattan type project
2550080	2551920	in terms of scale.
2551920	2554880	And he says like, take the NSA,
2554880	2557480	National Security Agency, for example.
2557480	2559240	Like it was secret for a long time.
2559240	2561840	Now they know, now we all know that it exists.
2561840	2563480	These people deal with numbers there, right?
2563480	2565120	They're also mathematicians.
2565120	2567400	So he said, you would go to,
2567400	2569400	you would see a whole generation of students
2569400	2573120	in the United States that got their PhDs for this.
2573120	2575320	You would check the whole,
2575320	2578060	like that year who graduated.
2578060	2580840	You would see that all these students are missing.
2580840	2582000	You would find their addresses.
2582000	2584520	You will see they're all working in the same city.
2584520	2588120	Then you would know there's like an operation going on there.
2588120	2589680	They're working on something.
2589680	2592160	And he says, he was looking into,
2592160	2594000	he says, if aliens exist,
2594000	2596280	there are like three different areas of physics,
2596280	2600840	which would require people from there to work on this.
2600840	2601920	And he did the math.
2601920	2604960	He did his homework and his nobody is missing.
2604960	2608040	So there's no like real big project going on.
2608040	2612420	You would be surprised about like how open
2612420	2615600	or non secretive the American academia really is.
2615600	2619320	It's like, and also Chinese academia in some regards.
2620320	2622240	I think the China past that period of time
2622240	2625640	where like we need to locked up 5,000 physicists
2625640	2627360	and high school students, college students,
2627360	2630080	because we need a nuclear bomb.
2630080	2631880	That's what we did in the sixties.
2631880	2632840	Exactly like you said,
2632840	2636920	a whole generation of college physics students disappeared
2636920	2639600	and it went shipped into that gunswil province.
2639600	2641560	And then next thing you know,
2641560	2644200	we had a big mushroom cloud and they were figured out.
2644200	2645760	Oh yeah, that's how they went.
2646920	2648760	But no, like we passed that.
2648760	2650840	Like I admit a lot of,
2650840	2653040	I basically know some people that are working
2653040	2655000	some of the very sensitive industry.
2655000	2656080	And then they can talk about it's like,
2656080	2658400	yeah, we're making somethings.
2658400	2661920	That's technically not internationally legal.
2662920	2664360	You know, and then in the U.S.
2664360	2665800	and then they talk about like,
2665800	2669240	oh, I'm working with the co-fusion project here
2669240	2672600	or I'm working with the NASA or something like it.
2672600	2673520	They're very open.
2673520	2677280	There is not that much of a secret to, you know,
2677280	2678440	attach to them.
2678440	2681840	And then what's funny about this whole ADIAN thing is that
2685320	2690000	if there is actual ADIAN, so like on the planet,
2690000	2693160	U.S. wouldn't be the only group of,
2693160	2695440	or the only country that knows about this.
2695440	2697440	You know, like everybody's watching.
2697440	2698840	It would have to be a global cover up.
2698840	2699680	Exactly.
2699680	2701840	It's like, everybody has to cover it up.
2701840	2702720	Like for what?
2702720	2703560	You know what I mean?
2703560	2706680	What's so potentially catastrophic that?
2707320	2710160	When you look at the failure,
2710160	2715240	the global failure in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic,
2715240	2716520	if they couldn't control that,
2716520	2718560	how would they be able to cover up the existence
2718560	2720920	of extraterrestrial life?
2720920	2722880	Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense, man.
2722880	2724960	There's like ADIAN's question.
2724960	2728120	Like the idea that some civilization figured out
2728120	2733120	how to do interstellar travel and visiting us, you know,
2733960	2736920	we're basically in terms of civilization,
2736920	2739120	we're pre-kindergarten.
2739120	2740480	Like, what for?
2740480	2743360	Like, what's so valuable on the planet?
2743360	2745720	And then I heard somebody like, you know,
2745720	2748360	one of those people that witnessed on a congress hearing
2748360	2750000	is like, ah, they came here for the water.
2750000	2751560	Like seriously, water?
2751560	2752560	It's too over.
2753680	2754840	It's a movie plot.
2754840	2756320	Exactly, it's like water.
2756320	2759040	Like y'all figured out how to travel the universe
2759040	2761920	and then you don't know how to combine hydrogen
2761920	2763480	and oxygen to go.
2763480	2768480	But he did say that we made some cool observations.
2769880	2773440	He said like, if we, like when we humans studied,
2773440	2778160	for example, orcas, which are like the smartest beings
2778160	2781080	next to us in the food chain, I guess,
2781080	2782760	like how do we approach them?
2783800	2786280	You know, we observed them, we build,
2788040	2790400	how do you say, what's the opposite of natural?
2790400	2793160	Artificial habitats for them, we studied them,
2793160	2794760	we hide from them.
2794760	2798360	You know, maybe somebody, if they are here,
2798360	2800640	why would they show themselves?
2800640	2804880	He made also a very cool observation about,
2804880	2809600	you know, the Sentinel Islands.
2809600	2813880	Sentinel, yeah, islands south of India.
2813880	2817720	That island with like a few hundreds of inhabitants
2817720	2820000	that killed everyone who showed up there
2820000	2822240	in the last few hundred years.
2822240	2823640	Basically the Indian government,
2823640	2825680	because the island belongs to India,
2825680	2828600	have put it like, not like a protection around it,
2828600	2830240	nobody's allowed to go there.
2830240	2832760	They're basically living in the Stone Age there.
2832760	2836480	So for them, but like the whole world is studying them,
2836480	2838720	but they're not aware of the existence
2838720	2841720	of even India, let alone the continents.
2841720	2845240	So he's saying like, maybe we are like the Sentinel Islands
2845280	2848240	inhabitants and the aliens are like India.
2848240	2849240	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
2849240	2851360	So how would we even know?
2851360	2853160	Yeah, I could be mad.
2853160	2856360	We assume that they would want to communicate with us.
2856360	2860840	And there's always this thing in the UFO lore
2860840	2863040	that all these visitations started
2863040	2865560	after we detonated the nuclear weapons.
2865560	2870320	That's where all this activity like started.
2870320	2874320	So maybe, I don't know, I want to believe.
2874320	2878880	Part of me believes, but if it's really like a cover-up,
2878880	2882680	I think like Musk would be the first one to,
2882680	2885240	I mean, he has satellites going around here.
2885240	2887400	He would know, he would say something.
2887400	2890880	Right, I think that there is a,
2890880	2892880	there are definitely, I've read this,
2892880	2895480	and these aren't really like conspiracy theory or anything,
2895480	2899640	but there are like discoveries in astrology.
2901360	2903200	Astrophysics, yeah, astrology.
2904080	2907040	Or, you know, just physics in general
2907040	2909360	that we figured out that maybe there's some...
2909360	2910360	Astrophysics?
2910360	2912080	Astrophysics. Astrology is something different.
2912080	2913280	Yeah, the wrong word, man.
2913280	2915120	That's a MBTI shit.
2915120	2919080	Anyway, so there were some discoveries
2919080	2923560	that implied that maybe we're being watched
2923560	2925600	by some other civilization.
2926920	2930160	You know, there was a book before,
2930160	2932320	we talked about this before the three body problem,
2932320	2936080	like how they found out that the aliens are watching
2936080	2939160	was that they conduct the experiment with no observer.
2939160	2941480	And according to quantum mechanics,
2941480	2943120	you know, when you don't have observer,
2943120	2945040	they behave like waves.
2945040	2946120	And then they found out, it's like,
2946120	2948680	why are these particles behaving like particles?
2948680	2949520	Somebody's watching.
2949520	2952800	And then that set up the actual stage
2952800	2955720	for what happened during the three body problems.
2955720	2958640	Like, oh yeah, there are aliens watching us.
2958640	2960200	But there are discoveries like that.
2960200	2963760	The author didn't make it happen out of the blue.
2965120	2969520	But I would say that I wanna believe that,
2969520	2974000	you know, some other galaxies that they discovered
2974000	2976320	a lot of things that we just aren't capable
2976320	2978840	of even contemplate yet.
2978840	2980920	And they may be watching us.
2980920	2984640	And it's so amazing to think about it.
2984640	2987760	Like, you know, because we know that, you know,
2987800	2990640	at least maybe like tens of a thousand light years
2990640	2992800	around us, there is no civilization found.
2992800	2994800	We have found zero evidence.
2994800	2997880	So which means that if there's a civilization watching us,
2997880	3000880	that's like, you know, millions or even more than that,
3000880	3003080	like thousands of millions of light years away.
3004680	3006120	They're watching us as like,
3006120	3008960	what they're watching like dinosaurs right now.
3008960	3009960	Oh, okay.
3009960	3011680	You know, they're like, oh, these are dinosaurs.
3011680	3014800	Like, but if imagine a civilization
3014800	3017720	that can watch us live,
3018120	3019440	that they're also watching this podcast
3019440	3020960	for some reason, like these two idiots
3020960	3022000	are talking about us right now.
3022000	3022840	Hey, let's go.
3022840	3023680	Mom, come on, come on.
3023680	3024520	They're breaking the code.
3024520	3026520	Yeah, yeah, but that means that they've figured out
3026520	3027880	a space time to such level
3027880	3030200	they can literally see into the future in a HD,
3030200	3032520	you know, in a 4K definition, basically.
3032520	3033480	That's crazy.
3033480	3034720	Yeah, but okay, at the end of the day,
3034720	3037560	we're always applying our understanding of science
3037560	3041320	that they operate on the same basis.
3041320	3042440	Yeah.
3042440	3044920	The best alien movie I've found.
3044920	3045760	Number one.
3045760	3046600	Mars Attacks.
3046680	3047520	Mars Attacks.
3047520	3048360	No, fifth elements, man.
3048360	3049200	Fifth elements.
3049200	3052040	I thought that was pretty damn good movie.
3052040	3055240	In terms of space opera is like, yeah.
3056240	3058840	And arrival, like arrival and annihilation,
3058840	3060480	these two films are, you know,
3060480	3062880	like the aliens won't behave like us.
3062880	3066960	And arrival, they just like, yo, we can't even talk.
3066960	3068840	You know, we, our language are so complex.
3068840	3070120	Like, give it up, man.
3070120	3070960	Like, go away.
3070960	3071920	Arrival is out there.
3071920	3073960	Definitely the best one out there.
3073960	3074800	Yeah, exactly.
3075000	3079760	But for guilty pleasure, fifth element, you know.
3079760	3080880	Yeah, it's a good one.
3080880	3084560	It's, I mean, 90s schlock, but it's a good movie.
3084560	3085400	It's good.
3085400	3088880	And also, you know, back to the Eric,
3088880	3092240	what he was saying is like, I was so surprised
3092240	3095200	like an actual scientist that went that far too.
3095200	3097680	Yeah, he gave it some legitimacy
3097680	3101360	by him going into the field and investigating.
3101360	3103120	That's what I liked.
3103120	3104640	I was hoping he's going to come.
3104640	3106800	I was like, oh, Weinstein is on Rogan.
3106800	3107640	Let's go.
3107640	3109240	Disclosure is coming.
3109240	3110280	He's going to say something.
3110280	3113760	And then he's like, nah, there is no real evidence.
3113760	3116800	But if he had one point he said,
3116800	3118400	if the aliens were here,
3118400	3120120	I would be the only person to understand
3120120	3121560	how they got to here.
3121560	3123120	Yeah, I remember that.
3123120	3125760	I'm like, wow, that's a,
3125760	3127880	wow, that's American confidence right there, man.
3127880	3130600	Like, okay, let's continue.
3131600	3133320	What did I want to say?
3133320	3134160	Yeah.
3136040	3138800	What Weinstein has one of these ideas
3138800	3142840	of also one of the things I like about him,
3142840	3144800	the idea he calls it,
3144800	3147480	he always makes up these terms,
3148680	3150440	the idea of managed reality.
3151320	3154000	And by that, he means that those
3154000	3156040	in the highest positions of power
3156040	3159520	are actively deceiving the general public
3159520	3162800	regarding the most crucial aspects of society.
3162800	3167360	And by that, biology, science, economics, politics,
3167360	3169480	journalism, global warming,
3170840	3172760	anything you can come up with.
3172760	3175600	So, and again, he has these analogies,
3175600	3179320	which I really love about him.
3179320	3180680	He really paints a picture.
3180680	3184320	He likened this situation as a,
3184320	3187040	he said this on Chris's podcast, the last one,
3187040	3190400	as a tanker that flipped over on a highway.
3190400	3192520	It's burning, the chemicals are coming out,
3192520	3195080	there are dead bodies left and right.
3195080	3197280	The police or the government is standing there
3197280	3200040	and saying, nothing to see here, just move along.
3201040	3203280	And I guess by that,
3203280	3204440	That's a powerful example.
3204440	3207000	It's a powerful example, it is, it is.
3207000	3210520	And there's a lot of, like for us,
3210520	3214600	there's a lot of evidence that points to the contrary.
3214600	3219600	And, but people are being encouraged to ignore the truth
3219760	3222000	and to not only that,
3222000	3226080	but also to put down those who dare to question things,
3226080	3231080	branding them, grifters, charlatans, conspiracy theorists.
3231760	3235320	And we've seen that a lot in the last 10 years, I think.
3235320	3239760	Yeah, that's a, I'm glad that he brought it up
3239760	3243320	because for one, where we're at,
3243480	3246160	that's a freaking perfect example of what's going on
3246160	3247480	during the COVID three years,
3247480	3250640	why we're still doing those tests and all that.
3250640	3252080	But it's everywhere, isn't it?
3252080	3252920	Is it not?
3252920	3255800	It's not, no, it is everywhere.
3255800	3259680	It's like, especially in the West, right?
3260560	3264520	What do you think that, in your opinion,
3264520	3267040	it's like, give us an example,
3267040	3270240	like where you feel like your reality is being managed
3270240	3271800	and you found out it's actually managed,
3271800	3273120	reality is not real?
3274240	3277600	Like back home, there's an open secret
3277600	3281200	that our government has been stealing the elections
3281200	3282680	for the last 10 years.
3283640	3286960	Everyone you ask, nobody is voting for them.
3286960	3289360	And every time the elections come around,
3289360	3291600	they win the elections.
3291600	3292680	So that's for one.
3292680	3295240	In terms of, I mean, we operate,
3295240	3298640	we deal with very existential problems back home,
3298680	3302400	but what's going on in the West
3302400	3305520	has started spilling over all over the planet.
3305520	3308160	So like biology, for example,
3308160	3311080	what they're saying now about men and women,
3311080	3315920	they're rewriting history, global warming,
3315920	3318040	it's happening, it's not happening.
3318040	3320840	You have the money, you have the funds,
3320840	3323600	get a group of scientists, make a consensus, sit down,
3323600	3325240	is it happening or is it not happening?
3325240	3328600	Why do we have to debate this all over and over again?
3328720	3332480	There's a lot of these topics that we are constantly debating,
3332480	3333920	is it or is it not?
3333920	3336040	Right, right, sure.
3336040	3338800	Same as with these aliens, okay, now I'm going out there,
3338800	3341040	you know, it doesn't really affect me,
3341040	3343800	but like example from back home would be this.
3345080	3350080	I think that the, how am I gonna put this?
3350440	3355440	So you have basically a mega industry on the planet
3356280	3358680	that their entire profit came from
3358680	3361080	making people arguing against each other.
3362080	3365560	That's why, you know, racism is a great example.
3365560	3369840	I think that America could have solved racism
3369840	3372840	a long time ago, but they didn't.
3372840	3376160	It's not because the Americans are full of like neo-Nazis
3376160	3378560	that just believe that there are white superiority
3378560	3381680	or all that bullshit, it's because when you have people
3381680	3383800	that are debating on the national television,
3384800	3387440	you got views, you can sell advertisement,
3388440	3390880	it's like solving the issue will basically say
3390880	3394560	that you can no longer make money in that way.
3394560	3397400	And it's very similar to the wars, you know, conflicts,
3397400	3399920	you know what I mean is like the,
3399920	3403640	I had this opinion on, you know,
3403640	3408400	we probably make more money by threatening,
3408400	3411680	threatening the fucking island of unification
3411680	3413760	than actually unify with them.
3414640	3416320	You know, like Americans at the same time,
3416320	3419080	it's like, but definitely more profitable
3419080	3422200	that they keep spreading fear about like, you know,
3423520	3426200	what we're gonna do, what the rush is gonna do.
3426200	3429400	That's why it's like, we never solve anything.
3429400	3432880	The same thing goes with the climate change, you know.
3433920	3436840	You, do you feel it's actually kind of strange
3436840	3439720	that the moment of Paris, you know,
3439720	3442640	China and United States signed a Paris Accord
3442640	3445120	to combat climate change, almost the next day
3445120	3448360	we became the evilest country on the planet.
3448360	3452720	Like we actually wanna do some solid policy change
3452720	3455400	to promote green energy, renewable energy.
3455400	3457000	You look at a Chinese street right now,
3457000	3458400	it's like how many electronic cars,
3458400	3461880	it's way more than any advanced economy on the planet.
3461880	3463920	Yeah, people tend to think outside of China,
3463920	3465640	that China is this big polluter.
3465640	3468000	I mean, truth be told, you have a lot of factories
3468000	3471400	and all this stuff, but when I travel China,
3471400	3473080	I see these wind turbines everywhere.
3473080	3475560	Like you said, electric cars left and right,
3475560	3478640	more so than outside of China, so much more.
3478640	3481640	We, they never talked about like in the, you know,
3481640	3484840	2015, 2016 when we shut down all those like really,
3484840	3489240	we call it the industrialization basically.
3489240	3491600	We need to shut down a lot of those old ass factories
3491600	3495560	so we can stop the pollution at the same time.
3495560	3500560	We wanna cut back on our production capabilities
3501040	3502800	because we're making goods that's so cheap
3502800	3504720	that nobody is making or making money out of it.
3504720	3508200	So, and then there were so much employment
3508200	3511000	that the Chinese economy had to suffer through that.
3511000	3513440	There's a reason that right now,
3513440	3515080	if you order food on the internet,
3515080	3517280	like it will be delivered in the fucking 10 minutes.
3517280	3520400	It's because all these people, they're working on this
3520400	3522960	and they can't find jobs in traditional
3522960	3525120	and manufacturer sectors, right?
3525120	3529000	So, you know, like when somebody actually tried
3529000	3531480	to solve it, all of a sudden,
3531480	3533000	because you were ending the debate,
3533000	3535800	like in China, global warming is not a freaking debate.
3535800	3539120	You know, and then you can't make money off of debates
3539120	3541440	and arguing each other and then just like bringing
3541440	3543080	out new perspectives and whatnot.
3544240	3545520	And people hate you for that.
3545520	3547240	Like people will literally hate you for that.
3547240	3550240	Like I think that the manager reality either,
3551240	3555920	I think that it's not like, you know, how Eric described it,
3555920	3559280	you know, there's just huge powerful people.
3559280	3564280	They just try to, you know, push us away from the truth
3564280	3567440	and then, you know, like turn us into mindless pigs,
3567440	3568440	whatever.
3568440	3571120	I think that the powerful people just want to make us feel
3571120	3573920	confused all the time, you know, that's why.
3573920	3576160	Like that's why a lot of people buy in propaganda.
3576160	3578480	It's because it's easier to understand.
3578480	3581200	And then if you don't listen to propagandas
3581200	3583080	and you really want to pursue like what's real
3583080	3584960	and what's actually in the real, like your brain
3584960	3586840	will burn out like on a daily basis
3586840	3588560	and nobody wants that, you know what I mean?
3588560	3589400	I do.
3589400	3592640	I don't think they are like some evil doers
3592640	3595200	who have this new world government, you know,
3595200	3600200	one world government, this apocalyptic ideas of the future,
3600800	3602840	these big conspiracy theorists,
3602840	3604840	but they're just sowing division
3604840	3606040	and they're reaping the profits
3606080	3608760	because division is they're monetizing our division.
3608760	3613760	We are divided on every single issue.
3616240	3618080	We are, I mean, all at the end of the day,
3618080	3620160	also citizens of the world
3620160	3623080	and we all participate in these conversations
3623080	3626160	and every single question we are divided.
3626160	3628160	And when you, this thing you mentioned,
3628160	3631360	the global warming and this, I think this is also part
3631360	3634880	of this Western self-righteous liberalism.
3634920	3637840	Putin said it best, like you guys in the West,
3637840	3640080	you have already industrialized,
3640080	3642480	you've arrived in the future.
3642480	3645920	It's like, tell Asian countries or African countries
3645920	3647400	who are just starting the process
3647400	3652400	of industrializing their nations to go green, like FU.
3652400	3653120	Yeah, exactly.
3653120	3656520	Like the African, like lithium mine, that's a perfect example.
3656520	3659360	It's like in order for us to drive electronic cars,
3659360	3661560	like how many Africans lives are being sacrificed
3661560	3664600	on a fucking ritualistic level, you know,
3664600	3667720	just to make sure that we have enough material
3667720	3669000	to build a car batteries.
3669000	3671040	Like this is hypocritical, man.
3671040	3673040	Hypocritical, they're all tweeting in the West
3673040	3674600	from their phones, let's go green.
3674600	3678480	This dash, hashtag, that, but somebody is dying
3678480	3681560	in Africa mining that coal belt or whatever it is in,
3681560	3686080	you know, buy a Starbucks coffee, tax,
3686080	3688040	I don't know, half a dollar goes to this cause
3688040	3689520	and then you feel good about yourself.
3689520	3692520	You can go and protest and whatnot.
3692520	3694160	But also the thing you asked me about,
3694160	3697960	where do I see this playing out, this managed reality?
3697960	3702960	Also with the news, I think most, I see it there.
3704280	3709280	There are, there's no, I mean, journalistic integrity,
3709600	3713120	like what, journalistic, what went out the window?
3713120	3715120	I mean, it's obvious when you go,
3715120	3718000	like you can go on these apps like Telegram
3718000	3721360	and you know, these dark web apps
3721360	3724920	and you can see news that you can't see on legacy media,
3724920	3726800	not even legacy that you can maybe even see
3726800	3729240	on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube.
3729240	3732560	Like we are, I do believe, I don't think,
3732560	3736000	and I personally don't think Eric was implying
3736000	3740160	that they're like these evil doers that are controlling,
3740160	3745160	but we are being deceived or at least we are being
3746000	3751840	conditioned or trained not to think,
3751840	3754120	not to question too much.
3754120	3757440	There's a lot of things that are happening that are absurd.
3757440	3759320	I think that's the main point.
3759320	3760400	Yeah.
3760400	3762200	You know, don't ask question.
3762200	3764600	There's nothing, just move along, you know.
3764600	3768360	Just move along while somebody is profiting.
3768360	3773360	I personally feel like, you know, for one,
3775600	3779680	the legacy media, the news are just so freaking
3779680	3783040	narrative-driven, which is something that Eric also talked
3783040	3784800	about, the narrative-driven media
3784800	3786600	and also the narrative-driven academics.
3786600	3789840	It's like you have this built-in story
3789840	3793880	that you wanna promote or you wanna spread
3793880	3796280	and then you find evidence that fits
3796280	3797600	that particular narrative.
3798760	3801200	For one, the legacy media is definitely,
3801200	3804520	I still have subscriptions to some pretty major news media,
3804520	3805560	like New York Times.
3807480	3808320	I just read the title.
3808320	3810160	I don't wanna read the freaking commentary on that.
3810160	3811800	It's like absolutely garbage.
3811800	3814000	And then you have the underground news.
3814000	3816080	And underground news sometimes is like so fucking
3816080	3821080	mind-boggling, stupid, conspiracy, theory-filled,
3821840	3823840	you know, successful.
3823840	3825720	Have you heard of ground news?
3825720	3826680	Yeah, I'm using it.
3826680	3827520	Are you using it?
3827520	3828360	Yeah.
3828360	3829400	Is it good?
3829400	3832360	It's a little bit overwhelming.
3832360	3833680	It gets a little bit repetitive
3833680	3837640	because they try to, it's not a news agency,
3837640	3841000	but it's sort of like a combinator.
3841000	3844120	You know, you combine all the news agency,
3844120	3846360	what he said, what he said together
3846360	3847640	and you make your own calls.
3848640	3851160	Be very careful of what you set up,
3851160	3852080	you're interested in it.
3852080	3855200	Cause like I accidentally set an election
3855200	3857600	and my entire front page is all about like fucking election.
3857600	3859160	I don't really care about this anymore,
3859160	3863000	but in terms of bias,
3863040	3864600	they have a bias meter on it.
3864600	3866360	So you can tell us like, okay, this is-
3866360	3867960	Who's reporting more?
3867960	3868800	Okay.
3868800	3869720	And this managed reality.
3869720	3871160	Also we talked about it last time
3871160	3872560	about the war in Ukraine.
3872560	3875240	That seems like a very managed picture
3875240	3876840	of what's really going on.
3876840	3880520	Obviously being sold a narrative.
3880520	3882160	Very obviously.
3882160	3885560	I think that, like I said last time,
3885560	3887920	it's like there's no way that according to the West,
3887920	3890280	if Russia has lost that much manpower,
3890280	3891240	it's still going.
3891240	3892680	Like there's no way.
3892680	3894200	It's not China that we were talking about.
3894200	3896680	Like Russia doesn't have a lot of people, right?
3896680	3898800	So yeah, there's a-
3898800	3901560	During the Chris Williamson podcast,
3902880	3904480	maybe you know something about this.
3904480	3907320	He was talking about some CPI question.
3907320	3908800	Right.
3908800	3909640	Yeah.
3909640	3913080	The Eric was attacking how the brew of liver statistics
3913080	3914680	manipulate a CPI number.
3914680	3915760	What does it stand for?
3915760	3916720	Consumer?
3916720	3918040	Consumer price index.
3918960	3923440	What it represents is that it take a basket of goods
3923440	3925480	and services that you will,
3925480	3928880	an average consumer would consume,
3928880	3931000	and take a look at the price level,
3931000	3933840	and then compare this price level after a period of time,
3933840	3936360	and then see like the percentage rise or decrease.
3936360	3937560	So if it's a positive number,
3937560	3938640	it means it's inflation,
3938640	3941000	and the negative number is the deflation.
3941000	3943640	That's how I learned from my college years.
3943640	3946400	And what Eric basically said is that they created
3946400	3951400	a inflation number to fit a specific political interest.
3951800	3952960	And I found that,
3955320	3957800	man, it's so hard to believe that.
3957800	3959760	It's really difficult to believe that.
3961320	3964680	Because if that's the case,
3964680	3966920	you will see that CPI doesn't correlate
3966920	3969880	with other economic indicators,
3969880	3973760	unless they fix like everything, right?
3973760	3976360	And I would say in terms of number fixing,
3976360	3978360	like the Americans are not as good as us.
3978360	3982880	Like we can make our economic scoresheet like box score
3982880	3985240	like perfect, right?
3985240	3988480	But I don't think that he,
3989360	3991960	I don't know what he meant that he said like,
3991960	3994120	the CPI number is wrong.
3994120	3995440	You know, like that's the part is like,
3995440	3996960	he didn't elaborate on this.
3996960	3999640	He didn't give out his own understanding about it.
3999640	4003680	Like what he thought should be the right formula.
4003680	4006000	He just said like the Federal Reserve
4006000	4007240	and then there was just, you know,
4007240	4008560	this star chamber people,
4008560	4010160	they're just fixing all these numbers.
4010160	4011680	I'm like, all right, cool.
4011680	4016480	Speaking of Federal Reserve and money,
4016480	4018360	and again, going back a little bit,
4018360	4021200	if you don't mind to this managed reality thing.
4021200	4023840	Like when people mention UBI,
4023840	4026600	this Universal Basic Income,
4026600	4029400	and how much poverty we have in the world today,
4031320	4033120	when people talk about that, you know,
4033240	4037200	it's met with like, you guys are utopians, you know,
4037200	4041120	this is like next level socialism,
4041120	4043120	you know, that this is not gonna happen.
4044480	4046600	But when you look at like when these,
4046600	4050320	we talked about the financial,
4050320	4053240	you know, the crashes that happened in 2007
4053240	4056600	and now at the beginning of this decade.
4056600	4057680	And every time this happens,
4057680	4059240	like I know it happened in Europe,
4059240	4061040	especially in the United States,
4061040	4062240	every time they build them out,
4062240	4066760	they print trillions of dollars every single time.
4066760	4067880	So what I'm trying to say,
4067880	4071200	like how do they have money for this all the time,
4071200	4072560	but they don't have money to fix
4072560	4075080	like these real world problems
4075080	4077920	that we all, you know, suffer from?
4077920	4081440	Yeah, the idea of printing money,
4081440	4086280	that's from, that's a Keyesian economic approach.
4086280	4087880	Like that's what the United States did.
4087880	4090160	What economic approach?
4090160	4092800	So I forgot his first name,
4092800	4094680	but his last name is Kane's.
4095560	4097320	He's a very famous economist
4097320	4099600	in during the Great Depression.
4099600	4101040	Stateside?
4101040	4103640	I think he's from UK, he's from UK.
4103640	4106120	Like UK were, same thing as Eric said,
4106120	4107800	like UK people should feel more proud.
4107800	4110460	Like they did something pretty amazing.
4110460	4114840	But in economics back then, they had this, you know,
4114840	4118920	they had this blind belief, this credility,
4119600	4123520	of, you know, if you let the free market run,
4123520	4125240	it will solve all the problems itself.
4125240	4126160	So you don't have to interfere.
4126160	4128240	The government doesn't have to do anything.
4128240	4132240	And that's basically fundamental belief
4132240	4133520	of all the right wing people,
4133520	4136040	like who believe in the smaller government
4136040	4138320	because the market will sell for the sell file.
4138320	4140160	But during the Great Depression,
4140160	4141920	we found out that no, the market won't sell.
4141920	4143960	Like there's market failure, you know,
4143960	4146720	like there are, you can produce so much goods
4146720	4148480	to the point that nobody's consuming
4148520	4150120	and it created deflation.
4150120	4152200	And deflation is very, very dangerous
4152200	4154080	to modern economy, like to any country.
4154080	4155800	Like we think the Zimbabwe is bad
4155800	4158360	because they had a hyperinflation.
4158360	4159200	So did we?
4159200	4160040	Yeah, yeah, so.
4160040	4160880	So did we?
4160880	4165680	Yeah, but if you compare that to what happened in Japan,
4165680	4169520	the longevity of the crisis, it's like hyperinflation,
4169520	4171280	it's relatively easy to stop,
4171280	4173880	but like deflation, you can't really stop it.
4173880	4175360	So they're afraid of that.
4175360	4177160	So that's why they're printing money.
4178880	4182080	But contrary to a lot of people's belief
4182080	4184520	that they're just printing cash out there,
4185440	4187800	what they're believing is that if you increase people's
4187800	4190360	spending and then just lower the interest rate,
4190360	4192160	you will, it will stimulus the economy
4192160	4193520	and then make it back to, you know,
4193520	4194640	if you give people more money,
4194640	4196840	they will like to spend on something.
4196840	4200600	And then, you know, it's stabilized the price level.
4200600	4202520	What you don't wanna see is that you're sitting
4202520	4206760	on a bunch of cash and its value is actually increasing.
4208040	4209440	That's what deflation means.
4209440	4210840	It's actually very horrible.
4210840	4213360	Like that's what China is going through right now.
4213360	4214720	So if like every day,
4214720	4216200	like me and my wife, we talked about this,
4216200	4218200	it's like every time we see a nice restaurant
4218200	4220000	and a very expensive,
4220000	4222360	we are not going to spend money to that restaurant.
4222360	4224120	We're just gonna wait it out
4224120	4227040	until like eventually that restaurant has zero customers,
4227040	4228360	it will drop down some discount
4228360	4230720	and then we'll just go eat there.
4230720	4232320	But in terms of the restaurant's,
4232320	4233760	from the restaurant's perspective,
4233760	4236080	it's absolutely horrible.
4236080	4239360	So deflation is definitely more scarier.
4239360	4241960	It's much scarier than the inflation.
4243120	4245600	That's why they print money all the time.
4245600	4247920	Like I don't agree on,
4247920	4249920	but the thing I don't agree is that
4249920	4252440	I'm all for you bailed out the banks,
4254400	4257120	but you still need to hold those bankers accountable
4257120	4257960	afterwards.
4257960	4258920	Like we solve your problem now,
4258920	4260480	here's somebody who got to go to jail.
4260480	4262440	Like whatever you guys did was wrong.
4262440	4263280	It was a fraud.
4263280	4264840	Like what happened in 2007?
4264840	4265680	It was just-
4265680	4266920	I think like two people went to jail maybe.
4266920	4268520	Yeah, it's just two or three people went to jail
4268520	4269520	and all these bankers,
4269520	4271800	they walk off with all these like big ass bonuses.
4271800	4274120	I thought that was absolutely wrong.
4274120	4278360	Like that set us example so bad that,
4278360	4279480	you know, now I thought about it,
4279480	4280960	I think the America lost,
4280960	4285080	I would say 60% of its credibility internationally,
4285080	4289800	based solely based on how they reacted in the 2007.
4289800	4292000	And then now we're just dealing
4292000	4293240	with the repercussions really.
4293240	4296520	Like everything on the planet is like,
4296520	4297360	if you think about it,
4297360	4300160	it's just dealing with the repercussions of 2007.
4300160	4303560	It has such a strong ripples in the history
4303560	4306760	that it's just like, you know,
4306760	4308680	I think that was probably one of the reasons
4308680	4311520	to why all these elites want to make us stupid
4311520	4312440	and don't think about this.
4312440	4314600	Cause like how are you going to get away with this, man?
4314600	4318400	Like seriously, like you have all these money
4319120	4322680	all these people that made so much money illegally
4322680	4324160	and they can walk away from this.
4324160	4327560	And then you call it a moral hazard.
4327560	4330800	I'm like, bro, like, look,
4330800	4333160	if there's a famine and the people on the streets
4333160	4334280	are eating each other,
4334280	4335800	like because they have to survive,
4335800	4338120	like I would want to call that a moral hazard.
4338120	4340600	You got a group of the most well-educated people
4340600	4344760	on the fucking planet made some conscious decision
4344760	4346480	to exploit people.
4346480	4347720	That's not a moral hazard.
4347720	4348640	It's not just illegal.
4348640	4349480	That's like,
4350760	4352080	you know.
4353360	4358880	So speaking of Eric verdict,
4360360	4363720	verdict, what's your opinion of him overall?
4363720	4365000	I'm going to pull Eric card.
4365000	4366320	Like, what do you think?
4368920	4370480	Nice. Okay.
4370480	4375480	Well, the most frequent criticism I've heard of him
4376280	4381280	is that he holds a very high opinion of himself.
4383760	4386720	On several podcasts, I've heard him say,
4386720	4390960	I've heard him mention that within his own family,
4390960	4394680	there are like two or three Nobel winning ideas.
4394680	4396680	I've even heard him entertain thoughts
4396680	4398520	of running the government by himself.
4399760	4404760	People say that he talks in circles,
4405800	4409360	that he has an answer for everything.
4409360	4411920	I also once, the only thing I think they might,
4411920	4414320	they didn't really, I'm nitpicking here,
4414320	4416200	but since we're talking,
4416200	4420720	the way he responded to comments made by Tim Dillon,
4420720	4424000	which was, which were obviously intended as a joke.
4424000	4424840	Remember that?
4425880	4427760	Tim Dillon said like, you know,
4427760	4431280	people always say Eric Weinstein is, you know, so smart.
4431280	4432320	What has he ever invented?
4432320	4434200	What did he ever do, you know?
4434200	4436760	And he was a guest on Rogan after that,
4436760	4440880	and he really kind of embarrassed himself in his reaction.
4440880	4441920	He went hard on Tim Dillon, right?
4441920	4445880	Yeah, he really took it seriously, took it to heart.
4445880	4450880	But disregarding all of that, similar to Peterson,
4452040	4456400	what I, the thing I like the most about Weinstein
4456400	4459960	is his sense of urgency when he talks about
4459960	4461760	these critical issues over time,
4461760	4465840	particularly the failure of institutions.
4465840	4466880	That's what I really like.
4466880	4469880	I also, I highly, I told you this many times,
4469880	4473080	I highly admire his eloquence, his intellect,
4473080	4477000	his ability to not only to talk about,
4477000	4479560	but also to communicate these big ideas.
4479560	4482160	In terms of this physics stuff and science,
4482160	4484840	I think he really has a visionary mind.
4484840	4489440	He's consistently thinking outside the box on all topics.
4489440	4494120	And his passion for physics has brought up,
4494120	4495960	has sparked an interest in me.
4495960	4499280	Like I told you, I've been watching these physics podcasts
4499280	4501920	even though I don't understand anything, but...
4501920	4503240	It's so intriguing though.
4503240	4504680	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4504680	4507080	They all have like amazing visuals all the time.
4507080	4508280	They do.
4508280	4510960	I think he will be well remembered in history,
4510960	4515440	even if nothing comes off of this geometric unity.
4516440	4520440	I think, you know, people like him are needed.
4520440	4525000	I don't think, I mean, he pulled away when he was kind of getting
4525000	4531000	not too big, but too loud in his criticisms of many things.
4531440	4533800	So I admire him for that as well.
4533800	4538200	And from where I'm sitting is just my subjective point of view.
4538200	4541720	I'm nobody to talk on this, but from where I'm sitting,
4541720	4544320	he, to me, he seems like one of the smartest people
4544320	4545160	in the world.
4545840	4548120	I think that I agree with you.
4548120	4551840	Like, do you feel like personally that he's, you know,
4551840	4555160	he really thinks we're very high off of himself?
4556040	4557320	Do you got an impression from him?
4557320	4562320	I do, but do you think like if Einstein was alive today
4564880	4565720	and he went...
4565720	4566800	Bro, that would be amazing.
4566800	4568440	We see Einstein on the podcast.
4568440	4571640	If we had the opportunity to see hours and hours
4571640	4574280	of Einstein talking, we can only see,
4574280	4577360	I think maybe there's only a few short videos of Einstein.
4577360	4582360	There's, you know, books and articles, but I'm pretty sure
4582680	4584480	we would say he's full of himself.
4584480	4585320	Yeah.
4585320	4586360	How can you not be?
4586360	4587400	Exactly.
4587400	4590640	I feel like it's a necessary flaw to have.
4590640	4591480	Yeah.
4591480	4593040	Expose yourself like that in the public.
4593040	4594840	All the artists, sorry for interrupting.
4594840	4597920	When we look at all these, that we had the opportunity,
4597920	4600320	now we have recordings and now in the modern age
4600320	4602680	of these artists, like musicians,
4602680	4605080	and they're all full of themselves.
4605080	4606040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4606040	4608280	I think one goes with the other.
4609480	4612640	I was, I had the same impression.
4612640	4614520	And also I think that kind of contradicts
4614520	4618240	to what he said about the exclusivity,
4618240	4622640	the necessary exclusivity of academia.
4622640	4624880	I think that what exactly are you doing right now
4624880	4628080	is attracting a lot of unqualified people to the academia.
4629760	4632120	You know, academia for me always has been this kind
4632440	4635680	behind the door, like very secretive type of,
4635680	4638160	you know, society.
4638160	4640040	It requires a lot of intellect
4640040	4643960	and a lot of time and effort to set a step into this.
4643960	4646160	It's not that, you know,
4646160	4647600	but at the same time, it's like,
4647600	4650000	I feel like he set a lot of good examples
4650000	4652560	on how we should approach various,
4652560	4654240	very controversial issues.
4654240	4658160	Like I was summing it up with this one thing
4658160	4659000	that he talked about.
4659000	4660520	It's about the gender issue.
4661520	4663320	And he didn't go as like, you know,
4663320	4664280	oh, there are only two gender issues.
4664280	4665120	Yes, yes.
4665120	4667360	He actually find a very solid middle ground.
4667360	4672360	It's like the nature before binary gender setups
4672360	4674040	like male and female, like we're good,
4674040	4675480	but they are all liars.
4675480	4677520	You don't want those all liars to feel
4677520	4679560	unloved and excluded from a society.
4679560	4681520	I'm like, that's such a solid point.
4681520	4683400	I think everybody can write it behind that.
4683400	4686760	How difficult is it to come
4686760	4689480	towards a common understanding on that level?
4689800	4691880	It's not difficult to understand.
4691880	4694760	We know that there are some people who are in a,
4694760	4698480	they have, you know, they're the borderline problems.
4698480	4700560	Like, you know, they're neither male or female, like.
4700560	4701400	Asexual.
4701400	4703120	Asexual, like we know they exist.
4703120	4705720	You know, we know that somebody has gendered.
4705720	4706560	Dysphoria.
4706560	4707600	Dysphoria.
4707600	4712480	So like the way he, the way he elaborate his ideas
4712480	4716080	on that particular issue is just such amazing.
4716080	4717840	With understanding and compassion.
4717840	4719600	With understanding and compassion.
4719600	4722840	And also he didn't compromise his scientific understanding
4722840	4724160	about the issue.
4724160	4726280	You know, he didn't go ultra like, you know,
4726280	4728840	Jordan Peterson on Chris Williamson's ass.
4728840	4732920	Like, I wish like, at least on that aspect,
