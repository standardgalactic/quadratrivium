00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
The science cares about you no matter whether you love science or hate science.

00:03.600 --> 00:08.200
As people come to understand the power of it, everyone's going to care.

00:08.200 --> 00:15.000
What we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive of.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.300
While many things stagnate, the unforgivable thing that's stagnated,

00:19.300 --> 00:24.500
the singular unforgivable thing is our understanding of the most basic notion of who we are.

00:24.500 --> 00:32.900
If we are going to, every time there's a border dispute, go to a thermonuclear standoff.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.500
It's just Russian roulette with smaller and smaller numbers of empty chambers.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.500
These are the precursors of genocide, make no mistake.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.200
You're friendly college students with blue hair chanting from the river to the sea

00:44.200 --> 00:46.900
or talking about the deaths of people.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.400
People will hear that and they'll say,

00:48.400 --> 00:51.700
Oh my God, Eric, you're spreading distrust and fear.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.300
I'm a pastor.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.900
Shoot the messenger all you want.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.600
All right.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.200
All right.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.000
Welcome back.

01:02.000 --> 01:02.800
Welcome back.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.300
Hello, my fellow CCP member.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.500
CCP member is male, but I sponsor money.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.100
It's fucking sweet, bro.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.400
What's up, comrade?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.100
What's up, comrades?

01:12.100 --> 01:12.800
That's right.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.900
Okay, let's get into it.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.700
Let's jump straight in.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.600
Let's give a little background on the on the subject of today's episode.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.000
Sure.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.200
Big favorite of mine.

01:25.200 --> 01:36.500
Mr. Eric Weinstein, Los Angeles, Los Angeles born a mathematician specializing in mathematical physics.

01:36.500 --> 01:45.500
Also an economist, a commentator, gained prominence as a managing director of teal capital.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.800
Investment firm founded by Peter teal, who we mentioned a few times already.

01:50.800 --> 01:57.200
Additionally, he's known for his involvement in the intellectual dark web.

01:57.200 --> 02:03.200
And he's been featured on various podcasts and platforms discussing topics,

02:03.200 --> 02:07.400
ranging from economics and science to culture and politics.

02:07.400 --> 02:15.200
So where does your introduction to Mr. Eric Weinstein start?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.500
Random short clips from Joe Rogan experience.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.400
That's for one.

02:18.400 --> 02:26.700
Secondly, he made a lot of interesting comments, including the, you know, in in those podcasts,

02:26.700 --> 02:32.500
including the one that we watched with Clint about Chris Williamson about, you know, the virus.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.300
Yeah, that was I found out that was very interesting.

02:36.300 --> 02:40.600
Overall, like also he started the proto, proto.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.100
A podcast, right?

02:42.100 --> 02:44.000
But I think that's no longer available.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.400
Yeah, it's defunct.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.600
It's just on hold.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.900
It's been on hold for a while.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.300
The portal, the portal, the portal.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.500
Yeah, they they stopped.

02:51.500 --> 02:57.800
I mean, they him, he stopped doing it just as the epidemic was gathering speed because

02:57.800 --> 03:01.200
Brett was his brother, Brett Weinstein.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.300
He was running his mouth a lot.

03:03.300 --> 03:10.800
I think he was actually the biggest advocates for the lot for the dangers of, you know,

03:10.800 --> 03:14.000
against the response of the for the pandemic.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.800
And he got not canceled, but he kind of his channel got demonetized.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.300
So Eric stopped.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.000
I think he only did 20 or 30 episodes.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.100
Have you seen any?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.400
Oh, no, I haven't.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.300
But I just know they exist.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.600
Yeah, it's it's still on.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.000
You can still see it.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.900
It's less than 30 episodes.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.700
Very good podcast, maybe even the best one I've ever seen.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.100
Right.

03:36.100 --> 03:42.300
Great guests, the usual bunch and some new faces that I haven't seen anywhere else.

03:42.300 --> 03:46.400
It's movie directors, sports personalities, porn stars.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.000
Oh, nice.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.500
Riley Reid.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.900
Oh, she she was on there and Riley Reid was a she's fairly new, right?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.400
Or is she like our cheaped milk status already?

03:56.400 --> 04:01.000
She she's she's young.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.400
I know that she's not a mouth yet.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.600
Don't ask me how I know.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.700
But I'm familiar with her work.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.700
Nice.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.700
Yeah, me as well.

04:10.700 --> 04:16.400
I think I first saw him on on on Rogan and on the Rubin report.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.900
They were podcast.

04:17.900 --> 04:23.800
I think he was the first time I saw he was there on with Peterson.

04:23.800 --> 04:29.700
I think it's the first time I saw Peterson listening to somebody like giving them their full attention.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.300
Who is this guy?

04:31.300 --> 04:33.700
And then later on, I saw him on on Lex.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.400
He's been on Lex like five, four, five times now.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.600
That's where I really got into him and recently on Chris Williams and podcast.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
Very, very good.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.000
Very excellent, excellent conversations.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I like the fact that, you know, how we introduced him.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
We introduced him in a style as if like he's right here with us.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
Of course, he's you know, Eric, we all good.

04:55.400 --> 05:01.100
Yeah, I was like, he doesn't want people to know that he come to China.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.800
Anyways, that's a so what's a what's a dark?

05:04.800 --> 05:09.200
Internet, internet, the intellectual dark web, intellectual dark web.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
Okay.

05:10.200 --> 05:17.900
Intellectual dark web was first jokingly coined by Weinstein himself in the mid 2010s.

05:17.900 --> 05:25.840
But the term became popular after after an article opinion piece was published in the

05:25.840 --> 05:32.280
New York Times by staff by correction by then staff editor Barry Weiss in the New York

05:32.280 --> 05:36.540
Times titled meet the renegades of the intellectual dark web.

05:36.540 --> 05:42.060
So the the term itself, it's, it's supposed to describe the group of intellectuals or

05:42.060 --> 05:51.340
commentators that oppose ideas such as identity politics, political correctness and cancel

05:51.340 --> 05:56.880
culture in higher education and news media across Western countries.

05:56.880 --> 06:04.400
They are just famous for discussing ideas that are outside mainstream mainstream discourse.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.000
So who do you know from the intellectual dark web?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.080
Can you guess who's in it?

06:10.080 --> 06:15.600
I would say like, I don't know if anybody I don't know for sure if somebody's in it,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.280
but I can guess like, I mean, it's not like a real club.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.340
It was just a group of a group of people.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.780
I probably think like Chijic is probably in it.

06:24.780 --> 06:25.780
No.

06:25.780 --> 06:26.780
No, not Chijic.

06:26.780 --> 06:27.780
All right.

06:27.780 --> 06:28.780
Jordan Peterson.

06:28.780 --> 06:33.140
Peterson is Sam Harrison, Sam Harris, right?

06:33.140 --> 06:38.100
The Weinstein Brothers, the Weinstein Brothers, Ben Shapiro, Douglas Murray, Douglas Murray

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
are a few of these.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.700
So the entire podcast podcast.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.700
Exactly.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.700
Exactly.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.700
Exactly.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.700
There's Christina Hoff summers.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.020
I think she's a philosopher slash author.

06:49.020 --> 06:55.920
Like I said, they were, they had in common what they were against, but some internal

06:55.920 --> 07:06.000
and external factors, mainly the 2016 presidential U.S. presidential election and the COVID again,

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
correction, the response to the COVID-19 epidemic are said to have caused some internal fractures

07:12.000 --> 07:14.200
within the group.

07:14.200 --> 07:19.300
And some other stuff, because you have on one side, you have Sam Harris, who's a big

07:19.300 --> 07:25.720
atheist in the same group with Peterson, who's a, you know, basically a Christian.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.940
Basically a full blown Christian right now.

07:28.940 --> 07:34.380
And I think they also, I think COVID was one of the breaking points for them, especially

07:34.380 --> 07:35.380
with Sam Harris.

07:35.380 --> 07:41.460
He really distanced himself from the Weinstein Brothers, from Brett mainly and criticized

07:41.460 --> 07:48.040
him a lot him and both him and Rogan for what they did during the pandemic.

07:48.040 --> 07:54.600
And also they disagree, I think on free speech as well, on the levels of free speech, you

07:54.600 --> 07:59.720
have the Weinstein Brothers who are not like free speech absolutists where you have Rogan

07:59.720 --> 08:03.080
and let's say, especially Ben Shapiro, who really are.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.200
So there's like a lot of, I mean, the gang fell apart.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
Yeah.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Yeah.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Yeah.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
Yeah.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
Yeah.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.880
They got popularized like that.

08:12.880 --> 08:20.900
And if you think about it for the past, I would say the past five to eight years.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.740
I think Joe Rogan put it very beautifully.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.620
It's like we need to stop called mainstream media, mainstream media because they're not

08:26.620 --> 08:27.620
big anymore.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.420
They're corporate media right now.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.020
Like everybody legacy media, the legacy media.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.020
Exactly.

08:34.020 --> 08:40.420
Now, more people are interested in what's going on on the internet and on the TV or

08:40.420 --> 08:42.660
on the newspaper, on the magazines,

08:42.660 --> 08:45.900
but for the past eight to five to eight years,

08:45.900 --> 08:47.700
we see all these intellectuals,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.740
they became like celebrities,

08:49.740 --> 08:51.780
like they became like rock stars.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.060
You know, they can go on tours,

08:53.060 --> 08:57.340
they sell out stadiums and theaters to give out speech.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.060
I think that's generally a good thing.

09:00.060 --> 09:02.460
I would say it's like nothing against Taylor Swift

09:02.460 --> 09:05.660
or Ariana Grande, but it's like, you know,

09:07.300 --> 09:09.140
I know they make good music,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.180
but at the same times,

09:10.180 --> 09:11.900
like there are very important people

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
that are spreading these like very important ideas,

09:13.900 --> 09:16.900
but they need, they finally gain that necessary,

09:16.900 --> 09:19.140
you know, attention from the general public.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.460
So I think it's a good thing overall.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.860
And by the way, it's a,

09:22.860 --> 09:25.260
since we touched on the COVID a lot, you know,

09:25.260 --> 09:29.340
Eric Dina, Chris Williamson podcast, like he,

09:29.340 --> 09:31.540
I think he was the first person that I heard

09:31.540 --> 09:33.820
that brought up that the US sponsored

09:33.820 --> 09:37.940
that the COVID research in Wuhan lab and then,

09:37.940 --> 09:40.860
and he was asking the questions, like, did we started it?

09:40.860 --> 09:42.940
Like, you know, that was the first person

09:42.940 --> 09:43.900
that I heard like, you know,

09:43.900 --> 09:45.780
a proper intellectual talking about that.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.140
So yeah, that's a, that's another thing.

09:49.140 --> 09:52.020
Yeah, like we did on that episode,

09:52.020 --> 09:53.700
we did on the podcast.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.380
I think you said it right that time,

09:56.380 --> 09:59.740
like there's a hunger in the general public,

09:59.740 --> 10:03.100
like you said a hunger for insights.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.740
So yeah, they definitely provided that,

10:06.740 --> 10:08.380
that this collective,

10:08.380 --> 10:11.180
but I heard Rogan at one point saying,

10:11.180 --> 10:12.980
talking disparagingly about it, you know,

10:12.980 --> 10:15.060
it seemed like they were, when you,

10:15.060 --> 10:17.860
when you say this IDW intellectual dark web,

10:17.860 --> 10:19.340
it seemed like there were like some group

10:19.340 --> 10:21.380
of superheroes or something.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.540
Because that, that New York times piece that came out,

10:24.540 --> 10:27.780
there was like, I saw like some,

10:27.780 --> 10:29.860
some scanned versions on it online,

10:29.860 --> 10:33.540
like a spread, they did this photo shoot really dramatic.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.380
All of them like singled out,

10:35.380 --> 10:39.660
like posing in front of some mysterious backdrops.

10:39.660 --> 10:43.660
It's a nighttime with the stars in the nature desert.

10:43.660 --> 10:47.580
It's, it's for, it's theoretical.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.580
Yeah, very, very theatrical.

10:49.580 --> 10:53.660
Yeah, but they fell apart even though I, like I said,

10:53.660 --> 10:57.300
that the biggest one was Sam Harris distancing himself

10:57.300 --> 11:01.260
due to the, because a lot of them supported Trump,

11:01.260 --> 11:02.940
even though like we don't support Trump,

11:02.940 --> 11:06.940
but you know, the lesser of two evils and paraphrasing.

11:06.940 --> 11:09.260
So because of that, and because of COVID,

11:09.260 --> 11:13.380
Brett and his wife, they have that dark horse podcast.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.180
And during the pandemic,

11:15.180 --> 11:17.900
they had, I think like bi-weekly episodes

11:17.900 --> 11:19.740
for like a year and a half.

11:19.740 --> 11:21.660
I mean, the podcast is still on,

11:21.660 --> 11:25.900
but their whole content was putting down the,

11:25.900 --> 11:29.180
I mean, the response to the pandemic should be told.

11:29.180 --> 11:34.180
Both of them, I think by trade are evolutionary biologists.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.220
So they kind of know what they're talking about in a way.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.500
So what were they suggesting?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.380
Like, you know, stop quarantining people.

11:41.380 --> 11:42.220
Like stop.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.220
Stop quarantining people.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.060
Stop the lockdown.

11:44.060 --> 11:44.900
The thing with the masks,

11:44.900 --> 11:48.580
be upfront about the origins of COVID enough

11:48.580 --> 11:51.460
with the lockdown, don't get vaccinated

11:51.460 --> 11:56.220
because it's gonna produce some bad responses.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.260
Right.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.380
Lots of stuff.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.660
Like really contrary.

11:59.660 --> 12:04.180
And I'm not saying I'm not a doctor or a scientist.

12:04.180 --> 12:07.740
There's some, obviously, there must be some truth, you know,

12:07.740 --> 12:12.420
in what they said, I think they were proven right.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.540
But at the time, I don't think they were helping

12:15.540 --> 12:16.740
with the whole thing.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.300
So they got demonetized very quick.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.060
You know, two things about intellectuals.

12:21.060 --> 12:25.580
The first of all, it's really difficult for them to form

12:25.580 --> 12:27.740
sort of some sort of alliances, you know,

12:27.740 --> 12:29.300
on every single aspect of it.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.140
Exactly.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.780
You know, because they're so smart, you know,

12:31.780 --> 12:33.900
they look at everything issue by issue.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.060
You know, when you are like that,

12:38.060 --> 12:41.540
you became a very unreliable ally, right?

12:41.540 --> 12:44.100
So that's an idea that I think Chris Williamson

12:44.100 --> 12:45.780
first brought up.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.100
At least that's the first time I heard it.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.100
And the secondly is that because they value their thoughts

12:52.460 --> 12:56.500
and truth a little bit too much.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.500
So in a crisis like that, I'm pretty sure everybody,

13:01.660 --> 13:05.220
the majority of them said whatever they feel like to say

13:05.220 --> 13:07.100
for the betterment of the general public,

13:07.100 --> 13:09.860
but the general public is not gonna take that

13:09.860 --> 13:11.860
in a way that they hope they will take.

13:11.860 --> 13:16.860
So, you know, I would understand like why they got

13:17.340 --> 13:20.460
demonetized and why, you know, a lot of people seeing them

13:20.500 --> 13:22.580
as like, you know, public enemies

13:22.580 --> 13:25.780
or whatever intellectual enemies on that front, you know,

13:25.780 --> 13:27.660
there's definitely a price you should pay

13:27.660 --> 13:29.260
when you are that smart.

13:29.260 --> 13:33.700
So yeah, there's a, but what I thought about the, you know,

13:33.700 --> 13:36.300
this group of people, I think that, you know,

13:36.300 --> 13:39.140
when I was doing a little bit of research on, you know,

13:39.140 --> 13:41.660
all these podcast intellectuals, right?

13:41.660 --> 13:43.500
The people that go on podcasts regularly,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.660
they, you know, doing shows or,

13:46.100 --> 13:51.100
they aren't necessarily the most welcome figures

13:53.260 --> 13:54.980
in the academia.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.340
That's what I found out.

13:56.340 --> 13:59.700
You know, like a lot of people in the academia,

13:59.700 --> 14:00.540
they are-

14:00.540 --> 14:01.380
Like exiled from academia?

14:01.380 --> 14:02.380
Yeah.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.020
A lot of them that they're, you know, like,

14:04.020 --> 14:06.100
I think Eric, one thing, one thing he talked about,

14:06.100 --> 14:09.940
like he, something that happened between him and Harvard,

14:09.940 --> 14:11.740
you know, a bread, obviously.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.200
Jordan Peterson lost his tenure, like in lessons,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.160
like all that shit.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.760
Like, and then there were group,

14:18.760 --> 14:21.840
the majority of the academia, like, you know,

14:22.680 --> 14:26.480
the key opinion that they have is like,

14:26.480 --> 14:31.040
they are famous for, they have this,

14:31.040 --> 14:34.200
they gain the glamour by tackling some very controversial

14:34.200 --> 14:36.360
issues, but when it comes down to

14:37.360 --> 14:39.440
doing research in their field, they're like,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.160
they're not that, you know, far head or whatever.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
So there is definitely an idea of the renegades

14:44.360 --> 14:45.920
versus the establishment.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.960
It's weird that they were all united by one of the things

14:49.960 --> 14:51.880
that they were united behind is, you know,

14:51.880 --> 14:54.640
cancel culture within higher education.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.440
And most, if not all of them ended up being exiled

14:58.440 --> 14:59.280
from academia.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.880
Exiled, exactly.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.720
Maybe not,

15:03.440 --> 15:04.360
what's his name?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.720
The atheist, the new atheist, what's his name?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.080
Didn't my-

15:11.080 --> 15:11.920
Dawkins?

15:11.920 --> 15:12.760
That's an old-

15:12.760 --> 15:13.600
No, no, no.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.520
Sam Harris, yeah.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.080
Sam Harris, Sam Harris.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.240
And I think I saw something,

15:19.680 --> 15:24.680
do you remember this was just like before Trump,

15:24.760 --> 15:27.000
maybe like a year or maybe the same year

15:27.000 --> 15:30.520
that this term started gathering some speed,

15:30.520 --> 15:32.200
this intellectual dark web?

15:32.200 --> 15:35.000
Do you remember that interview that Sam Harris,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.600
I think it was Bill Maher with Ben Affleck?

15:38.600 --> 15:39.440
Have you seen that?

15:39.440 --> 15:40.280
Oh yeah, I've seen it.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.440
Like Ben Affleck went Batman mode on it.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was at that time.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.720
He was a Muslim question.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.880
Right, he was like,

15:51.160 --> 15:52.840
I think he was accusing a lot of guys

15:52.840 --> 15:55.760
on their shows like being Islamic phobic, you know?

15:55.760 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, I know that.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
What about it?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.320
I think I just remembered that

15:59.320 --> 16:02.920
because you know, that started at the same time as this.

16:02.920 --> 16:07.240
Yeah, it's weird that they all got thrown together

16:07.240 --> 16:08.760
in this-

16:08.760 --> 16:10.320
I think a perfect counter example

16:10.320 --> 16:11.680
would be Andrew Schuberman.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.440
Like I don't think he's part of the dark web, right?

16:15.440 --> 16:19.160
No, he's not, but I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.280
I mean, we can put him in the same pot with Gorgons.

16:23.280 --> 16:28.200
There's probably a new batch of renegades.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.200
We can call him intellectuals,

16:30.200 --> 16:34.080
but like improvement gurus.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.360
The all the information I found about Andrew

16:39.360 --> 16:41.200
is overwhelmingly positive.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.360
Like both from the general public,

16:43.360 --> 16:46.760
like how many we have the Andrew Schuberman husband now

16:46.760 --> 16:48.080
and also from the academia.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.800
Like he's a very solid researcher.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.120
But at the same time, like he's very smart

16:54.120 --> 16:56.800
that he never talked about any controversial issues.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.200
And people are,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.480
I know there are a lot of people are very eager

17:01.480 --> 17:05.760
to sort of construct a trap for him

17:05.760 --> 17:07.760
so that he will accidentally say something

17:07.760 --> 17:09.640
that he wasn't planning on saying

17:09.640 --> 17:12.920
so we can take him down or put him in one of those categories.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.360
But so far, the guy's been smart.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.320
Like he's been on top of his game.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.080
So it just shows you he's like, yeah, that's a thing.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.840
They bring you up and then they put you down.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.680
Exactly.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.320
I told you, I think he's,

17:25.320 --> 17:29.640
we're gonna see him come out as a closeted Christian.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.640
Like big time.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
Right.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.920
Do you feel like, you know, I got this feeling,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.360
I don't know what you feel about it.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.320
And I feel like Eric Weinstein

17:38.320 --> 17:41.360
is just one of those smartest people on the planet

17:41.360 --> 17:43.880
that his resume doesn't feel real to me.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.880
Like I understand like you started off your academic career

17:47.880 --> 17:48.760
with mathematics

17:48.760 --> 17:51.680
and that's basically the universal language of science

17:51.680 --> 17:54.280
so we can tap into all the fields.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.120
I understand that.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.080
But to become a theoretical physicist,

17:58.080 --> 18:02.120
a mathematical physicist and economist at the same time,

18:02.120 --> 18:05.600
that just like for me, it would be like Andrew Huberman

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
was a neurologist,

18:06.600 --> 18:08.520
but at the same time, he's also a economist.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.640
Like what, you know what I mean?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.920
You should, the first episode of the portal

18:13.920 --> 18:17.680
is Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.880
That's the interview where I heard that

18:20.880 --> 18:22.560
when you subtract all the screens,

18:22.560 --> 18:23.600
where's the 99.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.520
He brought a similar point in the Chris Williamson podcast.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.360
You should look at that.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.480
It's a great, great conversation.

18:29.480 --> 18:34.120
He was, he was canceled as well by the left for being,

18:34.120 --> 18:36.280
you know, accused of all these things,

18:36.280 --> 18:40.240
you know, bigot and Nazi, even though he's a gay

18:40.240 --> 18:44.600
and in the open gay, I mean, gay, homosexual,

18:44.600 --> 18:46.320
but they put him down.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.960
They found a way to put him down.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.000
I mean, I don't think he cares.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.040
He has the fuck you money.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.320
So, and the credentials.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.960
So I don't really think he's bothered too much about it.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.320
Speaking of science, how did you,

18:59.320 --> 19:03.520
how was your, what's your experience with physics

19:03.520 --> 19:06.680
during your formative study years?

19:06.680 --> 19:08.360
It was a, it was a mess.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.600
Like I, the years I was there,

19:11.480 --> 19:16.360
I think that the string theorists were doing the last push.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.000
You know, that's when you see Brian Gray

19:18.000 --> 19:19.960
and all those cock-cool.

19:19.960 --> 19:20.960
Mitchell cock-cool.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.800
Mitchell cock-cool.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.560
Like all these professors, they were doing like

19:23.560 --> 19:25.880
a lot of documentaries about string theories.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.640
They were going on TED talks.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.920
And then back then I was like, you know,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.600
I thought it was just try to promote science.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.800
But now I thought about it.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.920
I think that definitely did it to gather more attention

19:36.920 --> 19:39.120
and also try to grab more funds.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.680
It was a mess because I remembered,

19:43.680 --> 19:46.280
I talked with a lot of my schoolmates

19:46.280 --> 19:49.640
from the physics department and they're not buying,

19:49.640 --> 19:52.680
it was never part of the formal, you know,

19:52.680 --> 19:55.080
education curriculum where like, you know,

19:55.080 --> 19:57.720
you study general relativity and quantum physics

19:57.720 --> 19:59.960
and then you have to learn a string theory.

19:59.960 --> 20:04.320
It was a never, it was more of a thought experiment

20:04.320 --> 20:05.160
for a lot of people.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.880
Like they never took it very seriously.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.040
Okay, I want to talk about that.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.240
But what I meant, how did you,

20:10.240 --> 20:11.800
did you have physics during your,

20:11.800 --> 20:13.560
in high school here in China or?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.200
Oh yeah, like since middle school.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.200
Did you do well?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.040
Yeah, pretty, pretty okay.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.880
Man, I barely passed physics.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.720
Really?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.960
I clawed my way through high school in physics.

20:23.960 --> 20:28.960
I had like all like these social sciences and languages.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.480
History, geography, everything.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.440
I was like a grade A student,

20:34.440 --> 20:38.160
but like math and physics, barely a D.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.280
I mean the equivalent,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.600
a Serbian equivalent of a D.

20:41.600 --> 20:46.600
I seriously, I crawled my way through those classes.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I mean, I was just,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.440
I was thinking today if my professors

20:51.440 --> 20:54.880
from high school and university could see me now

20:55.880 --> 20:58.480
about to talk about string theory,

20:58.520 --> 21:00.040
I would love to see their reaction.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.560
Right, that's amazing.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.920
It's like I had a,

21:04.920 --> 21:06.800
I would say like a high school physics for me

21:06.800 --> 21:08.600
was really tough.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.960
Like I didn't do that well.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.240
Like when I was in middle school, I did pretty okay.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.360
But high school, the Chinese high school physics

21:14.360 --> 21:16.640
is just full of like these pretty nuanced

21:16.640 --> 21:19.620
and unnecessarily complicated problems

21:19.620 --> 21:20.460
that you have to solve.

21:20.460 --> 21:23.320
And then there's nothing interesting in there.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.160
College, I think the Americans,

21:26.160 --> 21:27.560
they don't teach that hard.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.040
At least for public undergraduate studies,

21:32.040 --> 21:37.000
but I always had an interest in the ideas in physics,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.240
but I just don't want to turn myself into a physicist.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.320
Like I feel like that's really, really, really stressful.

21:44.840 --> 21:48.680
But yeah, like, but like things told to those guys,

21:48.680 --> 21:51.920
like everybody was, you know, it's very cultivating, you know?

21:51.920 --> 21:54.280
Do you think that we are like live amount

21:54.280 --> 21:56.940
like 11 fucking strings around us like all the time?

21:56.980 --> 21:59.140
That's crazy.

21:59.140 --> 22:04.140
So I was, he always, Weinstein always talks about string theory.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.820
Every time he shows up on a podcast or a lecture

22:07.820 --> 22:09.140
or something.

22:09.140 --> 22:12.540
So I've been rewatching and trying to figure out

22:12.540 --> 22:14.540
what he's saying.

22:14.540 --> 22:18.260
He's basically saying that string theory doesn't work

22:18.260 --> 22:23.260
neither technically nor in the approach of its physicists.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.140
So the point that he's trying to make,

22:26.140 --> 22:27.740
the way I understood it,

22:27.740 --> 22:31.940
is that string theorists are very arrogant

22:31.940 --> 22:34.980
in their approach in the way that they don't,

22:34.980 --> 22:36.500
they don't want to recognize

22:36.500 --> 22:39.700
that there might be something else outside their field.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.660
And he says that this approach of theirs

22:42.660 --> 22:44.580
is unscientific and analytical

22:44.580 --> 22:47.380
because they refuse to admit that they might be wrong.

22:47.380 --> 22:51.060
And like you said, despite all this money spent,

22:51.060 --> 22:53.140
brain power and time invested

22:53.140 --> 22:55.140
during the last half a century,

22:55.140 --> 22:59.060
the field hasn't produced any tangible results

22:59.060 --> 23:02.140
outside of some theoretical stuff,

23:02.140 --> 23:04.900
nothing that's applicable in the real world.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.740
That's how I understood it.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.660
I watched, I used to watch a lot of like

23:08.660 --> 23:11.460
these scientific documentaries like the Neil,

23:12.820 --> 23:13.780
Neil deGrasse Tyson?

23:13.780 --> 23:16.180
Neil deGrasse Tyson, like I need to repeat a name

23:16.180 --> 23:17.780
a hundred times so I can memorize it.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.940
Also alongside with Tarke Clarkson,

23:19.940 --> 23:21.020
Carlson, like-

23:21.020 --> 23:22.100
Kelly Clarkson?

23:22.100 --> 23:23.660
Chris Tarke or whatever.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.140
But anyway, so I watched a lot of these documentaries

23:28.140 --> 23:29.660
and what I found out was that

23:30.500 --> 23:33.820
their starting point is definitely very, very interesting.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.220
So you have 11 universal constants,

23:36.220 --> 23:39.500
like the constant for gravity or whatever.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.660
And then it's like maybe that's,

23:40.660 --> 23:42.580
one constant represents the dimensions

23:42.580 --> 23:47.420
or we have 11 dimensions at the very macroscopic level.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.540
And I'm like, yeah, at a quantum level,

23:49.540 --> 23:51.060
it's just these strings reverberate

23:51.060 --> 23:53.340
at a very specific frequency

23:53.340 --> 23:54.540
and I'll create a constant.

23:54.540 --> 23:57.380
I'm like, all right, cool, we'll understand that.

23:57.380 --> 23:58.780
That's very interesting.

23:58.780 --> 24:02.540
But then again, if you look at how string theory

24:04.060 --> 24:08.100
square off in front of other really dominant

24:09.180 --> 24:10.580
physics theories, right?

24:10.580 --> 24:13.860
Like the general relativity, the quantum mechanics,

24:13.860 --> 24:16.140
like it was way, way, way lower.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.980
I don't think that Einstein started the relativity theory,

24:21.020 --> 24:25.260
the theory of relativity like off of the imaginary,

24:25.260 --> 24:27.420
imagination at that level.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.060
And then compared to string theory,

24:30.060 --> 24:32.500
and then the other two were like really,

24:32.500 --> 24:35.700
really well grounded, you can use it.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.900
I think that GPS use that,

24:37.900 --> 24:40.260
the general theory of relativity

24:40.260 --> 24:43.060
and then the quantum mechanics were used

24:43.060 --> 24:45.460
creating quantum computers now.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.820
But like, even though they make a breakthrough,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.060
like exactly like you said,

24:49.060 --> 24:50.340
what are we gonna do with it?

24:50.820 --> 24:52.620
Make a fucking quantum violin,

24:52.620 --> 24:54.620
all of the fucking strings or whatever?

24:54.620 --> 24:58.860
Yeah, he's saying that they basically took the spotlight

24:58.860 --> 25:02.180
away within physics from theoretical physics

25:02.180 --> 25:06.260
all the way to just purely on string theory.

25:06.260 --> 25:09.900
And they're not asking these big questions,

25:09.900 --> 25:13.780
ideas of the universe, whether or not we can traverse it,

25:13.780 --> 25:17.820
leave the planet, find new sources of energy,

25:17.860 --> 25:22.540
become a multi-plan, multi-solar civilization

25:22.540 --> 25:24.020
or something like that.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.940
That's what I find interesting about him.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.580
When he talks about, I think I heard him,

25:29.580 --> 25:31.340
when he talks about Einstein,

25:31.340 --> 25:34.180
he said that this whole idea,

25:34.180 --> 25:37.420
I'm not sure if this is Einstein's concept,

25:37.420 --> 25:42.420
so that's what I, but this space time.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.780
Is this Einstein's space time?

25:45.780 --> 25:49.420
That he said this numerous times,

25:49.420 --> 25:53.540
he says space time, it's a map, it's not a territory.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.460
And that we are, that's we,

25:55.460 --> 25:59.060
that scientists, physicists are shackled by this.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.660
They're not thinking outside the box,

26:00.660 --> 26:03.340
what might be outside of that.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.140
I really like how he phrased that.

26:05.140 --> 26:08.380
Right, I just, it always amazed me to,

26:08.380 --> 26:10.620
you remember who was that guy's name

26:10.620 --> 26:11.700
that he constantly mentioned,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.740
like the most feared character, you know?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.380
I don't know, but I know who you mean.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.100
He's just retiring now.

26:17.100 --> 26:20.580
Yeah, he's part of that whole string theory,

26:20.580 --> 26:21.740
like bandwagon, right?

26:21.740 --> 26:25.060
Yeah, he's the Godfather.

26:25.060 --> 26:28.060
Right, and I feel like there is a,

26:30.020 --> 26:34.700
there is a sense of urgency among physicists.

26:34.700 --> 26:38.420
Like, you know, we haven't progressed any further

26:38.420 --> 26:41.780
after the discovery of, you know,

26:41.780 --> 26:45.580
what Einstein discovered and also the quantum physics.

26:45.580 --> 26:47.460
And then they feel this sense of urgency

26:47.460 --> 26:49.740
and then the string theorists are just, you know,

26:49.740 --> 26:52.220
according to Eric, it's like they exactly,

26:52.220 --> 26:54.100
like you said, they waste a lot of resource

26:54.100 --> 26:57.140
and funding and spotlight and attention

26:57.140 --> 27:01.900
on a concept that's probably not gonna lead us to anywhere.

27:01.900 --> 27:05.900
But at the same time, I always feel like, you know,

27:07.900 --> 27:10.420
maybe for him, this is very, very important,

27:10.420 --> 27:13.620
a very, you know, potent issue.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.860
But for us, like, you know, we don't understand how much.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.220
It's like we really, really, really hope to see

27:19.220 --> 27:23.180
that maybe, you know, the conventional physicists

27:23.180 --> 27:25.340
can make some sort of breakthrough

27:25.340 --> 27:28.260
and then just like use actual signs to be done,

27:28.260 --> 27:31.860
like these string theorists, like as they claim,

27:31.860 --> 27:34.540
like in the end, like we can move on for this.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.140
But like when I was listening to the podcast,

27:36.140 --> 27:38.740
I'm like, yeah, I understand that you are not happy

27:38.740 --> 27:40.620
about this, but how's that gonna relate it

27:40.620 --> 27:41.540
to my mortgage, man?

27:41.540 --> 27:44.860
Like, you know, I really wish I could know.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.660
Okay, but he thinks he thinks big.

27:46.660 --> 27:47.900
He thinks. Yeah, he definitely.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.260
Very, very, very, very big.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.980
I don't know when I think about physics,

27:51.980 --> 27:54.540
I'm like Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project,

27:54.540 --> 27:57.180
the atom bomb, and that's it.

27:57.180 --> 27:59.700
Like you said, I know GPS systems,

27:59.700 --> 28:04.100
they function on some, they came from physics, right?

28:04.100 --> 28:04.940
All right, yeah.

28:04.940 --> 28:05.780
What else?

28:06.700 --> 28:09.820
I think that they found that like hard evidence

28:09.820 --> 28:13.340
on the astronauts in the International Space Stations,

28:13.340 --> 28:17.060
like how slow, how much like there are times.

28:17.060 --> 28:17.900
Time dilation.

28:17.900 --> 28:18.740
Time dilation.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:20.020 --> 28:22.700
Gave us a solid, good movie called Interstellar,

28:22.700 --> 28:23.700
that's for sure.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.540
Yeah, some physicists worked on that.

28:25.540 --> 28:27.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:27.380 --> 28:28.700
The rendering of that black hole,

28:28.700 --> 28:30.340
like I think it took them like months

28:30.340 --> 28:31.700
to render the black hole like that.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.580
And then it was the most accurate depiction

28:33.580 --> 28:35.380
of what a black hole really looks like.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.940
Apparently Oppenheimer, he was the first one

28:37.940 --> 28:39.700
to propose the existence of black holes.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.620
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.700
Yeah, you were absolutely right.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.980
I was shocked when I was watching Oppenheimer

28:46.980 --> 28:48.340
and he said like,

28:48.340 --> 28:49.180
I'll check it.

28:49.180 --> 28:50.020
There's a small comment.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:51.380 --> 28:54.620
But like most people sort of give Stephen Hawking

28:54.620 --> 28:57.980
a little bit too much credit on the whole black hole thing,

28:57.980 --> 29:00.980
but like Hawking discovered a Hawking radiation,

29:00.980 --> 29:02.020
which is also important.

29:02.020 --> 29:04.180
Like he basically said like there,

29:04.220 --> 29:05.820
maybe we can get some information

29:05.820 --> 29:08.460
out of the black hole and it's not completely black.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.580
And then he actually,

29:11.580 --> 29:13.100
we found evidence about that.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.460
Black holes can evaporate,

29:14.460 --> 29:17.940
but yeah, Oppenheimer was definitely the first guy.

29:17.940 --> 29:21.540
I would say that he was one of the group of scientists

29:21.540 --> 29:24.100
who went that far and started to think

29:24.100 --> 29:27.660
that maybe we can find an object that dense

29:27.660 --> 29:29.740
in a universe that you can stop spacetime,

29:29.740 --> 29:32.380
which is a weird thing to say if you think about it.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.780
It's super weird.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.940
It breaks my mind every time I try to think about it.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.660
Last few nights, I've been trying to listen

29:38.660 --> 29:41.180
to some physics podcasts.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.020
It's fascinating, but as soon as I catch on

29:46.020 --> 29:47.460
to something they're talking about

29:47.460 --> 29:49.300
and start thinking about it,

29:49.300 --> 29:51.580
the conversation just moves on away from me.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.300
By the time I get back, I'm already lost.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.500
It's like weightlifting for a brain sort of.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.140
I mean, the most I know about physics

29:59.140 --> 30:01.380
is from the Big Bang Theory.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.020
Yeah.

30:04.020 --> 30:06.980
So one of the, I guess not one of the,

30:06.980 --> 30:09.900
one of the the most famous,

30:09.900 --> 30:14.900
most notable idea that Weinstein has is geometric unity.

30:16.020 --> 30:19.140
That it's a, how do you say?

30:19.140 --> 30:22.260
It's a theoretical framework that he introduced

30:22.260 --> 30:24.540
in this mathematical physics.

30:24.540 --> 30:27.980
So from what I understand, he is trying to,

30:28.740 --> 30:30.660
this idea of geometric unity,

30:30.660 --> 30:34.780
he's trying to merge Einstein's theory

30:34.780 --> 30:36.500
of general relativity,

30:36.500 --> 30:40.340
which explains gravity on a large scale, right?

30:40.340 --> 30:43.380
With, like you said, with particle behavior,

30:43.380 --> 30:46.180
which deals with quantum mechanics,

30:46.180 --> 30:49.180
which deals with particle behavior on a small scale.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.780
And so far, this theory has been met

30:51.780 --> 30:54.540
with a little bit of skepticism, but also interest.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.900
And he's still working on it.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.460
I don't know if you remember,

30:57.460 --> 31:02.460
this was like the previous time Weinstein was on Rogan.

31:02.780 --> 31:06.420
He presented this idea.

31:07.980 --> 31:11.420
Anyone can see it, it's on pull that up Jamie.com.

31:13.260 --> 31:17.260
But it's, I mean, it's serious science.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.620
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend

31:18.620 --> 31:20.140
like I know what he's talking about,

31:20.140 --> 31:25.140
but he's trying to, I think he sees himself in this theory

31:25.420 --> 31:28.380
that he can make another breakthrough

31:28.380 --> 31:31.460
and walk in the footsteps maybe of Weinstein.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.420
So I guess that's what he's trying to do.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.540
I'm like, you know,

31:39.820 --> 31:41.460
to give a new map.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.420
Exactly.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.500
I think that the vibe I'm getting

31:45.500 --> 31:46.740
when he was talking about this

31:46.740 --> 31:49.300
in the Chris Williamson podcast was that,

31:50.260 --> 31:52.700
you know, that's why for me,

31:52.700 --> 31:55.740
like Brian Cox was still my favorite physicist.

31:56.940 --> 31:59.420
Are you sure it's Brian Cox?

31:59.420 --> 32:00.260
Brian Cox.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.940
I've heard you say this now a few times.

32:01.940 --> 32:02.940
Is it Cox?

32:02.940 --> 32:04.060
Yes, it is Cox.

32:04.060 --> 32:05.660
Is that the guy who's always smiling?

32:05.660 --> 32:06.900
Yeah.

32:06.900 --> 32:07.740
C.O.X.

32:07.740 --> 32:08.580
Oh, okay.

32:08.580 --> 32:09.420
C.O.X.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.940
You know, like how else do you want to pronounce it?

32:11.940 --> 32:14.900
I also watched a few times, a physicist also,

32:14.900 --> 32:18.340
he was also on the podcast circuit, Brian Keating.

32:18.340 --> 32:19.660
There are a lot of Brian's in there.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.980
He's a colleague of Weinstein's,

32:21.980 --> 32:25.700
very, very cool guy, very interesting.

32:25.700 --> 32:29.060
But I don't, I hope that he can make some like contribution,

32:29.060 --> 32:32.820
but I would say that just based on his tone

32:32.820 --> 32:34.140
and all he described it,

32:34.140 --> 32:36.020
like all these big ass problems

32:36.020 --> 32:37.700
that he's tackling with right now.

32:39.860 --> 32:42.940
You know, one of my professors told me,

32:42.940 --> 32:44.820
it's like in academia,

32:45.820 --> 32:50.700
rarely you can find a area

32:50.700 --> 32:53.060
where you can build an entire building upon.

32:53.060 --> 32:56.660
Most people are just trying to add one additional brick

32:56.660 --> 32:59.220
to the pre-existing building at a time

32:59.220 --> 33:02.220
and then you would make the building as tall as possible.

33:02.220 --> 33:03.420
When he was talking like that,

33:03.420 --> 33:04.980
it really gives people the feeling

33:04.980 --> 33:09.300
that he found this new territory where you can,

33:09.300 --> 33:12.100
you know, there's a bright future ahead of this,

33:12.100 --> 33:14.740
but I was kind of skeptical.

33:14.740 --> 33:17.500
I know that for sure,

33:17.500 --> 33:19.180
his theory might be very brilliant,

33:19.180 --> 33:22.380
may make some really good contribution towards this,

33:22.380 --> 33:23.820
but I had the same,

33:23.820 --> 33:25.900
and I'm pretty happy for the fact

33:25.900 --> 33:28.420
that he was pretty passionate about this,

33:28.420 --> 33:32.340
but the thing I wanna say is that,

33:32.340 --> 33:34.980
don't expect that we can go to fucking Mars

33:34.980 --> 33:36.940
in two seconds in the next year or something.

33:36.940 --> 33:39.860
It's gonna take a colossal amount of effort.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.900
Yeah, but he's saying like, okay, we went to the moon,

33:41.900 --> 33:43.140
we can go to Mars,

33:43.140 --> 33:44.900
maybe one of the moons of Jupiter,

33:44.900 --> 33:46.940
and then what, like game over.

33:47.980 --> 33:50.860
So we probably do need somebody who's thinking

33:50.860 --> 33:52.220
that maybe it's not him,

33:52.220 --> 33:55.900
but I think maybe what he's trying to argue

33:55.900 --> 33:59.540
that the physics community should encourage

33:59.540 --> 34:02.700
outside the box thinkers and support them,

34:02.700 --> 34:04.460
because maybe these breakthroughs

34:04.460 --> 34:08.420
will come from one of these people who think like this.

34:08.420 --> 34:12.780
Then those who are indoctrinated into the field of string tier

34:12.820 --> 34:15.220
and just following the footsteps of those who can't be.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.420
Exactly, exactly.

34:16.420 --> 34:19.460
You need a lot, like a thousand bodies

34:19.460 --> 34:24.460
to basically form the foundation

34:24.500 --> 34:26.540
of just one significant breakthrough.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.780
And if you look at Einstein,

34:27.780 --> 34:30.500
he wasn't, he didn't came out of nowhere.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.660
He didn't come out of nowhere.

34:31.660 --> 34:35.340
Like he's breakthroughs also built upon

34:35.340 --> 34:39.460
like at least Newton's idea about gravity and all that.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.340
And then before him,

34:41.340 --> 34:46.340
I would say like the most common understanding

34:46.860 --> 34:50.340
about gravity was that gravity was a sort of like a field,

34:50.340 --> 34:52.740
like an electronic magnetic field.

34:52.740 --> 34:55.260
And then Einstein was basically saying like,

34:55.260 --> 34:57.540
probably it's not, it's something different.

34:57.540 --> 35:01.120
You know, so I'm definitely glad to see

35:01.120 --> 35:02.660
that he's still working on this problem.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.300
It's like, because I know a lot of people have quit.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.100
I think that a lot of string theorists,

35:08.100 --> 35:09.240
you know, who bought into this,

35:09.280 --> 35:11.720
a lot of them were once upon a time

35:11.720 --> 35:13.520
trying to solve this thing.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.880
Like they want to put their effort in,

35:14.880 --> 35:16.960
but it's just so damn difficult.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.480
And then they sort of, you know,

35:18.480 --> 35:19.320
if you think about it,

35:19.320 --> 35:22.000
string theory was originally also a thinking

35:22.000 --> 35:23.520
also after the box idea.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.360
Fringe, yeah.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.600
Yeah, so it's like.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.880
But yeah, like when you look at those old movies

35:30.880 --> 35:33.280
and those old books, you know, this is not the future.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.640
We were, I'm not gonna say promised,

35:35.640 --> 35:38.400
but that we all envisioned, you know,

35:38.400 --> 35:41.160
like Teal said, when you subtract all the screens,

35:41.160 --> 35:42.720
we're still living in 1970s.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.320
We haven't really made anything except these things.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.200
Yeah, exactly.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.760
This is the furthest we've, we haven't sent.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.960
I think a man hasn't been on the moon since 1972

35:52.960 --> 35:56.080
was the last manned moon mission.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.840
And, you know, this, the late mid sixties,

35:59.840 --> 36:03.860
we started this age of space exploration

36:03.860 --> 36:05.520
and then just withered out.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
Nothing happened.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.920
If your mask didn't reboot it,

36:08.920 --> 36:12.320
I mean, NASA basically clothed, you know,

36:12.320 --> 36:15.960
we're sending their astronauts to Russia to go to space.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.560
Yeah, there is a.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.760
What I'm trying to say, there's no,

36:18.760 --> 36:22.080
it seems like there's no imagination in science.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.440
There is no imagination.

36:23.440 --> 36:27.360
And I feel like there was just,

36:27.360 --> 36:30.240
science just went through a huge period of

36:32.240 --> 36:35.440
like self-indulged in depression, in a sense.

36:36.440 --> 36:41.120
Yeah, it's like, I know that NASA made a lot of,

36:41.120 --> 36:44.880
you know, NASA actually made a lot of progress

36:44.880 --> 36:47.160
in terms of, you know, we had a first picture

36:47.160 --> 36:48.560
of the black hole in 2016.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.160
That was huge.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.480
The detection of the gravitational waves,

36:52.480 --> 36:54.280
that's also huge.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.600
But we were just at that, I would say,

36:56.600 --> 37:00.040
it's like the darkness before the down type of time

37:00.040 --> 37:02.760
where, you know, everything seems so hopeless

37:03.040 --> 37:05.520
and boring that, you know,

37:06.520 --> 37:09.080
and every problem seems so urgent to solve

37:09.080 --> 37:11.880
and everybody's having this huge amount of stress

37:11.880 --> 37:13.560
on their shoulders.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.680
Yeah, we just need to get through that, but.

37:15.680 --> 37:20.160
When I, we talked about this ad nauseam,

37:20.160 --> 37:21.120
it's my new word.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.040
The three body problem.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.960
I mean, the ideas in those books are out there.

37:29.960 --> 37:30.800
Yeah.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.640
Fascinating.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.760
That's physics, right?

37:33.760 --> 37:35.240
Really, really interesting.

37:35.240 --> 37:39.240
The show is coming out next month, the Netflix version.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.560
I saw the trailer.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.440
I think they're doing all three books at the same time

37:43.440 --> 37:44.960
based on the trailer.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.920
I think so too.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.520
I think there were some elements from the other two books

37:48.520 --> 37:49.640
and they also brought it in.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.920
Like, I don't know if that's a good idea.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.720
Maybe from a narrative point of view,

37:54.720 --> 37:57.880
they want to set up some kind of cliffhangers.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.680
Like, you know, sometimes the TV shows does that,

38:00.680 --> 38:03.160
like show you something that wait down in the future

38:03.160 --> 38:05.520
and then bring back the story afterwards.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.560
Could be.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.400
Yeah.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.640
Okay, so let's connect all these two things,

38:09.640 --> 38:13.040
physics and the three body problem.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.000
For the past four years now,

38:15.000 --> 38:19.200
I think ever since he stopped doing the portal podcast,

38:19.200 --> 38:21.360
Weinstein has dedicated himself

38:21.360 --> 38:24.040
in investing the UFO phenomena.

38:24.040 --> 38:28.400
He has interacted with various experts in this field.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.480
And after four years,

38:31.480 --> 38:35.720
he says he remains skeptical about the existence

38:35.720 --> 38:37.760
of UFOs themselves.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.600
But that's...

38:38.600 --> 38:40.000
Just skeptical?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.320
Yeah, pessimistic skeptical.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.800
You know, they actually exist,

38:43.800 --> 38:46.680
but he points out there's like concrete evidence

38:46.680 --> 38:51.680
that points to existence of decades-long

38:52.560 --> 38:54.840
secret government programs

38:54.840 --> 38:58.440
that are shrouded in like UFO secrecy.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.320
And he says that these programs

39:01.320 --> 39:03.240
could actually might be just the front

39:03.240 --> 39:06.080
for testing new weapons

39:06.080 --> 39:09.480
or conducting retrieval missions behind enemy lines

39:09.480 --> 39:13.720
or experimenting with aerospace technology.

39:13.720 --> 39:18.120
And he said, even though he didn't see any concrete evidence,

39:18.120 --> 39:19.520
it's the only area,

39:19.520 --> 39:22.040
because you know, he's outspoken on all topics

39:22.040 --> 39:25.360
where he can't provide like a single explanation

39:25.360 --> 39:26.680
what's going on.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.960
And what is weird about it, and he mentioned it,

39:28.960 --> 39:32.440
and I also believe this is very weird,

39:32.440 --> 39:33.760
that you have in the United States,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.960
for example, for the last two years,

39:35.960 --> 39:37.320
you have these whistleblowers

39:37.320 --> 39:39.240
and all this news coming out.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.080
And the idea that the United States

39:42.080 --> 39:45.000
have lost control of their airspace

39:45.000 --> 39:47.440
has reached the highest level of US Congress

39:47.440 --> 39:49.280
and all these officials.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.040
And they are entertaining this idea.

39:52.040 --> 39:56.360
So either, like he said, bringing the scientists,

39:56.360 --> 40:01.360
debunk this in an afternoon, or sending the military.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.040
So which one is it?

40:03.040 --> 40:05.120
And they're not doing anything.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.600
It's like now wrapped up in all this bureaucracy

40:08.600 --> 40:12.320
and they made the aliens now kind of boring, you know?

40:12.320 --> 40:13.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.440
But something is going on there.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.280
There is a, that's actually a very strange thing.

40:18.280 --> 40:21.360
Like, did you ever watch one of those Congress hearings

40:21.360 --> 40:22.200
about that?

40:22.200 --> 40:24.000
Yes, I did, yeah, I watched the David Grosh one, yeah.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.720
Do you feel like it's so fucking surreal?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.240
It's uber bizarre.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.320
It's uber bizarre, right?

40:29.320 --> 40:33.120
It's like, it feel, to me,

40:33.120 --> 40:35.200
it's one of those like dreamlike sequences

40:35.200 --> 40:37.080
that happened in these couple of years

40:37.080 --> 40:40.760
as everything is so fucking over the top.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.240
You know, any, those people that showed up at the hearings

40:44.240 --> 40:46.360
claiming that they worked with the government,

40:46.360 --> 40:47.600
they worked for the government,

40:47.600 --> 40:50.760
they had actual aliens, somebody contact with the aliens.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.560
And if you watch these people from a different setting,

40:54.560 --> 40:56.760
you probably think that guy is probably fucking,

40:56.760 --> 40:59.320
you know, he's out there, like he's delusional,

40:59.320 --> 41:01.560
like he's crazy.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.240
And then you have a per people talking like that

41:04.240 --> 41:07.760
in front of some ultra serious Congress people.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.800
And then it's just these two elements combined together.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.400
I'm like, y'all really don't have anything better to do

41:14.400 --> 41:16.680
right now, like, wow.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.120
It's unreal, it's literally unreal.

41:19.120 --> 41:22.000
Like, like you said, it's like brought up to a serious level

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
that this, at this level is just,

41:25.000 --> 41:25.960
it doesn't make any sense.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.480
Like he said, like every time,

41:27.480 --> 41:29.080
because he really went deep into this,

41:29.080 --> 41:31.000
he met with all these people.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.040
And he says, every time people say like,

41:33.040 --> 41:35.800
these things are defying the laws of physics.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.960
He says, okay, how do you know they're defying

41:37.960 --> 41:38.800
the laws of physics?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.640
He's like, well, we can see like, okay,

41:40.640 --> 41:42.640
if they're defying the laws of physics,

41:42.640 --> 41:46.440
give me a physicist to tell me that.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.920
And upon his investigation,

41:47.920 --> 41:52.520
he found out there are no physicists working on this.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.040
He says, if anyone's gonna debunk it,

41:55.040 --> 41:56.200
it's gonna be the physicist.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.040
They're gonna debunk it.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.280
Like I said, in an afternoon,

41:58.280 --> 41:59.120
they're gonna say, okay.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.640
That was like 15 minutes conversation.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.680
15 minutes, yeah.

42:01.680 --> 42:05.080
He said, I'm not even in it

42:05.080 --> 42:06.960
and I'm like the only physicist.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.800
But to entertain the idea,

42:10.800 --> 42:15.640
I like when he made this interesting observation.

42:15.680 --> 42:20.560
He said, if you take like this kind of thing,

42:20.560 --> 42:22.960
this, let's say UFO cover up,

42:22.960 --> 42:25.400
if it was real, how he know it's not real,

42:25.400 --> 42:27.000
how he knows it's not real.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.080
Let's say this would be a Manhattan type project

42:30.080 --> 42:31.920
in terms of scale.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.880
And he says like, take the NSA,

42:34.880 --> 42:37.480
National Security Agency, for example.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.240
Like it was secret for a long time.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.840
Now they know, now we all know that it exists.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.480
These people deal with numbers there, right?

42:43.480 --> 42:45.120
They're also mathematicians.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.400
So he said, you would go to,

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
you would see a whole generation of students

42:49.400 --> 42:53.120
in the United States that got their PhDs for this.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.320
You would check the whole,

42:55.320 --> 42:58.060
like that year who graduated.

42:58.060 --> 43:00.840
You would see that all these students are missing.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.000
You would find their addresses.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.520
You will see they're all working in the same city.

43:04.520 --> 43:08.120
Then you would know there's like an operation going on there.

43:08.120 --> 43:09.680
They're working on something.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.160
And he says, he was looking into,

43:12.160 --> 43:14.000
he says, if aliens exist,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.280
there are like three different areas of physics,

43:16.280 --> 43:20.840
which would require people from there to work on this.

43:20.840 --> 43:21.920
And he did the math.

43:21.920 --> 43:24.960
He did his homework and his nobody is missing.

43:24.960 --> 43:28.040
So there's no like real big project going on.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.420
You would be surprised about like how open

43:32.420 --> 43:35.600
or non secretive the American academia really is.

43:35.600 --> 43:39.320
It's like, and also Chinese academia in some regards.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.240
I think the China past that period of time

43:42.240 --> 43:45.640
where like we need to locked up 5,000 physicists

43:45.640 --> 43:47.360
and high school students, college students,

43:47.360 --> 43:50.080
because we need a nuclear bomb.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.880
That's what we did in the sixties.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.840
Exactly like you said,

43:52.840 --> 43:56.920
a whole generation of college physics students disappeared

43:56.920 --> 43:59.600
and it went shipped into that gunswil province.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.560
And then next thing you know,

44:01.560 --> 44:04.200
we had a big mushroom cloud and they were figured out.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.760
Oh yeah, that's how they went.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.760
But no, like we passed that.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.840
Like I admit a lot of,

44:10.840 --> 44:13.040
I basically know some people that are working

44:13.040 --> 44:15.000
some of the very sensitive industry.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.080
And then they can talk about it's like,

44:16.080 --> 44:18.400
yeah, we're making somethings.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.920
That's technically not internationally legal.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.360
You know, and then in the U.S.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.800
and then they talk about like,

44:25.800 --> 44:29.240
oh, I'm working with the co-fusion project here

44:29.240 --> 44:32.600
or I'm working with the NASA or something like it.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.520
They're very open.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.280
There is not that much of a secret to, you know,

44:37.280 --> 44:38.440
attach to them.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.840
And then what's funny about this whole ADIAN thing is that

44:45.320 --> 44:50.000
if there is actual ADIAN, so like on the planet,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.160
U.S. wouldn't be the only group of,

44:53.160 --> 44:55.440
or the only country that knows about this.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.440
You know, like everybody's watching.

44:57.440 --> 44:58.840
It would have to be a global cover up.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.680
Exactly.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.840
It's like, everybody has to cover it up.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.720
Like for what?

45:02.720 --> 45:03.560
You know what I mean?

45:03.560 --> 45:06.680
What's so potentially catastrophic that?

45:07.320 --> 45:10.160
When you look at the failure,

45:10.160 --> 45:15.240
the global failure in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic,

45:15.240 --> 45:16.520
if they couldn't control that,

45:16.520 --> 45:18.560
how would they be able to cover up the existence

45:18.560 --> 45:20.920
of extraterrestrial life?

45:20.920 --> 45:22.880
Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense, man.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.960
There's like ADIAN's question.

45:24.960 --> 45:28.120
Like the idea that some civilization figured out

45:28.120 --> 45:33.120
how to do interstellar travel and visiting us, you know,

45:33.960 --> 45:36.920
we're basically in terms of civilization,

45:36.920 --> 45:39.120
we're pre-kindergarten.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.480
Like, what for?

45:40.480 --> 45:43.360
Like, what's so valuable on the planet?

45:43.360 --> 45:45.720
And then I heard somebody like, you know,

45:45.720 --> 45:48.360
one of those people that witnessed on a congress hearing

45:48.360 --> 45:50.000
is like, ah, they came here for the water.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.560
Like seriously, water?

45:51.560 --> 45:52.560
It's too over.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.840
It's a movie plot.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.320
Exactly, it's like water.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.040
Like y'all figured out how to travel the universe

45:59.040 --> 46:01.920
and then you don't know how to combine hydrogen

46:01.920 --> 46:03.480
and oxygen to go.

46:03.480 --> 46:08.480
But he did say that we made some cool observations.

46:09.880 --> 46:13.440
He said like, if we, like when we humans studied,

46:13.440 --> 46:18.160
for example, orcas, which are like the smartest beings

46:18.160 --> 46:21.080
next to us in the food chain, I guess,

46:21.080 --> 46:22.760
like how do we approach them?

46:23.800 --> 46:26.280
You know, we observed them, we build,

46:28.040 --> 46:30.400
how do you say, what's the opposite of natural?

46:30.400 --> 46:33.160
Artificial habitats for them, we studied them,

46:33.160 --> 46:34.760
we hide from them.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.360
You know, maybe somebody, if they are here,

46:38.360 --> 46:40.640
why would they show themselves?

46:40.640 --> 46:44.880
He made also a very cool observation about,

46:44.880 --> 46:49.600
you know, the Sentinel Islands.

46:49.600 --> 46:53.880
Sentinel, yeah, islands south of India.

46:53.880 --> 46:57.720
That island with like a few hundreds of inhabitants

46:57.720 --> 47:00.000
that killed everyone who showed up there

47:00.000 --> 47:02.240
in the last few hundred years.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.640
Basically the Indian government,

47:03.640 --> 47:05.680
because the island belongs to India,

47:05.680 --> 47:08.600
have put it like, not like a protection around it,

47:08.600 --> 47:10.240
nobody's allowed to go there.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.760
They're basically living in the Stone Age there.

47:12.760 --> 47:16.480
So for them, but like the whole world is studying them,

47:16.480 --> 47:18.720
but they're not aware of the existence

47:18.720 --> 47:21.720
of even India, let alone the continents.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.240
So he's saying like, maybe we are like the Sentinel Islands

47:25.280 --> 47:28.240
inhabitants and the aliens are like India.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.360
So how would we even know?

47:31.360 --> 47:33.160
Yeah, I could be mad.

47:33.160 --> 47:36.360
We assume that they would want to communicate with us.

47:36.360 --> 47:40.840
And there's always this thing in the UFO lore

47:40.840 --> 47:43.040
that all these visitations started

47:43.040 --> 47:45.560
after we detonated the nuclear weapons.

47:45.560 --> 47:50.320
That's where all this activity like started.

47:50.320 --> 47:54.320
So maybe, I don't know, I want to believe.

47:54.320 --> 47:58.880
Part of me believes, but if it's really like a cover-up,

47:58.880 --> 48:02.680
I think like Musk would be the first one to,

48:02.680 --> 48:05.240
I mean, he has satellites going around here.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.400
He would know, he would say something.

48:07.400 --> 48:10.880
Right, I think that there is a,

48:10.880 --> 48:12.880
there are definitely, I've read this,

48:12.880 --> 48:15.480
and these aren't really like conspiracy theory or anything,

48:15.480 --> 48:19.640
but there are like discoveries in astrology.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.200
Astrophysics, yeah, astrology.

48:24.080 --> 48:27.040
Or, you know, just physics in general

48:27.040 --> 48:29.360
that we figured out that maybe there's some...

48:29.360 --> 48:30.360
Astrophysics?

48:30.360 --> 48:32.080
Astrophysics. Astrology is something different.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.280
Yeah, the wrong word, man.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.120
That's a MBTI shit.

48:35.120 --> 48:39.080
Anyway, so there were some discoveries

48:39.080 --> 48:43.560
that implied that maybe we're being watched

48:43.560 --> 48:45.600
by some other civilization.

48:46.920 --> 48:50.160
You know, there was a book before,

48:50.160 --> 48:52.320
we talked about this before the three body problem,

48:52.320 --> 48:56.080
like how they found out that the aliens are watching

48:56.080 --> 48:59.160
was that they conduct the experiment with no observer.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.480
And according to quantum mechanics,

49:01.480 --> 49:03.120
you know, when you don't have observer,

49:03.120 --> 49:05.040
they behave like waves.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.120
And then they found out, it's like,

49:06.120 --> 49:08.680
why are these particles behaving like particles?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.520
Somebody's watching.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.800
And then that set up the actual stage

49:12.800 --> 49:15.720
for what happened during the three body problems.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.640
Like, oh yeah, there are aliens watching us.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.200
But there are discoveries like that.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.760
The author didn't make it happen out of the blue.

49:25.120 --> 49:29.520
But I would say that I wanna believe that,

49:29.520 --> 49:34.000
you know, some other galaxies that they discovered

49:34.000 --> 49:36.320
a lot of things that we just aren't capable

49:36.320 --> 49:38.840
of even contemplate yet.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.920
And they may be watching us.

49:40.920 --> 49:44.640
And it's so amazing to think about it.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.760
Like, you know, because we know that, you know,

49:47.800 --> 49:50.640
at least maybe like tens of a thousand light years

49:50.640 --> 49:52.800
around us, there is no civilization found.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
We have found zero evidence.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.880
So which means that if there's a civilization watching us,

49:57.880 --> 50:00.880
that's like, you know, millions or even more than that,

50:00.880 --> 50:03.080
like thousands of millions of light years away.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.120
They're watching us as like,

50:06.120 --> 50:08.960
what they're watching like dinosaurs right now.

50:08.960 --> 50:09.960
Oh, okay.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.680
You know, they're like, oh, these are dinosaurs.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.800
Like, but if imagine a civilization

50:14.800 --> 50:17.720
that can watch us live,

50:18.120 --> 50:19.440
that they're also watching this podcast

50:19.440 --> 50:20.960
for some reason, like these two idiots

50:20.960 --> 50:22.000
are talking about us right now.

50:22.000 --> 50:22.840
Hey, let's go.

50:22.840 --> 50:23.680
Mom, come on, come on.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.520
They're breaking the code.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
Yeah, yeah, but that means that they've figured out

50:26.520 --> 50:27.880
a space time to such level

50:27.880 --> 50:30.200
they can literally see into the future in a HD,

50:30.200 --> 50:32.520
you know, in a 4K definition, basically.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.480
That's crazy.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.720
Yeah, but okay, at the end of the day,

50:34.720 --> 50:37.560
we're always applying our understanding of science

50:37.560 --> 50:41.320
that they operate on the same basis.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.440
Yeah.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.920
The best alien movie I've found.

50:44.920 --> 50:45.760
Number one.

50:45.760 --> 50:46.600
Mars Attacks.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.520
Mars Attacks.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.360
No, fifth elements, man.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.200
Fifth elements.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.040
I thought that was pretty damn good movie.

50:52.040 --> 50:55.240
In terms of space opera is like, yeah.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.840
And arrival, like arrival and annihilation,

50:58.840 --> 51:00.480
these two films are, you know,

51:00.480 --> 51:02.880
like the aliens won't behave like us.

51:02.880 --> 51:06.960
And arrival, they just like, yo, we can't even talk.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.840
You know, we, our language are so complex.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.120
Like, give it up, man.

51:10.120 --> 51:10.960
Like, go away.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.920
Arrival is out there.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.960
Definitely the best one out there.

51:13.960 --> 51:14.800
Yeah, exactly.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.760
But for guilty pleasure, fifth element, you know.

51:19.760 --> 51:20.880
Yeah, it's a good one.

51:20.880 --> 51:24.560
It's, I mean, 90s schlock, but it's a good movie.

51:24.560 --> 51:25.400
It's good.

51:25.400 --> 51:28.880
And also, you know, back to the Eric,

51:28.880 --> 51:32.240
what he was saying is like, I was so surprised

51:32.240 --> 51:35.200
like an actual scientist that went that far too.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.680
Yeah, he gave it some legitimacy

51:37.680 --> 51:41.360
by him going into the field and investigating.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.120
That's what I liked.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.640
I was hoping he's going to come.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.800
I was like, oh, Weinstein is on Rogan.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.640
Let's go.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.240
Disclosure is coming.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.280
He's going to say something.

51:50.280 --> 51:53.760
And then he's like, nah, there is no real evidence.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.800
But if he had one point he said,

51:56.800 --> 51:58.400
if the aliens were here,

51:58.400 --> 52:00.120
I would be the only person to understand

52:00.120 --> 52:01.560
how they got to here.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.120
Yeah, I remember that.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.760
I'm like, wow, that's a,

52:05.760 --> 52:07.880
wow, that's American confidence right there, man.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.600
Like, okay, let's continue.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.320
What did I want to say?

52:13.320 --> 52:14.160
Yeah.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.800
What Weinstein has one of these ideas

52:18.800 --> 52:22.840
of also one of the things I like about him,

52:22.840 --> 52:24.800
the idea he calls it,

52:24.800 --> 52:27.480
he always makes up these terms,

52:28.680 --> 52:30.440
the idea of managed reality.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.000
And by that, he means that those

52:34.000 --> 52:36.040
in the highest positions of power

52:36.040 --> 52:39.520
are actively deceiving the general public

52:39.520 --> 52:42.800
regarding the most crucial aspects of society.

52:42.800 --> 52:47.360
And by that, biology, science, economics, politics,

52:47.360 --> 52:49.480
journalism, global warming,

52:50.840 --> 52:52.760
anything you can come up with.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.600
So, and again, he has these analogies,

52:55.600 --> 52:59.320
which I really love about him.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.680
He really paints a picture.

53:00.680 --> 53:04.320
He likened this situation as a,

53:04.320 --> 53:07.040
he said this on Chris's podcast, the last one,

53:07.040 --> 53:10.400
as a tanker that flipped over on a highway.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.520
It's burning, the chemicals are coming out,

53:12.520 --> 53:15.080
there are dead bodies left and right.

53:15.080 --> 53:17.280
The police or the government is standing there

53:17.280 --> 53:20.040
and saying, nothing to see here, just move along.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.280
And I guess by that,

53:23.280 --> 53:24.440
That's a powerful example.

53:24.440 --> 53:27.000
It's a powerful example, it is, it is.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.520
And there's a lot of, like for us,

53:30.520 --> 53:34.600
there's a lot of evidence that points to the contrary.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.600
And, but people are being encouraged to ignore the truth

53:39.760 --> 53:42.000
and to not only that,

53:42.000 --> 53:46.080
but also to put down those who dare to question things,

53:46.080 --> 53:51.080
branding them, grifters, charlatans, conspiracy theorists.

53:51.760 --> 53:55.320
And we've seen that a lot in the last 10 years, I think.

53:55.320 --> 53:59.760
Yeah, that's a, I'm glad that he brought it up

53:59.760 --> 54:03.320
because for one, where we're at,

54:03.480 --> 54:06.160
that's a freaking perfect example of what's going on

54:06.160 --> 54:07.480
during the COVID three years,

54:07.480 --> 54:10.640
why we're still doing those tests and all that.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.080
But it's everywhere, isn't it?

54:12.080 --> 54:12.920
Is it not?

54:12.920 --> 54:15.800
It's not, no, it is everywhere.

54:15.800 --> 54:19.680
It's like, especially in the West, right?

54:20.560 --> 54:24.520
What do you think that, in your opinion,

54:24.520 --> 54:27.040
it's like, give us an example,

54:27.040 --> 54:30.240
like where you feel like your reality is being managed

54:30.240 --> 54:31.800
and you found out it's actually managed,

54:31.800 --> 54:33.120
reality is not real?

54:34.240 --> 54:37.600
Like back home, there's an open secret

54:37.600 --> 54:41.200
that our government has been stealing the elections

54:41.200 --> 54:42.680
for the last 10 years.

54:43.640 --> 54:46.960
Everyone you ask, nobody is voting for them.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.360
And every time the elections come around,

54:49.360 --> 54:51.600
they win the elections.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.680
So that's for one.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.240
In terms of, I mean, we operate,

54:55.240 --> 54:58.640
we deal with very existential problems back home,

54:58.680 --> 55:02.400
but what's going on in the West

55:02.400 --> 55:05.520
has started spilling over all over the planet.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.160
So like biology, for example,

55:08.160 --> 55:11.080
what they're saying now about men and women,

55:11.080 --> 55:15.920
they're rewriting history, global warming,

55:15.920 --> 55:18.040
it's happening, it's not happening.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.840
You have the money, you have the funds,

55:20.840 --> 55:23.600
get a group of scientists, make a consensus, sit down,

55:23.600 --> 55:25.240
is it happening or is it not happening?

55:25.240 --> 55:28.600
Why do we have to debate this all over and over again?

55:28.720 --> 55:32.480
There's a lot of these topics that we are constantly debating,

55:32.480 --> 55:33.920
is it or is it not?

55:33.920 --> 55:36.040
Right, right, sure.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.800
Same as with these aliens, okay, now I'm going out there,

55:38.800 --> 55:41.040
you know, it doesn't really affect me,

55:41.040 --> 55:43.800
but like example from back home would be this.

55:45.080 --> 55:50.080
I think that the, how am I gonna put this?

55:50.440 --> 55:55.440
So you have basically a mega industry on the planet

55:56.280 --> 55:58.680
that their entire profit came from

55:58.680 --> 56:01.080
making people arguing against each other.

56:02.080 --> 56:05.560
That's why, you know, racism is a great example.

56:05.560 --> 56:09.840
I think that America could have solved racism

56:09.840 --> 56:12.840
a long time ago, but they didn't.

56:12.840 --> 56:16.160
It's not because the Americans are full of like neo-Nazis

56:16.160 --> 56:18.560
that just believe that there are white superiority

56:18.560 --> 56:21.680
or all that bullshit, it's because when you have people

56:21.680 --> 56:23.800
that are debating on the national television,

56:24.800 --> 56:27.440
you got views, you can sell advertisement,

56:28.440 --> 56:30.880
it's like solving the issue will basically say

56:30.880 --> 56:34.560
that you can no longer make money in that way.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.400
And it's very similar to the wars, you know, conflicts,

56:37.400 --> 56:39.920
you know what I mean is like the,

56:39.920 --> 56:43.640
I had this opinion on, you know,

56:43.640 --> 56:48.400
we probably make more money by threatening,

56:48.400 --> 56:51.680
threatening the fucking island of unification

56:51.680 --> 56:53.760
than actually unify with them.

56:54.640 --> 56:56.320
You know, like Americans at the same time,

56:56.320 --> 56:59.080
it's like, but definitely more profitable

56:59.080 --> 57:02.200
that they keep spreading fear about like, you know,

57:03.520 --> 57:06.200
what we're gonna do, what the rush is gonna do.

57:06.200 --> 57:09.400
That's why it's like, we never solve anything.

57:09.400 --> 57:12.880
The same thing goes with the climate change, you know.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.840
You, do you feel it's actually kind of strange

57:16.840 --> 57:19.720
that the moment of Paris, you know,

57:19.720 --> 57:22.640
China and United States signed a Paris Accord

57:22.640 --> 57:25.120
to combat climate change, almost the next day

57:25.120 --> 57:28.360
we became the evilest country on the planet.

57:28.360 --> 57:32.720
Like we actually wanna do some solid policy change

57:32.720 --> 57:35.400
to promote green energy, renewable energy.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.000
You look at a Chinese street right now,

57:37.000 --> 57:38.400
it's like how many electronic cars,

57:38.400 --> 57:41.880
it's way more than any advanced economy on the planet.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.920
Yeah, people tend to think outside of China,

57:43.920 --> 57:45.640
that China is this big polluter.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.000
I mean, truth be told, you have a lot of factories

57:48.000 --> 57:51.400
and all this stuff, but when I travel China,

57:51.400 --> 57:53.080
I see these wind turbines everywhere.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.560
Like you said, electric cars left and right,

57:55.560 --> 57:58.640
more so than outside of China, so much more.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.640
We, they never talked about like in the, you know,

58:01.640 --> 58:04.840
2015, 2016 when we shut down all those like really,

58:04.840 --> 58:09.240
we call it the industrialization basically.

58:09.240 --> 58:11.600
We need to shut down a lot of those old ass factories

58:11.600 --> 58:15.560
so we can stop the pollution at the same time.

58:15.560 --> 58:20.560
We wanna cut back on our production capabilities

58:21.040 --> 58:22.800
because we're making goods that's so cheap

58:22.800 --> 58:24.720
that nobody is making or making money out of it.

58:24.720 --> 58:28.200
So, and then there were so much employment

58:28.200 --> 58:31.000
that the Chinese economy had to suffer through that.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.440
There's a reason that right now,

58:33.440 --> 58:35.080
if you order food on the internet,

58:35.080 --> 58:37.280
like it will be delivered in the fucking 10 minutes.

58:37.280 --> 58:40.400
It's because all these people, they're working on this

58:40.400 --> 58:42.960
and they can't find jobs in traditional

58:42.960 --> 58:45.120
and manufacturer sectors, right?

58:45.120 --> 58:49.000
So, you know, like when somebody actually tried

58:49.000 --> 58:51.480
to solve it, all of a sudden,

58:51.480 --> 58:53.000
because you were ending the debate,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.800
like in China, global warming is not a freaking debate.

58:55.800 --> 58:59.120
You know, and then you can't make money off of debates

58:59.120 --> 59:01.440
and arguing each other and then just like bringing

59:01.440 --> 59:03.080
out new perspectives and whatnot.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.520
And people hate you for that.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.240
Like people will literally hate you for that.

59:07.240 --> 59:10.240
Like I think that the manager reality either,

59:11.240 --> 59:15.920
I think that it's not like, you know, how Eric described it,

59:15.920 --> 59:19.280
you know, there's just huge powerful people.

59:19.280 --> 59:24.280
They just try to, you know, push us away from the truth

59:24.280 --> 59:27.440
and then, you know, like turn us into mindless pigs,

59:27.440 --> 59:28.440
whatever.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.120
I think that the powerful people just want to make us feel

59:31.120 --> 59:33.920
confused all the time, you know, that's why.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.160
Like that's why a lot of people buy in propaganda.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.480
It's because it's easier to understand.

59:38.480 --> 59:41.200
And then if you don't listen to propagandas

59:41.200 --> 59:43.080
and you really want to pursue like what's real

59:43.080 --> 59:44.960
and what's actually in the real, like your brain

59:44.960 --> 59:46.840
will burn out like on a daily basis

59:46.840 --> 59:48.560
and nobody wants that, you know what I mean?

59:48.560 --> 59:49.400
I do.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.640
I don't think they are like some evil doers

59:52.640 --> 59:55.200
who have this new world government, you know,

59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.200
one world government, this apocalyptic ideas of the future,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.840
these big conspiracy theorists,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840
but they're just sowing division

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.040
and they're reaping the profits

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.760
because division is they're monetizing our division.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.760
We are divided on every single issue.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.080
We are, I mean, all at the end of the day,

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.160
also citizens of the world

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.080
and we all participate in these conversations

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.160
and every single question we are divided.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.160
And when you, this thing you mentioned,

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.360
the global warming and this, I think this is also part

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.880
of this Western self-righteous liberalism.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.840
Putin said it best, like you guys in the West,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.080
you have already industrialized,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.480
you've arrived in the future.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.920
It's like, tell Asian countries or African countries

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.400
who are just starting the process

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.400
of industrializing their nations to go green, like FU.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.120
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.520
Like the African, like lithium mine, that's a perfect example.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.360
It's like in order for us to drive electronic cars,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.560
like how many Africans lives are being sacrificed

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.600
on a fucking ritualistic level, you know,

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.720
just to make sure that we have enough material

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.000
to build a car batteries.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.040
Like this is hypocritical, man.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.040
Hypocritical, they're all tweeting in the West

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.600
from their phones, let's go green.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.480
This dash, hashtag, that, but somebody is dying

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.560
in Africa mining that coal belt or whatever it is in,

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.080
you know, buy a Starbucks coffee, tax,

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.040
I don't know, half a dollar goes to this cause

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.520
and then you feel good about yourself.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.520
You can go and protest and whatnot.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.160
But also the thing you asked me about,

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.960
where do I see this playing out, this managed reality?

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960
Also with the news, I think most, I see it there.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.280
There are, there's no, I mean, journalistic integrity,

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.120
like what, journalistic, what went out the window?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120
I mean, it's obvious when you go,

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.000
like you can go on these apps like Telegram

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.360
and you know, these dark web apps

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.920
and you can see news that you can't see on legacy media,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.800
not even legacy that you can maybe even see

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.240
on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.560
Like we are, I do believe, I don't think,

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.000
and I personally don't think Eric was implying

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.160
that they're like these evil doers that are controlling,

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
but we are being deceived or at least we are being

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.840
conditioned or trained not to think,

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.120
not to question too much.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.440
There's a lot of things that are happening that are absurd.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.320
I think that's the main point.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.400
Yeah.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.200
You know, don't ask question.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.600
There's nothing, just move along, you know.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.360
Just move along while somebody is profiting.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.360
I personally feel like, you know, for one,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.680
the legacy media, the news are just so freaking

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.040
narrative-driven, which is something that Eric also talked

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.800
about, the narrative-driven media

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.600
and also the narrative-driven academics.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.840
It's like you have this built-in story

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.880
that you wanna promote or you wanna spread

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.280
and then you find evidence that fits

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.600
that particular narrative.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.200
For one, the legacy media is definitely,

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.520
I still have subscriptions to some pretty major news media,

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.560
like New York Times.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.320
I just read the title.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.160
I don't wanna read the freaking commentary on that.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.800
It's like absolutely garbage.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.000
And then you have the underground news.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.080
And underground news sometimes is like so fucking

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.080
mind-boggling, stupid, conspiracy, theory-filled,

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.840
you know, successful.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.720
Have you heard of ground news?

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.680
Yeah, I'm using it.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.520
Are you using it?

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.360
Yeah.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.400
Is it good?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.360
It's a little bit overwhelming.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.680
It gets a little bit repetitive

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.640
because they try to, it's not a news agency,

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.000
but it's sort of like a combinator.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.120
You know, you combine all the news agency,

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.360
what he said, what he said together

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.640
and you make your own calls.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.160
Be very careful of what you set up,

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.080
you're interested in it.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.200
Cause like I accidentally set an election

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.600
and my entire front page is all about like fucking election.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.160
I don't really care about this anymore,

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.000
but in terms of bias,

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.600
they have a bias meter on it.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.360
So you can tell us like, okay, this is-

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.960
Who's reporting more?

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.800
Okay.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.720
And this managed reality.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.160
Also we talked about it last time

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.560
about the war in Ukraine.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.240
That seems like a very managed picture

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.840
of what's really going on.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.520
Obviously being sold a narrative.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.160
Very obviously.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.560
I think that, like I said last time,

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.920
it's like there's no way that according to the West,

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.280
if Russia has lost that much manpower,

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.240
it's still going.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.680
Like there's no way.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.200
It's not China that we were talking about.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.680
Like Russia doesn't have a lot of people, right?

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.800
So yeah, there's a-

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.560
During the Chris Williamson podcast,

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.480
maybe you know something about this.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.320
He was talking about some CPI question.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.800
Right.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.640
Yeah.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.080
The Eric was attacking how the brew of liver statistics

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.680
manipulate a CPI number.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.760
What does it stand for?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.720
Consumer?

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.040
Consumer price index.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.440
What it represents is that it take a basket of goods

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.480
and services that you will,

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.880
an average consumer would consume,

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.000
and take a look at the price level,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.840
and then compare this price level after a period of time,

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.360
and then see like the percentage rise or decrease.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.560
So if it's a positive number,

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.640
it means it's inflation,

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.000
and the negative number is the deflation.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.640
That's how I learned from my college years.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.400
And what Eric basically said is that they created

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.400
a inflation number to fit a specific political interest.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.960
And I found that,

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.800
man, it's so hard to believe that.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.760
It's really difficult to believe that.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.680
Because if that's the case,

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.920
you will see that CPI doesn't correlate

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.880
with other economic indicators,

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.760
unless they fix like everything, right?

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.360
And I would say in terms of number fixing,

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.360
like the Americans are not as good as us.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.880
Like we can make our economic scoresheet like box score

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.240
like perfect, right?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.480
But I don't think that he,

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.960
I don't know what he meant that he said like,

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.120
the CPI number is wrong.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.440
You know, like that's the part is like,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.960
he didn't elaborate on this.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.640
He didn't give out his own understanding about it.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.680
Like what he thought should be the right formula.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.000
He just said like the Federal Reserve

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.240
and then there was just, you know,

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.560
this star chamber people,

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.160
they're just fixing all these numbers.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.680
I'm like, all right, cool.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.480
Speaking of Federal Reserve and money,

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.360
and again, going back a little bit,

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.200
if you don't mind to this managed reality thing.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.840
Like when people mention UBI,

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.600
this Universal Basic Income,

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.400
and how much poverty we have in the world today,

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.120
when people talk about that, you know,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.200
it's met with like, you guys are utopians, you know,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.120
this is like next level socialism,

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.120
you know, that this is not gonna happen.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.600
But when you look at like when these,

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.320
we talked about the financial,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.240
you know, the crashes that happened in 2007

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.600
and now at the beginning of this decade.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.680
And every time this happens,

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.240
like I know it happened in Europe,

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.040
especially in the United States,

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.240
every time they build them out,

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.760
they print trillions of dollars every single time.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.880
So what I'm trying to say,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.200
like how do they have money for this all the time,

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.560
but they don't have money to fix

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.080
like these real world problems

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.920
that we all, you know, suffer from?

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.440
Yeah, the idea of printing money,

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.280
that's from, that's a Keyesian economic approach.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.880
Like that's what the United States did.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.160
What economic approach?

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.800
So I forgot his first name,

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.680
but his last name is Kane's.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.320
He's a very famous economist

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.600
in during the Great Depression.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.040
Stateside?

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.640
I think he's from UK, he's from UK.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.120
Like UK were, same thing as Eric said,

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.800
like UK people should feel more proud.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.460
Like they did something pretty amazing.

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.840
But in economics back then, they had this, you know,

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.920
they had this blind belief, this credility,

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.520
of, you know, if you let the free market run,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.240
it will solve all the problems itself.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.160
So you don't have to interfere.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.240
The government doesn't have to do anything.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.240
And that's basically fundamental belief

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.520
of all the right wing people,

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.040
like who believe in the smaller government

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.320
because the market will sell for the sell file.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.160
But during the Great Depression,

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.920
we found out that no, the market won't sell.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.960
Like there's market failure, you know,

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.720
like there are, you can produce so much goods

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.480
to the point that nobody's consuming

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.120
and it created deflation.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.200
And deflation is very, very dangerous

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.080
to modern economy, like to any country.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.800
Like we think the Zimbabwe is bad

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.360
because they had a hyperinflation.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.200
So did we?

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.040
Yeah, yeah, so.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:20.880
So did we?

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.680
Yeah, but if you compare that to what happened in Japan,

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.520
the longevity of the crisis, it's like hyperinflation,

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.280
it's relatively easy to stop,

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.880
but like deflation, you can't really stop it.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.360
So they're afraid of that.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.160
So that's why they're printing money.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.080
But contrary to a lot of people's belief

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.520
that they're just printing cash out there,

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.800
what they're believing is that if you increase people's

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.360
spending and then just lower the interest rate,

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.160
you will, it will stimulus the economy

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.520
and then make it back to, you know,

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.640
if you give people more money,

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.840
they will like to spend on something.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.600
And then, you know, it's stabilized the price level.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.520
What you don't wanna see is that you're sitting

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.760
on a bunch of cash and its value is actually increasing.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.440
That's what deflation means.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.840
It's actually very horrible.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.360
Like that's what China is going through right now.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.720
So if like every day,

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.200
like me and my wife, we talked about this,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200
it's like every time we see a nice restaurant

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.000
and a very expensive,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.360
we are not going to spend money to that restaurant.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.120
We're just gonna wait it out

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.040
until like eventually that restaurant has zero customers,

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.360
it will drop down some discount

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.720
and then we'll just go eat there.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.320
But in terms of the restaurant's,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.760
from the restaurant's perspective,

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.080
it's absolutely horrible.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.360
So deflation is definitely more scarier.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.960
It's much scarier than the inflation.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.600
That's why they print money all the time.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.920
Like I don't agree on,

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.920
but the thing I don't agree is that

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.440
I'm all for you bailed out the banks,

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.120
but you still need to hold those bankers accountable

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:57.960
afterwards.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.920
Like we solve your problem now,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.480
here's somebody who got to go to jail.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.440
Like whatever you guys did was wrong.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.280
It was a fraud.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.840
Like what happened in 2007?

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.680
It was just-

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.920
I think like two people went to jail maybe.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.520
Yeah, it's just two or three people went to jail

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520
and all these bankers,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.800
they walk off with all these like big ass bonuses.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.120
I thought that was absolutely wrong.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.360
Like that set us example so bad that,

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.480
you know, now I thought about it,

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.960
I think the America lost,

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.080
I would say 60% of its credibility internationally,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.800
based solely based on how they reacted in the 2007.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.000
And then now we're just dealing

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.240
with the repercussions really.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.520
Like everything on the planet is like,

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.360
if you think about it,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.160
it's just dealing with the repercussions of 2007.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.560
It has such a strong ripples in the history

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.760
that it's just like, you know,

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.680
I think that was probably one of the reasons

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.520
to why all these elites want to make us stupid

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.440
and don't think about this.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.600
Cause like how are you going to get away with this, man?

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.400
Like seriously, like you have all these money

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.680
all these people that made so much money illegally

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.160
and they can walk away from this.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.560
And then you call it a moral hazard.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.800
I'm like, bro, like, look,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.160
if there's a famine and the people on the streets

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.280
are eating each other,

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.800
like because they have to survive,

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.120
like I would want to call that a moral hazard.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.600
You got a group of the most well-educated people

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.760
on the fucking planet made some conscious decision

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.480
to exploit people.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.720
That's not a moral hazard.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.640
It's not just illegal.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.480
That's like,

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.080
you know.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.880
So speaking of Eric verdict,

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.720
verdict, what's your opinion of him overall?

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.000
I'm going to pull Eric card.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.320
Like, what do you think?

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.480
Nice. Okay.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.480
Well, the most frequent criticism I've heard of him

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.280
is that he holds a very high opinion of himself.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.720
On several podcasts, I've heard him say,

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.960
I've heard him mention that within his own family,

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.680
there are like two or three Nobel winning ideas.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.680
I've even heard him entertain thoughts

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.520
of running the government by himself.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.760
People say that he talks in circles,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.360
that he has an answer for everything.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.920
I also once, the only thing I think they might,

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.320
they didn't really, I'm nitpicking here,

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.200
but since we're talking,

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.720
the way he responded to comments made by Tim Dillon,

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.000
which was, which were obviously intended as a joke.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.840
Remember that?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.760
Tim Dillon said like, you know,

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.280
people always say Eric Weinstein is, you know, so smart.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.320
What has he ever invented?

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.200
What did he ever do, you know?

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.760
And he was a guest on Rogan after that,

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.880
and he really kind of embarrassed himself in his reaction.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.920
He went hard on Tim Dillon, right?

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.880
Yeah, he really took it seriously, took it to heart.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.880
But disregarding all of that, similar to Peterson,

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.400
what I, the thing I like the most about Weinstein

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.960
is his sense of urgency when he talks about

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.760
these critical issues over time,

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.840
particularly the failure of institutions.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.880
That's what I really like.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.880
I also, I highly, I told you this many times,

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.080
I highly admire his eloquence, his intellect,

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.000
his ability to not only to talk about,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.560
but also to communicate these big ideas.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.160
In terms of this physics stuff and science,

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.840
I think he really has a visionary mind.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.440
He's consistently thinking outside the box on all topics.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.120
And his passion for physics has brought up,

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.960
has sparked an interest in me.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.280
Like I told you, I've been watching these physics podcasts

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.920
even though I don't understand anything, but...

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.240
It's so intriguing though.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.080
They all have like amazing visuals all the time.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.280
They do.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.960
I think he will be well remembered in history,

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.440
even if nothing comes off of this geometric unity.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.440
I think, you know, people like him are needed.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.000
I don't think, I mean, he pulled away when he was kind of getting

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
not too big, but too loud in his criticisms of many things.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.800
So I admire him for that as well.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.200
And from where I'm sitting is just my subjective point of view.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.720
I'm nobody to talk on this, but from where I'm sitting,

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.320
he, to me, he seems like one of the smartest people

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.160
in the world.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.120
I think that I agree with you.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.840
Like, do you feel like personally that he's, you know,

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.160
he really thinks we're very high off of himself?

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.320
Do you got an impression from him?

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:02.320
I do, but do you think like if Einstein was alive today

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.720
and he went...

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.800
Bro, that would be amazing.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.440
We see Einstein on the podcast.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.640
If we had the opportunity to see hours and hours

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.280
of Einstein talking, we can only see,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.360
I think maybe there's only a few short videos of Einstein.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.360
There's, you know, books and articles, but I'm pretty sure

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.480
we would say he's full of himself.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.320
Yeah.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.360
How can you not be?

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.400
Exactly.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.640
I feel like it's a necessary flaw to have.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.480
Yeah.

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.040
Expose yourself like that in the public.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.840
All the artists, sorry for interrupting.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.920
When we look at all these, that we had the opportunity,

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.320
now we have recordings and now in the modern age

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.680
of these artists, like musicians,

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.080
and they're all full of themselves.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.280
I think one goes with the other.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.640
I was, I had the same impression.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.520
And also I think that kind of contradicts

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.240
to what he said about the exclusivity,

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.640
the necessary exclusivity of academia.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.880
I think that what exactly are you doing right now

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.080
is attracting a lot of unqualified people to the academia.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.120
You know, academia for me always has been this kind

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.680
behind the door, like very secretive type of,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.160
you know, society.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.040
It requires a lot of intellect

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.960
and a lot of time and effort to set a step into this.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.160
It's not that, you know,

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.600
but at the same time, it's like,

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.000
I feel like he set a lot of good examples

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.560
on how we should approach various,

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.240
very controversial issues.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.160
Like I was summing it up with this one thing

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.000
that he talked about.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.520
It's about the gender issue.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.320
And he didn't go as like, you know,

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.280
oh, there are only two gender issues.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.120
Yes, yes.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.360
He actually find a very solid middle ground.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.360
It's like the nature before binary gender setups

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.040
like male and female, like we're good,

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.480
but they are all liars.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.520
You don't want those all liars to feel

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.560
unloved and excluded from a society.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.520
I'm like, that's such a solid point.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.400
I think everybody can write it behind that.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.760
How difficult is it to come

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.480
towards a common understanding on that level?

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.880
It's not difficult to understand.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.760
We know that there are some people who are in a,

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.480
they have, you know, they're the borderline problems.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.560
Like, you know, they're neither male or female, like.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.400
Asexual.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.120
Asexual, like we know they exist.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.720
You know, we know that somebody has gendered.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.560
Dysphoria.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.600
Dysphoria.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.480
So like the way he, the way he elaborate his ideas

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.080
on that particular issue is just such amazing.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.840
With understanding and compassion.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.600
With understanding and compassion.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.840
And also he didn't compromise his scientific understanding

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.160
about the issue.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.280
You know, he didn't go ultra like, you know,

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.840
Jordan Peterson on Chris Williamson's ass.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.920
Like, I wish like, at least on that aspect,

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.120
I definitely hope that more, you know, intellectuals

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.040
or scientists can be more Eric.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.400
Like we can, we can handle.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.320
Like if you were just like appear to be a very egoistic,

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.720
like, yeah, we, yeah, sure.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.560
Why not?

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.920
You know, I feel like Kanye West already set the bar,

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.920
like really, really, really,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.720
appropriate so far as to accept those figures.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.200
But anyways, all right, man.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.520
All right.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.480
That was solid, man.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.640
Always.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.480
Nice.
