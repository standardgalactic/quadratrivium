00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Welcome back, today on Philosophy Battle we are covering one of the greatest battles

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,280
that has ever influenced me, and namely it's actually the setup for the battle that will

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,680
finally allow us to gain the philosophic powers of this metaphysical eye that I've been promising.

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,600
The setup will lay the groundwork for the eternal traction in the slippery, perilous

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
battlefields of philosophy.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,080
The awesome battle that we'll be covering though is from this green book, the second

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,680
of three books that I may cover on relativism.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,800
A book simply titled, Relativism, by Paul O'Grady, a philosophy lecturer at Trinity

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,720
College in Dublin.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,040
While there are a number of different battles in this green book, the one we'll be covering

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,800
today involves Paul O'Grady defending truth against the attacks of the extreme relativist.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,280
That is, the relativist who believes everything is relative.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Not just matters of taste or beauty, or even what counts as right and wrong, but for them

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,920
even things like knowledge, truth, logic, and reality are relative.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,320
For them, everything is relative.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,040
Nothing is objective, nothing is absolute.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,520
And that is what we would call the extreme relativist.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,160
It may sound a little bit out there, but we're dealing with a sophisticated relativist whose

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,680
weapon has been empowered by three trends and namely five philosophers that Paul O'Grady

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,240
himself noted for us in his introductory chapter, where he helped explain the powers of this

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,320
wickedly awesome weapon and how it came into being, especially in modern philosophic warfare.

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,880
So if you'd like to see how it is possible that even a reasonable person may come to

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,280
feel that even things like truth or knowledge or facts are relative, please check out the

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
previous video, The Powers of Relativism.

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,760
Why are we considering the concerns of these relativists that make the charges that even

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,080
facts truth or logic is relative?

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,140
It's important for a good philosopher to understand that one cannot simply defeat an

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,060
enemy like this, an extreme relativist, who wishes to use relativism everywhere, not just

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,620
because they say so, but as empowered by actual philosophic writing, namely those five philosophers,

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,420
by simply proclaiming, hey, there's no problem, we could just literally objectively describe

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,420
things how they are and we have scientific facts and so on, you know, facts and logic.

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,660
So they aren't relative, well you may actually have to deal with them rather than try to

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,420
offhand dismiss them.

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,380
Because if science doesn't maintain its legitimacy and authority, you may have religious fanatics

35
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,820
teaching extreme spiritual beliefs in science class, you may have corporations or politicians

36
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,180
disregard scientific findings, and many other terrible things that happen sometimes simply

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,900
to spite scientific evidence.

38
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,020
And the arguments of the SSK, a particular group of sociologists that studied science

39
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,780
that used these powerful philosophic weapons to attack the authority and legitimacy of

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,940
science or arguments of their academic descendants can be used to do such things, even perhaps

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,180
pull funding away from the sciences.

42
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,220
Thinking all of this isn't really a problem because we could just describe reality objectively

43
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,180
with literalism and so that's not relative, against this extreme relativist with this

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,900
sophisticated weaponry is a very rudimentary attack that will be blown out of the water

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,180
by this powerful enemy.

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,060
Again to understand the main staples of how they could even do that, we covered that in

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,820
our last video covering the power of relativism.

48
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,220
So please check that out if you'd like to see how exactly this weapon can be so powerful.

49
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,220
Or check this out if you would like more detail on who these SSK are and what happened in what

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,140
was called the science wars.

51
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,540
But if you're more interested in the battle against this enemy, how we can defeat them,

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,780
that's what we got for you today.

53
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,820
That will show the limits of this weapon.

54
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,700
Well actually Paul Grady first makes a wonderful setup from which he is able to then go and

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,060
defend against charges of relativism on two fronts, the two limits, here and here.

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,580
As I said this setup will be used for me to explain the powers of the philosophic eye,

57
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,260
or at least what I mean by that in my own theatric way of describing things.

58
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,500
In any case, he defends truth and rationality from charges of relativism.

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Those are the battles we are going to cover, but as I said for today, we'll just be covering

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,020
both that setup and the first battle, defending truth.

61
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,100
Now in this chapter on truth, he also discusses whether logic can be relative, so we will

62
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,580
look at logic as well in this video if not an additional one if this one gets too long.

63
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,700
By the way, O'Grady does accept relativism in ontology, of which ontology is a topic about

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,840
what there is, what kind of things there are in the world.

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,140
And he also accepts it sort of to a certain degree in epistemology, which is the study

66
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
of knowledge.

67
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,980
Here however, it is limited by how much relativism there can be in rationality, because rationality

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,500
plays an important role in knowledge.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,420
Again though, he actually still defends rationality against the charges of relativism by the

70
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,060
extreme relativists, which is the other awesome battle in this book which we will definitely

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,060
eventually cover in a different video, in the next one hopefully.

72
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,900
After we cover both these battles though, perhaps I may make a video of an overall assessment

73
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,420
of the book talking about some of the other chapters maybe, you know, if you subscribe.

74
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Hehe.

75
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,340
But enough about me, let's listen to Paul O'Grady to get that first important setup.

76
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,860
But let me point out whenever I am speaking for O'Grady, which will actually still be

77
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,820
my interpretation of paraphrasing of what he said, I will still cite it down through

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,020
the line in the corner of the screen, and when I speak more for myself, the citation

79
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,580
will disappear.

80
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,420
And that way you'll know what's from him sort of, and what's from me.

81
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,860
Also you can then check if I misinterpreted any of his lines and identify exactly where

82
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,380
I have failed, and that I always credit others in honesty if I'm covering their work.

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,620
And though I may just be a shadowy nobody on the internet here, please still mention

84
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,620
me, not as an academic source, but in a footnote or something if any of my videos have given

85
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,780
you formulation to your own thought.

86
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,940
You should do the same even if it's a conversation you've had with your professor and received

87
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,120
a clear idea from another person or something.

88
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,960
Be as honest and credit as much as possible.

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,780
Academic honesty and citation work hand in hand in improving your battle stance and philosophy,

90
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,100
helping to shelter you and support you by diverting attacks to others that you have

91
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,220
cited if certain attacks are inbound, but also allowing others to help correct your

92
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,340
stance if they can spot the sources of misunderstanding.

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,620
Wow, now that sounded like a big ethics lecture.

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,180
But anyway, so for today our battle is gonna focus specifically on Paul O'Grady's setup

95
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,900
and then ultimately his defense of truth against the charges of relativism by the

96
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Allithic Relativist, Allithic meaning about truth, and Relative being that which is dependent

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,580
on something else.

98
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,620
He says, Allithic Relativism has often been invoked as a way of avoiding contradiction.

99
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,420
So his first section is going to be about how Allithic Relativism is motivated by wanting

100
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,140
to avoid contradiction, then all the different ways to relativize truth, all of which will

101
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
be rejected.

102
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,900
In the second section we'll look at different theories of truth that might defend and relativize

103
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,380
version of truth, though actually that for the most part counts against those theories

104
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,660
not for it.

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,700
In any case, the third section is going to be about logic, whether it is relative and

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,420
whether there can be alternative logics.

107
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,020
So it's true, people have different beliefs on politics, morals, religion, music, etc.

108
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,180
One of the motivations is to accommodate this diversity.

109
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,300
So as if to say that though there are different views, they can all be true.

110
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,160
Think about this, remember we have already attacked their organs in a previous episode

111
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
and videos for you are here if you followed my journey.

112
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,060
So let's hope they know that we're coming from a good place ourselves as well.

113
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,620
Anyway, because of this, they reject both positions of a non-relativist.

114
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,440
Those positions are first, dogmatism, that one view can be true and the rest must be

115
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,940
false, denying diversity, and the other of non-cognitivism, that no one has the truth

116
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,940
because what they're saying can't even be said to be true or false.

117
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,340
For this, because truth isn't at issue, diversity can easily exist.

118
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,100
It's kind of like saying some things can be true or false like in science, but these

119
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,500
things, values, moral views, religious views, etc, they aren't the type of things that

120
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,460
can even be true or false, and diversity can flourish when truth isn't in the picture.

121
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,860
So truth relativists, illithic relativists, hold that some competing views can both be

122
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,620
legitimate candidates for truth and competing views as legit candidates can both be true

123
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,700
despite them being opposing.

124
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,420
To accept opposing positions as both being true simultaneously is on the face of it to

125
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,500
accept contradiction, and to do such a thing is unacceptable.

126
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,060
So I said in a previous video while dealing with Robert Kirk, to forgive me for not showing

127
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,020
how Kirk explained how contradictions are bad and just to trust me that he actually

128
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,260
did show us that.

129
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,460
I didn't show it because I really wanted to get to and show how O'Grady does it.

130
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,620
And this is that important setup that I wanted to show, which will work for him to defend

131
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,360
in different places against the relativists, but also may be ultimately the basis for one

132
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,260
of the coolest things that it will ever show on the show, that metaphysical eye.

133
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,940
It has a number of implications, but starting it out it may seem super simple.

134
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,380
So if it's simple for you and obvious, still be patient with it.

135
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,780
Only later will we really begin to use what he sets up here in battle, then we will truly

136
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,540
see how awesome it is.

137
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,140
But for now, let's just take a look.

138
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Let's see why contradictions are bad.

139
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,540
This is going to be awesome.

140
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Contradiction is the assertion of a statement or proposition and the negation of that same

141
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,860
assertion or proposition at the same time in the same understanding.

142
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,820
And this is an important point.

143
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,140
Because it's like changing your mind over time, that really isn't a contradiction.

144
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,380
People may say I believe something then and I don't believe it now because now I know

145
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,500
it's wrong.

146
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,620
So there's a now versus then distinction, showing that it's not a legitimate contradiction.

147
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,900
And for what we're talking about, it has to be a legitimate contradiction, p and not

148
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
p.

149
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,380
Oh, so p is a proposition, which is a statement about what is or not, the state of affairs

150
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,180
as they are or not.

151
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,660
And a proposition doesn't have to be represented or presented with the letter p, it could be

152
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,780
represented with q or r or s, it's just a kind of variable like in math how we can use

153
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,940
x or y or z to represent consistent numerical variables.

154
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,060
Also for your sake, this symbol is the negation symbol in logic.

155
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,140
It means not, or the negative of what is expressed after it.

156
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,260
But I'll try to keep it simple for you and try to write it like this whenever I can at

157
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
first.

158
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,740
But anyway, so about being a genuine contradiction.

159
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,340
Everyone saying this is black and this is white isn't a legitimate or genuine contradiction.

160
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,700
Something can be black and white.

161
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,980
A legit contradiction would be more like to say this is black and this is not black.

162
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, I kinda don't like this example too much because in normal everyday language,

163
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,860
if we are saying about say a soccer ball, we wouldn't actually just say it's black,

164
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,820
we would say it's black and white.

165
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,780
Just because we know it's kind of misleading to say just it's black.

166
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,660
And our general way of speaking would allow us to assume that it's not also white because

167
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,100
you would have said black and white if it were also white.

168
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,580
It would be kind of unusual to leave out white if your point was to say what color is the

169
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,980
ball is, you know?

170
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,460
But anyway, his point here is that there should be no sneaky way of showing that it's not

171
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,220
really a contradiction.

172
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,100
So it's black and it is not black is a very clear case of a contradiction.

173
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,660
And that's what he's trying to get at.

174
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,060
But to be a true relativist, they have to be willing to accept even these legitimate contradictions.

175
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,900
And what's the problem with accepting genuine cases of contradictions as possible?

176
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:05,060
The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of

177
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,100
assertion and negation.

178
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,860
This, this point here is one of the two main reasons I'm talking about O'Grady.

179
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,100
If you can grasp the essential nature of all assertion, you will have developed what I

180
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,780
call a metaphysical eye, a deeper philosophic understanding that allows you to catch enemies

181
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,220
who lack that understanding and end up committed to devastating and crippling positions.

182
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:36,220
So what comes next may on the one hand seem super obvious, but its implication we will

183
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,660
show later as being incredibly important.

184
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:47,300
You see, to make an assertion, you are expressing some content that something is the case.

185
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,220
Something is a certain way.

186
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,340
In doing that, you are at the same time denying its negation.

187
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,780
For example, the sun is shining at a certain time or place.

188
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,900
This rules out or denies the sun is not shining at that exact time or place or understanding

189
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,360
that is meant in the first proposition.

190
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,080
This is also a logical move called double negation here.

191
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,520
To say p is also equivalent to say not not p.

192
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,680
Now that's more of a formal logic way of expressing this rational principle.

193
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,800
Many of us learn in studying math say we're multiplying two negatives make a positive

194
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,240
or simply in English when we use the double negatives.

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,520
For example, someone that says it isn't true that we're not here means that it is true

196
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,120
that we are.

197
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,980
Or for example, it's not true that it's not raining means that it is true that it is raining.

198
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,560
So you see, double negatives make a positive.

199
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,280
But also a positive can be a double negative.

200
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,920
And that means a positive is like negating a negative.

201
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,480
Assertion implies the rejection of the negation of that assertion.

202
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,840
This is going to sound funny so for those of you who are listening to this and not

203
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,640
watching this, it might make more sense to watch this at the same time.

204
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:13,080
But asserting p, which is logically equal to not not p, shows it is not not p.

205
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,200
P denies not p.

206
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,920
This is really simple logic that we're familiar with.

207
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,000
But again, to be talking about it like this can feel a bit weird to someone new in philosophy.

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,480
So I hope I'm not actually confusing anyone by talking about something super basic but

209
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,800
in more formal logical ways.

210
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,960
But anyway, when it comes to contradiction, it is to assert and endorse both the assertion

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,040
and its negation.

212
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,560
P and not p.

213
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,440
This is kind of like cutting off its own legs maybe, that's the way of saying it, because

214
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,400
p should imply not not p.

215
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,920
Which denies not p.

216
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,600
And yet not p also denies p.

217
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,960
So a contradiction undermines the very process of asserting.

218
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,440
To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.

219
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,640
Two sides attacking each other in the same unit is nothing.

220
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Like one part negative and one part positive cancelling each other out in math or perhaps

221
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
in physics let's say.

222
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Since some basic math is plenty easier to grasp for many people I believe than maybe

223
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,160
my earlier logical stuff, let's look at it like this.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,360
So it's like you might as well say nothing.

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,640
It's equal to saying you have no knowledge, no claim to anything at all.

226
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,880
Also then a positive assertion like a plus one is equal to denying a negative or you

227
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,440
know minus a negative one.

228
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,040
Saying plus one minus one is to say nothing at all.

229
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,600
And then I would wonder why did you waste my time telling me something that yields nothing,

230
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,400
no claim, no stance, no belief, no anything.

231
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,160
To assert anything of substance that has a purpose meaning a stance requires that it

232
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,800
also denies the opposite of what is being asserted, lest it be rendered meaningless or

233
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,520
even false.

234
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,800
So this is a law of non-contradiction, a law against contradiction.

235
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:29,520
The law of non-contradiction is so basic and necessary that one cannot even argue for or

236
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,280
against it on the basis of anything more fundamental.

237
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,000
Because it's so fundamental, in fact it is the very basis of how we do argumentation

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
in the first place.

239
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,560
This makes it an insurmountable problem for anyone that tries to deny non-contradiction.

240
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,680
Even denying the principle, in so far as denying has any meaning whatsoever, must have

241
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,680
a determinate content that is not undermined by simultaneously affirming the principle.

242
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,600
So that is why contradictions must be avoided.

243
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
This is it.

244
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,360
If you get anything from this video, I hope it is this and it is tied to the very nature

245
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,400
of making any assertion.

246
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,280
With it you will see clearly what many have already begun to see in the previous Kirk

247
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,760
video series and what I spoke about as a crippling problem, which O'Grady now calls insurmountable.

248
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,600
Let me explain it like this.

249
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,320
It is self-defeat.

250
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,800
You see, this principle that contradictions are bad, let's say, it is actually the very

251
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,640
basis of arguing against something.

252
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,280
So to argue against this principle assumes this principle, that the principle works,

253
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,800
thus cutting off one's own legs in a way.

254
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,680
Even so we don't miss it, arguing for or asserting anything, no matter what, has a meaning

255
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,400
in so far as you are denying the opposite of what you are saying, as we stated earlier.

256
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,560
So an argument against this principle also requires it, in order for that argument to

257
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
have any meaning.

258
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,440
How can one contradict that contradictions happen?

259
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,320
It's an insurmountable problem for them who deny it.

260
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,640
And we saw this actually already in the Kirk video as I pointed it out for us.

261
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,280
And we'll talk about this again in my final talk about relativism before I'm done with

262
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
this whole topic.

263
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,320
But let me give it some more timeless, some very easy things that we may have encountered

264
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,520
in our lives that highlight this.

265
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,240
If one tries to deny that denial is possible, then how are you denying?

266
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
That is incoherent.

267
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:49,160
The TFM true for me relativist in the Kirk videos disagreed that disagreement happens.

268
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,440
How can you disagree that disagreement happens?

269
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,040
That's self-defeating.

270
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,480
If you try to say no one can say anything with any authority, then how did you say that?

271
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,400
In fact how can you say with authority, or even just substantively, what your own position

272
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,800
is unless it means to deny the opposite of that position?

273
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,680
I mean trying to say no one can talk is self-defeating and that you've just proven by what you're

274
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
doing that you are wrong.

275
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,680
One cannot deny that denial exists or claim that no one can make a claim nor say that

276
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,160
they know that there is no knowledge.

277
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,560
One should not be able to tell everyone to shut up that no one has the right to talk

278
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,760
because then that person too should have kept quiet.

279
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
If that were true.

280
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,240
While I always say philosophers keep battling, philosophers do battle about anything they

281
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,440
can but it takes short time for a philosopher to realize certain positions are terrible

282
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,720
either because they have more arguments against them than can have defending them but also

283
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,600
because it may be a self-defeating position and those must be avoided at all costs.

284
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,600
So Immanuel Kant once said and I quoted metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or a lighthouse

285
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
strewn with many a philosophic wreck.

286
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Man eff that ship let me tell you this is from me not O'Grady not anyone else but metaphysics

287
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,480
epistemology philosophy of mind anywhere you are there is a lighthouse there is always

288
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,960
a lighthouse and it stands on the pillar of non-contribution a pillar of rationality

289
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,640
and connecting to another pillar the nature of assertion and thus the necessity of truth

290
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,520
this will be our lighthouse and I will talk more about this lighthouse in the future and

291
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,160
what my organs are perhaps but there is enough to understand to really see with what I theatrically

292
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,400
call your metaphysical eye when self-defeat is happening this is the philosophic eye that

293
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
will allow you to defeat your philosophic enemies from working within their own system but there

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,640
is a commitment here further that O'Grady will talk about later when he defends rationality

295
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,440
when he defends rationality itself against attack in the next battle but also something

296
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,200
metaphysical that I feel is actually left out from O'Grady's discussion that perhaps

297
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,120
I will address at the end but how exactly then does this seeming obvious point become

298
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,120
very useful on the battlefield how does this really help us in a way to conduct our lives

299
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,520
or our society and how deep does it impact philosophy or the world well this star allows

300
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,080
me to speak enough but maybe not enough to elaborate or visualize my metaphors here

301
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,760
if you subscribe though maybe I will gain more power to speak myself but we are here

302
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,760
not for some shadowy nobody like me but for a real human being Paulo Grady so let's

303
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:16,600
get back to him so you can't actually argue for or against non-contradiction for doing

304
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,880
that would assume it so to avoid contradiction because now we know contradictions are bad

305
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,880
the relativist denies that there is a real contradiction because truth itself is just

306
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:37,160
relative something is either true for you or true for me for some of them that's their

307
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,280
distinction like now and then except they're not using now and then they're using for me

308
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,360
or for you so it's opposing views but not in the same sense thus it's not a real contradiction

309
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,640
for them and this is what we covered in the last episode episode six we saw Robert Kirk

310
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,480
battle this kind of relativist the true for me relativist the tfm relativist in the last episode

311
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,600
but O'Grady makes kind of quicker work of them than Kirk did O'Grady however asks a bunch of

312
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,240
questions that we all would of someone that claims truth is relative but I guess I'd only

313
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,280
highlight this question in particular if all truth is relative is that itself relatively true

314
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,440
or absolutely true pointing to the incoherence of relativists once again in a way can you see it

315
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,000
but anyway leaving that for now O'Grady then says something that is more true in our common

316
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,240
lives which is why I spent so much time emphasizing it in the previous episode with Kirk he says that

317
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,680
at the crudest level saying something is like true for me is just a way of being polite and

318
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:50,200
non-confrontational like saying God exists is true for me but this doesn't actually stop us from

319
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,120
judging whether something is true or false just that we're no longer judging the true or false

320
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,960
whether God exists instead it is changed to merely if it is true or false whether or not you actually

321
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,440
do believe one way or another this is common but is not actually a way of relativizing truth

322
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,840
so it's a non-starter whoa actually I really love this this is a great point that makes quick work

323
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,440
of the tfm relativists many relativists believe they are not making objective statements about

324
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,840
how things are if they put in qualifiers like to person x y is true well okay y is true is now

325
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:38,040
relative to person x but it's still a proposition that reports the truth of to person x y is true

326
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,040
now is this non-relatively true perhaps here's where we covered another cool thing that I think

327
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Kirk did about how there could be an infinite regress with this but to be clear simply saying

328
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:57,800
I think science is good doesn't mean you're not making an objective claim just that your objective

329
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,560
claim now isn't about science it is about the truth of what you think and so we could ask about

330
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,400
the objective truth of whether you actually think that about science or not and it would ascertain

331
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,520
the truth of your statement in a way that is for us and for everyone and not just for you simply

332
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,320
saying to me or for me or in my opinion or I believe doesn't mean one isn't making an objective

333
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:32,200
claim actually all it's doing is just reducing or preserving the space to where we feel more

334
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,400
entitled to be objective where we are less likely to be opposed or questioned to speak about what I

335
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,320
think or how I feel one is more entitled to objectively take a stance on what is the case

336
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,520
with these qualifiers again think about how every assertion still nevertheless needs to be substantive

337
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,080
to say something and thus to oppose its opposite anyway so as O'Grady says there's got to be a

338
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,720
better way to philosophically relativize truth because this actually is a non-starter well

339
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm gonna talk about three ways these are going to be the three better more philosophically

340
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:18,120
empower ways to try and relativize truth that the relativist may choose other than just stating that

341
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,320
everything is simply true for me or true for you we're going to call these at least three attacks

342
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,600
the first attack is going to be artificial languages associated with Tarski and Carnep

343
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,400
that truth is relative to a language or a system and there can be many languages so truth is actually

344
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,640
just relative to the pragmatic reasons we have to which system we decide upon the second attack

345
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,520
is going to be about how true and false aren't the only options associated with Joseph Margolis

346
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,600
the third attack is an account that is given by Chris Sawyer but one that shifts the relativization

347
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:02,040
away from being about truth really so this is the battle so this is the battle

348
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,280
O'Grady versus the Alithic well attack one artificial languages

349
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,480
since ordinary natural language were vague and imprecise for scientific use and could

350
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,480
lead to philosophic problems Gottlieb Frege championed the construction of special languages for

351
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:37,160
philosophy called Burgerschrift okay so I can't pronounce it despite having read it thousands

352
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,600
of times in many different places but hey I don't really have German philosophy friends to you know

353
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,800
have a quick talk about for this video you know so I could have learned how to pronounce it properly

354
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:56,760
I also don't have German friends to ask I also don't have friends anyway the idea was that if you

355
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,840
made language clear and precise enough like math you could clear away many philosophical problems

356
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,440
just by being clear about what is said to be and what is therefore implied by it and philosophers

357
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,560
could make these languages for scientists use we sort of already have been talking about this in

358
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,280
the last video when we discussed Carnap again check it out if you like but one of frega's students

359
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,200
Rudolph Carnap as I just mentioned took up the project various philosophic issues there in

360
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,280
ordinary language could actually be solved in these specially constructed precise languages

361
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:39,320
things like the analytic synthetic distinction logical consequence and even truth could be

362
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,760
clearly defined in such artificially constructed languages which language was chosen to be used

363
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:53,480
and therefore which definition of truth it entailed was a matter of pragmatic choice for the scientists

364
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,520
that philosophers would make these languages for you see Carnap at the time felt in normal

365
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,960
language the notion of truth is a sloppy concept that just ends up in unnecessary philosophical

366
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,960
debate about correspondence between appearance and reality in the new languages however truth

367
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:17,160
could be given clear and strict definitions but only holds within that language now when Polish

368
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,760
American Alfred Tarski made his celebrated account of truth he followed Carnap in dealing with only

369
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,720
artificial languages and his account of truth didn't work in natural language so the general

370
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,960
universal notions of truth began to be replaced with the notion of true in L where L is the

371
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,680
artificial language keep in mind that from the philosophic point of view the traditional

372
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,760
philosophic discussions about say what is the nature of truth were thought of as pseudo debates

373
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,360
arising from the confusion over language so really it became more preferable that truth

374
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,480
was thought of as merely a term with a clear definition that depends on which language you

375
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:10,280
choose in this way truth becomes relativized to each artificial language and in fact contradiction

376
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,520
can happen within a language but each language gets to set out its own criteria of what counts

377
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:23,880
as a contradiction too and so contradiction only happens within a particular language not across

378
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,440
different languages so the relativist employs the Tarski-Carnap argument that truth is just whatever

379
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,000
is true in L and different languages can actually be set so something doesn't count as a contradiction

380
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,560
within it and discussions of truth generally beyond what is true in L is just confusions

381
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,800
truth thus relativized well now Paulo Grady defends against this attack

382
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,160
firstly he points out what's the real relevance of artificial languages and definitions concerning

383
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,760
real beliefs genuine disputes between people about beliefs can't be sidestep because of the

384
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,280
employment of artificial languages that seems kind of like a common sense philosophy here but

385
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,200
Paulo Grady has an even more philosophic response to this issue check it out as he points out

386
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,360
remember choice between artificial language is a pragmatic issue which shouldn't itself

387
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,040
be a discussion of truth it's just a matter of whether one versus another is more useful or not

388
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:40,280
right but even to say even to make the judgment that this language is useful requires the notion

389
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:49,000
of truth that it's true that that language is useful this judgment of truth that a language is

390
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,640
indeed useful or not stands outside the particular artificial language themselves not relativized

391
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,920
and it's that notion of the truth in a general theoretical sense that this artificial languages

392
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:12,280
attack tried to remove well see it didn't such use seems unavoidable wow what a move that was

393
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,400
awesome Paulo Grady did something awesome here like uh i love this because it challenges that

394
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,960
naive notion that pragmatics somehow dissolves philosophic issues in all cases such as discussions

395
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,120
of truth and knowledge now you uh maybe perhaps don't do philosophy in academia but there's no

396
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,320
field of knowledge whether medicine sport science law or business analyst or something like that

397
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,960
where the discussion of how do we know something in that field isn't important or in this case

398
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,240
it helps to show that if you have a concern about is it true that trying to replace it with

399
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,920
its pragmatic that or its practical that doesn't actually really remove the philosophic concern

400
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,720
because someone with that concern would just move on to concerns of well is it true that it is

401
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,760
pragmatic and such and such this is a kind of similar move though isn't it to something we've

402
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:18,680
already seen saying true for me didn't stop our concern of objective claims nor does saying oh

403
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:25,960
it's pragmatic that stop our concerns with is it true that in a similar fashion do you see it

404
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:35,080
trying to say hey discussions about truth can be made to not count down here across languages

405
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:42,520
at the artificial level doesn't remove how they do happen up here because the notion of truth

406
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,520
can't be avoided so long as any judgment is happening from a kind of above position

407
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:56,760
above position i say hopefully my visuals are helping here and we will continue to use them

408
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,720
to show how in a sense we go high or above to speak about things anything when we are stating how

409
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:11,240
things are in a capital t truth way even when we qualify our statements with to me or to them or

410
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,280
in science or its practical that or its pragmatic that and hopefully by the end of this video

411
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,240
you will come to realize the necessity of this and it will actually build the power of this

412
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,760
philosophic eye that i promised so maybe it's worth rewatching this video twice uh to get what

413
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,840
i'm kind of saying here if it sounds a little confusing but don't worry about it like it will

414
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,240
really become much more clear once we covered both these battles in any case attack one has failed

415
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,560
but the wicked elithic relativist isn't done yet another far more spooky attack comes about

416
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,520
attack two multiple truth values conflicting views produce a contradiction in a classical logic

417
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:03,560
in which there are two truth values either the truth value of true or false two now relativists

418
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,160
are accused of self-refutation this is the self-defeat that we saw earlier with that circle

419
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,040
also sometimes called incoherence but to avoid that problem some say there's more than just

420
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:24,040
two truth values that there could be three or more which means they drop the classical logic law

421
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,160
of the excluded middle a law that states that there's only truth and false no third value

422
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,720
so just to re-explain this sort of sorry if this is repetitive but it's important to be

423
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,840
clear about what the strategy is here if you remember the relativists wanted to use something

424
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,720
the principle of non-contradiction because they needed in order to express a content

425
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:53,560
but the content that they wanted to express was to deny that principle p and not p that itself

426
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,520
is a contradiction both of these cannot be true or perhaps another way to look at it is p cannot

427
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:09,240
be both true and false but anyway looking at the example of p and not p because both cannot be true

428
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,640
then if one is true the other must be false this relied on the principle of non-contradiction as we

429
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:24,360
saw before if this is true then this has to be false but also the other way around if one is false

430
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,560
the other must be true easy enough right so choosing one of the two options forces the

431
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,560
opposite proposition to be the other option but this isn't just because of non-contradiction

432
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,760
it's also because there isn't a third option here and that's called the law of the excluded middle

433
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:52,520
things are either true or false no middle no new option but if we drop that law and we had like a

434
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,480
third option then saying this is false doesn't necessarily mean that this one has to be true

435
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,120
it could also possibly be this other thing whatever it is so dropping the excluded middle

436
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:13,240
law may save the relativist from self-defeat in this way that way they can deny p the principle of

437
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:21,080
non-contradiction while not necessarily asserting p as true it would be this new thing what would that

438
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:31,800
third value even look like well some say indeterminate so like t f and question mark maybe or others say

439
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,800
like mostly mainly or half truth and mostly mainly false well that's like seven different values there

440
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:46,520
but if you think of it if you can do something like that you can even do it using more numbers

441
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:56,600
for probability like between 0 and 1 0.1 true or 0.56 true doing this kind of thing instead of just

442
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:03,480
t and f doesn't necessarily make your relativist but it can be helpful to relativists in defusing

443
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,520
what could have been a contradiction if we had only a two-valued system p may be very probable

444
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:21,240
or 0.96 true while not p could be half or 0.5 true and so it is claimed a classical contradiction is

445
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:29,640
avoided joseph margulis makes a detailed relativist position that demands the rejection of the principle

446
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:37,160
of excluded middle rejecting the two values only systems because using a two value only system

447
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,600
could lead to a contradiction for relativists if they try to use this classical logic to defend

448
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,880
ontological relativism or incommensurability incommensurability is another thing that happens

449
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,520
to appear to promote relativism as it means there's no shared value or shared position from which you

450
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,800
can measure two different things so they can't be compared so to avoid contradiction they move to a

451
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,880
multi-valued logic instead but that might be the motivation behind why the relativists want to drop

452
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,760
the law of the excluded middle but margulis also had reasons presented in that he links his rejection

453
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:22,680
to what he calls cognitive intraintra what intrapah to what he calls cognitive intrapah shoot he links

454
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,640
his rejection to what he calls cognitive intransparency we don't really know the world in itself the

455
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,880
world is always mediated to us in historical and context laden ways

456
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,800
so how does polo grady deal with this multiple truth values attack it seems pretty radical

457
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:50,280
out there to say that there's more than just truth and falsehood well first off is it really a new

458
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,720
third value we're talking about here like look at this one like just because you don't know what the

459
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,680
value is and maybe you never can thus calling it indeterminate that doesn't mean it's a new value

460
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,240
it just means that you recognize that you don't know that it's a truth gap and they've already

461
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,840
been systems that developed with this truth gap in mind and they don't act like this is some kind

462
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:23,880
of new value somehow secondly just because you add modifiers like most or sometimes or 0.33 to

463
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,680
a classic two-value system hardly means that you actually made new values one obviously can see that

464
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,280
these things as merely saying probability of something but it isn't actually a new kind of

465
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,960
fundamental truth value being introduced here seems to be an epistemic issue that is an issue

466
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:49,080
about knowledge of how likely something is to be true rather than importing a new conception of truth

467
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,960
thirdly just like with the case with artificial languages is it really helpful to our cases of

468
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,240
contradiction it could be after all merely still relying on a two-valued system anyway

469
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:08,280
thus the second attack attack two while it seemed pretty radical still nevertheless

470
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,600
failed now ogredy just makes a quick point for himself he says look one of the main reasons

471
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,520
for ontological relativity is to avoid contradiction in ontology anyway what he's saying is that

472
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,640
relativists want to avoid contradiction even as they espouse the way the world is can be different

473
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,560
and relative but ogredy says we can have that without having to alter our conception of the

474
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,320
truth there are alternatives to get to ontological relativism without having to come up with new

475
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,360
truth values and presumably he will explain what those ways are in his chapter on ontology

476
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:51,320
where he himself allows for relativism and so as a larger strategy trying to go at it like this

477
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,480
and figure new ways to make new truth values is not necessary and paul ogredy then advocates for

478
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,840
what quine calls a policy of minimum mutilation this is like ogredy saying that if you want

479
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,600
relativism in ontology we can figure out a way to do that without having to do this massive change

480
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,880
when it's completely unnecessary to do so we should do the minimum amount of changing so i

481
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,840
guess the question then remains how how do we get that and wait what exactly is ontological

482
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,080
relativity because really i mean i really really didn't in detail explain it in this video yet

483
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,440
but neither did he so i guess we kind of have to wait to check out his chapter in ontology

484
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,560
to really see what's going on there and how we can get ontological relativity without massive

485
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:42,680
changes to truth but for now let's move on to the third attack attack three strong and weak

486
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,960
distinction chris soyer also investigated relativism while charging most arguments against

487
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,400
relativism as unfairly assuming absolutism in the first place he ultimately at least

488
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,760
this argument defends against a kind of alithic relativism as we shall see even while accepting

489
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,040
a few of their premises in any case he says the typical version of alithic relativism

490
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:12,360
employs a notion of frameworks as we have seen in the previous video about the power of relativism

491
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,800
similarly with terms like paradigm framework language games conceptual scheme while all can

492
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,520
come from different places they function in much the same way as to the arguments employed by

493
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,120
relativists and against i guess objectivists who think that there is some kind of director

494
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:35,320
unmediated access or observation or descriptive ability of reality itself relative truth is truth

495
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,960
that is relative to some framework this framework may be of different kinds historical cultural

496
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,880
linguistic or biological for example so like everything that so like everything that makes

497
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,560
up how you interpret or mediate the world so the issue is something that is true in one framework

498
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,400
but false in a different framework because it's relativized to different frameworks it avoids

499
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,680
the contradiction that would have happened if it was the same framework a grady points out as we

500
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,840
can tell it's basically the same thing as true and l where l was for an artificial language but

501
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,400
now it's just replaced with the notion of frameworks a grady then goes on to use an example

502
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,840
of the hopi indian tribe now the hopi indian tribe is one of the most widely cited examples by

503
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,400
relativists you know along with the azandei i guess and relativists of many stripes pushing

504
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,680
relativism into whichever field of investigation they desire the hopi indian do appear to have

505
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,040
different worldview and we'll talk about what that is in the next battle but a grady will argue that

506
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,200
that means they have different ontology not therefore different everything which some extreme

507
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,720
relativists might insist that they do have also different logic therefore and different rationality

508
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:54,040
and different truths even that is for the relativists their language is proof of relativism about

509
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,840
truth anyway this little note of mine here is kind of spilling the beans behind what o grady

510
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,800
will say as he puts it in brackets on a paragraph 13 line 67 a source of confusion here is that the

511
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:12,680
hopi do in fact have a different ontology soyer is exploring the possibility about relativism

512
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,680
about truth but it seems better to explain the difference in the hopi and the standard scientific

513
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:26,120
view with relativized ontology but keeping an absolute conception of truth soyer makes a distinction

514
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:33,240
between strong and weak relativism wherein strong relativism the same sentence can be true in one

515
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:41,240
framework but false in another so like spirits live in trees true in the hopi framework but false

516
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,720
translated to normal english and then there is weak relativism where one sentence cannot even be

517
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:54,200
expressed in another framework where translation is not possible soyer decides he's gonna focus on

518
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:00,600
the strong one because he says that's where most relativists are at anyway thinking that translation

519
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:07,800
is possible but the way he sees it is that there are two premises the world as experienced is

520
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:16,040
partially constituted by frameworks and translation is possible between frameworks and somehow this

521
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:25,640
is supposed to conclude to truth is relative in the strong sense but soyer doesn't think three

522
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,720
follows two is questionable especially if the statement becomes contradictory false in one and

523
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:38,040
true in another how could they have anything in common if the worlds the frameworks are so different

524
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,640
then what sense can the sentence even mean the same thing in what sense are they the same sentence

525
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,160
or equivalence if the ontology is different between the frameworks that is if the world is

526
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,280
different expressed by the two different frameworks then it seems that the meaning of the sentence

527
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:01,000
must be different as soyer pithley puts it and pithley means a brief or sharp or forcefully

528
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,800
like straight up soyer straight up says it like a change of world entails a change of meaning

529
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:14,680
so to encapsulate that saying that something can be false in another framework it shows that it's

530
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,400
not really the same thing then if you're really trying to say that the other framework can be so

531
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,440
radically different that can lead it to being false because of this attack three strong failed

532
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,320
so if you didn't get that strong relativism won't work or at least it seems if the worlds are so

533
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,760
different that the same sentence can be false in one yet true in another the sentence doesn't

534
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,040
really mean the same thing then the meaning of the sentence is changing if the worlds are so

535
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:50,760
radically different that we could even consider one thing false while true in another and our focus

536
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,440
as per ogready has been much more to do with seeing how the idea of worlds can be different

537
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,440
doesn't necessarily need to include that truth is relative okay so the strong attack failed but

538
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,120
what about the weak attack weak alithic relativism where a sentence is inexpressible in another

539
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,640
framework remember we kind of had that condition earlier about how legitimate relativism about

540
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,560
truth would allow for contradiction in a different context different sentences become

541
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,840
candidates for truth and false like a context of math taxonomy or genetic history etc in a

542
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,600
different context a sentence may not even appear so to make that easier to explain i guess while

543
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,960
playing basketball the truth of whether light is really the universal speed limit would not even show

544
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,800
it wouldn't even be a candidate for truth or false while playing basketball is it two hundred

545
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,920
and ninety nine million seven hundred ninety two thousand four hundred fifty eight meters per second

546
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,000
like i can't even ask such a question in basketball type of language so whether that's true or false

547
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,760
doesn't even register in basketball language let's say and therefore the truth of that sentence

548
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,640
is relative to languages where they would be even a candidate for truth and false

549
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,360
but already says that ain't really relativism about truth though for relativism we need something

550
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:18,440
to be true and false in different contexts but just cuz something isn't expressible in another

551
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,640
language doesn't mean there's a threat of contradiction it seems like these different

552
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,600
contexts or different styles of reasoning here whatever you'd like to call it can still nevertheless

553
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,800
be perfectly compatible different things are being discussed which can be lumped together in a larger

554
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:39,800
account with no contradiction so relativism about truth isn't defensible in that way either

555
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,800
attack three week failed

556
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:53,800
so

557
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,880
well that was an awesome battle wasn't it well oh grady did some good work there i think but

558
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,280
there's still more room more attack left in the relativist for those that believe that

559
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,120
different theories of truth can allow for more openness to a relativized version of truth so

560
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:27,480
now oh grady has a section where he talks about correspondence theory of truth epistemic theory

561
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,160
of truth and a deflationist theory of truth the former two being what he calls substantive he

562
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,200
discusses how depending on which theory you use it has different impacts for relativism in other

563
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,480
places but because i'm currently not thinking i'm necessarily going to be covering his entire book

564
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,960
or at least not sure to what depth i'm going to be doing that i'm just going to cover it quickly

565
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,840
with this kind of graph and then we'll go on to the second battle basically the ones that are

566
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,680
substantive are saying that truth is substantively important that it's a kind of property of some

567
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,920
sentences or belief that makes it explanatorily important the deflationist ones are where truth

568
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,760
is insignificant and just a kind of grammatical thing we say he talks about alfred he gives an

569
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:16,760
example using a tarski here but i'm just going to skip that part anyway of the substantive ones

570
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,920
he discusses too the first one being correspondence theory where truth is when propositions correspond

571
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,960
to reality he brings up a few reasons why this is actually untenable like how the best ones really

572
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:34,360
still entail how larger propositions rely on the truth of basic elements but there aren't basic

573
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,280
propositions in the natural language and how it's not actually well explained how there's a structure

574
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,040
in a proposition that is the same one in reality how they can both share that same structure

575
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,040
anyway if you like a detailed discussion of this kind of criticism of correspondence theory just

576
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,440
let me know in the comments below but the point is that correspondence theory doesn't leave room

577
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:01,400
open for relativism on ontology nor in epistemology or at least technically it can still be connected

578
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,000
to ontological relativism you know relativism about what there is or what kind of things there are

579
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,920
in the world but that would kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a correspondence

580
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,560
theorist in the first place because it makes correspondence theory not all that substantive

581
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,880
if language could connect to multiple realities then he talks about how there's an epistemological

582
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,880
theory of truth where truth is just the best of what we know this kind of has a problem of well

583
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:34,440
you know we can be wrong about things so truth seems to change as we adjust and the answer back

584
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,440
to that concern is usually like cool whatever truth is an ideal anyway like a goal that we

585
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,120
just never reach because we never truly finish investigating everything but we always will

586
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,800
try and the best of our trying is what we'll just call truth it makes it kind of grammatical I guess

587
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:57,560
in that sense responding to that however critics are often like you're just conflating issues with

588
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:04,360
knowledge and how or if we can have certainty with what the truth is but they respond back well

589
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,840
that's not much of a criticism you're just inherently assuming or stipulating that truth

590
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:14,920
is something other than what we propose here in any case this one though does leave the doors open

591
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,600
for relativism in ontology and in epistemology the study of knowledge but just because it leaves

592
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:26,360
doors open for relativism in ontology and in epistemology well does that really mean that it

593
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,640
can leave doors open for relativizing truth as well well O'Grady will argue that the amount of

594
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:37,240
relativism in the epistemology is actually limited by rationality which is another place he battles

595
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,280
to defend against relativism and the result of that kind of has a trickleback effect I guess you

596
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,560
could say to ensure that ultimately there is one absolute truth and that's what we're gonna see

597
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,120
next so let's see now how he defends against charges of relativism in rationality oh wait

598
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,840
before we do that we should look at logic logic in some sense already seems to be much of the

599
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,120
discussion in defending against relativism for O'Grady it's a part of his whole setup anyway

600
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,920
also it's often the go-to move for people to push back against claims of something being relative

601
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,640
they just say hey it's logic anyway so let's check that out the link for the next video will

602
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,560
be below I think you deserve a break but if you don't need a break and you're ready to go ready

603
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:29,640
get that next thing on then let's go now and see logic versus relativism by the way thank you for

604
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,160
watching this video give it a like and a comment too the comments I have received over the years

605
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,360
actually as well as my patreon supporter slick pockets are ultimately the greatest motivating

606
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:46,520
thing I see comments of support mentally really help me and honestly there are things that I find

607
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,920
in those comments that are sometimes so touching even though I don't reply like I really do read

608
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,720
all of them and I know I'm doing something good things here and maybe even with my life because

609
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,920
of those comments you know I don't even know if I've mentioned before but writing the script for

610
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,440
this episode episode seven like I literally heard gunshots out of my window while writing philosophy

611
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,760
it's it's caught me really questioning sometimes why I'm doing this so they help so if you can

612
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,680
please socially or financially help me you can support me on patreon or if you have paypal you
