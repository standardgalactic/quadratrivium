1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Relativism. It is one of the most powerful modern philosophic weapons. Its power is immense,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,240
however it can become dangerous if wielded to extreme degrees, by those with insufficient

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,560
philosophic understanding. While it can be traced back to ancient times, it is philosophies from

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,720
five different great philosophers that are noted to have been imbued into this weapon,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,280
empowering it into the modern philosophic warfare. Relativism is most useful in carving out the

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,400
layers of presumed objectivity and the naivety of our old ways. We use relativism now as more

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,320
a clear path to being skeptical about all sorts of claims, not just who makes the best pizza,

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,640
or even what is right and wrong, but now, even what we may have previously called facts.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,480
And so this weapon becomes incredibly crucial for any good philosophic warrior to appreciate its

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:05,840
power, but equally important, also its limits. And ignoring those limits can create dangerous and

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,760
frustrating enemies for us on the battlefield. We must learn to wield relativism to become

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,320
good philosophers, to question, to be skeptical of all sorts of claims to objectivity. We must use

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,760
it whenever it can be used, but we must also be cautious and not be impatient in our journey to

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:33,200
investigate cases where perhaps it cannot. The limits of its use. So today we're gonna explain

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,000
those two things, the power and limits of this tremendous philosophic weapon called relativism.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Which is why we came here to the battlefield of metaphysics in the first place, so we can dismantle

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,080
it and see more than merely a blur of all it can destroy, to see that it indeed does have limits

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,280
and indeed does become volatile when those limits are crossed. Limits that we will later point out,

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,280
if it should be crossed by those on the battlefield of the philosophy of science in particular,

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,560
when we get back to the battlefield science, if we ever get back. Anyway, we'll be looking at

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,720
the power and limits as explained and set out in this green book, Relativism by Paul O'Grady.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,320
In the last episode we looked at a battle in this red book, Relativism and Reality by Robert Kirk,

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,000
because I wanted to make a social point. You see, as it is clearly outlined in all three books I may

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,520
want to cover on relativism, including this blue book, The Challenge of Relativism by Patrick J.J.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:46,000
most find relativism alluring for social reasons. Because we want to be open and tolerant to people

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,160
of different perspectives, different viewpoints, and understanding from different political spheres,

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,320
different cultures, races, genders, and so on. But if we jump into it, guns ablazing as the

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,080
phrase goes, without sufficient philosophical understanding first, one might hastily end up

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,480
wielding relativism to an unlimited degree such that one takes the position that everything is

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,720
relative. Even truth, yep, knowledge, truth, reality, everything. And that's what we might call

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,680
an extreme relativist. So while I personally find those in the pursuit of tolerance, not just noble

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,880
but necessary, I present extreme relativism as a terrible strategy in that pursuit. Now it might

33
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,520
sound kind of ridiculous right now, like who would think that say oh I don't know that literal

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,160
scientific facts are relative. It does happen though, it did happen, and probably it still will

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,880
happen. But we will explain in this video how this weapon appears to become even that powerful

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,840
as wielded by sophisticated relativists, with seemingly good reasons. In any case, Robert Kirk

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,440
in a section of that red book that I have here took an unsophisticated version of that extreme

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,640
relativist that's known as the true for me relativist, or if you're fancy the protagorean

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,720
relativist. Anyway for that version of the extreme relativist, there is no truth, there is just whatever

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,640
is true for me or true for you. So what counts as truth depends on the personal perspective of the

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,000
speaker. Though at first it may have seemed kind of funny, but we actually encounter people who

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,440
hold this kind of belief at all levels of society, not just in the philosophy classrooms,

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,240
people use this to express their truths about politics, religion, and even about

44
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,560
literal states of the world, facts, and so on. From the newsroom to the bar conversation,

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,800
arguing over global warming, alternative medicine, or even if the dragon eater sports team should have

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,880
won the golden cup. True for me is often used to speak without trying to offend others or tell

47
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,000
others that they are wrong for having a different position, or perhaps just to hold on to what you

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,160
believe despite evidence shown otherwise. And I go over a few different reasons why people do this

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,720
in that Robert Kirk video series, episode 6. Now back in that last episode though, episode 6,

50
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
in that battle Kirk shows that this position of saying everything is just true for me or true for

51
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,440
you actually can't support the idea that everything is relative, but also that in trying to defend

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,760
against Kirk's attacks, the extreme relativist also becomes further committed to a path that leads

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,800
them to becoming a solipsist. What is a solipsist? It's thinking that you're the only one that exists,

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,280
that there are no other minds, just one mind, just you. Everything else is just a presentation around

55
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,560
you. Please check out that last episode if you like to see how TFM, true for me,

56
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,200
relativism leads to solipsism. But from there Kirk does show that that too,

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,280
solipsism, is a position that doesn't support this assertion, and I thought that was a pretty cool

58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,720
philosophic move to do. But then I made my own move to re-explain why true for me or TFM leads to

59
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,840
solipsism in my own way. And then that a solipsist's position isn't actually open and tolerant,

60
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,680
that actually, while you may have started out as a relativist for those good noble reasons of

61
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,120
tolerance and openness that I agree with, that if you stay committed to TFM and become a solipsist,

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,760
it's actually close-minded, selfish, intolerant position that denies the agency of others,

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,520
and even defies the grasp of the very concept of otherness. Instead of bringing understanding

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,360
from different perspectives together, they actually become a segregationist of sorts,

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,240
preventing any real engagement with otherness, thus becoming exactly what they hate, opposing the

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,600
very heart or organs of why they wanted to be a relativist in the first place. Again, if you think

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,160
that's kind of interesting, and would like to see how all that happened, you can check out that

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,000
series of videos here. I'll put the links below in the description. And if you were or will be

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,640
influenced by my move made in that video, well, you know, even though this is a YouTube video and

70
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,760
not an academic source, you know, I'm just a shadowy nobody here, but please still credit that

71
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,200
video in some way, at least in the footnotes. It's about intellectual honesty, you know? Also,

72
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,480
that way, if I say anything wrong and you're influenced by it, others will know why, and blame

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,000
can also fall on my shoulders. And hopefully that might bring some other philosophers to come battle

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,760
me over it. And surely one of us will learn something from that battle. Anyway, that version of the

75
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,520
relativist isn't actually the more powerful version that philosophers battle against. So,

76
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,480
I ended up promising that we would go and move on to bigger, badder relativists,

77
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,400
ones who are actually empowered by arguments from philosophers themselves.

78
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Those five that I mentioned earlier are the ones that Paul O'Grady specifically notes. For him,

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,680
it's actually one of three tendencies that showed up in the different areas of philosophy,

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,280
pushing out this more modernized weapon. So, here we are today looking at the imbuing of this power,

81
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,400
the three tendencies that includes ideas from these five philosophers.

82
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,400
Briefly, in Paul O'Grady's book, he has a general outline that looks like this. Here,

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,640
we will find the philosophies that helped embolden these relativists and empower that

84
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,880
relativist weapon. This is what this video will cover now, the power. Here and here, O'Grady draws

85
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,400
the limits of relativism, at truth and rationality. Now, on logic, relativism is sort of allowed in

86
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,480
the sense that it is allowed on a lower order, but I will explain that later. Relativism, however,

87
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,160
for O'Grady, is allowed in ontology. I find this much has to do with the basis of conceptual

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,800
relativity, but we won't be covering it for our purposes right now. Also, some relativization

89
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,880
is allowed in epistemology, but limited by the amount set out in chapter 5, limits on

90
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,520
relativism about rationality. Today though, we'll go over some of that power, as I promised. It may

91
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,960
seem kind of quick though, because O'Grady seems more about wanting to point out the sources of

92
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,880
this power than actually getting into with examples what those sources really are that gave it the

93
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,360
power. So hopefully at times I can assist there. Also, don't worry if it's a bit fast. In each

94
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
place, each battle, later on that we cover, the philosophic arguments from the actual

95
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
philosophic thought is often addressed anyway, and sometimes the philosophers are other than these

96
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,600
five. But one in particular, I will be doing myself, in an additional video, to help explain

97
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,080
so that people really understand why simply thinking literalism, or scientific physical

98
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,640
descriptions, is not actually strong enough to oppose this relativist, whose weapon has been

99
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,080
empowered by these five philosophers. After that, we'll move on to talk about each of the chapters

100
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:25,440
that include the limits of relativism, and the battles therein. So this part, power, may not

101
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,440
have much battle itself, but it is a look at that weapon that will be in play in the battles here

102
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,440
after. Finally, after all this, I will give my overall evaluation of the book, and maybe then

103
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
I'll touch on some of the chapters that I left out. So let's get to it.

104
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,920
Philosophy battle. The most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet,

105
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,200
probably. Now entering the battlefield of metaphysics.

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, light switch.

107
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh, uh, I'm gonna keep this on.

108
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,760
Hmm, whoa.

109
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,080
That's better. Here is Paul O'Grady. That's not really him. That's just an image I made.

Support me on Patreon, or make a direct contribution to me on PayPal.

111
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Who will give us a little history lesson that will lead us to explaining the powers of this

112
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,400
weapon. And to be clear, as he says it in his preface, he is more going to cover this topic

113
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,400
in an analytic tradition than a continental one. And also, he's not going to be covering Einstein,

114
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,640
which doesn't really have to do with what we're talking about here. Anyway, let's begin.

115
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,960
Long ago in the land before time. Oh, okay, wait. That was just me, not him. Listen, whenever I'm

116
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,080
speaking for O'Grady, it will be sited down to the line on the bottom of the screen. Unless I say

117
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,160
otherwise. That way, you know I make up nothing. And if I misinterpreted anything, you know exactly

118
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,320
which line I didn't do justice. Also, you will know that when I do say something from my own opinion

119
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
or my own information offered here, you won't misinterpret it as if he were saying it,

120
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,480
because then the citation will just disappear when it's me talking. Okay? That's how we roll in

121
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,320
philosophy battle. Citation down to the line. But on the other hand, while I am siding everything

122
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,920
down to the line, it will be my interpretation or my paraphrasing of what is being said, unless of

123
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,800
course I actually put it up in quotes on the screen. And it might be shifted just a tiny bit

124
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
in order to make sense for this video. Anyway, in the 20th century, there was the linguistic

125
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,880
turn in philosophy. Oh, wait. So this happened in large part because of a guy named Fraga,

126
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,280
who kind of tried to make a more scientific or math-like perfect language to do philosophy in.

127
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,480
It kind of looked like this. And hopefully we can talk about Fraga at length later. But anyway,

128
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,240
crudely crunched down for you guys now. Basically, traditional discussions about what is knowledge

129
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,600
turned into what can we say is true. And from that to how can sentences about the world,

130
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,960
i.e. propositions, be true. And how do they relate to each other? What even counts as a proposition?

131
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,760
Doesn't all information need to be in some sort of language? And if the world is made up of

132
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,920
information, is there an inherent language of reality? Or on the other hand, isn't language

133
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,800
a tool of communicating among different people? And so this linguistic turn led to a social turn

134
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,880
because language brings into the account of the social context that the language is created in.

135
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,560
And because there are different societies, previously stable philosophical concepts about

136
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,400
truth, meaning, ontology, knowledge, they became unstable. To be clear, I'm dealing

137
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,400
not with moral relativism, what's right and wrong, good or bad. I'm interested in cognitive

138
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,600
relativism. Relativism about things like truth, reality, and knowledge. Everything that isn't

139
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,760
aesthetics, like tastes or beauty and art, or morals, ethics, right and wrong. So in my terminology,

140
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,720
the opposite of relativism is absolutism. So, ferrogradi relativism is the opposite of absolutism,

141
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,640
just as the subjective would be opposite to objective. Just keep that in mind in case an

142
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,280
imperfect philosopher uses the term objective as opposite relative instead, as is my preference,

143
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,680
I tend to do this. But anyway, saying something is relative is saying that it comes from or is

144
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,000
determined or dependent on something else. For example, saying something is big, big relative

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,960
to what? To me or to an ant or to the planet Uranus. Big is a relative term that depends on

146
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,280
something else here. Something absolute is independent and doesn't require a relationship

147
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,560
to anything else. Ogrady then describes three traditions that in the beginning seemed more

148
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,960
unified, that later split with little contact in between them. He describes them as the English

149
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,120
based tradition of Russell, Wittgenstein, Ryle, and Austin, the American based tradition of James,

150
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Lewis, Quine, and Putnam, and while they had little contact with each other, they pretty much

151
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,720
practically completely left alone the Husserl, Heidegger, Sacher, Derrida tradition, which Ogrady

152
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,680
doesn't call that tradition by any particular geographical name, but I would guess on that

153
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,200
basis he would call it the continental tradition therefore. Yet some tendencies began to emerge

154
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:46,000
among all sides and aided in the rise of cognitive relativism. Relativism about even those things.

155
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,720
Here are three of those tendencies that started emerging independently from different places.

156
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Rejecting the theory practice dichotomy, rejecting the fact value dichotomy,

157
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,200
and framework ideas, which come from those five philosophers. So first let's deal with

158
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,680
rejecting the theory practice dichotomy.

159
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,320
In ancient times, morals, morality was just as much a part of the world in how the world is.

160
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,360
With technological and scientific advancement studying nature though, it left behind questions

161
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,320
of behavior and human conduct. The investigation of nature actually pulled apart from that of

162
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,080
morality. The discussions of nature became disconnected to that of morals. A split appeared

163
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,760
in the kinds of knowledge we had. On the one hand we had the objective reliable nature,

164
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,920
on the other hand we had the subjective moral society and religion. So there was a realm of the

165
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,200
world that existed independent of us, that science investigated, and the human world that was dependent

166
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,680
on us. Philosophical conceptions developing from this reflected that split between a world

167
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,000
independent of human input, as reality, and a world dependent on human beings like morals,

168
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,480
ethics, and behavior. And he says what I suppose as it was taken at the time, that genuine knowledge

169
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,320
is knowledge of that which is there independent of our knowing of it, knowledge of what was there

170
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,760
anyway. Human knowledge is an effort to adequately capture or represent this reality. Philosophers

171
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,600
working within this built the conception of primary and secondary qualities. This is going to sound

172
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,720
a lot like the legendary John Locke now. Primary qualities were aspects of reality that were

173
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,440
independent of human cognition, like shape, motion, and mass. Things that are taken to be there as they

174
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,360
are even if no minds were around to perceive them. And then there were secondary qualities,

175
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,160
like color, sounds, and so on. Things that are dependent on our awareness of them. So like vibrations

176
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,280
in the air hitting my eardrum technically doesn't need to invoke consciousness, but actually hearing

177
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,520
sound does. To this day these appear to many as fundamentally different things. Like the difference

178
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,920
between the mind actually seeing the color red is thought to be fundamentally different, koalia,

179
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,760
than the mere detection of say 430 terahertz on the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.

180
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,840
So one set of phenomena was part of the furniture of the world itself, and the other are products of

181
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,080
products. And the other are products of human receptivity and dependent on human cognition.

182
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,640
Now it was taken to be that investigations of nature while helpful to make technology that

183
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,880
can be used for certain purposes by our society that the actual investigation of nature itself

184
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,760
was still nevertheless pure for the sake of truth itself. So you know they felt it was still

185
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,360
objective. That sure we made technology and make use of knowledge for different things depending

186
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,600
on our society based on the particular parts of the world we're in or in different periods of

187
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,800
history with certain levels of technology and advancement let's say. But at least practicing

188
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,480
the method of gaining knowledge of nature itself, practicing science, was still objective. But then

189
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,120
this came under attack from different areas in the 20th century. Scientists are members of society too,

190
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,240
like anyone else. Influenced by fashion, economics, politics, social status, etc. And also science

191
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,480
itself doesn't actually turn out to be so clear a systemic progression in its study with rules and

192
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,400
methods as it turns out. History in fact shows us that it's actually full of chance and lucky

193
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,240
screw-ups. But so what? One may say that despite still living in a messy human world, scientists

194
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,560
are still able to pull out the goods, unpolluted absolute conception of reality. As in the sentiments

195
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,400
yeah maybe how and why we get the knowledge is relative to the time and society we're in but

196
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,240
still like the knowledge itself was still objective right? Well to that Paulo Grady says

197
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,120
there's still a bigger challenge, a massive skeptical challenge. The sentiments that if such a

198
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,320
pure dehumanized picture of reality is the goal of inquiry, how can we ever reach it?

199
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,360
Surely we would inevitably infect it with human subjectivity in our efforts to grasp it. Imagine

200
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,280
knowledge is like a snowball or something super soft and we live in a blind world. To know it we

201
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,720
would have to grab it but by grabbing it we change sort of what it is. We forced our impression onto

202
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,680
it. We can't really know what it is on grasp. It's always going to be affected not just in

203
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:11,600
order to observe it but by observing it, by conceptualizing it, by knowing it. Things can't

204
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,600
be observed without a perspective from which we perceive so how could anything be known in ways

205
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,320
beyond a particular perspective? One might feel well we will never really have knowledge then of

206
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,640
reality itself. It will always be infected by us therefore. Now there's also a different conception

207
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,400
of objectivity which is inter subjectivity. That is the objective is just that which the

208
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,360
reasonable people agree upon. Well I'm not going to touch this for now but I just want to note

209
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,760
there's much to say about this to think of later on but anyway still even with this conception it

210
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,440
involves that for them while we do get in touch with a reality independent of human thought

211
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,520
but mediated via human thought. Now what this has to do with relativism is that reality can be

212
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,000
mediated in different ways. Representations of the same objective reality can be different

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,520
depending on the concepts we use to think about it. Different features of reality come to the

214
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,000
fore as we deploy different sets of concepts to deal with it. Quoting here, philosophers from

215
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,080
different traditions such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger and William James came to hold versions of this

216
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,000
view which are framework ideas but O'Grady will talk about them later more closely. In any case

217
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,120
this all goes against the idea that our practice or doing science or anything is somehow not altered

218
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,520
by our theories or our concepts which are relative to the type of creatures we are. How much we already

219
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,080
know, what we are still ignorant of, what time and place our society is based in etc and therefore

220
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,520
from different societies it would mean differences in our practice and concepts but I think this

221
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:04,080
issue is being kind of muddled with the next failing dichotomy so let's look at that now. Rejecting the fact value dichotomy.

222
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:19,360
The idea of facts is connected to the idea of an absolute conception of reality

223
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:27,280
as if they are independent, objective, solid, reliable and is contrasted with the subjective

224
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,120
unreliable things like feelings and desires. One of the big changes is the idea of value

225
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,480
no longer being inherently in certain things like gold but instead something we project

226
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,120
onto certain things. A way human beings have been coloring the facts so we could split language into

227
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,280
a descriptive vocabulary that just says what the facts are and an evaluative vocabulary that reports

228
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,800
how we feel about those facts. This is a fact value split. Facts are supposed to exist as if

229
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,840
independently of the mind but in order for a human to know a fact it has to be conceptualized by the

230
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,800
human mind. We dress the world in concepts in order to think of it. The world doesn't automatically

231
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,840
conceptualize itself. Throughout our own history we've created concepts to help describe the world

232
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,680
and the concepts we create pick out the things we are interested in. For example we use concepts

233
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,160
related to our senses. Take color. We had color concepts only for the part of the visual spectrum

234
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,680
that we can see before learning about light and how much bigger the spectrum is. There were no

235
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,360
concepts to discriminate the spectrum beyond what we saw. So before we may have only thought about

236
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,440
you know red, green and blue, yellow etc. We didn't even have the concepts to differentiate between

237
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,760
say infrared and ultraviolet for example until after we learned more about light. With this

238
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,440
we can still say that there are facts that are either true or false but what counts as a fact

239
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,200
also depends in part on us both in whether we have concepts to describe it but also if it even fits

240
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,320
with everything else that we already know. We can decide if something counts as a fact or not

241
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,600
if it fits with everything else we already know about the world. Our decision on saying

242
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,720
something as a fact is therefore based on a number of considerations that are actually

243
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,800
value laden. Value laden which means something like soaked in our values. If soaked or endowed

244
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,520
with our interests. Interests like whether or not it makes our theories more simple,

245
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,800
coheres with the facts, allows for greater generalizations etc. Things that will help

246
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,120
us make further predictions. These things aren't in the facts themselves, they're values where

247
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,920
human interests enter the picture. Now this alone doesn't make a fact subjective, just what counts

248
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,560
as an objective fact isn't independent of the subjective mind. So there's actually two pictures

249
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,920
here, an old picture where the world exists totally independent of the human mind constructing

250
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,320
anything and the mind merely mirrors that. And now a more recent picture where the mind is in

251
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,040
some way to some degree constructing the world that we live in. So this more recent picture

252
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,280
allows for describing the world in multiple ways since people could have different values,

253
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,920
thus their accounts of the facts will differ. Now anti-relativists will want to say it can't

254
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,880
be varied all that much, there's a limit to how different they can be, and we can work towards

255
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,440
unifying a picture of reality. But the relativists focus more on the differences themselves, that

256
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,600
they can't unify different versions of the world. And one of the ways that they do this is by using

257
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,800
the idea that the world is mediated through a structure that yields different accounts of

258
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,200
reality to us relative to that structure. And different terms are used by the relativists

259
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,960
for this structure such as conceptual scheme, paradigm, linguistic framework, and language

260
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,840
games. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to make that sound too spooky. I'm actually laughing with joy

261
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,960
because paradigms and language games are two that I feel reasonably comfortable talking about.

262
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,040
And the latter is often spooky because of its misunderstanding and again which I feel I can

263
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,000
contribute to getting rid of that misunderstanding and misconstruing. But don't worry now,

264
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,800
O'Grady is going to explain how these other philosophers, framework ideas, oh okay oh well

265
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,240
I guess we're going straight to the slide this time. So now O'Grady is going to quickly cover

266
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,400
some philosophers because he's more so trying to show the similarity in what he calls framework ideas

267
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,440
in all of them rather than actually go into depth explaining and giving details of their

268
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,360
philosophies. Some of it may then therefore seem unclear to you right now but just focus on what a

269
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,040
framework idea is generally even if you're unclear about a specific philosopher's version.

270
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,160
In any case, I'm here for y'all to help fill in some of what might be missing. And hopefully a

271
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:28,640
faithful way anyway. Let's start. C.I. Lewis American philosopher C.I. Lewis was influenced

272
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,320
by Immanuel Kant's idea that there was a division of knowledge between the given and that which

273
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,200
processes the given. To be understood by us I guess. Whoa wait a minute maybe we should stop early.

274
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,960
I realize Kant seems very much to be the backdrop behind a lot of this so I'm going to give a sort

275
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,240
of one of my visualizations of this kind of philosophic picture here. In this picture the

276
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,080
unprocessed reality outside what is currently grasped by the mind would be the sort of indistinct

277
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,680
undifferentiated gray mush but really I can't even say it's gray or I can't even say it's mush.

278
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,920
I can't say anything about it. I can only say things about what I do perceive and this stuff is

279
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:19,120
beyond perception but whatever it be if it be at all it then be processed by our minds through

280
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,880
these things called categories of understanding to produce the familiar perceptions that we do have.

281
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,840
So there's a difference between reality or the pure world in itself you could say or maybe we

282
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,320
would just make up a new word for it like numina and then there's our perception of the world as

283
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,080
we perceive it. That reality is processed filtered and shaped by our categories of understanding

284
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,240
aspects of our mind. We cut up things to understand the world as the kind of creatures we are

285
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,040
that results in our perceptions what we might call phenomena and I talk more about how this

286
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,360
relates to relativists in my bonus episode for episode six where I first introduced this kind

287
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,040
of image. So it would be lovely if you do check that out in fact you might get to appreciate

288
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,680
the powers of this philosophic weapon and the sophisticated relativist position to some degree

289
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,520
just from that bonus video alone. So again please do check out episode six I know it has a lot of

290
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,200
parts to it but hey it's a fun journey so anyway the basic idea for our purposes here

291
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,680
is that there is an input from outside our mind and then some processing of the mind

292
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,040
happens of whatever that outside input is in order to even perceive what we do and those

293
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,120
perceptions are what we would call observation. In this sense we don't actually directly observe

294
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,520
reality it's like we have spectacles on. So O'Grady is saying that Lewis was influenced by

295
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,240
this sort of picture which I made sort of loosely generally based on Immanuel Kant.

296
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,280
But Lewis was also influenced by pragmatists emphasizing the relation of thoughts to action

297
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,840
you know actually doing things. Ah good old pragmatics that things have value only if they're

298
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,160
useful to us to actually do things or survive. It's the spice of American style philosophy.

299
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,000
He fused both of these into a position that also denies the theory practice dichotomy and the fact

300
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,160
value dichotomy. He thought of philosophy as investigating these categories that we use to

301
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,400
think about the world. Denying that the world conceptualizes itself. Instead the way we think

302
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,800
about reality is socially and historically shaped. Concepts the meanings that are shared by human

303
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,160
beings are a product of human interaction with the world. Theory is infected by practice and facts

304
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:55,520
are shaped by values. Concepts structure our experience and reflect our interests attitudes

305
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,040
and needs. Think about that talk about light going from colors we normally see to now even

306
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,040
including ultraviolet. Violent. Ultraviolet and infrared. Or even and if you're big into history

307
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,520
you might get a kick out of this but blue was not recognized as a unique color concept until

308
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,440
practical societal reasons came about. More often in our cross-cultural history we find the color

309
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,360
concept that combines what we now consider green and blue. But as it seems to me the most popular

310
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,720
theory goes that we only began to use the color concept of blue uniquely after we became capable

311
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,440
of making blue pigment in ancient Egypt. A color which was otherwise very rare in nature itself

312
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,520
and perhaps it's just that blue did not require being uniquely identified prior to that.

313
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,720
Anyway back to Lewis though. The categories we use aren't from reality itself but reflect

314
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:04,480
enduring human interests. In that way reality is relative to a system of concepts. The world as

315
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,000
we know it is shaped by the concepts we use to interpret it. Experience though governs which

316
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,080
system of concepts we use and respect to which ones are successful. Faulty and useless concepts

317
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,560
lead to bad predictions and unsuccessful courses of action. It's come to my attention that I may

318
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,280
want to make something clear here even though I have already said it but I'm gonna say it again

319
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,840
but I'm not saying this gray mush is what's actually there. That reality is actually gray mush.

320
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,520
Really I don't know if it's gray and I don't know if it's mush. It's just that I can't say or

321
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,800
talk about it at all. And Kant's categories make it even difficult to even say that it is.

322
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,040
So there are different ways to interpret this that we will talk about later especially if we

323
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,240
cover chapter three on ontology. And I don't really know Lewis directly actually. I only know

324
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,760
what O'Grady says about him here but he does say much later on in a different chapter that Lewis

325
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,160
nevertheless does take the given as data of the senses upon which we build knowledge. So this is

326
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,080
just what it seems to me right now but it's more simply the eyes do very much still pick up this

327
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,160
visual light input let's say but whatever this light reflections mean to us in order for it to

328
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,800
mean anything in order for it to even be information in a sense at all it has to do with our concepts.

329
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,840
So this is as it appears or is given but then it's still the concepts that cut it up meaningfully.

330
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,600
So really there is all this then we have say a concept of saying something is edible and that

331
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,720
cuts this out and of course therefore I guess a concept of the non edible and maybe we have the

332
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,960
concept of things from nature and also things that are constructed from and for humans and then

333
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,960
we have concepts to identify colors. So it's really that concepts are cutting up all this

334
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,800
information that there is from the given and for Lewis those concepts themselves are a social

335
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,640
product certainly children are taught to recognize the type of things that are edible and not and

336
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,400
certainly children go through a process of recognizing the type of things that are just

337
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,520
there in nature and the kind of things that humans must have made these concepts came into

338
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,120
being and survived among any number of concepts because they help us survive or accomplish goals

339
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,520
ourselves. So that's my example of what's going on here I bring this up just to be clear that with

340
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,040
both of these the given or input doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't something if anything

341
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,080
scientifically it is nigh infinite information in a sense if there even is such a thing as

342
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,400
information at that stage and it isn't simply just gray mush I'm just visualizing it like that

343
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,680
that whatever is presented to the mind cannot be thought of or talked about or even recognized

344
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,200
without concepts to cut it up out of the rest of everything else that's just one interpretation of

345
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,320
what's going on but don't worry about it too much right now we're just trying to grasp this idea

346
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,440
that we're actually contributing to what we observe anyway so the framework idea for lewis

347
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,080
are systems of categories by which we mediate reality to ourselves for lewis these categories

348
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,800
are almost as much as social product shaped by our society as language itself is this is kind of

349
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,480
different from earlier contos categories appeared to be an attempt at more of a universal description

350
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,480
of how the human mind must conceptualize reality in order to understand it but from lewis these

351
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,560
categories are socially constructed from our social environment that you are in while lewis

352
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,800
really didn't talk much about how this would mean that there could be different sets of categories

353
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,080
therefore he has acknowledged the possibility on occasion and we can see that different categories

354
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,440
would mean that the world as it appears to us would be different in a sense according to different

355
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,960
societies if a different society can lead to different categories that leads to different

356
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,520
ways the world appears to us as at least what we can say about what we observe peaking out or even

357
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,720
recognizing only certain things we have the concepts our society has provided to pick out or

358
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:21,280
recognize but anyway there is no unmediated access to reality itself and the only curbs on the system

359
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,200
of categories would be pragmatic ones for lewis so possibly having different sets of socially

360
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,400
constructed categories that's what ogready calls lewis's framework idea a presentation of the world

361
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:41,920
comes with it a certain set of categories from which it was processed a framework now let's move to

362
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,120
rudolf karnab

363
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,880
sharing a lot of the same sources with lewis german philosopher rudolf karnab articulated

364
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,360
his framework idea of linguistic frameworks that was super relativistic he was also influenced

365
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,760
by kant thinking that our knowledge is a result of some kind of processing and shared the idea of

366
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:14,720
pragmatic value of applying one's knowledge but he was also influenced much by science as that

367
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,600
which constitute actual knowledge and as a force therefore to get rid of metaphysical and theological

368
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,680
fake knowledge this is a kind of deflationist view of philosophy where instead of talking about

369
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,960
things like truth and reality philosophies suggest clarify meanings for scientists doing that too

370
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,160
may have seemed itself another discussion of philosophical truths but when it came to certain

371
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,480
things in philosophy like what is really real these kind of questions seemed unanswerable

372
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,120
in a way that questions and science could be answered so instead philosophers should just

373
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,440
focus on investigating and creating these models which are like languages and systems where one

374
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,960
can calculate and identify things with clear meanings logical implications and criteria for

375
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,040
confirmation so that scientists can then go on and actually do the research using these models

376
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,360
this was to deflate philosophical questions into merely practical choices of which model

377
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,400
scientists wanted to use so central to karnab's project is this notion of frameworks frameworks

378
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,800
for karnab outline all the rules using the terms and relations between the terms so number terms

379
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,920
can be introduced and have a relationship or rules based on that relationship within the

380
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,240
framework of math let's say so for example in my interpretation of this it means that five seven

381
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,240
and two within the framework of math five has a relationship to seven being a difference of two

382
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,480
you can add two to five and get seven or subtract two from seven and get five those terms have a

383
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,720
relationship and they are clear in the framework of math relative to that framework questions about

384
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,160
numbers are easy these kind of questions about the relationships like what is nine plus eight

385
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,160
they are internal questions questions that presuppose the existence of such a framework

386
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,480
to get an answer relative to the framework internal questions are uncontroversially

387
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,040
answerable and there are different frameworks to discuss different kinds of things physical objects

388
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:31,520
properties or spatial temporal objects do numbers really exist do properties really exist

389
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,840
karnab calls these external questions because they are outside the context of a linguistic

390
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,880
framework such questions are improper because the choice of framework is pragmatically decided on

391
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,400
if it is useful to speak of numbers then such a framework will be used if it is useful to speak

392
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,400
of properties then that framework will be used the only appropriate external questions are ones

393
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,720
about the expediency of using a framework or not so pretty much within this linguistic frameworks

394
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,960
questions are answered easily within the structure of that framework but to try to step outside of

395
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,600
framework and discuss it itself the only meaningful question here is if that framework is useful us

396
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:22,960
to use right now or not but still this can lead to a huge number of frameworks so karnab points to

397
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,600
a kind of natural selection akin to biology to how we come to use particular ones reducing how

398
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,600
varied they can be but even with natural selection there's still a lot open here for relativists

399
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,440
but let's leave that there for now karnab will come up again in the battle and we will cover

400
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:49,280
again sort of what the idea is so anyway that's what ogready calls karnab's framework idea and now

401
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,320
for lw Ludwig Wittgenstein

402
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,360
he's probably the most important developer of framework ideas of the 20th century and is well

403
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,880
known for making two influential philosophies whoa wait a minute uh so to be honest with you

404
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,160
i do not think this section is very good at explaining what Wittgenstein's framework idea

405
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,040
is even less so than any of the other philosophers the framework idea of language games has less

406
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,320
time devoted to it than the other things and yet it's very important to grasp this idea in particular

407
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,920
especially considering ogready himself thinks he's the most important contributor to it but also it

408
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,880
could be very helpful for us in the future as well so i want to make clear it's not that

409
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,080
paul ogready has gotten wittgenstein wrong in this section or that ogready cannot do a better job at

410
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,440
explaining him or isn't so much smarter than me but that this particular section doesn't really

411
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,280
explain what a language game really is and how it leads to the other points that ogready brings up

412
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,920
so i will do that myself explain it in a separate video a video that's just off the cuff you know

413
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,920
not cited from the top of my head just me trying to explain with examples what language games are

414
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,320
and how it connects to the points that ogready is going to be bringing up for the purposes of

415
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,840
just getting the idea out there to move on but hey maybe it could also be a great standalone video

416
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,240
if you've kind of forgotten what wittgenstein's language games were kind of about at least until

417
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,840
i do make a proper video since we definitely will get into wittgenstein properly one day and i promise

418
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:33,760
to give away all my secret stash of important citation everything cited down to the line like

419
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,480
i normally do you know even back to his blue and brown books where we will find a cheat code

420
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,880
okay but for now let's see what ogready does say anyway ogready tells us that wittgenstein had two

421
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,920
influential philosophies one presented in his tractatis logical philosophicus that articulates

422
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,440
what essentially language is you know its essence and the picturing relation between language and

423
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,200
reality now ogready doesn't say what he thinks wittgenstein said is the essence of language

424
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,920
but i think it's simply that it has this picturing relationship that language is that

425
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,480
which corresponds to reality like a picture does with words and a proposition having the

426
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,360
same relationship to each other as the objects that they pick out or stand for in the world

427
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,080
the other philosophy later in life his latter philosophy is presented in his philosophical

428
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,240
investigations and it actually critiques a lot of what was said in that first account

429
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,440
rejecting the idea that language has a particular essence and that philosophy shouldn't focus on

430
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,960
advancing theses but be a kind of therapy to help clarify language instead of having a single

431
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,720
determinant language language is comprised of many language games now i'm just gonna read like six

432
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,400
lines and tell you what i think of them a language game is a complex whole of verbal usage and

433
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,640
associated activities words simply don't label or stand for objects but relate to each other and

434
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,920
the world in highly complex ways words are like tools there are many different kinds performing

435
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,960
many different kinds of activities therefore there are many different language games and many

436
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,680
different associated forms of life the kinds of activities associated with the language game

437
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,800
the language games are governed by grammatical rules rules of grammar prescribe the modes of

438
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:23,520
representation by which the world is represented to us oh super clear isn't it no look i don't

439
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,080
think old grady is wrong but only because i actually studied vikenshine but also i haven't

440
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,120
forgotten what's wrong with talking about vikenshine like this in part because i haven't forgotten

441
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,720
what it was like as a young philosopher that was unfamiliar i think this could to someone less

442
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:45,360
familiar make vikenshine seem complicated or even mystical in some sense neither of which is true

443
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,280
the last lines in particular could seem to imply something radical like what you say changes the

444
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,920
world itself that reality as commonly taken is literally changing when you change what you say

445
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,880
that's kind of extreme if you think about that kind of picture and not at all what vikenshine's

446
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,040
about though it's hard to say but also to deny what vikenshine's actual metaphysical position

447
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,880
really is because he himself won't do that since his philosophy aims to stop speaking metaphysically

448
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,400
in such a manner in the first place but if you insist to be unfaithful to his philosophy there

449
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,040
is still a cheat code in the blue and brown books like i said that i can give you later so subscribe

450
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,320
in any case i can imagine someone reading this and just feeling like oh whatever just another

451
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,520
philosopher using a bunch of words together to obfuscate their position to appear deep and

452
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,120
complicated but it's just vague nonsense jargon so this is why i believe my video becomes necessary

453
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,800
for anyone who hasn't studied vikenshine's language games already because you're not going to get a

454
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,360
good sense of it from ogready despite what it may seem like other actual philosophers say

455
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,920
for someone new and not familiar with the kind of concepts that philosophers use all the time

456
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,440
this really isn't easy text and i definitely think kirks book was probably much more palatable to

457
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,840
somebody new in any case there are a couple of more things that ogready does point out about

458
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,880
language games vikenshine's framework idea that are important so let's cover them ogready points

459
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,760
out three things and two of them are that vikenshine emphasized that it was important

460
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,520
not to conflate one language game with another or to think that there are super language games

461
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,760
that govern all others ogready also points out that there is a quite popular use of vikenshine's

462
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,840
idea was to try to defend religious belief against rationalistic critique by claiming that religion

463
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,520
is its own language game and that it is illicit to use criteria from another language game usually

464
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,680
science to challenge it but as it is always really important to point out this is not to say that

465
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,680
vikenshine himself espoused such views again as i said that he didn't mean and likely didn't want

466
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,040
his philosophy to be used by extreme relativists especially considering how he was trying to be

467
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,200
anti-philosophy in his own way but his views lent themselves to such use ogready then talks about

468
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,760
how in uncertainty vikenshine's latest writings that vikenshine does seem to have this image of

469
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,360
a riverbed with a bedrock below to kind of represent even how in a language game there are

470
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,800
beliefs that we are willing to change more easily and fluidly and some more deeply entrenched which

471
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,120
are likely bedrock at the bottom of a river but that even those can change just at a much slower

472
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,720
rate ogready brings us up to kind of say how it's this bedrock beliefs that are the framework upon

473
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,360
which the fluid beliefs depend and that this for ogready is also used to say the framework may alter

474
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,640
and indeed there may be alternative frameworks but really he didn't need to bring that up at all i

475
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,560
think the fact that there are different language games is enough to see how vikenshine's philosophy

476
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,200
empowers the relativists in fact as far as i have seen the issue of whether the bedrock can change

477
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,440
from within a language game isn't a discussion that the relativists using this weapon even bother

478
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,680
with it's seemingly to me always a discussion about how there are differing language games but

479
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,000
maybe i'm missing something as to why he felt this was important to bring up i mean i guess there's

480
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,480
another argument to how there can be different frameworks but really the language game argument

481
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,520
not the bedrocks can change argument is ultimately what's taken to be the power that is imbued into

482
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:23,200
this weapon from vikenshine now i do wish ogready would have done don't think look more which is

483
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,600
give more examples for us to actually look at in many places in his book but as i said in the

484
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,680
beginning of the video paul ogready does seem to be more concerned with pointing out the sources of

485
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,080
the powers of this weapon rather than actually explaining what the sources are which is why i

486
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,640
said i would try to hopefully fill that gap and bear that responsibility myself so again please

487
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,600
do go check out that video that i will be making i will definitely be more clearly explaining what

488
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,520
the idea of a language game is and i will explain why we would be against the idea of a super language

489
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,560
game and why we shouldn't mix language games as well as how these kind of vikenshinean philosophers

490
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,840
may be in a tight spot sometimes if one is trying to stay faithful to his philosophy while explaining

491
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,880
anyway please check out that video so now i'm going to give things back to ogready who will

492
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:21,280
talk about w v quine w v quine was one of the earliest to popularize the phrase conceptual

493
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,840
scheme the conceptual scheme is revisable but there is no neutral position to talk about the

494
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,920
world is to apply some conceptual scheme to it from childhood growing up we learn the conceptual

495
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,120
scheme and as we learn more the conceptual scheme gets refined and right now science is the best

496
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:48,160
as the most inclusive scheme that covers everything that exists it is the best to understand the world

497
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,280
and predict changes in it but borrowing the term language game from vikenshine quine says that there

498
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,520
are other kinds of language use for poetry or fiction for example and they are used to see the

499
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,440
world in a different way imaginary worlds so of course they'd have different conceptual schemes

500
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,480
which is fine but what if it's the same world like the real world can we nevertheless have

501
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,320
different conceptual schemes well it seems there's enough in quine to say yeah for sure

502
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,040
for example he believes that all beliefs can in fact be changed that none are unchangeable

503
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,520
and absolute that there are no a priori beliefs for quine but what that even means could use some

504
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,480
further detail but it's in a different chapter that again i'm not sure if i'm gonna cover

505
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:46,400
but also he did believe in under determination of theory by fact which is to say that any set

506
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,800
amount of evidence could support more than one theory so with my famous example i used in the

507
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,800
map of philosophy of science video check it out if you have time there i used an example of dots

508
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,880
on a graph that i give with the dots representing observations or even what counts as evidence

509
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,640
for any certain amount of dots can support more than one theory of what the shape the dots are

510
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,760
making and in fact no amount of dots will ever fully guarantee only one shape or theory that

511
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,400
could fit it so it would be like quine does believe that even in dealing with the real world

512
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,960
people could nevertheless have different conceptual schemes these two things that all our beliefs

513
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,480
can change so our conceptual scheme can change and that we can have different theories based off the

514
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,880
same observation thus different conceptual schemes while based in the real world would make quine

515
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,480
fertile ground for relativists but we'll talk later in chapter three whether that's actually

516
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:55,360
his position or not chapter three chapter three whoa okay so we can stop with that look i don't

517
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:02,960
know we're really gonna be covering that what okay fine we'll see anyway ogready is calling quine's

518
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,800
conceptual scheme which is like our best theory of the world that we use to make sense of the world

519
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:18,240
which can change and can be different quine's framework idea now finally drop that coon hold on

520
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:31,440
a philosopher and historian uh science ts coon helped relativists in a big way his notion of paradigms

521
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,040
not paradigms became influential well beyond philosophy of science a paradigm is a context

522
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,720
within which scientific inquiry proceeds like assumptions training methods standards goals

523
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,480
methods of experimentation again ogready doesn't provide examples even in places where they would

524
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,560
be super helpful but i would just say maybe it would be helpful to imagine a newtonian paradigm

525
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:03,200
let's say versus an einsteinian paradigm you know a paradigm of relativity or now say a quantum

526
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,360
physics paradigm they characterize a scientific community at a stable period but a crisis can

527
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,920
happen that lead to a new paradigm the paradigms themselves though are supposedly incommensurable

528
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:22,560
paradigms create their own context within which it rationally operates so one can't rationally

529
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,480
judge or decide between them here's where i think there's some leftover blood soaked soil of the

530
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,400
positivists that have us thinking of it like that which i mentioned in that map episode but yeah

531
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,880
think of it as in that evidence is interpreted through a paradigm so then it isn't evidence

532
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,760
that's actually deciding between paradigms we can't evaluate the evidence without a paradigm first

533
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,920
so each paradigm judges itself and one cannot judge a paradigm from another based on evidence

534
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,840
itself now i have actually created two videos on coon already one video is coon's response in his

535
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,000
own words to those that contrast him with his predecessor the great champion carl popper so

536
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,640
it gives i think a decent outline of what coon's position is but also i made a video explaining

537
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:21,360
in much more detail how it is specifically his philosophy that allowed these relativists therefore

538
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:28,400
to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science using his philosophy of paradigm shifts

539
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,680
and crises if you're interested please check them out the second video can be a bit spooky it's

540
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:41,920
called the gates of hell but uh i'm just being dramatic don't worry hell isn't really involved

541
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,840
in any case it's these philosophers that are the big names of whose philosophies are similar

542
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:54,400
enough in terms of a framework idea to be pressed into a single weapon and a nearly supremely

543
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:01,360
powerful position the relativist takes wielding this great weapon framework ideas from them

544
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,560
developed from very different places of the world and was one of the three big trends that brought

545
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,960
this weapon into the modern philosophic battle according to a gradient but i think he is missing

546
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,360
a couple of other things namely that there's also a lot of scientific discoveries that led

547
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:23,840
to similar beliefs about how what we perceive isn't objective reality that it is shaped by the type of

548
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,440
creatures that we are with the faculties that we have brain science shows all the ways we filter

549
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,360
out non-essential information and what counts as essential again has to do with our evolved histories

550
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:40,320
as human beings again such as what kind of colors we can see in the light spectrum and even many

551
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,960
people's beliefs and interpretation of what quantum physics supposedly shows us evidence for

552
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,120
that our act of observing itself affects the observed not that i believe that interpretation

553
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,920
but it is one that many more people have been taking on because of quantum physics of course

554
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,000
though ogready is talking about philosophy but i do think philosophical conversation is obviously

555
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,760
being influenced by discoveries and technological advancement in science in modern times as much

556
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,600
as it was in his own little history lesson given to us here describing the separation of nature and

557
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:28,720
morals the battle so we may find ourselves up against an enemy wielding this weapon in an extreme

558
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,560
let's say because we are endorsing the use of science to decide on the role of vaccines the

559
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,680
reality of global warming or the age of the earth we can actually believe that this position of

560
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,720
wielding this weapon to an extreme degree of thinking everything is relative was created not

561
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,480
because they are evil and want to attack science we may believe that they are actually sincere in

562
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,640
their honest virtuous morals of pursuing tolerance and open-mindedness of people of different perspectives

563
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,560
and a weary of western imperialist thinking of having used claims of rationality and logic and

564
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:08,080
scientific advancement as a reason to oppress and invalidate others of non-western belief systems

565
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:15,040
but of course it's that same extreme position that can be used to defend attacks from science

566
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,280
against the intolerant abusive tyrannical belief systems that will say science is just relative

567
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,280
so it cannot be used to attack their abusive beliefs that aren't grounded in reality but dogma

568
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,040
and deep rooted insecurities like misogyny or homophobia so taking this weapon as if it were

569
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,640
infinitely powerful isn't in the best interest of even those who are primordially interested in a

570
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,720
more tolerant social world and there is real-world evidence cases about this but we'll talk about

571
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:52,080
them later in any case we as good warriors on the philosophic battlefield should wonder how

572
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,480
if i do come up against an enemy wielding this weapon to an extreme degree enough to attack

573
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,320
science claims to truth or rationality let's say then how am i supposed to beat them when i want

574
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,280
to say something is science when i want to say something is the truth when i want to say something

575
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:13,440
makes rational sense so think about it against this enemy i cannot just take something out of my

576
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,640
pocket and say see this is the objective thing here it's not relative because everything i say

577
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,880
is merely relative to a language game i can't show any evidence either because evidence is relative

578
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:36,800
to a paradigm and i can't even show any observation of anything because all observations are structured

579
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,880
relative to our conceptual scheme there isn't anything i can produce anything i can offer

580
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:49,120
that cannot be attacked by this enemy so it's difficult to figure out how can i beat this

581
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:55,120
enemy when they can attack anything i show them if i say objects or reality they can even say

582
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,160
that those are just in fact words relative to a language game even if i try to be very clear that

583
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,320
i mean mind independent reality they can still attack that and say whatever mind independent

584
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,840
reality even means is structured by a conceptual scheme tied to particular social groups that

585
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,680
make use of such conceptual structures thus hastily concluding that reality is relative

586
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,400
so yes it is incredibly frustrating trying to deal with this kind of enemy who will continually

587
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,360
attack constantly so i want you to remember this situation facing an enemy that will always attack

588
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:38,160
no matter what is shown how can you win think of it for yourself first do you see a way we could

589
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,040
deal with this kind of enemy can you come up with a cool move or a counter think about it

590
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,080
before we get to the next video where we'll cover what paul o'grady does on the battlefield

591
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:55,280
choosing specific areas to defend against charges of relativism this weapon however made by philosophers

592
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,760
is being wielded to attack science not by philosophers themselves but by sociologists

593
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,840
who used kuhn to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science in order to attack it

594
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:14,320
and these sociologists do not understand this weapon well enough to grasp the dangers if it is

595
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:21,200
used as if unlimited they only know its power to attack the attempt to speak with authority

596
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:28,080
not the limits which we unlike them will learn in the next videos once we learn that this weapon

597
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,360
does in fact have limits and the dangers that happens when those limits are crossed we will

598
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,640
then return back to the battlefield of the philosophy of science where they had these

599
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:44,320
science wars the battlefield from where i came in this journey and then we will take on this

600
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:51,680
particular group of sociologists that are attacking science are those influenced by them called the ssk

601
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:58,240
who started the science wars so if you would like an account of what led to the science wars and who

602
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:05,120
are these ssk please watch my video voodoo sociology as paulo grady now prepares for battle

603
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:11,760
himself against this extreme relativist presented in the next video one that attempts to make a

604
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:25,280
few attacks on objectivity by proclaiming that even truth is relative
