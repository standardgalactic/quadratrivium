00:00.000 --> 00:01.240
Hey again.

00:01.240 --> 00:05.360
So this video is about the criticism I have of Paulo Grady's book on relativism.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.240
So at very least a previous video with a summary of that book would be absolutely necessary

00:09.240 --> 00:11.240
if you haven't watched the whole series.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.920
And I know it may have already implied this, but seriously, once criticism is likely to

00:14.920 --> 00:19.280
have actual weight, at least weight enough to even bother replying to, only if one has

00:19.280 --> 00:24.120
actually done the reading, or in this case, actually watches the video properly that indicates

00:24.120 --> 00:25.880
there was an entire series.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.960
I really don't know what it is with the hubris of some of us to jump into like the 6th chapter

00:29.960 --> 00:34.120
of a discussion and wonder why certain things are being spoken about or in a certain way

00:34.120 --> 00:38.600
and why other things seem to be left out as if they hadn't been spoken about in great

00:38.600 --> 00:43.360
depth in previous parts, or even ignoring how they were mentioned in that video itself

00:43.360 --> 00:44.880
if it's watched well enough.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.200
I mean, it's certainly one thing not to know that there were previous parts if nobody mentioned

00:49.200 --> 00:52.800
it, but if I'm going through the trouble of mentioning the previous videos which I pretty

00:52.800 --> 00:57.760
much always do and even often give full recap of each video and I don't know what to say

00:57.760 --> 00:58.760
about that.

00:58.760 --> 01:09.480
In any case, either way, this video is not going to be a great place for you to respond

01:09.480 --> 01:13.440
to his arguments if I even bother mentioning them, it's just going to explain what actually

01:13.440 --> 01:16.520
happened in his book Taken at Face Value.

01:16.520 --> 01:22.480
So my criticism today is about how he presents himself versus what the book actually says,

01:22.480 --> 01:26.920
in particular how open he presents himself to ontological relativism.

01:26.920 --> 01:32.000
That is, relativism about the world, the properties or the furniture of reality, the account of

01:32.000 --> 01:33.440
the world that we have.

01:33.440 --> 01:38.760
He presents himself as very open, and I think he knows that if anyone attacks him, it would

01:38.760 --> 01:39.760
be about ontology.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.320
I say this because he kind of predicts that one might say that his principles are said

01:44.320 --> 01:49.600
to be universal, so don't they constitute an exception to ontological relativity?

01:49.600 --> 01:53.960
But he clearly answers that these principles are abstractions, codifications of a practice

01:54.000 --> 01:59.200
that we do, they aren't entities themselves, they don't have an ontological status of

01:59.200 --> 02:04.520
being universally existing in all ontologies, so no, it's not an exception.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.440
Also by the way, they are abstracted principles, so it's not like they are written rules that

02:09.440 --> 02:11.400
we observe and then follow.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.520
No such things are written down anywhere, that doesn't exist as an entity or anything

02:15.520 --> 02:16.520
like he was saying.

02:16.520 --> 02:21.600
He is not even claiming that they are, it's just rather they articulate the nature of

02:21.600 --> 02:27.040
that practice, which was the practice of being rational and deliberation, when we are thinking

02:27.040 --> 02:30.200
about something, discussing it and judging, for example.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.160
So if you're thinking he's wrong about rationality because there aren't written rules

02:34.160 --> 02:38.280
somewhere that are then followed, well that would be misunderstanding about what's going

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
on here.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.960
But more importantly, that's not what my issue is about at all.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.560
To understand my criticism, let's look at what he says about the structure of his book.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.960
At the very beginning of his book, he said, so the position staked out in this book is

02:52.960 --> 03:00.800
one that denies relativism about truth, accepts a great deal of ontological relativity, and

03:00.800 --> 03:08.080
a lesser amount of logical relativity resists radical epistemological relativity, and denies

03:08.080 --> 03:10.360
relativism about reason.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.680
So that's this kind of image that I made based on what he claimed, and I pretty much

03:14.680 --> 03:17.680
showed an almost beginning of each of my videos.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.240
But then after going thoroughly through his book and seeing how the various areas connect,

03:22.240 --> 03:24.880
we actually end up with a very different picture.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.040
This picture.

03:26.040 --> 03:30.040
And there is no greater difference among these two pictures than how he presents himself

03:30.040 --> 03:37.080
in one as accepting a great deal of relativism in ontology, or defending it, or even argued

03:37.080 --> 03:40.200
for relativism about ontology.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.280
Matter of fact, there's really only one place if I can recall where he uses a qualifier

03:44.280 --> 03:46.360
of it being moderate.

03:46.360 --> 03:52.040
But for the vast majority of cases, it's just open to ontological relativity, without

03:52.040 --> 03:56.120
a distinction like moderate or limited or restricted or anything, distinctions that

03:56.120 --> 04:01.600
he makes in other areas like logic or epistemology, but not in ontology.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.000
I mean after having gone through the book when we clearly look at the book, it's actually

04:05.000 --> 04:10.360
his core rationality providing at very least a minimum restraint against extreme relativism

04:10.360 --> 04:11.600
in every section.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.520
Yeah, in truth it provides a place where it's completely denied, but that's given

04:15.520 --> 04:19.280
the precondition described in the truth video if you do want to check it out.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.640
Either way, everywhere else, it's a minimum condition anyway.

04:22.640 --> 04:28.480
Not like complete universal absolutism in some places and complete relativism in other places.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.840
No, in fact, even in rationality itself, if you look at the rationality chapter, it's

04:33.840 --> 04:37.500
just a minimum core that is universal anyway.

04:37.500 --> 04:42.120
So he's actually open to relativism in all of these areas in a much greater sense than

04:42.120 --> 04:46.520
the naivety of the traditional philosophers prior to him perhaps, but there is still a

04:46.520 --> 04:51.880
minimum restriction in all of them and it's coming from his core rationality to everywhere

04:51.880 --> 04:58.800
and as a result that makes him say it denies relativism, resisting radical relativism,

04:58.800 --> 05:03.820
or that it only allows relativism in a very mitigated sense.

05:03.820 --> 05:09.340
Then providing restriction and here's the contrast when it comes to ontology.

05:09.340 --> 05:15.700
In the ontology chapter, not wanting to be charged as holding to Promethean anti-realism

05:15.700 --> 05:21.220
and just making up whatever world we want as we go along, no restriction, but the ontological

05:21.220 --> 05:26.300
relativist wants to hold that there are certain constraints on our thinking, we don't just

05:26.300 --> 05:28.180
invent reality.

05:28.180 --> 05:32.700
The realist is saying the constraint comes from the outside as in reality, that reality

05:32.700 --> 05:37.140
constrains the theory of the world that we have at least to some degree, but the ontological

05:37.140 --> 05:42.140
relativist for them, the discipline is an internal issue, not something imposed from

05:42.140 --> 05:43.420
the outside.

05:43.420 --> 05:47.900
Discipline and thought comes from proper methodology, from something such as a theory

05:47.900 --> 05:51.500
of rational constraint, which is universal.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.340
And that's his core figuring out here that he offers, in a way through epistemology.

05:56.340 --> 06:00.940
In any case, it's pretty clear that there are restraints on ontology, certainly a variety

06:00.940 --> 06:05.660
we are ruling out then is one that is the Promethean anti-realism, where we have no

06:05.660 --> 06:09.860
restraint on our account of the world and we can just make up as we go along.

06:09.860 --> 06:13.940
Someone might say though that that is the reason, because the restriction is internal

06:13.940 --> 06:18.460
and not from a mind independent reality, that's why it's okay to just call it ontological

06:18.460 --> 06:23.420
relativity and not mention any kind of qualifiers like limited or moderate or mitigated or anything

06:23.420 --> 06:24.420
else.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.300
But let's be clear about a few things first.

06:26.580 --> 06:31.260
Firstly, there can be different levels of relativism within ontology, even if the extreme

06:31.260 --> 06:34.860
one already has a name of Promethean anti-realism.

06:34.860 --> 06:39.620
An example could be how we contrast the Strassonian limitation of cognitive capacities that we

06:39.620 --> 06:44.380
have with Quine's seeming fluidity, or even actually contrasting the fluidity of Quine

06:44.380 --> 06:48.620
with his later preference for a certain ontology, i.e. physics.

06:48.620 --> 06:52.780
That was after all one of the tensions O'Grady points out in Quine's work.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.380
So while they are of different strengths, they were all nevertheless internal restraints.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.660
So a different degree of internal restraint does exist.

07:00.660 --> 07:04.700
I mean, I think it's pretty clear if we are taking the ontological relativists at their

07:04.700 --> 07:10.100
word and sourcing, or maybe outsourcing the restraint to epistemology, then there seems

07:10.100 --> 07:14.900
to be a limitation depending on how much limitation there is in epistemology.

07:14.900 --> 07:19.820
And there is certainly a limitation in epistemology according to O'Grady there, of different

07:19.820 --> 07:24.940
degrees of how much relativism we could have in epistemology that we would select.

07:24.940 --> 07:30.460
So why not by that nature say there are different degrees of limitation in ontology as well?

07:30.460 --> 07:33.820
Certainly it wasn't complete relativism in epistemology.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.700
There was a minimum restraint, that's why we called it moderate.

07:37.700 --> 07:42.380
So then that should be worth noting that it means there is a restraint in ontology as

07:42.380 --> 07:43.380
well.

07:43.380 --> 07:48.380
It's precisely the reason why we mentioned it in truth, and in logic, and even in epistemology

07:48.380 --> 07:51.060
where the restraint came from rationality.

07:51.060 --> 07:55.940
That restraints do come in different strengths and are coming from another area still implies

07:55.940 --> 08:00.380
that this area is restrained to different degrees, and that was a good enough reason

08:00.380 --> 08:05.380
to still call it restraint against extreme relativism in other places like epistemology,

08:05.380 --> 08:07.660
but he didn't do that for ontology.

08:07.660 --> 08:14.020
Okay, so let's ask what does it mean to say that there is restraint if we did say it?

08:14.020 --> 08:20.300
Well, one, for Ogrady it is possible that we may sometimes hold two sets of ontology

08:20.300 --> 08:21.300
in tandem.

08:21.300 --> 08:26.060
Two, Ogrady is open to the idea that worldviews can contradict.

08:26.060 --> 08:29.760
After all, in the rationality chapter, when in discussion of how there can be different

08:29.760 --> 08:35.180
empirically adequate metaphysical systems, he says, insofar as they, and he means chi

08:35.180 --> 08:40.340
or the hopi metaphysical systems that he called absolutely developed worldviews, but

08:40.340 --> 08:45.780
anyway, insofar as they are empirically adequate, they do not contradict empirical evidence.

08:45.780 --> 08:50.740
However, they do cut against the materialistic or physicalistic metaphysics.

08:50.740 --> 08:54.420
There is therefore an argument possible between two metaphysical systems.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.100
So one, we can have two ontologies, two, they can contradict.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.420
But also, three, one of them may be considered false.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.100
They may be false.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.820
So we can resolve this contradiction by considering one false.

09:06.820 --> 09:11.340
So yeah, maybe it's not because of any metaphysical commitment to reality, but because of our

09:11.340 --> 09:16.460
rational constraint that impacts what commitments we have to different ontologies.

09:16.460 --> 09:21.940
Certainly he appears to admit that his core or his principles does govern our different

09:21.940 --> 09:25.740
ontologies, as he says in his final chapter.

09:25.740 --> 09:31.900
Whatever theory or ontology we deploy in interpreting and understanding reality is put together

09:31.900 --> 09:35.020
under the governance of these principles.

09:35.020 --> 09:39.700
So a certain kind of practice is regarded as universal, the practice of reasoning and

09:39.700 --> 09:40.700
arguing.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.060
This doesn't conflict with ontological relativism.

09:44.060 --> 09:49.100
So here it is again, that he is saying in this line that it doesn't contradict with

09:49.100 --> 09:53.780
ontological relativism because those principles aren't entities.

09:53.780 --> 09:57.700
This line is after all taken from that exact same section earlier that I was quoting from

09:57.700 --> 10:01.900
in the beginning, where he anticipated that kind of criticism, but at the same time he

10:01.900 --> 10:07.660
is admitting here that our ontologies, and we can hold multiple, are governed by the principles

10:07.660 --> 10:09.220
of core rationality.

10:09.220 --> 10:13.420
But it's the same thing then as it was in logic or epistemology for example.

10:13.420 --> 10:18.500
There is a core rationality that is governing there, and it was the basis by which we would

10:18.500 --> 10:23.580
restrict against extreme relativism, carefully saying for logic that relativism would be

10:23.580 --> 10:28.820
allowed but only in a mitigated sense, or in epistemology where it's by that restriction

10:28.820 --> 10:32.540
just moderate epistemological relativism that is allowed.

10:32.540 --> 10:35.940
So why is ontology being treated differently?

10:35.940 --> 10:41.940
I mean it does mean something to mention that by rationality, even if not an appeal to external

10:41.940 --> 10:47.580
mind-independent reality or anything, that we do rule against having contradictory ontologies,

10:47.580 --> 10:52.060
or self-contradictory ontologies via our coherentist systems.

10:52.060 --> 10:58.580
As such, valuing some, those with less contradiction, has greater than those with more contradictions,

10:58.580 --> 11:00.560
so they're not equally viable.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.940
As we examine them in our conscious deliberation, therefore not holding them as having equally

11:05.940 --> 11:07.860
valuable status.

11:07.860 --> 11:12.860
Perhaps some are more and some are less contradictory with other ontologies that we hold in tandem,

11:12.860 --> 11:18.100
or within its own subsystem.

11:18.100 --> 11:23.060
There is work being done here by rationality or the principles to limit ontologies, and

11:23.060 --> 11:28.240
such is admitted and explicated in different places, for example in the epistemology chapter

11:28.240 --> 11:33.020
when talking about different coherentist system, how it is restricting against the proliferation

11:33.020 --> 11:36.660
of infinite number of coherentist systems that we may hold.

11:36.660 --> 11:41.020
Or in another part of epistemology, the end where rationality being the means by which

11:41.020 --> 11:46.120
we judge different A priori frameworks, that was explicitly explained as well.

11:46.120 --> 11:50.320
So it is explicated, but not exactly in the way I just did now before.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.460
The thing is, I'm just doing a little bit of hypothetical syllogism, you know, putting

11:54.480 --> 11:59.760
things together to show and explicate the constraint that is an ontology based on his

11:59.760 --> 12:00.760
work.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.040
I mean, it's his work that suggests that this is the case, that that's what we do

12:04.040 --> 12:08.040
with ontologies, but he doesn't spell it out for us like this.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.520
For some reason I have to do that here.

12:10.520 --> 12:15.760
I mean, I agree with it, but it's coming from my explication here, not his, even if

12:15.760 --> 12:18.120
it is based directly on his work.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.720
So what I disagree with, and what would have become very obvious had he explicated what

12:22.740 --> 12:28.700
I just did, is how there is no distinction being given in ontology like there is in other

12:28.700 --> 12:34.580
places for limited ontological relativism, or mitigated ontological relativism, versus

12:34.580 --> 12:40.180
extreme or radical or stronger ontological relativism by Ogrady, in the most of the cases

12:40.180 --> 12:41.860
that he presents himself.

12:41.860 --> 12:47.300
So there is enough in this book from the structure itself, what it purports to say, what is happening

12:47.300 --> 12:52.140
between these various areas and how they function together to see that what is described as

12:52.160 --> 12:58.580
happening in other areas is also happening in a similar fashion in ontology, but in ontology

12:58.580 --> 13:01.080
being described in a different way.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.080
Why?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
Hmm?

13:03.080 --> 13:06.240
Some manipulative reason perhaps?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.240
Hmmmm.

13:07.240 --> 13:14.740
So the second part of my criticism is this kind of trick that seems to be happening.

13:14.740 --> 13:18.680
I described it previously in the previous video how there's sort of different kind of relativists,

13:18.680 --> 13:23.320
Which is in part what Ogrady is saying, we don't want to be a certain kind that is self-defeating.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.160
But I suggested there's another kind which is one that doesn't know that stepping in

13:27.160 --> 13:32.480
or pulling terms to avoid self-defeat still ends up in a place where they end up preventing

13:32.480 --> 13:34.320
themselves from engagement.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.800
As I mentioned, maybe in the previous video, this is what happened and this is the move

13:37.800 --> 13:44.040
that was made against Barnes and Bloor, when they pulled terms using Mary Hess, I think,

13:44.040 --> 13:46.080
with their balance of argument.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.400
What you see the thing is, when Barnes and Bloor use terms like balance of argument or

13:50.400 --> 13:56.080
empirical evidence, when they claim these things favor them and not the opposition, then they

13:56.080 --> 14:00.880
obviously do mean them in a general sense outside of their position, or else there would

14:00.880 --> 14:04.360
have been no efficacy in saying that they favored them in the first place.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.400
And if not, there might be versions of balance of argument or empirical evidence that actually

14:08.400 --> 14:13.400
weigh against them anyway, so there's no point in bringing up that theirs favor them.

14:13.400 --> 14:18.540
And that's the reason why O'Grady says it seems clear that these terms are in fact intended

14:18.540 --> 14:20.480
in a universal sense.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.760
And it's not the only place where the effect of silence or lack of engagement is pointed

14:24.760 --> 14:28.280
out when you pull terms like this, it happened in truth as well.

14:28.280 --> 14:32.800
But it's being pointed out for O'Grady still is a reason to rule against relativism in

14:32.800 --> 14:37.880
such places because of the effect of silence, since relativists do in fact want to engage

14:37.880 --> 14:39.240
according to O'Grady.

14:39.240 --> 14:43.440
So this technique didn't cut it for O'Grady in other places like truth or rationality.

14:43.440 --> 14:49.760
But as I mentioned in the previous video, speaking in the ontology chapter itself about

14:49.760 --> 14:55.040
one of the main ontological relativists discussed there, O'Grady says of Putnam, his argument

14:55.040 --> 14:58.680
against extreme relativism is simply that it is self-refuting.

14:58.680 --> 15:03.600
If one claims that each perspective is equally valid, then that very view is one among many

15:03.600 --> 15:09.400
perspectives and it has no purchase on anyone else's position and may be safely ignored.

15:09.400 --> 15:14.380
So the technique is mentioned there and why it doesn't work in ontology.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.400
But to this, O'Grady just says that he will refer to other chapters and come back to what

15:18.400 --> 15:24.080
epistemological or rational constraints can coexist with ontological relativism.

15:24.080 --> 15:28.240
But first and foremost, he already did speak about the discipline coming from rationality

15:28.240 --> 15:31.240
within this chapter, not really later.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.920
But anyway, more importantly, it doesn't seem to even properly connect as a response

15:35.920 --> 15:37.360
to what is said.

15:37.360 --> 15:42.840
Why isn't the self-defeat or failure to engage rather nevertheless still pressed in response

15:42.840 --> 15:47.960
to a relativist pulling terms in ontology like it is in other cases?

15:47.960 --> 15:50.640
And they absolutely did do that in ontology.

15:50.640 --> 15:56.240
The world, reality, ontology, properties, existence, all of it is pulled.

15:56.240 --> 16:01.200
That was one of the main things that was done there in a way reducing ontology into epistemology.

16:01.200 --> 16:07.360
It isn't clear why the restraint that is implied is only coexistence in ontology but

16:07.360 --> 16:08.880
restriction in others.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.960
So to make this clear about what I'm saying, just as I explained what restraint would mean

16:12.960 --> 16:17.680
if it were explained in ontology, let me explain what would have happened if he didn't allow

16:17.680 --> 16:20.560
this technique to work in ontology.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.200
Ontology is relative.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.920
Is itself a specific ontological view?

16:24.920 --> 16:30.560
To say that we create our worldviews relative to our conceptual scheme is itself a worldview.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.040
And it is being said as if in a non-relative sense.

16:34.040 --> 16:38.240
It is being said as if in a general sense that is at least in a way that would oppose

16:38.240 --> 16:42.760
other ontologies such as one that says, for example, our account of the world is taken

16:42.760 --> 16:45.280
directly from the properties of the world itself.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.440
That's being opposed here.

16:47.440 --> 16:52.680
To say our account of the world is exclusively relative to our internal working since there

16:52.680 --> 16:59.240
is no meaning in speaking of an external influence is itself a claim about what is the case with

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
the accounts.

17:00.920 --> 17:06.280
So we see this kind of counter in other areas but it's not being utilized here, biogradie,

17:06.280 --> 17:10.960
and described as preventing extreme or radical ontological relativism.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.240
If I may use some example, we pressed self-defeat in epistemology.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.840
Each epoch judges itself.

17:17.840 --> 17:21.600
One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they

17:21.600 --> 17:27.160
seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.080
One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared

17:31.080 --> 17:36.480
among all of them, that one cannot judge among them, but in doing so they are speaking about

17:36.480 --> 17:40.840
all of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common

17:40.840 --> 17:45.280
and so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing

17:45.280 --> 17:47.840
what they claim shouldn't be possible.

17:47.840 --> 17:52.920
Or to defend Kuhn from being interpreted as using global K.I.

17:52.920 --> 17:59.480
But Kuhn's own work itself shows that it is not global M.I. or K.I., or also would

17:59.480 --> 18:01.440
have undermined his own work.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.400
We saw this with Wartian Stitch and B.M.B.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.480
Kuhn's work is describing different paradigms, as if from the outside of them.

18:09.480 --> 18:14.440
If the claim is that terms cannot be understood outside the paradigm in which they are used,

18:14.440 --> 18:21.320
then one cannot compare paradigms in the way Kuhn has done, or even used against McIntyre.

18:22.320 --> 18:27.440
He says a significant challenge to universalism about rationality comes from McIntyre, who

18:27.440 --> 18:31.960
espouses that there are different traditions of thought that embody their own criteria

18:31.960 --> 18:36.280
of rationality and no neutral ground to evaluate them.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.640
First off, the self-defeat, like we have seen many times now.

18:39.640 --> 18:46.120
A quick response is to wonder which tradition McIntyre inhabits and how he manages to discuss

18:46.120 --> 18:52.080
and evaluate the ideas of so many people from other apparently incommensurable traditions.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.520
There are various areas where we notice the relativists are doing what they say they cannot

18:56.520 --> 19:01.160
do, in order for them to take a position on matters where they are saying you can't take

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
a position.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.280
But it isn't being used here in ontology to catch or prevent an extreme ontological

19:07.280 --> 19:11.340
relativist in the ways that O'Grady suggests could happen in other places.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.840
So why is he doing this?

19:12.880 --> 19:17.520
Is he actually being tricked here or making a mistake, goofing up?

19:17.520 --> 19:21.200
Well, I'm not capable of pointing out such an error, surely.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.920
I am after all just a shadowy internet character after all.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.640
But if I am right, then perhaps this was done on purpose.

19:30.640 --> 19:37.080
Perhaps he is simply allowing for such a technique to work here and purposely portraying himself

19:37.080 --> 19:42.220
as being more open than other areas to ontological relativism.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.220
But why?

19:43.220 --> 19:44.820
Why would he do that?

19:44.820 --> 19:49.260
Why is ontological relativism getting such special treatment?

19:49.260 --> 19:53.340
Well now, I made, if I think of it possibly, even a distasteful charge against O'Grady

19:53.340 --> 19:55.140
at the end of the ontology video.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.900
So I'm sorry that it is that way.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.100
Again, it's probably my lack of understanding.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.700
You know, my error here.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.820
Surely it must be that.

20:01.820 --> 20:06.380
But I think O'Grady absolutely does have enough tools in his arsenal within his book

20:06.380 --> 20:12.660
to actually and has actually defended against ontological relativism of an extreme variety

20:12.660 --> 20:14.380
in three different ways.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.820
I have only presented two so far and the third one will come after this conclusion.

20:18.820 --> 20:24.340
But instead he is purposely portraying himself as open to relativism in ontology just to

20:24.340 --> 20:26.620
placate relativists.

20:26.620 --> 20:32.580
By having an area they feel they are on good footing, a way of funneling relativists to

20:32.580 --> 20:36.020
ontology away from other areas.

20:36.020 --> 20:40.860
I'm actually prompted by him to see this as his motivation because of his insistence

20:40.860 --> 20:44.660
that this is the best way to accommodate relativists.

20:44.660 --> 20:49.460
About ontological relativism, he says at the very end of the ontological chapter, it appears

20:49.460 --> 20:54.580
to be one of the best ways those attracted to the relativistic ideas can accommodate

20:54.580 --> 20:56.460
that relativism.

20:56.460 --> 21:01.580
And near the end of the book he says, much of what motivates people to accept relativism

21:01.580 --> 21:05.660
can be accommodated by ontological relativism.

21:05.660 --> 21:10.500
So in a way it appears that he's actually just placating relativists by not talking

21:10.500 --> 21:15.700
about how he has actually restricted against ontological relativism in a number of ways.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.540
So to be clear, I'm not disagreeing with him about the funneling, I agree with him

21:19.540 --> 21:23.900
that many arguments for relativism, let's say in rationality for example, are only ever

21:23.900 --> 21:28.780
really about conceptual or ontological relativity anyway when you actually analyze them.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.780
And many relativists don't seem to recognize this because they're not very clear on which

21:31.780 --> 21:35.020
relativism they're even talking about especially when they're presenting arguments.

21:35.100 --> 21:38.540
And that's pointed out both by O'Grady and Philips, they talk about this kind of thing

21:38.540 --> 21:40.300
but that's another thing anyway.

21:40.300 --> 21:46.100
My issue here or claim is that while funneling into ontological relativism, he won't actually

21:46.100 --> 21:51.180
mention that even in that area it is also just moderate relativism or restricted or

21:51.180 --> 21:52.620
mitigated relativism.

21:52.620 --> 21:57.820
Instead he portrays it as if his book is just openly accepting ontological relativism period

21:57.820 --> 22:01.820
or just tentatively because he's not ruling against one way or another.

22:01.820 --> 22:07.900
So I'm saying I think he does this on purpose to make the funneling just seem more acceptable

22:07.900 --> 22:12.980
for the relativist, more appealing to do so, in a way purposely hiding the restrictions

22:12.980 --> 22:15.220
that are in that area as well.

22:15.220 --> 22:20.300
But you know, holding back attacks or defenses, just to make victories of yours in other areas

22:20.300 --> 22:25.220
seem more acceptable to your opponents, which is a very maybe kind thing to do, I don't

22:25.220 --> 22:29.460
know about emotions, but it does seem more like a psychological trick, a manipulative

22:29.460 --> 22:33.900
technique played on the relativist than honest philosophic work.

22:33.900 --> 22:38.220
Wow, are you saying O'Grady is being dishonest somehow?

22:38.220 --> 22:40.660
That's not cool man, why would you say that?

22:40.660 --> 22:45.820
Look, yeah I know, I know, okay listen, I don't know how else to feel about it though.

22:45.820 --> 22:49.180
You know I very much love this book, it's very rich in texture, it goes through many

22:49.180 --> 22:53.740
different philosophical discussions and discusses relativism in a very impactful way and that's

22:53.740 --> 22:57.540
why I think there are such good lessons we can take from this book.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.780
Even though I think there's a lot missing too.

22:59.780 --> 23:04.380
But my issue would be that his stance ultimately leaves the work of discussing the role of

23:04.380 --> 23:09.580
reality out and maybe we can talk about that more with Philips, but even that is a different

23:09.580 --> 23:15.860
issue from what I'm actually criticizing here, based on his book, if we take it at face value.

23:15.860 --> 23:20.580
And really my criticism isn't that massive in terms of his philosophy, which is largely

23:20.580 --> 23:25.180
something I agree with, even if it is excluding or leaving open the discussion of reality playing

23:25.180 --> 23:29.420
an important role in what we count as or think of as true or knowledge or facts.

23:29.420 --> 23:33.840
In comparison to that, this is really a rather small criticism perhaps of just representing

23:33.840 --> 23:39.340
oneself differently than one's work actually seems to be, so it could be an error in me

23:39.340 --> 23:44.380
which is fine, I hope it is, but if it isn't then it's either some kind of error in his

23:44.380 --> 23:46.900
work or purposely done.

23:46.900 --> 23:51.300
It can't strictly be an error though because my criticism is about the way he's portraying

23:51.300 --> 23:54.020
himself and I just find it misleading.

23:54.020 --> 23:59.460
There is enough in his work to make movements against ontological relativism despite what

23:59.460 --> 24:00.660
he says.

24:00.660 --> 24:05.340
So again, my assessment is that O'Grady presents himself as much more relativistic than he

24:05.340 --> 24:09.660
actually is based on the structure of his book, techniques of relativists that failed

24:09.660 --> 24:14.580
in other areas but seem to work here, as well as one more reason that I'm going to cover.

24:14.580 --> 24:18.100
I would agree with him that the middle ground is what this book is and I agree that the

24:18.100 --> 24:22.620
middle ground between the extremes is a result of a more philosophically aware path and a

24:22.620 --> 24:25.060
path of the future in philosophy.

24:25.060 --> 24:30.020
And while this book is a little more favorably open to anti-realist philosophy than my position

24:30.020 --> 24:35.860
would be, it's where he claims he lands on the middle path that does not seem to me to

24:35.860 --> 24:40.060
be where the book itself actually is saying it is.

24:40.060 --> 24:44.460
But now let's look at the most important component of my criticism that speaks about

24:44.460 --> 24:49.420
ontology anyway and it will lead us into a discussion about what is left out in this

24:49.420 --> 24:51.140
book.

24:52.140 --> 24:57.220
You see this whole book, it's best case for the universal hinges on non-contradiction

24:57.220 --> 24:59.940
and I doubt saying that is controversial at all.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.820
And now we're going to see a little funny thing that can happen in philosophy, much

25:02.820 --> 25:07.340
like it happened to Coon with just a few lines from his work leading to radical interpretation

25:07.340 --> 25:09.340
as we have seen in the rationality video.

25:09.340 --> 25:13.820
Well in this case it's a few words that O'Grady says when explaining assertion that

25:13.820 --> 25:16.500
impacts a truth deeper than he discussed.

25:16.500 --> 25:22.260
You see the argument for the principle of non-contradiction actually goes like this.

25:22.260 --> 25:27.020
The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of

25:27.020 --> 25:29.220
assertion and negation.

25:29.220 --> 25:34.900
When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content, and then endorses

25:34.900 --> 25:36.460
it as true.

25:36.460 --> 25:40.700
This content holds that something in the world is in such a way.

25:40.780 --> 25:47.700
Assertion also rules out various other things, namely the negation of that assertion.

25:47.700 --> 25:53.140
So assertion implies the rejection of the negation of the assertion.

25:53.140 --> 25:58.940
But a contradiction makes an assertion and simultaneously asserts the negation of that

25:58.940 --> 26:00.580
first assertion.

26:00.580 --> 26:05.980
Because of this, a contradiction undermines the very process of making an assertion.

26:05.980 --> 26:11.300
To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.

26:11.300 --> 26:15.260
Hence, contradictions must be avoided.

26:15.260 --> 26:21.060
So the principle of non-contradiction is itself being defended in order to preserve the very

26:21.060 --> 26:23.900
act of assertion, also negation.

26:23.900 --> 26:29.900
So again despite what I am saying next, this defense is not about esoteric objective assumptions

26:29.900 --> 26:34.020
or whatever have you assumptions about an ignorant or naive realist, that would be after

26:34.060 --> 26:38.940
all a derogatory description and a philosophic failure to grasp the argument that's happening

26:38.940 --> 26:41.340
here that Ogrady is offering.

26:41.340 --> 26:46.300
The defense is actually based on what it even means to say anything meaningfully.

26:46.300 --> 26:52.140
But that means it is actually the nature of assertion first that is really doing the work.

26:52.140 --> 26:56.940
And thus why we cannot have contradiction, because it would undermine the very process

26:56.940 --> 26:59.260
of assertion according to him.

26:59.260 --> 27:05.420
So let's focus on assertion and ask again, what does assertion even mean according to

27:05.420 --> 27:06.420
Ogrady?

27:06.420 --> 27:10.140
How do we cash out this concept of assertion?

27:10.140 --> 27:13.940
So I am going to read it again but slowly so we can really figure out what I am trying

27:13.940 --> 27:15.420
to say here.

27:15.420 --> 27:22.460
When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content and endorses it as true.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.980
Now the word true here, I am just going to leave alone.

27:24.980 --> 27:28.420
I don't even think he needed to bring that up because it may introduce some questions

27:28.580 --> 27:31.140
that he may not have wanted at that point in time.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.060
But anyway that's not what I am doing.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.900
I wonder what is expresses a content?

27:36.900 --> 27:38.900
What is this content?

27:38.900 --> 27:46.700
Well he says this content holds that something in the world is in such a way.

27:46.700 --> 27:53.460
This line itself describes that assertion as fundamentally making an ontological claim,

27:53.460 --> 27:55.500
a claim about the world.

27:55.500 --> 28:01.900
The very act of assertion is actually inherently tied into issues of ontology to say that the

28:01.900 --> 28:07.260
world is a certain way, in such a way.

28:07.260 --> 28:11.980
That is the nature of all assertion and it may take some philosophic reflection to realize

28:11.980 --> 28:16.460
it that there is an implicit claim about how things are and when we bother to say how things

28:16.460 --> 28:21.380
are however qualified it is, there is some connection to a certain way in the general

28:21.380 --> 28:22.380
sense.

28:22.380 --> 28:27.140
We couple this with his explication of how we cannot escape the notion of general truth.

28:27.140 --> 28:32.740
In all claims of speaking, even when you are talking about yourself, your sense, your feelings,

28:32.740 --> 28:35.860
is an attempt to state reality as being in such a way.

28:35.860 --> 28:41.020
However fallible and unjustified, this attempt to do so is a necessary component.

28:41.020 --> 28:46.860
All claims involve content that is conversationally intended to be about the world being a certain

28:46.860 --> 28:52.180
way, stating what is the case in such a way that rules out the opposite of what one is

28:52.180 --> 28:53.820
saying.

28:53.820 --> 29:00.060
This is the philosophic eye, the recognition of what it even means to take a position,

29:00.060 --> 29:04.620
to make an assertion, to speak of anything in any field.

29:04.620 --> 29:07.100
That's why I sometimes call it metaphysical.

29:07.100 --> 29:12.700
I'm not saying the eye exists as an entity somewhere ontologically, there's no magical

29:12.700 --> 29:15.180
spiritual superpowers I'm talking about here.

29:15.180 --> 29:22.420
I'm just theatrically presenting this philosophic awareness as an eye, an eye for its recognition

29:22.420 --> 29:28.580
that philosophers recognize certain necessities in order to take a position at all.

29:28.580 --> 29:33.180
And so this eye would activate or just notice and recognize that one is trying to take a

29:33.180 --> 29:36.140
position that would undermine doing so.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.460
Let's look at some of that activation.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.580
No one can say anything at all.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.500
Then how did you say that?

29:43.500 --> 29:46.340
No one should be denied at all.

29:46.340 --> 29:50.020
So aren't you denying those who would deny?

29:50.020 --> 29:53.460
We can only speak about ourselves.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.140
Then how are you speaking about others now?

29:56.140 --> 30:00.260
I disagree with the idea that disagreement is possible.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.660
Then how are you disagreeing?

30:02.660 --> 30:05.660
No one can speak in the general sense.

30:05.660 --> 30:08.540
Then why is that in the general sense?

30:08.540 --> 30:11.140
No one can objectively evaluate.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.260
Then how did you make that evaluation?

30:14.260 --> 30:18.300
We should no longer take any philosophic positions.

30:18.300 --> 30:22.300
That is itself a philosophic position.

30:22.300 --> 30:25.420
Philosophy is garbage and pointless.

30:25.420 --> 30:29.380
Is itself your philosophic position?

30:29.380 --> 30:32.820
Philosophy is garbage and science is the best.

30:32.820 --> 30:36.900
That itself is philosophy, philosophy of science.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.340
Talking with any authority is not possible.

30:40.340 --> 30:44.180
And what's your authority behind saying that?

30:44.180 --> 30:49.100
Whether it's based on reason or evidence, empirical structures, logic, whatever it is,

30:49.100 --> 30:54.700
however which way we feel the need then or ability to participate in the battlefield,

30:54.700 --> 30:59.940
that becomes something that shouldn't also at the same time be at risk when we are there,

30:59.940 --> 31:02.460
at very least, by us.

31:02.460 --> 31:07.060
So do not be tricked by the extreme relativists to shoulder the burden of providing something

31:07.060 --> 31:13.580
impossible in objective language or in objective observation or absolute anything.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.820
They are powerful enough to attack anything that comes across them in a certain way and

31:17.820 --> 31:21.420
that's the way that they're going to continue to emphasize and always see.

31:21.420 --> 31:25.540
And so they will claim that everything is relative ignoring the assumptions made in

31:25.540 --> 31:26.980
their own claim.

31:26.980 --> 31:31.700
There is a necessary assumption that something of what I bothered to say when I make an assertion

31:31.700 --> 31:37.700
about how things are, whether currently or forever inexplicable or not, conveys something

31:37.700 --> 31:44.220
about reality beyond the individual speaking and taking a stance in order to engage.

31:44.220 --> 31:49.620
That even if a proposition is completely relative, in that the proposition is relative to many

31:49.620 --> 31:50.620
factors.

31:50.620 --> 31:55.100
Sure, but there is an assumption that one of those things that it is relative to is

31:55.100 --> 31:59.620
a shared reality as a medium to whomever I am speaking with.

31:59.620 --> 32:04.420
That there is something of my assertion that has to do with how the world is in a certain

32:04.420 --> 32:11.140
way, beyond that which is created by my mind alone and thus ruling out the opposite way

32:11.140 --> 32:12.940
at the same time.

32:12.940 --> 32:18.380
This section of this video, the philosophic eye, I would like you to couple with my video,

32:18.380 --> 32:23.300
the my move video which is a part of the Kirk series so you may have to watch the Kirk series

32:23.300 --> 32:24.580
to really appreciate it.

32:24.580 --> 32:29.460
But if you connect the my move video from that series with this part of this video, I would

32:29.500 --> 32:33.460
really appreciate it, please maybe rewatch that one or check it out or something, but

32:33.460 --> 32:38.780
you will see how there is a deep, socially ethical aspect of this as well.

32:38.780 --> 32:42.140
And there certainly is these kind of social and ethical aspects which O'Grady doesn't

32:42.140 --> 32:45.340
do too much a discussion of, but we will get to next.

32:45.340 --> 32:50.220
But as a preview, the more powerful relativists often discussed here in O'Grady's version

32:50.220 --> 32:55.540
use philosophies to talk about how things are relative to a society, to a community.

32:55.540 --> 33:00.780
But in such a view, the existence of a society or the community is implicit in such a philosophy

33:00.780 --> 33:03.220
and so it is not in question.

33:03.220 --> 33:09.020
And in a way that definitely would contradict the individualist based extreme relativists.

33:09.020 --> 33:12.780
Even though they don't really account for that, I've encountered some people who would

33:12.780 --> 33:16.820
immediately agree with, as I say, any kind of relativism, so they would immediately agree

33:16.820 --> 33:22.260
with extreme individualistic based relativism even though that relativism may be in contradiction

33:22.260 --> 33:27.220
with community based relativisms which are the more powerful varieties, seemingly ones

33:27.220 --> 33:30.940
that are based on actual philosophers' writings in history and so on.

33:30.940 --> 33:34.940
Anyway, the move to more powerful relativism then definitely makes it even more favorable,

33:34.940 --> 33:39.220
the kind of point I was making there, that it will connect important ways to the point

33:39.220 --> 33:44.220
I made about the conversational standards of behaving as if committed to a metaphysical

33:44.220 --> 33:51.580
reality of another's existence and the independent agency of others outside of you and your own

33:51.580 --> 33:53.380
personal perception.

33:53.380 --> 34:01.260
Now of course relativists may say, oh, okay, so it's just a necessary assumption for conversations.

34:01.260 --> 34:02.500
So what?

34:02.500 --> 34:08.180
That doesn't really mean there is a mind-independent reality, let alone any argument for the ability

34:08.180 --> 34:11.900
for our language to convey non-relative reality.

34:11.900 --> 34:16.420
So really, reality is still relative.

34:16.420 --> 34:23.540
Well, welcome back relativists to the realist world where conversational standards don't

34:23.540 --> 34:29.700
hold light against our concern for what really is the case.

34:29.700 --> 34:33.060
That's actually a deep cut if you get what was done in ontology, so I hope you get the

34:33.060 --> 34:36.420
joke because, you know, they were trying to pull terms in an important way and try to

34:36.420 --> 34:40.380
make things more about the conversational standards rather than a discussion of metaphysical

34:40.380 --> 34:44.860
reality beyond them, but that move really didn't help them and that's part of basically

34:44.980 --> 34:49.820
the reason why I think this book is so good, because it connected the principle of non-contradiction

34:49.820 --> 34:54.580
to the nature of assertion, the nature of communicating with others rather than what

34:54.580 --> 34:59.340
is typically assumed, you know, metaphysical commitments, philosophers, traditional stuff.

34:59.340 --> 35:03.220
Anyway, it's still rather important to note that many of the elements aren't made by

35:03.220 --> 35:07.860
O'Grady or myself, they have been around for a while as I mentioned self-defeat and

35:07.860 --> 35:12.180
incoherence of certain forms of relativism have been known for thousands of years, even

35:12.260 --> 35:17.260
to many well-known relativists themselves and even this connection of the defense based

35:17.260 --> 35:21.340
on assertion rather than a transcendental structure building you could actually see

35:21.340 --> 35:26.580
in the positivist's writing, which O'Grady was probably heavily influenced by given he

35:26.580 --> 35:30.900
wrote a whole book about him, but it's how O'Grady wrote it and put it all together

35:30.900 --> 35:35.500
in the various fields that I really liked and yet for maybe that exact same reason of

35:35.500 --> 35:41.220
the positivist's influence he didn't really draw out or address the ontological implications

35:41.220 --> 35:46.500
and so that may be the tension of his own work for claiming to be open to ontological

35:46.500 --> 35:49.140
relativism a great deal.

35:49.140 --> 35:51.860
Let me give you some of my closing remarks now.

35:51.860 --> 35:55.980
There are more criticisms I could have of O'Grady of course and I do have, but those

35:55.980 --> 36:00.340
are mainly about what is left out and that being a discussion at least of Wittgenstein

36:00.340 --> 36:04.800
in a more general sense that was mostly absent if not soft in this book.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.780
This book was more kind of quine heavy and ironically I think it could have explicated

36:08.780 --> 36:12.780
a more middle ground or more nuanced position if we could have actually taken a closer look

36:12.780 --> 36:13.980
at Wittgenstein.

36:13.980 --> 36:17.460
It really does highlight the difference between someone who thinks Wittgenstein's philosophy

36:17.460 --> 36:22.820
leads to some radical relativism and someone who understands how that isn't so at all

36:22.820 --> 36:27.460
as Patrick Phillips may say does violence to the spirit of Wittgenstein.

36:27.460 --> 36:31.820
Phillips specifically looks closely at Wittgenstein and uproots misinterpretations of him from

36:31.820 --> 36:36.060
relativistic thinkers, but hey O'Grady said he was on the one hand trying to be general

36:36.060 --> 36:40.560
and cover a more broad range of things and a more surfaced way even though this is definitely

36:40.560 --> 36:42.980
far too textured for somebody new to philosophy.

36:42.980 --> 36:47.360
Anyway, it's still rather clear that if you were trying to give a full treatment of relativism

36:47.360 --> 36:52.420
everywhere then this book would be way freaking massive, so I'm glad it's not.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.800
Anyway, so that's my criticism and the explanation of the power that I promised you.

36:56.800 --> 37:02.620
You may agree with O'Grady or disagree in ways that I have about what is necessary in

37:02.620 --> 37:05.020
order to take a position at all.

37:05.020 --> 37:10.420
But the power is at very least to recognize that there is something necessary and therefore

37:10.420 --> 37:15.740
not relative in order to take a position at all or at least is necessary for those who

37:15.740 --> 37:21.580
are in combat or in conversation or sharing among each other in a shared way.

37:21.580 --> 37:25.820
And your philosophic eye will hopefully now activate whenever you hear someone or some

37:25.820 --> 37:30.940
other warrior saying or doing something on the basis of what they are attacking.

37:30.940 --> 37:34.680
So we're going to Phillips next and I have spoken a lot about him already, you know without

37:34.680 --> 37:38.200
perfect citations, so forgive me for that, I'll get to it when I do cover him.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.080
But when we do get to it, we are going to be forced into talking about some politics

37:41.080 --> 37:43.880
and there's some politically related stuff in this philosophy.

37:43.880 --> 37:48.360
But please understand that a far more nuanced understanding elevates a conversation philosophically

37:48.360 --> 37:53.400
from kind of typical tribalistic political talk is definitely more complicated than the

37:53.400 --> 37:57.680
reductive simplicity that would aid tribalism a lot in any case.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.600
I will be clear about what I'm saying later if it hasn't already been made to some of

38:01.600 --> 38:06.260
us, I know there are a number of places where I've given like clues.

38:06.260 --> 38:11.440
Join us, good warrior, for we travel now to see the insights of Patrick J.J. Phillips.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.160
Then finally, after all this time, return to the battlefield of fellow sigh, philosophy

38:15.160 --> 38:19.800
of science, and explain how these science wars are impacting the world to this very

38:19.800 --> 38:20.800
day.

38:20.800 --> 38:25.880
Oh, and I'm sorry I never actually properly covered Davidson, Davidson versus Ogrady is

38:25.880 --> 38:29.520
something that I said I would do and something that Ogrady talked about in this book and

38:29.520 --> 38:31.080
so I never really covered it.

38:31.080 --> 38:35.760
I'm actually very attracted to some of Davidson's arguments, so maybe one day I can cover specifically

38:35.760 --> 38:40.920
Ogrady versus Davidson after I take a closer look at Davidson directly instead of just

38:40.920 --> 38:45.280
relying on what Ogrady says, because right now I can't recall from Davidson what Ogrady

38:45.280 --> 38:47.160
says and what he was referring to.

38:47.160 --> 38:51.160
But you know, there's also so much I promise to do, I pop anyway.
