00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Epistemological Relativism

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,680
Epistemology is one of the main branches in philosophy.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,520
It is the study of knowledge itself.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,880
And epistemological relativism, well, it could mean many different things, but for the most

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,280
part is the position that there is not one universal way of assessing a knowledge claim

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,880
regardless of context.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,320
It denies one way of justifying or acquiring true beliefs, that there could be many ways

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,040
which would result in there being possibly many radically different or alternative knowledge

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,400
beliefs, even or at least seemingly contradictory ones.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,360
And there could be different positions under the header of epistemological relativism that

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,240
vary in strength as in how much relativism you can have.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,240
While there is much combat about that among different philosophers, at the lowest level

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,880
hardly anyone rejects relativity when it comes to perceptual knowledge.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,520
As in knowledge based on your perceptual location, like at any given time say the knowledge

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,800
of how this particular side of the face of this rock appears to you is relative to your

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,560
position to that rock.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,800
Or maybe how different people know different things because they are in different locations.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,600
Relativism at that level is perfectly fine, even with the absolutist position, which is

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
the opposite of the relativist.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
The real combat comes about when you're talking about relativism on a higher level, like natural

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,440
laws of the universe itself or math or geometry or even logic.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,200
Now back in the old days those who used relativism as a weapon at even those higher levels were

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,960
called skeptics.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,760
They used it to deny objectivity and by that also claims to knowledge.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,720
Because for them thinking that you could believe another set of beliefs even about these things

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,240
means that you don't really know.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,520
Such as the ancient pyrrhonian skeptics, but the modern use of relativism up here includes

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,280
philosophers who think that they can actually have relativism while not denying knowledge.

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
Being a relativist but not a skeptic.

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,800
In a sense, saying knowledge doesn't have to be objective.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
That it can be relative.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,680
Today we're covering this topic as it is presented in the middle chapter by philosopher

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
Paul O'Grady and that's the citation in the corner.

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,520
So I won't be covering all of epistemology which is virtually impossible to do in one

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,160
video, it will be more of a surface covering of this major branch of philosophy which can

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,920
still be a great source for someone to understand the kind of things going on in epistemology

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
in a more general sense.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,720
But the conversation is going to be framed in terms of how different knowledge can be

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,800
or how relative things can get in epistemology as discussed by Paul O'Grady, whose book

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,640
I've chosen to present here, even though certainly some of these debates have continued

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,000
past the time of his book being published.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,720
So you don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to even though I may be

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,560
suggesting other videos at times in this one, just take it more of a signpost.

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,680
It will still be a great standalone video for someone new to generally grasp the kind

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
of issues going on here even if you're not interested in relativism or whoever this

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
philosopher is.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
But if you will allow me to give some background first before we start talking about epistemology.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,080
Paul O'Grady is a philosopher who investigated relativism in many different cognitive areas

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,760
and I mean cognitive because he doesn't want to talk about merely morals you know like

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,840
what's right and wrong or aesthetics like what counts as beautiful.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,200
Those things can be relative to different people or cultures or not, who knows, we're

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
not talking about that though.

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Our concerns here are about if even things like truth or logic or today if knowledge

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
can be relative to.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,960
And before you think that you have a very clear and obvious answer please go watch this

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,960
video I made on his first chapter, it will in some sense convey the power of this weapon.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:06,120
But O'Grady does then go on to battle in these two areas specifically against relativization

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,360
and those are what I call the limits of this weapon.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
And that's what I was really interested in, that's what I even came here for.

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,720
I didn't want to have to cover everything in his book.

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,400
So I already covered his first powerful and awesome battle on the front of truth and also

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,880
covered the kind of intricacies of logic since he did utilize the principle of logic in order

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
to battle against relativization on the front of truth.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,520
But after that I just wanted to go straight to his next battle where he defends against

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
relativization.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,880
So if you're interested please do go check out these first battles if you'd like.

67
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,040
They are pretty good and certainly if you're less familiar with and want to come to grips

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,200
with how there can be relativism even about things like logic this video can help quite

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
a bit.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,840
To explain how in fact one actually can be a relativist when it comes to logic, that

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,720
there are different kinds of logic and what actual philosophers and logicians and maybe

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,240
computer scientists I guess mean when we say logic.

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,120
In any case O'Grady allows relativism both here and here but here it is limited by rationality

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,360
where he will argue against relativization.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
So like I said at first I was just gonna skip these chapters but then I realized that one

76
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,120
might not really appreciate what he's gonna be doing in that final battle of his without

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,440
knowledge of some of what happens here because he actually does reference it and in part

78
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,200
his strategy is to accommodate the relativist away from here into one of these other areas.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,080
So I decided to try and make a quick short video about both of these chapters to some

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,160
degree not my normal in depth line by line citation and standard of production you know

81
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
maybe lower quality audio or less visuals I don't know.

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,720
So I did one on ontology already which for our sake is pretty much a discussion about

83
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
the world and how the world can be relative.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,520
And for that video I just made it very general about the general battles going on in that

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,200
field and how O'Grady kind of presents it but not cited perfectly down to the line and

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,880
not going over everything O'Grady says just finally saying where O'Grady lands on the

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,560
issue like I don't want it to be overly visually produced or anything just wanted it to be

88
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,720
quick but it seems like I may have let it go a little bit out of hand there it got mad

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
visual.

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,440
So for this video actually this is my second time doing it the first time doing it I went

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,480
super fast and super quick just sticking to line by line citation of everything that happened

92
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,960
but it seemed like it was too fast.

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,040
So I'm going to slow it down technically I already did the work I've already made

94
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,600
a lot of the visualizations although it's still not up to par to my normal standard

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,200
and maybe the explanations is not even as in depth or as perfect an explanation as I

96
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,040
normally would do so this video isn't my norm kind of video keep that in mind I want

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,760
it to be at least kind of understandable what's basically going on in epistemology at least

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,320
in terms of what's happening with relativism and what O'Grady's final position is.

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,840
So let's get through this chapter together and if you don't care for this chapter you

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
can just jump to that final battle if that's all you really wanted to but you know here

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,280
we are in epistemology and if you're interested in epistemology this video can definitely

102
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,160
maybe help in some kind of more general sense I don't know.

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
But let's begin.

104
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,360
So he presents two main positions that believe yes you can have relativism in knowledge but

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,080
not be a skeptic a stronger position and a weaker position the stronger position believes

106
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,840
that different cultures and historical epochs have different standards for assessing knowledge

107
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,720
and thus different sets of beliefs there's no shared point from which to judge implying

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,960
they are completely cut off from each other which is a problem of incommensurability no

109
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,160
shared point to measure.

110
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,080
Judgment isn't possible from the outside one can only judge from within its own standards

111
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,880
each epoch judges itself.

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,640
One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,200
seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,400
One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared among

115
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,680
all of them that one cannot judge among them but in doing so they are speaking about all

116
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,040
of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common and

117
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,600
so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing what

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,680
they claim shouldn't be possible.

119
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,160
And don't mind my commentary if it doesn't help but this is basically self-defeat and

120
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,560
it is a massive running theme when it comes to facing this kind of opponent so they need

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,360
to be able to show that they can hold this position without being self-defeating.

122
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
Both Richard Rorty and Steven Stitch try to do this and both of these figures will come

123
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
back again in the battle on rationality chapter 5.

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,400
Now a weaker version of this does admit relativization can happen even in things like logic and math

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,040
and geometry or knowledge based on the a priori and they're supported with real world examples

126
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,500
like the change from Euclidean geometry, Aristotelian logic, Newtonian physics which all used to

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,640
be taken as absolute non-relative stuff but with developments in the 19th and 20th century

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,160
it's pretty clear we can have alternative geometry, different kinds of logical and mathematical

129
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,380
calculi even and even new physics.

130
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,640
And in terms of that logic part again if you would like examples of different logics and

131
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,080
how that could work please check out my video covering his discussion about alternative

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,280
logic.

133
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,840
But while this position is open to relativization about even those things there is still a limited

134
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,680
amount of alternatives not an infinite variety of alternatives about those things and also

135
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,800
it's still a limited form of relativism in terms of using one or an alternative system

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,880
that there's still a universal way of judging among them.

137
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,000
So both of these are epistemological relativism one is stronger which he calls radical epistemological

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,600
relativism where all judgments are relative to cultural and historical epochs no universal

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,120
standard at all all beliefs thus relativized to those separate and incommensurable epochs

140
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,840
and the weaker or as it is called by O'Grady the moderate epistemological relativists still

141
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,360
holds that a priori judgments are indeed relative to different systems so there can be alternative

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,480
accounts of the a priori knowledge knowledge like math or logic things that we can have

143
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,040
based on pure reasoning without even any experience but on the other hand there's still one universal

144
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,200
way of judging all those alternative systems.

145
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,000
And before making the case for this latter position which Paul O'Grady holds he first

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,840
wants to discuss the difference between relativism and skepticism and kind of trace how relativism

147
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,880
kind of came out as a way of responding to skepticism and hey in epistemology talking

148
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,960
about skepticism was pretty good place to start but after we're done talking about

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,160
skepticism and the responses to it then we'll talk about the main two big battles in modern

150
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,880
epistemological warfare which is foundationalism versus coherentism and externalism versus

151
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,600
internalism.

152
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,200
After he's done discussing both of these things then we'll go back to his discussion

153
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,040
of the radical versus the moderate epistemological relativists and why he prefers the latter.

154
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,280
So first, skepticism.

155
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,440
Well to be clear the skeptic definitely thinks that if they're all alternatives to what

156
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,520
we think to be true then we don't really have knowledge and should just suspend our

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,880
belief but the epistemological relativists hold that you can have alternatives but having

158
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,440
alternatives doesn't necessarily mean that we don't know and that those alternatives

159
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,160
can also actually constitute knowledge.

160
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,480
Now there's been many skeptical positions in history for example the ancients thought

161
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,600
that being skeptical was a kind of ethical position against holding belief solely on

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,000
dogma based just in faith which may have been used in religious and political or social

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,880
oppression of the people.

164
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,080
Other philosophers use it as a tool to test our knowledge to see what we can even be skeptical

165
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
about.

166
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,900
If we can be doubtful about it it meant that we didn't really know it.

167
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,200
So philosophers kind of tried to use doubt to uproot things that we didn't know to see

168
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,640
what we have left things that were indubitable things that couldn't be doubted and tried

169
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,280
to build our knowledge based on those undoubtedly indubitable things.

170
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,040
Now some philosophers are doubtful about having any knowledge at all while others are doubtful

171
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,640
about some specific things like the external world or that other minds exist or the possibility

172
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,600
of moral knowledge or even that there could be knowledge based on pure thought.

173
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:39,760
Now for this next section we're just gonna take this one as our main example of the skeptic.

174
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,640
So just so you have an idea of why somebody would be skeptical about the external world

175
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm gonna give you kind of a more modern example for this a more modern thought experiment

176
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,520
that of the possibility of having been born completely within a computer simulated environment

177
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
for example.

178
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,160
Nothing about how things appear to you within the simulated environment may connect to how

179
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,760
things really are in the actual world.

180
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,480
In such a situation all of your sensations are merely a part of the simulation, in fact

181
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,360
even your body would be a part of the simulation.

182
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,040
Maybe in the real world you don't actually have two legs and arms.

183
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,720
As if perhaps you're just a brain with electrodes being plugged in and just being given sensations

184
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
of sights and sounds and smells.

185
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,080
I mean technically in that situation you wouldn't really know if there really are trees or birds

186
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,880
if they really exist in that external world but also since all of our science or information

187
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,960
we were told that science has is based on that simulation, we wouldn't even know if

188
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,560
we are brains.

189
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,040
And in this way it seems always possible to be doubtful about the external world.

190
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,720
But that's just a thought experiment, don't worry about it too much, the point is that

191
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,600
you can be skeptical about the external world.

192
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,360
And so O'Grady outlines two strategies to respond to this kind of skepticism, one that

193
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,520
is to meet the challenge of the skeptic, to actually find beliefs that can't be doubted

194
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,160
even in this kind of situation and then build our knowledge off of those as a kind of secure

195
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,760
base and the other one is to show that the skeptical challenge is not something to be

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,080
taken seriously at all, it's kind of more of a rejection strategy to deny the skepticism.

197
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Now most philosophic tradition is about that first strategy, so if you're just starting

198
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,840
philosophy you're probably going to learn one of these two things if not both, I mean

199
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,720
you should probably learn about both.

200
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,440
But as he presents them there's the empiricist and the rationalist take on this kind of strategy.

201
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,000
For the empirical strategy the idea is that beliefs immediately deprived from perception

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,360
often called the given were proposed as many as immune to doubt.

203
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,120
So if you think of it, simulation or not, the given may be that I'm having the sensation

204
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,880
of red right now.

205
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
That's still true no matter what.

206
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,840
Not conceptualizing what that red is about or what it's coming from or if it connects

207
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,720
to anything beyond what I perceive, nothing like that.

208
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,440
It's supposed to be non-conceptualized experience.

209
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,400
That's still something I know directly no matter what situation it is.

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,800
But hey that's just my example of what the given might be.

211
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Really the details of what the given is varied a lot among philosophers but they did have

212
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,160
all in common the idea that knowledge began with the data of the senses.

213
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
That's what makes it empirical.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,960
These immediately derived perceptions, the given, were taken to be safe from skepticism

215
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,680
and so we can build our secure knowledge strictly off those things.

216
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,000
Now that approach may seem promising to you but the problem that led most to reject this

217
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,880
kind of move was the issue of giving an account of how that stuff can even have data that

218
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,960
we aren't skeptical about.

219
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,760
The whole point was that it was so basic it were below the level of conceptualization.

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,720
But once you conceptualize it in order to build off it, it no longer is safe from skepticism.

221
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,320
And we kind of already spoke about this issue a lot in that ontology video so if you're

222
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,120
interested in what's going on here, how is this an accurate criticism, please go check

223
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,840
out that video first or maybe even the power of relativism, the first chapter, to see what's

224
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
being said here.

225
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,760
That the idea that we can just build off simply how we see things is actually a kind of naive

226
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,000
position at this point, we've moved way past that.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Anyway, for this reason, Ogrity says the empiricist's attempt at meeting the skeptical challenge

228
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,000
has failed.

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,160
Now on the rationalist's attempt to meet this challenge is most notably Rene Descartes

230
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,040
who actually thought there were some kind of special properties of certain beliefs that

231
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,640
made them indudable, that made them the kind of beliefs that can't ever be doubted, namely

232
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,400
that they must be clear and distinct.

233
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,320
But when pressed to explain these properties, how they allow them to justify other propositions

234
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,320
and why they would entail certainty, as Ogrity remarks, that did not prove compelling.

235
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
So both of these failed.

236
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
What about strategy 2?

237
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,920
In terms of kind of denying or rejecting the kind of philosophic doubts that we have here

238
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,320
about the external world, Ogrity covers two philosophers, namely Wittgenstein and Quine.

239
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,200
Now I already have done a video on Wittgenstein and if you want a little better understanding

240
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,920
if you're unfamiliar with his latter philosophy, please do check it out, it's even less I guess

241
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,600
formal than this video, it's more of me kind of talking from the top of my head to kind

242
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,280
of compensate for a section where he talked about Wittgenstein earlier in one of his chapters

243
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,240
that I just didn't think was really great.

244
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,200
Nevertheless, I think in my opinion it's a pretty good video of giving an understanding

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,560
of Wittgenstein and how he deals with this kind of skepticism, and how he would deal

246
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,600
with this kind of skepticism as being ungrounded, and also how Wittgenstein's philosophy loans

247
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,240
itself to being used by relativists even though he didn't want that.

248
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
But Ogrity comments that even if we do take Wittgenstein's approach to show that these

249
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,200
doubts are ungrounded, it changes our conception of philosophy, to see it more as therapeutic

250
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,160
and as a removing kind of system building.

251
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,840
But also he remarks how some philosophers still take some initial lessons from Wittgenstein

252
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,080
to do away with the skepticism but still feel they can go on and continue doing philosophy

253
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,160
in a more traditional systemic fashion.

254
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,880
And it seems to me that this includes using Wittgenstein's philosophy about how they're

255
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,360
being different language games and therefore different standards within each language game

256
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,840
to then be relativistic about almost anything.

257
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
This even includes rationality, but Ogrity will address that rationality thing in chapter

258
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,800
5 like we've already mentioned.

259
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,960
Now Ogrity kind of makes a sort of similar point about Quine then too, which I also made

260
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,680
a kind of quick rough video as a starting point about Quine also, which I hope is done

261
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,240
by now, but he really does speak about Quine in both of these middle chapters and really

262
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,040
didn't want to have to present Ogrity's version of Quine twice, so I just made that

263
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,760
video so I can reference it in both of these videos, so you can check that out.

264
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,640
And it will explain its relation both to ontology and its relation to epistemology and so here

265
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,080
also in regards to skepticism.

266
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,280
It will explain how he finds that doubts arising from scientific knowledge can also be answered

267
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,200
therefore with scientific knowledge, from where it arises rather than taking those doubts

268
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
to some extreme unanswerable level.

269
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,360
Like I said though, I think Ogrity is making a similar point about Quine as he did Wittgenstein,

270
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,440
that even though he accounts for how different they are, he says that Wittgenstein's philosophy

271
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,240
led to a change in conception of philosophy as more of a form of therapy to remove a kind

272
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,900
of attempt to build a transcendental philosophical structure.

273
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,680
And even for Quine, his philosophy changes the conception of philosophy since it's no

274
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,160
longer seen as different from science, it's no longer seen as separate, they are both

275
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,180
simply a part of the same web.

276
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,980
But also like Wittgenstein, there are philosophers that could actually take Quine's position

277
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,300
but don't go on to hold science as particularly prized web of belief that Quine did, which

278
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,860
was a non-relativist epistemology, and so they use Quine's philosophy to deal with

279
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,500
the skepticism but then go on to become epistemological relativist, drawing a parallel to Wittgenstein,

280
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,780
how his philosophy is used too to be relativistic about epistemology.

281
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,500
In summary for this section about skepticism in terms of our epistemological discussion,

282
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,300
it shows that the more promising solutions to skepticism, what we are calling strategy

283
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,700
too, which is the rejection of the skeptical challenge, they actually can be used to lead

284
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,100
to epistemological relativism, but also it requires a change in our conception of philosophy,

285
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,980
and we'll talk more about that later.

286
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,980
But that's the point here, about this traditional problem about skepticism in epistemology has

287
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,300
in more recent time with more recent and modern strategy led to some taking on epistemological

288
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,940
relativist positions.

289
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,500
But now let's move on to the main two big battles in modern epistemological warfare,

290
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,260
which is foundationalism versus coherentism, and externalism versus internalism.

291
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,940
Now these two former things were taken to be absolute, and these two latter things were

292
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,420
taken to be more relativistic.

293
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,980
But in this section, Paul O'Grady is going to show that this isn't necessarily so, that

294
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,020
actually all of these positions can have both elements of relativism and elements of an

295
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,580
absolutist position, that even the foundationalists and the externalists can be made relativistic,

296
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,860
and that both the coherentist and internalist positions don't have to lead to any kind of

297
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,300
extreme radical relativism, that there can be some kind of absolutist constraints on them

298
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
too.

299
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,140
So before we get into these main two big battles, I just want to explain something called inferential

300
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
justification first.

301
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,220
And for those of us who are not familiar with formal logic, let me just kind of loosely

302
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,700
explain the idea using an example of basic arithmetic, basic math.

303
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,820
So look at this example, 2 plus 2 equals 4.

304
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:51,540
Now the justification of 4 is actually inferred from these earlier premises, and so in this

305
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:58,180
way, the truth of these is being preserved into the conclusion of 4.

306
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,660
Now it's kind of weird to talk about math like this for me, so in a more formal logical

307
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,900
symbolic language, basically the truth of these premises are preserved in the conclusion,

308
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:16,420
that if p then q, and we have p, we use something called modus ponens to infer q.

309
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,220
The truth of q is inferentially justified given that these former premises are true.

310
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,820
If it's true that if p then q, and if it's true that p, we can therefore infer and justify

311
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,340
q.

312
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,380
So justification in this sense is kind of moving from these earlier premises to this latter

313
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
one.

314
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Keep that in mind.

315
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,980
In this way, it's usually taken that belief is justified and so inferentially from another

316
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,580
belief, and justification is just thereafter passed on.

317
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,900
So anyway, let's look firstly at foundationalism.

318
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,140
Now we have already in some sense kind of spoken about this earlier with the empirical strategy,

319
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,300
but anyway, the foundationalist idea is that all of our beliefs, justification just don't

320
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,940
go back forever and ever, though there is some battle about this idea of going back forever,

321
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,540
which actually goes past the time of O'Grady's book between Klein and Gannett, or Ginnett?

322
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,140
Once again, I don't really have friends to tell me how to say things.

323
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
So subscribe.

324
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,860
Either way, both positions here take the idea of it going back forever as obviously untenable.

325
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,460
Anyway, also for the foundationalist, for them it doesn't just cycle back on to itself,

326
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,660
instead there must be some basic original first beliefs that aren't inferentially justified

327
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,140
from other beliefs, that these basic beliefs are special and in some way self-justifying.

328
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,220
And higher level premises are just built upon them in a process called epistemic ascent.

329
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,300
So maybe as a kind of quick simple image we might imagine an upside down triangle.

330
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,620
While this kind of seems to imply for most foundationalists then that knowledge can only

331
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,580
be one structure, as based on these basic beliefs, there is no room for relativism of

332
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,060
our beliefs then.

333
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,460
But O'Grady shows with Karnap that even these basic beliefs, our so called basic ones, can

334
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,700
actually be characterized in different ways, as relative to our theoretical models.

335
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,700
The theories that we have actually shape how we interpret what those basic beliefs even

336
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,860
are, and we can choose different models for our different aims, different purposes, but

337
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,420
in so doing so changing our theories we even end up changing those so called basic beliefs,

338
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,820
in ways that show that they can't actually be taken as pre-theoretical I guess.

339
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,180
We can't actually take them as just prime and evident in of themselves.

340
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,380
But also with Karnap, the whole epistemic ascent itself can actually be relative and

341
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,820
different based on which model we are using.

342
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,860
And to make that sort of idea clear, once again, I do have a video on logic that makes

343
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,020
this kind of idea more clear about how we can have different logics in different models,

344
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,580
and how that can entail different inferential rules that allow us to build in different

345
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
ways.

346
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,260
One of these models isn't inherently more right or wrong.

347
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,100
We can in fact just select them based on our purposes and for Karnap those purposes were

348
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,500
used for scientists.

349
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,260
Anyway, so please do go check out that video, okay?

350
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,300
The point here anyway was that relativism can still arise when it comes to foundationalism

351
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,300
too, even though it's normally thought of as being strictly absolutist.

352
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,220
Now the coherentist position, which is the opposition to foundationalism, is much more

353
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,100
like a larger web.

354
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,380
For them they believe there are no basic beliefs.

355
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,380
There can be no beliefs that aren't justified by other beliefs.

356
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,740
And to combat the foundationalists that accuse them of just being circular in their reasoning,

357
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,980
well they say that justification is non-linear, that justification is more holistic, justification

358
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,540
coming from multiple beliefs within the matrix of beliefs.

359
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,540
Now Ogrity summons one of the most popular images that kind of give visualization to

360
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,220
the coherentist picture, which is the image of Neruth's boat.

361
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,020
An image that I'm kind of presenting here in a kind of more simple fashion, but hey

362
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,460
I think the point comes across.

363
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,300
The idea is that no one plank in this boat is essential.

364
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,300
You can actually remove anyone if needed and replace any plank at any one time.

365
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,860
But not the whole thing, which means there's no foundational essential plank.

366
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,820
When we remove any one plank we can make other adjustments in other places to make sure we

367
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,100
still stay afloat while we're replacing it for example.

368
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,220
And just to note, this whole idea of Neruth's boat is actually kind of in part based on

369
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,700
the Ship of Theseus.

370
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,380
In the Ship of Theseus you can replace one plank at a time all the way through the ship

371
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,580
so that it ends up being completely different.

372
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,580
And when it comes to the Ship of Theseus the question is, is it still the same ship if

373
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,940
it's completely different by the end?

374
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,620
But there's no clear point at which we count it as being suddenly a new ship.

375
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,660
Anyway, this discussion is not about the Ship of Theseus, but just the idea that in fact

376
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,660
the entire thing can change because there's no one essential, foundational, or most important

377
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,060
belief, or thing that we know a part of our entire ship.

378
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,940
Anyway, so the big deal with Coherentism in terms of relativism is that it seems that

379
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,780
we can have an endless number of different systems that even contradict with each other.

380
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,360
Since all it needs to be justified is be coherent within its own system.

381
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,180
And hey, if you think of it, many people suffering from extreme paranoid schizophrenia have large

382
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,420
structures of beliefs that they are completely obsessed about trying to make perfectly coherent

383
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,140
or take conspiracy theorists for example.

384
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,900
They might have huge numbers of beliefs that they think interlock and connect in so many

385
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,140
different ways that they are completely obsessed about making perfectly connected and internally

386
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,640
coherent too.

387
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,160
But what they believe still contradicts what we believe in some ways or many ways even.

388
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,900
But if we take every system as being equally justified, then this is taken to be radical

389
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
relativism.

390
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,900
And to deal with this kind of situation of how there can be seemingly contradictory

391
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,660
different Coherentist belief, in my phrasing at least I'll say it, that some actually

392
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,080
believe well you know you just take these web of beliefs and you mash them together

393
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,180
to make one big one, one big web of belief that's for everyone.

394
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,060
And some take that to be what's happening with the whole project of unifying science.

395
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,140
That's one way to deal with that kind of problem.

396
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,020
Others try to mark out some systems as unique or special by appealing to some kind of transcendental

397
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,500
arguments about the nature of belief.

398
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:41,340
How some beliefs are specially known in some way, or sort of fusing elements of both foundationalism

399
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,060
and Coherentism together.

400
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,500
Anyway, because of those it seems to imply that it's possible that there can be one

401
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,140
correct system.

402
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,580
That even in Coherentism, there can be an absolutist and non-relativist picture.

403
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,620
But if there can be many different systems, one falls into extreme relativism.

404
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,240
And the moderate position is that while there can be different systems, there's a limitation

405
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,800
on how many alternatives there can be.

406
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Again, the stronger position is that there can be many globally different systems, systems

407
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,460
that are completely different from each other.

408
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,760
And the weaker position is the idea that there is actually just distinct local subgroups

409
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,860
within a larger system.

410
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,780
The radical epistemological relativist uses a Coherentist picture, but with multiple systems

411
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,880
and no limits on how many there can be.

412
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,820
The moderate epistemological relativist is one where there can be local subgroups within

413
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,780
a more global system.

414
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:44,020
So to be clear, relativism can happen both with foundationalism and Coherentism.

415
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,020
But later when we talk about both of these positions, they're both going to be using

416
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,740
a more Coherentist structure, just a matter of whether or not it's radically relativistic

417
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,780
or moderately so.

418
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,660
But onward to the next big battle in epistemology, externalism versus internalism.

419
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,920
Now most of the epistemological tradition has been internalized till recently.

420
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,080
Now traditionally in the philosophic tradition, we used to define knowledge as being justified

421
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,720
true belief.

422
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,000
That you had a belief, you had good reasons for believing what you do, and it is actually

423
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
true.

424
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,320
Then we would say you have knowledge.

425
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,240
But then this guy named Edmund Gettier came along and basically showed that we can make

426
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,780
cases where somebody does have good reasons to believe what they do and it happens to

427
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,580
turn out to be true but we still wouldn't say they really knew.

428
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,860
So it showed that JTB wasn't enough, that there probably had to be something more or

429
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,140
maybe even that this whole enterprise of defining knowledge in this way is not a good one but

430
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,580
that's my personal opinion.

431
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,460
But don't worry about what that special case was or what to do instead.

432
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,960
The whole point here is that we still held that knowledge generally had to have an entailed

433
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,480
truth but that somebody could be justified in believing something even though it didn't

434
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,240
have to be true, that it was possible to be fully justified and have the good reasons

435
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,040
to believe something even though it turns out to be false.

436
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,520
And in such a case we would say you don't have knowledge.

437
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,280
So this question about internalism and externalism isn't about knowledge itself, it's specifically

438
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,360
about justification.

439
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,260
And the internalists hold that the reasons why somebody should be considered justified

440
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,540
in believing what they do should be available to the person who holds the justified belief.

441
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,520
It should be internally available to them.

442
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,980
But the externalist says that one can be justified for believing what they do for reasons outside

443
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:47,300
of what is consciously known or available to the person who has those true beliefs.

444
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,080
The externalist feels we can actually point to certain mechanisms that might be outside

445
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,480
of what we are aware of that still nevertheless produce likely true beliefs in us.

446
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,240
And because those mechanisms still produce true beliefs in us, that means we should still

447
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,960
be considered justified if we used those mechanisms, even if we're not aware of what those mechanisms

448
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,600
are or articulate how we got beliefs from those mechanisms.

449
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,980
Such as perception, like seeing, maybe seeing and perception actually produces very likely

450
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,240
beliefs in us.

451
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,840
So we're still justified in believing what we do because we use that mechanism, even

452
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,620
if we can't exactly explain why we believe what we do based on them.

453
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:34,780
Now it's important to note, in this way externalists kind of have connected justification to truth.

454
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,220
And this is a connection that the internalist doesn't necessitate at all.

455
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,820
And so because of that, it might seem like since the externalist is connected to truth

456
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,960
and since we've seen that truth is not relative, that's an earlier battle that Paul O'Grady had,

457
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,640
we would say that then there's no room for relativism in externalism.

458
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,760
Because truth isn't relative and they're supposed to be connected, right?

459
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,720
Well, O'Grady shows with Alvin Goldman's Reliabilist account that this isn't necessarily so.

460
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,480
That there can be different frameworks that provide systems of rules for judging if a belief

461
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,800
is justified or not, called J-Rules.

462
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,660
And these rules don't even have to be consciously known, but can be applied from without to

463
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,660
give an objective judgment if a belief is justified.

464
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,660
But there's a criterion of rightness for when it comes to judging which framework succeeds

465
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,780
in capturing justification.

466
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,700
So the criterion establishes the correct framework, which establishes if something is justified.

467
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,780
And according to Goldman, epistemic terms like justified or not happens within these

468
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,560
frameworks, but outside of them they're just descriptive language, so on the level

469
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,160
of the criterion, he settles for the term of reliability.

470
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,080
And technically there could be different frameworks that meet the same criterion.

471
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,560
To be clear, Goldman doesn't say that these are culturally relative or anything like that,

472
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,160
but they can be multiple within even an individual.

473
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,720
If that seems unclear, don't worry about it.

474
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,260
The point here for this video is that even the externalist has some room for relativism.

475
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,860
But even in comparison to that, the internalists seem much more obviously open to relativism,

476
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,220
as it appears there's no external constraint of their beliefs having to be true.

477
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,060
Consider in one person's perspective, they could have all the good reasons to believe

478
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,660
they know something.

479
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,300
And he gives an example of himself possibly believing that a lecture will happen from

480
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,360
an eminent philosopher, because he's seen the ad posters for it, and students have spoken

481
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,560
to him about it, and he even sees someone being guided into the lecture hall, so he

482
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,800
has many factors, perception, testimony, coherence, and they all come together to make

483
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,360
him perfectly justified in believing a lecture is happening or going to happen.

484
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,240
But it turns out, it's actually all an elaborate hoax set up by some students playing a trick

485
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,400
on him.

486
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,340
In this context, he was perfectly justified in believing there was a lecture happening.

487
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,340
But in the context of the students who may have set up the hoax, they were completely

488
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,660
justified in believing there was no lecture happening.

489
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,580
So we had two valid justifications but opposing beliefs.

490
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,820
So this led philosophers to think that maybe context matters for justification, context

491
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,220
in terms of who's the one describing something as being justified or not.

492
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,560
So instead of saying that S is justified in believing P, we now have that S is justified

493
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,120
in believing P relative to context C. But what kind of context can we have?

494
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,880
Well Ogrity says that contextualism has been investigating this kind of issue.

495
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,600
So the point is that internalism kind of leads us into a discussion about contextualism.

496
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,120
Differing knowledge standards apply in different contexts.

497
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,380
For example, Mary knows her kids are in the yard because she just checked on them and

498
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,780
she has no reason to think otherwise.

499
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,140
So we might agree that yeah, Mary knows her kids are in the yard, she just checked.

500
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,020
But also, we find out there's actually a kidnapper in the neighborhood.

501
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:13,700
So now we think, oh well considering that, maybe she's not justified in knowing.

502
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,020
Maybe she doesn't really know.

503
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,280
Ogrity uses her own standards in her context to be able to say that she is fully justified

504
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,920
to believe she knows where her kids are.

505
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,480
But we use our standards given what we know to say that she's not justified.

506
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,320
Now what makes us select different standards?

507
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,040
Mark Heller says that it depends on our interest and the demands of the conversation we're

508
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
having.

509
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,600
But don't worry about where this goes.

510
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,100
Mary tries tying this all up by saying that even if knowledge descriptions are contextually

511
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,140
sensitive, it doesn't necessarily lead to extreme relativism.

512
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,340
Because relative to a context within those standards, there's still an objective answer

513
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,940
to whether or not S knows P, just like indexical sentences that use I or this.

514
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,500
For example saying yeah, I am in Paris.

515
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,100
Sure, the truth of that is relative to who's saying it.

516
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,260
But once we know who's saying it, there's still a way of objectively evaluating if

517
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,680
it's true.

518
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,920
Meaning given the context, once we figure out what the context is, one can establish

519
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,800
an absolute truth claim.

520
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,120
But that's not the only contextualist argument that prevents a strong relativist reading

521
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
of it.

522
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,880
It still seems open and possible that there could be general epistemic standards that

523
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,240
govern more local contextualized aspects.

524
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,040
And that's actually kind of what he will argue for and give details of in his chapter

525
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
5.

526
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,600
But as a summary of this whole section of both these battles, basically despite what's

527
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,940
normally assumed of all of these positions, they can both have elements of relativism

528
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,340
and absolutism to some degree.

529
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:54,220
And even if we take these normally assumed relativist positions, they don't necessarily

530
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,980
have to lead to radical relativism then.

531
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,860
We can have actually more moderate versions of relativism with them.

532
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,060
So now we're going to deal with that conflict of radical epistemological relativist versus

533
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,420
a moderate epistemological relativist position.

534
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,800
For the radical epistemological relativist, he gives the examples of Rorty and Stitch.

535
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,440
And I'm just going to be like fully, fully honest with you right now, I detest having

536
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,480
to get into this mess.

537
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,860
Getting into it here will be overly complicated in cumbersome.

538
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,520
And ultimately I don't think it's very contributive to what we want to do with Ogrady anyway.

539
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,200
Even if Rorty's challenges may be one that's more likely going to be coming from someone

540
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,140
who we describe as a relativist, arguments that are going to be made against anyone trying

541
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,340
to attempt to establish anything universal in any which way.

542
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,100
Still, a lot of the descriptions about the failings of philosophy and the presumptions

543
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,260
of objectivity and the denial of trying to assume a kind of transcended structure and

544
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:03,100
all that, you know, which isn't an inaccurate criticism of the old philosophical tradition,

545
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,080
but it actually results in a kind of unnecessary wholesale rejection of the role of philosophy

546
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,240
itself.

547
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,280
But you know what, let me actually read the sort of conclusion Paulo Grady has when it

548
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,600
comes to Rorty and Stitch, so we can get a kind of sense of the criticism Ogrady has

549
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,360
for both of them, and also the kind of role that is still left for philosophy, even considering

550
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,040
the accurate critiques that Rorty and Stitch might have.

551
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,000
So first he says of Rorty.

552
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,780
Rorty's view is just too extreme.

553
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,420
Because one model of ontology, truth, rationality, epistemology, and so on fails, does not mean

554
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,820
the whole philosophical enterprise fails.

555
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,060
A fallible historically, politically, and scientifically attuned reflection on questions

556
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:55,900
of meaning, truth, reason, and so on is philosophy, and is what people like Habermas, McDowell,

557
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,580
Putnam and Quine, to mention just a few, are doing.

558
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:07,320
One may disagree with him, indeed being part of the philosophers club seems to entail disagreeing,

559
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,760
but it reflects too much of an all or nothing style of thinking to reject epistemology and

560
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,040
metaphysics because certain versions of it haven't worked, and instead plump for social

561
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,520
political analyses of truth, rationality, warrant, and so on.

562
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,320
As Searle once remarked apropos Wittgenstein, just because his early theories of philosophy

563
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,900
failed, he concluded that all philosophy was doomed to fail.

564
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:43,420
In some forms of anti-philosophy, one can find enormous philosophical hubris lurking

565
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,540
just beneath the surface.

566
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,880
Rorty has done a great service in his criticism of the analytic tradition, forcing it to be

567
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,700
more self-aware.

568
00:40:52,700 --> 00:41:00,560
However, self-criticism doesn't always mean self-annihilation, as Rorty seems to think

569
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
in this case.

570
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,080
I mean, I find these to be some pretty harsh words for Rorty, but also I very much like

571
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,040
this quote because I think it's far more accurate to how and what philosophy is compared

572
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,160
to the results of Rorty's conception.

573
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,280
But anyway, let's look at what Paulo Grady says in response to both of them together

574
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,440
now.

575
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,500
What is common to both Stitch and Rorty is a tendency to set up dichotomies, as if they

576
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,660
were mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the options.

577
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,260
Rorty rejects the traditional conception of philosophy as seeking to find objectivity

578
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,300
in the transcendent and non-human.

579
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,020
Stitch rejects more recent attempts to do the same in this scientific world.

580
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,100
Both have quite compelling cases to make against their opponents, however, they then both leap

581
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,160
to a position that this is supposed to be the only alternative to the rejected position.

582
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Rorty speaks of intersubjective agreement as the new objectivity and Stitch talks of

583
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,800
achieving diverse cognitive goals.

584
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,600
The implication in both cases is that while these are meaningful occusions, it is a retreat

585
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,720
to the rejected conception of philosophy to seek further explanation as to why certain

586
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,320
goals and methods are preferable to others, and for what reasons communities come to agreement

587
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,740
over issues.

588
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,340
In fact, both are largely right in their rejection of traditional ways of explaining objectivity

589
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:30,340
and cognitive success, but fall foul of explaining how objectivity emerges in the new conversational

590
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,860
context other than saying it generally does.

591
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,140
An important task for philosophers who are persuaded of the failure of some of these

592
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:46,140
traditional projects, but who are dissatisfied by the skimpiness of explanation of how objectivity

593
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,240
as intersubjectivity is supposed to work, is to try and establish how it does.

594
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,320
A beginning for such a project is to look at a priori knowledge.

595
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,640
So that's what O'Grady does next.

596
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,440
Oh man, this video is huge.

597
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,200
Okay, so I'm going to hit this last part of the video with some mad crunch time, and

598
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,920
I'm kind of sorry for that, but don't worry, I will still explain what O'Grady's position

599
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,480
is going to be in terms of epistemological relativism at the end.

600
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,500
But this is the section then devoted to moderate epistemological relativism, and pretty much

601
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,340
first he's going to explain why we can be relativist about even these things like logic

602
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,860
and math and geometry, but then after explaining that he's going to explain why we should

603
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,820
still have it be moderate, why there's still some use in there being relative, but also

604
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,540
at the same time why we don't have to result in some kind of extreme relativism, what the

605
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,260
limits of this relativism is.

606
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,020
So anyway, let's talk about it.

607
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,360
So he's starting this discussion with a priori knowledge.

608
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,720
So basically, a priori knowledge was taken to be the best example of absolute knowledge

609
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,240
prior to experience, and it was also thought to be necessarily true.

610
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,000
But Kripke challenged this and shown that that relationship isn't actually always holding,

611
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,960
that it doesn't have to be necessary.

612
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,400
In any case, like I said, keep in mind, the standard candidates for what a priori knowledge

613
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,600
is, is things like logic, or math, or so called special sentences, but I don't want to have

614
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,260
to explain what those special sentences are right now.

615
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,020
The point is, some believe that they can have justification for all of these things based

616
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,140
in a kind of rational intuition, and these philosophers are namely Russell and Bonjour,

617
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,540
but they thought these things were known immediately, that they were kind of special to human intuition,

618
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,660
and they were non-reducible, they couldn't be reduced to other beliefs, and they weren't

619
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,740
arbitrary, and also that they were kind of part of the mind-independent world, they weren't

620
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,020
just true inside our heads.

621
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,200
Now at first these things were taken to be infallible, that they can't be wrong, but

622
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,200
that changed, especially when whole systems that were taken to be a priori were challenged,

623
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,680
and shown that there were alternatives to them, particularly when it was shown that there

624
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,440
could be non-Euclidean geometry.

625
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,680
Now if you want to look up what non-Euclidean geometry is, you can do that yourself, it's

626
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,760
pretty much the challenge to Euclid's fourth postulate, but more or less as a kind of rudimentary

627
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:11,540
explanation, the old geometry had pretty much assumed a flat 2D surface, but non-Euclidean

628
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,300
geometry can be done in 3D, in three dimensions, and it's not always based on the idea that

629
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:24,100
the 2D one was wrong, just that the two dimensional Euclidean geometry was perfectly fine for

630
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:30,020
cases where we were doing work on 2D surfaces, so conventionalism is a position that is meant

631
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,000
to deal with there being multiple a priori systems, and we just kind of select one, and

632
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,720
in fact we have already seen something like this in that logic video with Carnap, and

633
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,080
how we actually make different systems as useful for scientists, different logical systems,

634
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:52,160
but that did mean for Carnap that there were still practical constraints, namely is that

635
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,720
system actually useful for the scientist or not?

636
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,160
So it wasn't completely relativistic.

637
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,340
There were other problems though for the conventionalist, and some of those problems were pointed out

638
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
by Quine.

639
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,860
You see, Quine wanted to defend a logic as being particularly deep in the mind, and he

640
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,100
showed that the idea of consequence as used by the conventionalist is actually a part

641
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,380
of that logic, and so we kind of have a funny result, that in conventionalism we may have

642
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:25,700
it say that whenever there was a case type T, we apply convention C, and so we have

643
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:32,200
a case T, then using modus ponens, kind of like we did earlier in the video, we can conclude

644
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,480
to using convention C. That seems kind of clear, right?

645
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,320
But the funny thing is, what if the convention is modus ponens?

646
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:47,080
Then we're using modus ponens to employ modus ponens.

647
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,880
That's kind of like a funny cool move, Quine did.

648
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,760
So it seems at the upper level there are still some principles of logic which go outside

649
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,460
the bounds of conventionalism, and certainly this is Ogrady's kind of point in that logic

650
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:05,260
chapter too that he was trying to argue for, but what's happening at this upper apparatus,

651
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,500
he's going to argue for again at chapter 5, hint hint, it's rationality.

652
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,780
It's basically the system that's coming up all the time, that's what he's going to

653
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
talk about.

654
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,580
Anyway, Quine's system actually does away with the a priori completely then, and again

655
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,860
you can check out this video if you'd like an account of how that's happening, but Ogrady

656
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,080
points out problems with Quine as well, because it denies a meaning-belief distinction, and

657
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,120
meanings, for even terms where we don't even have experiences of them yet, still seem to

658
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,320
be important for philosophers.

659
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,200
Even if they're just temporarily set to see what their implications are, meanings can

660
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,880
change, but all the more useful to clarify what those meanings we set out are going to

661
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
be.

662
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,040
So Ogrady then presents what he calls a pragmatist a priori position.

663
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,900
Where instead of completely denying a priori beliefs, we actually do have or can make a

664
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,540
priori frameworks.

665
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,380
And they are distinct from what we can call a posteriori beliefs if you want, which is

666
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,660
the content within and of which that require this framework as a precondition for talking

667
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,980
about the world.

668
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,860
And he shows this distinction of what's the framework and what is the content within

669
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,540
the framework actually being used by many different philosophers who are widely different

670
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,480
in their philosophies such as Lewis, Karnap and Wittgenstein, and in a way appeasing all

671
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,680
the changes that happened through this entire lineage, he says that this framework can change,

672
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,760
that it's not infallible, but investigating these frameworks is central to philosophy.

673
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,440
There's no commitment to a single framework for all contexts, there can be different ones,

674
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,720
and even some things within a framework can eventually become a part of it.

675
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,240
But we have three questions for philosophers to investigate.

676
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,660
One, making sense of the notion of a framework itself.

677
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,020
Is it or how much of it is explicit or implicit, natural or artificial?

678
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,500
Two, is there a core framework that is universal?

679
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,940
And three, how do we judge among those frameworks themselves?

680
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,660
How does one judge a framework?

681
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,580
So Ogrady gives his answers to these three questions.

682
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,280
For that first question, making sense of the notion of a framework itself, he says these

683
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,680
frameworks are a tacit set of presupposition, and that the job for philosophers is to be

684
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,160
able to address and judge them.

685
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,200
Not just what their purposes serve, but the different kind of purposes we can even have

686
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,560
for them.

687
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,880
Doing these philosophers don't merely just point them out, that we do have such frameworks

688
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,240
and such preconceptions that are in play, but then after pointing them out we can actually

689
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,500
tinker with them and make adjustments to them, perhaps even make new ones or improve on them

690
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,340
for different purposes.

691
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,100
So I really enjoy Ogrady's input here, because in the end of this chapter he's making a

692
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:00,060
good case for philosophy itself and the kind of work it can do in a way that isn't within

693
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,480
the specter of Rorty's criticism, or those who think that all philosophy is somehow necessarily

694
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,260
tied to a kind of universal transcendent objective structure building in order to correspond

695
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,580
with mind independent reality.

696
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,800
And it also creates a new conception of the role of philosophy in a way that connects

697
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,120
to the lessons learned from Wittgenstein and Quine, but he also then goes on to promise

698
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,560
that in terms of this second question, if there is a universal framework, he will claim

699
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,440
that there is a universal framework always in play, or rather that, and I prefer rather

700
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:38,080
here, that what frameworks are can't be wholly different from each other, that there is something

701
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,820
shared among all of them, and he will call that the core rationality, which actually

702
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:49,220
has his principle of non-contradiction, and actually with that core rationality, we will

703
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,700
be able to do three, judge among them.

704
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,540
So he will cover that core rationality in his next chapter, and that's it for what

705
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,980
Ogrady says in Epistemology.

706
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:06,700
So there is relativism in a knowledge relative to a framework, and even those frameworks

707
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,400
can change and be different relative to different purposes, but as we shall see with Ogrady

708
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,080
in the next chapter, he will argue against it being extreme relativism, because there's

709
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,960
a limit on what these frameworks can even be, and what exactly that limit is, is shown

710
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,120
in his next chapter.

711
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,520
