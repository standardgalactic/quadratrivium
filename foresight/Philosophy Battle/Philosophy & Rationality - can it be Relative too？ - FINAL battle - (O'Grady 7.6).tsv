0	5120	Welcome back to Philosophy Battle. Today we will be paying witness to a great series of battles in philosophy,
5120	9920	where we're going to cover an attempt to show a universal conception of rationality.
9920	14960	But first, who would even believe there can be alternative rationalities in the first place?
14960	19120	That rationality could be relative. And what does that even mean?

24240	29200	And we'll show how philosopher Paul O'Grady will accommodate the relativism that is from
29200	34000	these sources away from being about rationality to showing they really just show support for
34000	38560	relativism in other areas of philosophy where he has already demonstrated being quite open to
38560	43920	relativism, such as conceptual relativity or ontological relativity. So because he's going
43920	48240	to do that kind of thing in the first section of this video, I think it's pretty important to
48240	53120	explain something first. I hope you don't mind. But if you don't know, this video is actually
53120	57120	the final big battle Paul O'Grady is going to have after covering relativism in many different
57120	63200	areas of philosophy in cognitive areas, not things like moral relativism, whether something's
63200	65040	right and wrong or beauty, if that's
