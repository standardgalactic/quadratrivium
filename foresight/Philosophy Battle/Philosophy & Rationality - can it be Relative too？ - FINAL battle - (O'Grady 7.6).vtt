Welcome back to Philosophy Battle. Today we will be paying witness to a great series of battles in philosophy,

00:05.120 --> 00:09.920
where we're going to cover an attempt to show a universal conception of rationality.

00:09.920 --> 00:14.960
But first, who would even believe there can be alternative rationalities in the first place?

00:14.960 --> 00:19.120
That rationality could be relative. And what does that even mean?

00:19.120 --> 00:24.240
We will discuss the major sources from where relativism about rationality even comes from.

00:24.240 --> 00:29.200
And we'll show how philosopher Paul O'Grady will accommodate the relativism that is from

00:29.200 --> 00:34.000
these sources away from being about rationality to showing they really just show support for

00:34.000 --> 00:38.560
relativism in other areas of philosophy where he has already demonstrated being quite open to

00:38.560 --> 00:43.920
relativism, such as conceptual relativity or ontological relativity. So because he's going

00:43.920 --> 00:48.240
to do that kind of thing in the first section of this video, I think it's pretty important to

00:48.240 --> 00:53.120
explain something first. I hope you don't mind. But if you don't know, this video is actually

00:53.120 --> 00:57.120
the final big battle Paul O'Grady is going to have after covering relativism in many different

00:57.120 --> 01:03.200
areas of philosophy in cognitive areas, not things like moral relativism, whether something's

01:03.200 --> 01:05.040
right and wrong or beauty, if that's
