That rationality could be relative. And what does that even mean?
We will discuss the major sources from where relativism about rationality even comes from.
And we'll show how philosopher Paul O'Grady will accommodate the relativism that is from
these sources away from being about rationality to showing they really just show support for
relativism in other areas of philosophy where he has already demonstrated being quite open to
relativism, such as conceptual relativity or ontological relativity. So because he's going

the final big battle Paul O'Grady is going to have after covering relativism in many different
areas of philosophy in cognitive areas, not things like moral relativism, whether something's
