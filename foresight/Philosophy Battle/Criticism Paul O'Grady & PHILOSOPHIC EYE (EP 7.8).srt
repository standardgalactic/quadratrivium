1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Hey again.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,360
So this video is about the criticism I have of Paulo Grady's book on relativism.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,240
So at very least a previous video with a summary of that book would be absolutely necessary

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
if you haven't watched the whole series.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,920
And I know it may have already implied this, but seriously, once criticism is likely to

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,280
have actual weight, at least weight enough to even bother replying to, only if one has

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,120
actually done the reading, or in this case, actually watches the video properly that indicates

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,880
there was an entire series.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,960
I really don't know what it is with the hubris of some of us to jump into like the 6th chapter

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,120
of a discussion and wonder why certain things are being spoken about or in a certain way

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,600
and why other things seem to be left out as if they hadn't been spoken about in great

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,360
depth in previous parts, or even ignoring how they were mentioned in that video itself

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,880
if it's watched well enough.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,200
I mean, it's certainly one thing not to know that there were previous parts if nobody mentioned

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
it, but if I'm going through the trouble of mentioning the previous videos which I pretty

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,760
much always do and even often give full recap of each video and I don't know what to say

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
about that.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:09,480
In any case, either way, this video is not going to be a great place for you to respond

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,440
to his arguments if I even bother mentioning them, it's just going to explain what actually

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,520
happened in his book Taken at Face Value.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,480
So my criticism today is about how he presents himself versus what the book actually says,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,920
in particular how open he presents himself to ontological relativism.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,000
That is, relativism about the world, the properties or the furniture of reality, the account of

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,440
the world that we have.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,760
He presents himself as very open, and I think he knows that if anyone attacks him, it would

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
be about ontology.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,320
I say this because he kind of predicts that one might say that his principles are said

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,600
to be universal, so don't they constitute an exception to ontological relativity?

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,960
But he clearly answers that these principles are abstractions, codifications of a practice

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,200
that we do, they aren't entities themselves, they don't have an ontological status of

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,520
being universally existing in all ontologies, so no, it's not an exception.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,440
Also by the way, they are abstracted principles, so it's not like they are written rules that

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,400
we observe and then follow.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,520
No such things are written down anywhere, that doesn't exist as an entity or anything

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
like he was saying.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,600
He is not even claiming that they are, it's just rather they articulate the nature of

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,040
that practice, which was the practice of being rational and deliberation, when we are thinking

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,200
about something, discussing it and judging, for example.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,160
So if you're thinking he's wrong about rationality because there aren't written rules

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,280
somewhere that are then followed, well that would be misunderstanding about what's going

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
on here.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,960
But more importantly, that's not what my issue is about at all.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,560
To understand my criticism, let's look at what he says about the structure of his book.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,960
At the very beginning of his book, he said, so the position staked out in this book is

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,800
one that denies relativism about truth, accepts a great deal of ontological relativity, and

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,080
a lesser amount of logical relativity resists radical epistemological relativity, and denies

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,360
relativism about reason.

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,680
So that's this kind of image that I made based on what he claimed, and I pretty much

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,680
showed an almost beginning of each of my videos.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,240
But then after going thoroughly through his book and seeing how the various areas connect,

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,880
we actually end up with a very different picture.

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,040
This picture.

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,040
And there is no greater difference among these two pictures than how he presents himself

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,080
in one as accepting a great deal of relativism in ontology, or defending it, or even argued

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,200
for relativism about ontology.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,280
Matter of fact, there's really only one place if I can recall where he uses a qualifier

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,360
of it being moderate.

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,040
But for the vast majority of cases, it's just open to ontological relativity, without

59
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,120
a distinction like moderate or limited or restricted or anything, distinctions that

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,600
he makes in other areas like logic or epistemology, but not in ontology.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,000
I mean after having gone through the book when we clearly look at the book, it's actually

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,360
his core rationality providing at very least a minimum restraint against extreme relativism

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,600
in every section.

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah, in truth it provides a place where it's completely denied, but that's given

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,280
the precondition described in the truth video if you do want to check it out.

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Either way, everywhere else, it's a minimum condition anyway.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Not like complete universal absolutism in some places and complete relativism in other places.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,840
No, in fact, even in rationality itself, if you look at the rationality chapter, it's

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,500
just a minimum core that is universal anyway.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,120
So he's actually open to relativism in all of these areas in a much greater sense than

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,520
the naivety of the traditional philosophers prior to him perhaps, but there is still a

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,880
minimum restriction in all of them and it's coming from his core rationality to everywhere

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,800
and as a result that makes him say it denies relativism, resisting radical relativism,

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,820
or that it only allows relativism in a very mitigated sense.

75
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,340
Then providing restriction and here's the contrast when it comes to ontology.

76
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,700
In the ontology chapter, not wanting to be charged as holding to Promethean anti-realism

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,220
and just making up whatever world we want as we go along, no restriction, but the ontological

78
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,300
relativist wants to hold that there are certain constraints on our thinking, we don't just

79
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,180
invent reality.

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,700
The realist is saying the constraint comes from the outside as in reality, that reality

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,140
constrains the theory of the world that we have at least to some degree, but the ontological

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,140
relativist for them, the discipline is an internal issue, not something imposed from

83
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,420
the outside.

84
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,900
Discipline and thought comes from proper methodology, from something such as a theory

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,500
of rational constraint, which is universal.

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,340
And that's his core figuring out here that he offers, in a way through epistemology.

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,940
In any case, it's pretty clear that there are restraints on ontology, certainly a variety

88
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,660
we are ruling out then is one that is the Promethean anti-realism, where we have no

89
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,860
restraint on our account of the world and we can just make up as we go along.

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,940
Someone might say though that that is the reason, because the restriction is internal

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,460
and not from a mind independent reality, that's why it's okay to just call it ontological

92
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,420
relativity and not mention any kind of qualifiers like limited or moderate or mitigated or anything

93
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
else.

94
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,300
But let's be clear about a few things first.

95
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,260
Firstly, there can be different levels of relativism within ontology, even if the extreme

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,860
one already has a name of Promethean anti-realism.

97
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,620
An example could be how we contrast the Strassonian limitation of cognitive capacities that we

98
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,380
have with Quine's seeming fluidity, or even actually contrasting the fluidity of Quine

99
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,620
with his later preference for a certain ontology, i.e. physics.

100
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,780
That was after all one of the tensions O'Grady points out in Quine's work.

101
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,380
So while they are of different strengths, they were all nevertheless internal restraints.

102
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,660
So a different degree of internal restraint does exist.

103
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,700
I mean, I think it's pretty clear if we are taking the ontological relativists at their

104
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,100
word and sourcing, or maybe outsourcing the restraint to epistemology, then there seems

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,900
to be a limitation depending on how much limitation there is in epistemology.

106
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,820
And there is certainly a limitation in epistemology according to O'Grady there, of different

107
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,940
degrees of how much relativism we could have in epistemology that we would select.

108
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,460
So why not by that nature say there are different degrees of limitation in ontology as well?

109
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,820
Certainly it wasn't complete relativism in epistemology.

110
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,700
There was a minimum restraint, that's why we called it moderate.

111
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,380
So then that should be worth noting that it means there is a restraint in ontology as

112
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
well.

113
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,380
It's precisely the reason why we mentioned it in truth, and in logic, and even in epistemology

114
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,060
where the restraint came from rationality.

115
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,940
That restraints do come in different strengths and are coming from another area still implies

116
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,380
that this area is restrained to different degrees, and that was a good enough reason

117
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,380
to still call it restraint against extreme relativism in other places like epistemology,

118
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,660
but he didn't do that for ontology.

119
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:14,020
Okay, so let's ask what does it mean to say that there is restraint if we did say it?

120
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,300
Well, one, for Ogrady it is possible that we may sometimes hold two sets of ontology

121
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
in tandem.

122
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,060
Two, Ogrady is open to the idea that worldviews can contradict.

123
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,760
After all, in the rationality chapter, when in discussion of how there can be different

124
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,180
empirically adequate metaphysical systems, he says, insofar as they, and he means chi

125
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,340
or the hopi metaphysical systems that he called absolutely developed worldviews, but

126
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,780
anyway, insofar as they are empirically adequate, they do not contradict empirical evidence.

127
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,740
However, they do cut against the materialistic or physicalistic metaphysics.

128
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,420
There is therefore an argument possible between two metaphysical systems.

129
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,100
So one, we can have two ontologies, two, they can contradict.

130
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,420
But also, three, one of them may be considered false.

131
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,100
They may be false.

132
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,820
So we can resolve this contradiction by considering one false.

133
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,340
So yeah, maybe it's not because of any metaphysical commitment to reality, but because of our

134
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,460
rational constraint that impacts what commitments we have to different ontologies.

135
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,940
Certainly he appears to admit that his core or his principles does govern our different

136
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,740
ontologies, as he says in his final chapter.

137
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,900
Whatever theory or ontology we deploy in interpreting and understanding reality is put together

138
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,020
under the governance of these principles.

139
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,700
So a certain kind of practice is regarded as universal, the practice of reasoning and

140
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
arguing.

141
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,060
This doesn't conflict with ontological relativism.

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,100
So here it is again, that he is saying in this line that it doesn't contradict with

143
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,780
ontological relativism because those principles aren't entities.

144
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,700
This line is after all taken from that exact same section earlier that I was quoting from

145
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,900
in the beginning, where he anticipated that kind of criticism, but at the same time he

146
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,660
is admitting here that our ontologies, and we can hold multiple, are governed by the principles

147
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,220
of core rationality.

148
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,420
But it's the same thing then as it was in logic or epistemology for example.

149
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,500
There is a core rationality that is governing there, and it was the basis by which we would

150
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,580
restrict against extreme relativism, carefully saying for logic that relativism would be

151
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,820
allowed but only in a mitigated sense, or in epistemology where it's by that restriction

152
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,540
just moderate epistemological relativism that is allowed.

153
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,940
So why is ontology being treated differently?

154
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,940
I mean it does mean something to mention that by rationality, even if not an appeal to external

155
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,580
mind-independent reality or anything, that we do rule against having contradictory ontologies,

156
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,060
or self-contradictory ontologies via our coherentist systems.

157
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,580
As such, valuing some, those with less contradiction, has greater than those with more contradictions,

158
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,560
so they're not equally viable.

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,940
As we examine them in our conscious deliberation, therefore not holding them as having equally

160
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,860
valuable status.

161
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Perhaps some are more and some are less contradictory with other ontologies that we hold in tandem,

162
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,100
or within its own subsystem.

163
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,060
There is work being done here by rationality or the principles to limit ontologies, and

164
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,240
such is admitted and explicated in different places, for example in the epistemology chapter

165
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,020
when talking about different coherentist system, how it is restricting against the proliferation

166
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,660
of infinite number of coherentist systems that we may hold.

167
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,020
Or in another part of epistemology, the end where rationality being the means by which

168
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,120
we judge different A priori frameworks, that was explicitly explained as well.

169
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,320
So it is explicated, but not exactly in the way I just did now before.

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,460
The thing is, I'm just doing a little bit of hypothetical syllogism, you know, putting

171
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,760
things together to show and explicate the constraint that is an ontology based on his

172
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
work.

173
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,040
I mean, it's his work that suggests that this is the case, that that's what we do

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,040
with ontologies, but he doesn't spell it out for us like this.

175
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,520
For some reason I have to do that here.

176
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,760
I mean, I agree with it, but it's coming from my explication here, not his, even if

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,120
it is based directly on his work.

178
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,720
So what I disagree with, and what would have become very obvious had he explicated what

179
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,700
I just did, is how there is no distinction being given in ontology like there is in other

180
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,580
places for limited ontological relativism, or mitigated ontological relativism, versus

181
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,180
extreme or radical or stronger ontological relativism by Ogrady, in the most of the cases

182
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,860
that he presents himself.

183
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,300
So there is enough in this book from the structure itself, what it purports to say, what is happening

184
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,140
between these various areas and how they function together to see that what is described as

185
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,580
happening in other areas is also happening in a similar fashion in ontology, but in ontology

186
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,080
being described in a different way.

187
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Why?

188
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Hmm?

189
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,240
Some manipulative reason perhaps?

190
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Hmmmm.

191
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,740
So the second part of my criticism is this kind of trick that seems to be happening.

192
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,680
I described it previously in the previous video how there's sort of different kind of relativists,

193
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,320
Which is in part what Ogrady is saying, we don't want to be a certain kind that is self-defeating.

194
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,160
But I suggested there's another kind which is one that doesn't know that stepping in

195
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,480
or pulling terms to avoid self-defeat still ends up in a place where they end up preventing

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,320
themselves from engagement.

197
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,800
As I mentioned, maybe in the previous video, this is what happened and this is the move

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,040
that was made against Barnes and Bloor, when they pulled terms using Mary Hess, I think,

199
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
with their balance of argument.

200
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,400
What you see the thing is, when Barnes and Bloor use terms like balance of argument or

201
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,080
empirical evidence, when they claim these things favor them and not the opposition, then they

202
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,880
obviously do mean them in a general sense outside of their position, or else there would

203
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,360
have been no efficacy in saying that they favored them in the first place.

204
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,400
And if not, there might be versions of balance of argument or empirical evidence that actually

205
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,400
weigh against them anyway, so there's no point in bringing up that theirs favor them.

206
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,540
And that's the reason why O'Grady says it seems clear that these terms are in fact intended

207
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,480
in a universal sense.

208
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,760
And it's not the only place where the effect of silence or lack of engagement is pointed

209
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,280
out when you pull terms like this, it happened in truth as well.

210
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,800
But it's being pointed out for O'Grady still is a reason to rule against relativism in

211
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,880
such places because of the effect of silence, since relativists do in fact want to engage

212
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
according to O'Grady.

213
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,440
So this technique didn't cut it for O'Grady in other places like truth or rationality.

214
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,760
But as I mentioned in the previous video, speaking in the ontology chapter itself about

215
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,040
one of the main ontological relativists discussed there, O'Grady says of Putnam, his argument

216
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,680
against extreme relativism is simply that it is self-refuting.

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,600
If one claims that each perspective is equally valid, then that very view is one among many

218
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,400
perspectives and it has no purchase on anyone else's position and may be safely ignored.

219
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,380
So the technique is mentioned there and why it doesn't work in ontology.

220
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,400
But to this, O'Grady just says that he will refer to other chapters and come back to what

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,080
epistemological or rational constraints can coexist with ontological relativism.

222
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,240
But first and foremost, he already did speak about the discipline coming from rationality

223
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
within this chapter, not really later.

224
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,920
But anyway, more importantly, it doesn't seem to even properly connect as a response

225
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
to what is said.

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,840
Why isn't the self-defeat or failure to engage rather nevertheless still pressed in response

227
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,960
to a relativist pulling terms in ontology like it is in other cases?

228
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,640
And they absolutely did do that in ontology.

229
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,240
The world, reality, ontology, properties, existence, all of it is pulled.

230
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,200
That was one of the main things that was done there in a way reducing ontology into epistemology.

231
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,360
It isn't clear why the restraint that is implied is only coexistence in ontology but

232
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
restriction in others.

233
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,960
So to make this clear about what I'm saying, just as I explained what restraint would mean

234
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,680
if it were explained in ontology, let me explain what would have happened if he didn't allow

235
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
this technique to work in ontology.

236
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,200
Ontology is relative.

237
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,920
Is itself a specific ontological view?

238
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,560
To say that we create our worldviews relative to our conceptual scheme is itself a worldview.

239
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,040
And it is being said as if in a non-relative sense.

240
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,240
It is being said as if in a general sense that is at least in a way that would oppose

241
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,760
other ontologies such as one that says, for example, our account of the world is taken

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,280
directly from the properties of the world itself.

243
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,440
That's being opposed here.

244
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,680
To say our account of the world is exclusively relative to our internal working since there

245
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,240
is no meaning in speaking of an external influence is itself a claim about what is the case with

246
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
the accounts.

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,280
So we see this kind of counter in other areas but it's not being utilized here, biogradie,

248
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,960
and described as preventing extreme or radical ontological relativism.

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,240
If I may use some example, we pressed self-defeat in epistemology.

250
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,840
Each epoch judges itself.

251
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,600
One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they

252
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,160
seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.

253
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,080
One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared

254
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,480
among all of them, that one cannot judge among them, but in doing so they are speaking about

255
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,840
all of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common

256
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,280
and so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing

257
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
what they claim shouldn't be possible.

258
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,920
Or to defend Kuhn from being interpreted as using global K.I.

259
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,480
But Kuhn's own work itself shows that it is not global M.I. or K.I., or also would

260
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,440
have undermined his own work.

261
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
We saw this with Wartian Stitch and B.M.B.

262
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,480
Kuhn's work is describing different paradigms, as if from the outside of them.

263
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,440
If the claim is that terms cannot be understood outside the paradigm in which they are used,

264
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,320
then one cannot compare paradigms in the way Kuhn has done, or even used against McIntyre.

265
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
He says a significant challenge to universalism about rationality comes from McIntyre, who

266
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,960
espouses that there are different traditions of thought that embody their own criteria

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,280
of rationality and no neutral ground to evaluate them.

268
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,640
First off, the self-defeat, like we have seen many times now.

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,120
A quick response is to wonder which tradition McIntyre inhabits and how he manages to discuss

270
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,080
and evaluate the ideas of so many people from other apparently incommensurable traditions.

271
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,520
There are various areas where we notice the relativists are doing what they say they cannot

272
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,160
do, in order for them to take a position on matters where they are saying you can't take

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
a position.

274
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,280
But it isn't being used here in ontology to catch or prevent an extreme ontological

275
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,340
relativist in the ways that O'Grady suggests could happen in other places.

276
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
So why is he doing this?

277
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
Is he actually being tricked here or making a mistake, goofing up?

278
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,200
Well, I'm not capable of pointing out such an error, surely.

279
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,920
I am after all just a shadowy internet character after all.

280
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,640
But if I am right, then perhaps this was done on purpose.

281
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,080
Perhaps he is simply allowing for such a technique to work here and purposely portraying himself

282
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,220
as being more open than other areas to ontological relativism.

283
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
But why?

284
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,820
Why would he do that?

285
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,260
Why is ontological relativism getting such special treatment?

286
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,340
Well now, I made, if I think of it possibly, even a distasteful charge against O'Grady

287
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,140
at the end of the ontology video.

288
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,900
So I'm sorry that it is that way.

289
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Again, it's probably my lack of understanding.

290
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,700
You know, my error here.

291
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,820
Surely it must be that.

292
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,380
But I think O'Grady absolutely does have enough tools in his arsenal within his book

293
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,660
to actually and has actually defended against ontological relativism of an extreme variety

294
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,380
in three different ways.

295
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,820
I have only presented two so far and the third one will come after this conclusion.

296
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,340
But instead he is purposely portraying himself as open to relativism in ontology just to

297
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,620
placate relativists.

298
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,580
By having an area they feel they are on good footing, a way of funneling relativists to

299
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,020
ontology away from other areas.

300
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,860
I'm actually prompted by him to see this as his motivation because of his insistence

301
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,660
that this is the best way to accommodate relativists.

302
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,460
About ontological relativism, he says at the very end of the ontological chapter, it appears

303
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,580
to be one of the best ways those attracted to the relativistic ideas can accommodate

304
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,460
that relativism.

305
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,580
And near the end of the book he says, much of what motivates people to accept relativism

306
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,660
can be accommodated by ontological relativism.

307
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,500
So in a way it appears that he's actually just placating relativists by not talking

308
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,700
about how he has actually restricted against ontological relativism in a number of ways.

309
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,540
So to be clear, I'm not disagreeing with him about the funneling, I agree with him

310
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,900
that many arguments for relativism, let's say in rationality for example, are only ever

311
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,780
really about conceptual or ontological relativity anyway when you actually analyze them.

312
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,780
And many relativists don't seem to recognize this because they're not very clear on which

313
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,020
relativism they're even talking about especially when they're presenting arguments.

314
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,540
And that's pointed out both by O'Grady and Philips, they talk about this kind of thing

315
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,300
but that's another thing anyway.

316
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,100
My issue here or claim is that while funneling into ontological relativism, he won't actually

317
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,180
mention that even in that area it is also just moderate relativism or restricted or

318
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,620
mitigated relativism.

319
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,820
Instead he portrays it as if his book is just openly accepting ontological relativism period

320
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,820
or just tentatively because he's not ruling against one way or another.

321
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,900
So I'm saying I think he does this on purpose to make the funneling just seem more acceptable

322
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,980
for the relativist, more appealing to do so, in a way purposely hiding the restrictions

323
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
that are in that area as well.

324
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,300
But you know, holding back attacks or defenses, just to make victories of yours in other areas

325
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,220
seem more acceptable to your opponents, which is a very maybe kind thing to do, I don't

326
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,460
know about emotions, but it does seem more like a psychological trick, a manipulative

327
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,900
technique played on the relativist than honest philosophic work.

328
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,220
Wow, are you saying O'Grady is being dishonest somehow?

329
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,660
That's not cool man, why would you say that?

330
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,820
Look, yeah I know, I know, okay listen, I don't know how else to feel about it though.

331
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,180
You know I very much love this book, it's very rich in texture, it goes through many

332
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,740
different philosophical discussions and discusses relativism in a very impactful way and that's

333
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,540
why I think there are such good lessons we can take from this book.

334
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,780
Even though I think there's a lot missing too.

335
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,380
But my issue would be that his stance ultimately leaves the work of discussing the role of

336
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,580
reality out and maybe we can talk about that more with Philips, but even that is a different

337
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,860
issue from what I'm actually criticizing here, based on his book, if we take it at face value.

338
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,580
And really my criticism isn't that massive in terms of his philosophy, which is largely

339
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,180
something I agree with, even if it is excluding or leaving open the discussion of reality playing

340
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,420
an important role in what we count as or think of as true or knowledge or facts.

341
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,840
In comparison to that, this is really a rather small criticism perhaps of just representing

342
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,340
oneself differently than one's work actually seems to be, so it could be an error in me

343
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,380
which is fine, I hope it is, but if it isn't then it's either some kind of error in his

344
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,900
work or purposely done.

345
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,300
It can't strictly be an error though because my criticism is about the way he's portraying

346
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,020
himself and I just find it misleading.

347
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,460
There is enough in his work to make movements against ontological relativism despite what

348
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,660
he says.

349
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,340
So again, my assessment is that O'Grady presents himself as much more relativistic than he

350
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,660
actually is based on the structure of his book, techniques of relativists that failed

351
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,580
in other areas but seem to work here, as well as one more reason that I'm going to cover.

352
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,100
I would agree with him that the middle ground is what this book is and I agree that the

353
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,620
middle ground between the extremes is a result of a more philosophically aware path and a

354
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,060
path of the future in philosophy.

355
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,020
And while this book is a little more favorably open to anti-realist philosophy than my position

356
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,860
would be, it's where he claims he lands on the middle path that does not seem to me to

357
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,060
be where the book itself actually is saying it is.

358
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,460
But now let's look at the most important component of my criticism that speaks about

359
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,420
ontology anyway and it will lead us into a discussion about what is left out in this

360
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,140
book.

361
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,220
You see this whole book, it's best case for the universal hinges on non-contradiction

362
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,940
and I doubt saying that is controversial at all.

363
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,820
And now we're going to see a little funny thing that can happen in philosophy, much

364
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,340
like it happened to Coon with just a few lines from his work leading to radical interpretation

365
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
as we have seen in the rationality video.

366
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,820
Well in this case it's a few words that O'Grady says when explaining assertion that

367
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,500
impacts a truth deeper than he discussed.

368
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,260
You see the argument for the principle of non-contradiction actually goes like this.

369
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,020
The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of

370
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,220
assertion and negation.

371
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,900
When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content, and then endorses

372
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,460
it as true.

373
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,700
This content holds that something in the world is in such a way.

374
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,700
Assertion also rules out various other things, namely the negation of that assertion.

375
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,140
So assertion implies the rejection of the negation of the assertion.

376
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,940
But a contradiction makes an assertion and simultaneously asserts the negation of that

377
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,580
first assertion.

378
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,980
Because of this, a contradiction undermines the very process of making an assertion.

379
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,300
To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.

380
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,260
Hence, contradictions must be avoided.

381
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:21,060
So the principle of non-contradiction is itself being defended in order to preserve the very

382
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,900
act of assertion, also negation.

383
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,900
So again despite what I am saying next, this defense is not about esoteric objective assumptions

384
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,020
or whatever have you assumptions about an ignorant or naive realist, that would be after

385
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,940
all a derogatory description and a philosophic failure to grasp the argument that's happening

386
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,340
here that Ogrady is offering.

387
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,300
The defense is actually based on what it even means to say anything meaningfully.

388
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,140
But that means it is actually the nature of assertion first that is really doing the work.

389
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,940
And thus why we cannot have contradiction, because it would undermine the very process

390
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,260
of assertion according to him.

391
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,420
So let's focus on assertion and ask again, what does assertion even mean according to

392
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
Ogrady?

393
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,140
How do we cash out this concept of assertion?

394
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,940
So I am going to read it again but slowly so we can really figure out what I am trying

395
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,420
to say here.

396
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:22,460
When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content and endorses it as true.

397
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,980
Now the word true here, I am just going to leave alone.

398
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,420
I don't even think he needed to bring that up because it may introduce some questions

399
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,140
that he may not have wanted at that point in time.

400
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,060
But anyway that's not what I am doing.

401
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,900
I wonder what is expresses a content?

402
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
What is this content?

403
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:46,700
Well he says this content holds that something in the world is in such a way.

404
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:53,460
This line itself describes that assertion as fundamentally making an ontological claim,

405
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,500
a claim about the world.

406
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,900
The very act of assertion is actually inherently tied into issues of ontology to say that the

407
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:07,260
world is a certain way, in such a way.

408
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,980
That is the nature of all assertion and it may take some philosophic reflection to realize

409
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,460
it that there is an implicit claim about how things are and when we bother to say how things

410
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,380
are however qualified it is, there is some connection to a certain way in the general

411
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
sense.

412
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,140
We couple this with his explication of how we cannot escape the notion of general truth.

413
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,740
In all claims of speaking, even when you are talking about yourself, your sense, your feelings,

414
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,860
is an attempt to state reality as being in such a way.

415
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,020
However fallible and unjustified, this attempt to do so is a necessary component.

416
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,860
All claims involve content that is conversationally intended to be about the world being a certain

417
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,180
way, stating what is the case in such a way that rules out the opposite of what one is

418
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,820
saying.

419
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,060
This is the philosophic eye, the recognition of what it even means to take a position,

420
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,620
to make an assertion, to speak of anything in any field.

421
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,100
That's why I sometimes call it metaphysical.

422
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,700
I'm not saying the eye exists as an entity somewhere ontologically, there's no magical

423
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,180
spiritual superpowers I'm talking about here.

424
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:22,420
I'm just theatrically presenting this philosophic awareness as an eye, an eye for its recognition

425
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,580
that philosophers recognize certain necessities in order to take a position at all.

426
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,180
And so this eye would activate or just notice and recognize that one is trying to take a

427
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,140
position that would undermine doing so.

428
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,460
Let's look at some of that activation.

429
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,580
No one can say anything at all.

430
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,500
Then how did you say that?

431
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,340
No one should be denied at all.

432
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,020
So aren't you denying those who would deny?

433
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,460
We can only speak about ourselves.

434
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,140
Then how are you speaking about others now?

435
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,260
I disagree with the idea that disagreement is possible.

436
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,660
Then how are you disagreeing?

437
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,660
No one can speak in the general sense.

438
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,540
Then why is that in the general sense?

439
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,140
No one can objectively evaluate.

440
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,260
Then how did you make that evaluation?

441
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,300
We should no longer take any philosophic positions.

442
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,300
That is itself a philosophic position.

443
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,420
Philosophy is garbage and pointless.

444
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,380
Is itself your philosophic position?

445
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,820
Philosophy is garbage and science is the best.

446
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,900
That itself is philosophy, philosophy of science.

447
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,340
Talking with any authority is not possible.

448
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,180
And what's your authority behind saying that?

449
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,100
Whether it's based on reason or evidence, empirical structures, logic, whatever it is,

450
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,700
however which way we feel the need then or ability to participate in the battlefield,

451
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,940
that becomes something that shouldn't also at the same time be at risk when we are there,

452
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,460
at very least, by us.

453
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,060
So do not be tricked by the extreme relativists to shoulder the burden of providing something

454
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:13,580
impossible in objective language or in objective observation or absolute anything.

455
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,820
They are powerful enough to attack anything that comes across them in a certain way and

456
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,420
that's the way that they're going to continue to emphasize and always see.

457
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,540
And so they will claim that everything is relative ignoring the assumptions made in

458
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,980
their own claim.

459
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,700
There is a necessary assumption that something of what I bothered to say when I make an assertion

460
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,700
about how things are, whether currently or forever inexplicable or not, conveys something

461
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:44,220
about reality beyond the individual speaking and taking a stance in order to engage.

462
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,620
That even if a proposition is completely relative, in that the proposition is relative to many

463
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
factors.

464
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,100
Sure, but there is an assumption that one of those things that it is relative to is

465
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,620
a shared reality as a medium to whomever I am speaking with.

466
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,420
That there is something of my assertion that has to do with how the world is in a certain

467
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,140
way, beyond that which is created by my mind alone and thus ruling out the opposite way

468
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,940
at the same time.

469
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,380
This section of this video, the philosophic eye, I would like you to couple with my video,

470
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,300
the my move video which is a part of the Kirk series so you may have to watch the Kirk series

471
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,580
to really appreciate it.

472
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,460
But if you connect the my move video from that series with this part of this video, I would

473
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,460
really appreciate it, please maybe rewatch that one or check it out or something, but

474
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,780
you will see how there is a deep, socially ethical aspect of this as well.

475
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,140
And there certainly is these kind of social and ethical aspects which O'Grady doesn't

476
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,340
do too much a discussion of, but we will get to next.

477
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,220
But as a preview, the more powerful relativists often discussed here in O'Grady's version

478
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,540
use philosophies to talk about how things are relative to a society, to a community.

479
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,780
But in such a view, the existence of a society or the community is implicit in such a philosophy

480
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,220
and so it is not in question.

481
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,020
And in a way that definitely would contradict the individualist based extreme relativists.

482
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,780
Even though they don't really account for that, I've encountered some people who would

483
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,820
immediately agree with, as I say, any kind of relativism, so they would immediately agree

484
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:22,260
with extreme individualistic based relativism even though that relativism may be in contradiction

485
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,220
with community based relativisms which are the more powerful varieties, seemingly ones

486
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,940
that are based on actual philosophers' writings in history and so on.

487
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Anyway, the move to more powerful relativism then definitely makes it even more favorable,

488
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,220
the kind of point I was making there, that it will connect important ways to the point

489
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,220
I made about the conversational standards of behaving as if committed to a metaphysical

490
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,580
reality of another's existence and the independent agency of others outside of you and your own

491
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,380
personal perception.

492
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:01,260
Now of course relativists may say, oh, okay, so it's just a necessary assumption for conversations.

493
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,500
So what?

494
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,180
That doesn't really mean there is a mind-independent reality, let alone any argument for the ability

495
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,900
for our language to convey non-relative reality.

496
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,420
So really, reality is still relative.

497
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:23,540
Well, welcome back relativists to the realist world where conversational standards don't

498
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,700
hold light against our concern for what really is the case.

499
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,060
That's actually a deep cut if you get what was done in ontology, so I hope you get the

500
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,420
joke because, you know, they were trying to pull terms in an important way and try to

501
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,380
make things more about the conversational standards rather than a discussion of metaphysical

502
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,860
reality beyond them, but that move really didn't help them and that's part of basically

503
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,820
the reason why I think this book is so good, because it connected the principle of non-contradiction

504
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,580
to the nature of assertion, the nature of communicating with others rather than what

505
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,340
is typically assumed, you know, metaphysical commitments, philosophers, traditional stuff.

506
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,220
Anyway, it's still rather important to note that many of the elements aren't made by

507
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,860
O'Grady or myself, they have been around for a while as I mentioned self-defeat and

508
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,180
incoherence of certain forms of relativism have been known for thousands of years, even

509
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,260
to many well-known relativists themselves and even this connection of the defense based

510
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,340
on assertion rather than a transcendental structure building you could actually see

511
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,580
in the positivist's writing, which O'Grady was probably heavily influenced by given he

512
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,900
wrote a whole book about him, but it's how O'Grady wrote it and put it all together

513
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,500
in the various fields that I really liked and yet for maybe that exact same reason of

514
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,220
the positivist's influence he didn't really draw out or address the ontological implications

515
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,500
and so that may be the tension of his own work for claiming to be open to ontological

516
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,140
relativism a great deal.

517
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,860
Let me give you some of my closing remarks now.

518
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,980
There are more criticisms I could have of O'Grady of course and I do have, but those

519
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,340
are mainly about what is left out and that being a discussion at least of Wittgenstein

520
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,800
in a more general sense that was mostly absent if not soft in this book.

521
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,780
This book was more kind of quine heavy and ironically I think it could have explicated

522
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,780
a more middle ground or more nuanced position if we could have actually taken a closer look

523
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,980
at Wittgenstein.

524
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,460
It really does highlight the difference between someone who thinks Wittgenstein's philosophy

525
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,820
leads to some radical relativism and someone who understands how that isn't so at all

526
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,460
as Patrick Phillips may say does violence to the spirit of Wittgenstein.

527
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,820
Phillips specifically looks closely at Wittgenstein and uproots misinterpretations of him from

528
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,060
relativistic thinkers, but hey O'Grady said he was on the one hand trying to be general

529
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,560
and cover a more broad range of things and a more surfaced way even though this is definitely

530
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,980
far too textured for somebody new to philosophy.

531
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,360
Anyway, it's still rather clear that if you were trying to give a full treatment of relativism

532
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,420
everywhere then this book would be way freaking massive, so I'm glad it's not.

533
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,800
Anyway, so that's my criticism and the explanation of the power that I promised you.

534
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,620
You may agree with O'Grady or disagree in ways that I have about what is necessary in

535
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,020
order to take a position at all.

536
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,420
But the power is at very least to recognize that there is something necessary and therefore

537
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,740
not relative in order to take a position at all or at least is necessary for those who

538
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,580
are in combat or in conversation or sharing among each other in a shared way.

539
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,820
And your philosophic eye will hopefully now activate whenever you hear someone or some

540
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,940
other warrior saying or doing something on the basis of what they are attacking.

541
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,680
So we're going to Phillips next and I have spoken a lot about him already, you know without

542
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,200
perfect citations, so forgive me for that, I'll get to it when I do cover him.

543
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,080
But when we do get to it, we are going to be forced into talking about some politics

544
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,880
and there's some politically related stuff in this philosophy.

545
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,360
But please understand that a far more nuanced understanding elevates a conversation philosophically

546
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,400
from kind of typical tribalistic political talk is definitely more complicated than the

547
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,680
reductive simplicity that would aid tribalism a lot in any case.

548
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,600
I will be clear about what I'm saying later if it hasn't already been made to some of

549
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,260
us, I know there are a number of places where I've given like clues.

550
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,440
Join us, good warrior, for we travel now to see the insights of Patrick J.J. Phillips.

551
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,160
Then finally, after all this time, return to the battlefield of fellow sigh, philosophy

552
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,800
of science, and explain how these science wars are impacting the world to this very

553
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
day.

554
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,880
Oh, and I'm sorry I never actually properly covered Davidson, Davidson versus Ogrady is

555
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,520
something that I said I would do and something that Ogrady talked about in this book and

556
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,080
so I never really covered it.

557
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm actually very attracted to some of Davidson's arguments, so maybe one day I can cover specifically

558
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,920
Ogrady versus Davidson after I take a closer look at Davidson directly instead of just

559
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,280
relying on what Ogrady says, because right now I can't recall from Davidson what Ogrady

560
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,160
says and what he was referring to.

561
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,160
But you know, there's also so much I promise to do, I pop anyway.
