00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Philosophy Battle, the most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet, probably.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Now, entering the battlefield of metaphysics.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Hey everyone, my name is AJ and welcome to Philosophy Battle.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
Before this video starts, I want to make clear this video will introduce ontology, what it is and to what degree it can be relative.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
It is after all important to investigate because it matters if there are actual legitimate grounds

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
as to why someone might say we live in different worlds so you can't support or criticize one another.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Like, how exactly do we live in different worlds?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
And how extreme can that claim actually be meant?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
But it will actually lead us into an exciting discussion about realism and anti-realism in philosophy.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Trust me, it's gonna be awesome.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
It's one of my favorite things to talk about in philosophy, so I may be a little bit theatrical at times.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
We will be discussing pre and post Kantian views and well, it can be treacherous grounds,

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
so if you don't get certain parts or get lost or don't know what's going on, don't worry about it too much.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Just be patient as it could very well be cleared up later and the point at the end will be made pretty clear, at least I think so.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
The video is generally covering the discussion as it is presented in a book of a philosopher, Paul O'Grady, a pretty recent work

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
because I felt his book has a lot of great and interesting battles in it as well as some important lessons for us.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
Now, I may end up saying this again a little bit later after I do a sort of recap into the video, so forgive me if this is repeated,

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
but if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having here, that's okay.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
You don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to, even if I'm suggesting another video in this video.

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
Just take it more as a signpost, even an important signpost possibly if you want more information if I suggest other videos at various points, which I will.

01:58.000 --> 02:10.000
I believe this will be a good video regardless for introducing one of the main problems in metaphysics about ontology or even in philosophy itself, so let's start the video.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Ontological Relativism

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
What is it and why are we talking about it?

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, ontology is a field of study under the branch of philosophy called metaphysics, so we're doing philosophy and we're having a metaphysical discussion.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
A discussion about what though?

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Ontology is a discussion about what there is, what kind of things exist in the world and what the world is fundamentally made of

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
or what kind of properties are a part of the world.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
So for example, believing there is only matter in the world that the world is just made up of matter only.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
That's your ontological position.

02:47.000 --> 02:56.000
Or if you think the world is made up of ideas, which includes these senses, you know, like the sense of touch and the sense of color, the sense of smells and so on.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
All of these just being ideas coming to your mind and so the world is just that.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
The world is just made up of ideas and maybe minds that give and receive ideas.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
That would be an idealist ontology.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
Or even if your view of the world is that there's earth and there's heaven and hell, that too is your ontological position.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
A position about what there is in the world, what exists.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Though that has some religious connotations and we're not discussing religious views here.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
This is not about religion.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
We're just having a discussion about what there is in the world.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And this conception seems to have a view that the world has different planes of existence.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Perhaps for someone it's not about heaven and earth, but about universal forms and particular manifestations of that.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
All of these fit within the field of ontology.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
So perhaps in some sense, if we can just crudely say epistemology is about knowledge, then ontology would be about the world.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Or reality.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
While people may have different views about what the world is fundamentally made of or what kind of structure reality really has,

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
our question today is about whether the world or reality is relative.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
Now we commonly already are relativists about a number of things, not just things like taste in music or preference in Pokemon.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
But even in descriptions of physical things, like things being big, such descriptions are known to be relative.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
The bird is big compared to the ant.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But compared to the tree, it's not.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
The tree is actually big compared to the bird.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
But compared to the mountain, it's not.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
The mountain is actually big compared to the tree.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And so on.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Big is a relative description.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
In fact, if you imagine this self illuminated cube were the only thing in the universe, nothing else,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
not even the edges of the screen as you look at it,

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
then there's no way of knowing if it's big or small.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
Without anything to compare it to, calling it big is meaningless.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
An empty idea.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
And so there's no point here in talking about it like it could even be considered big.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
So what if the world, reality itself, is relative?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
What if our ontology is relative?

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Wait, relative to what?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Well, guess what, we actually came here to the battlefield of metaphysics

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
just to discuss the power and limits of this philosophic weapon called relativism.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Why?

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Because we actually came from the battlefield of the philosophy of science,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
where we had encountered some enemies wielding this weapon to extreme degrees.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
So because of that, I thought it would be beneficial to come here to the battlefield of metaphysics

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
just to dismantle this weapon.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
To show its power and limits.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So while there are a few books I may cover,

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
currently I'm covering this topic mostly based on the writings of philosopher Paul O'Grady

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
in this green book called relativism.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
In his book, he covers a variety of different philosophic areas to discuss relativism.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
He's not going to be discussing ethics or morals, you know, what's right and wrong,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
or aesthetics, like what counts as beautiful.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
But he's more interested in cognitive things like truth and reality and knowledge

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
if even those things can be considered relative.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So after explaining the power of relativism, which is a wickedly powerful weapon,

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
he then goes on to defend against relativization in two areas.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
He battles against relativization on truth and on rationality.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
So I made a video covering his first chapter that I phrase as covering the power of relativism.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's my phrasing though.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And I would really insist that you watch that video,

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
especially before thinking that one can just offhand dismiss this enemy.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
If you think it's obvious or evident that relativism is wrong for any reason,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I put a lot of work into this video and I think you should definitely check it out

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
because it will definitely pay for any good philosopher who wants to conceptually grip

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
what the issue really is in order to understand the power of this weapon.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Not just in the sense to be able to dismantle our enemy to point out the flaws in their strategy,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
but also as a weapon to be wielded by us ourselves

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
in order to challenge anywhere that there are baseless assumptions of objectivity

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
or naive thoughts about what's obvious and evident.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
On the other hand, this weapon does have limits that our enemies did not appear to be aware of.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
The dangers of thinking everything is relative.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
So we already covered the great and totally awesome battle

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
where Paul O'Grady defended truth against relativism.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And please go check out that video.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
It's definitely one of my favorite battles of all time

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
and certainly has important lessons that can go along with us in our philosophic journey forever, probably, I don't know.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
But he did also use a kind of principle of logic in order to make that defense

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
and so it kind of made sense that in that first chapter he did also talk about whether logic itself can be relative.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
So I guess I also therefore thought important to cover that topic

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
and made a video discussing logic itself.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
Logic in the way that philosophers or logicians or kind of I guess also mathematicians know it.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
This is looking at formal symbolic logic and really offers a much more in-depth understanding

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
of what logic is than the common person or lay person does.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
It certainly goes beyond the mere rhetoric of political pundits online, for example.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
There, however, Paul O'Grady did actually allow relativism

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
that we did seem to accept relativism in logic

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
but only in terms of a lower order.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
That there seemed to be a higher order and a lower one

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
in the higher order there still seems to have maintained certain principles of logic

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
of which hasn't truly been argued for yet.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
It will be argued for in that chapter 5, the next battle.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
So I wanted to skip to that rationality battle

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
because I only came here to the battlefield of metaphysics

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
to discuss the power and limits of this weapon.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Having already covered the power, I only wanted to cover the limits

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
the places where he defends clearly against relativization.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
But I kind of noticed that in that area of rationality

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Paul O'Grady does seem to have certain strategies and techniques

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
that make reference to these previous chapters.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
So it would leave something wanting if I didn't at least somehow explain

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
what's going on in these other areas.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
So I thought it important to at least kind of cover what's happening over here

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
since it is part of his strategy in rationality.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
But this video is going to be way different from what I normally do.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
You see normally I cite everything I say down to the line

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
when I'm covering some philosophers writing.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
But today I'm not really going to be covering Paul O'Grady that closely.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm just going to give a more general description of what's going on in ontology in some way.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
So it's going to be much less structured and less scripted

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
since there's not much citation that I'm going to be giving anymore.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
You see that kind of line to line citation that I was giving before

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
actually provided some kind of order and script

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
even though I don't ever use a kind of proper script

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
the kind of citation was still giving me a kind of order for my videos.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
But without it this is much less scripted than my normal videos

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
so forgive me for that.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
But nevertheless I will still try to present sort of what his framing

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
of the main battles and the main issues are in this chapter

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
as he presents it kind of.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Though I will still be clear about certain things that are framed in his way

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
versus things that are framed from me.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm just not actually going to be covering either of these chapters

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
like fully or in depth as I did the other battles

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
where the battles are happening that I'm interested in.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
In any case I will come back to talk about this chapter maybe later

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
when I kind of finish off doing Paul O'Grady

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
and want to give a full evaluation of this book.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
There's a reason why this chapter in particular is something that I might want to talk to

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
in more depth or detail in the future.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And I'll talk about what that reason is.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
In any case the point of this video is just to generally cover ontological relativism

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
and the kind of issues that are happening here

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
the sort of battles that are going on

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
in the more modern type of take

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
both as O'Grady frames it and as I would

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
and then we'll just discuss where O'Grady lands on this issue going forward.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
So if you don't know who O'Grady is or anyone else don't worry about it.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
If you're here just to talk about ontological relativism

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
this video will still be very helpful

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
at least giving a kind of outlay of the kind of battle that's going on

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and the different issues and different perspectives

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
that come to conflict with each other.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Okay?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Let's go.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
As already discussed in the Power of Relativism episode

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
O'Grady points out a pre and post Kantian view

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
and don't let those words be spooky.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'll explain them.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Basically back in the pre Kantian

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
or Kant days there was this kind of image

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
the idea that there was the world and us

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
or our mind

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
and we have beliefs and propositions

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
or observations about the world

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
the world as it is

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
so ontology was about that

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
the world that would be a certain way

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
even if we aren't there with our observations

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
beliefs or thoughts

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
so like the tree is here

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
not there

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
the mountain is denser than the clouds

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
et cetera et cetera

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
that the world independent of our minds is

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
and is a certain way

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
the world that would be that way

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
even if no humans existed

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
even if all species capable of having beliefs

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and observations had gone extinct

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
the world in of itself

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
not relative to someone's perspective

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
would be there and be a certain way

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
so that's more of a pre Kantian kind of picture

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and while we can all have different kind of ontological beliefs

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
about what that world is like

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
there still seem to be some agreement pre Kant

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
that that's what we were talking about

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
but then Kant came along

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and he done messed that whole thing up

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
he changed the game for real

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and now we have this new picture

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
where this world that we observe

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
that we have beliefs about

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
or thoughts of and make propositions about

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
is actually constructed in part by our minds

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
the mind by our categories of understanding

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
as Kant call them

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
needs to give shape to whatever it is that's out there

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
to make a world that is even understandable by us

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
in this sense we never directly observe reality itself

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
we can never really know in any way or form

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
what this outside stuff is

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
or anything about it

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
even possibly that it exists

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
so I represent it as this gray mush

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
but really I can't say it's gray

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
or say that it's mush

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I can't really say anything at all

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
but I'm using this as a visual

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
just to show that the concepts of color or shape

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
that would come from us and our minds have not applied here

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
in fact Robert Kirk calls this cosmic porridge

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
and this is not that I or Kirk are advocating

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
that this is what reality really is

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
in fact Kirk argues against this cosmic porridge kind of picture

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
because as a realist we want there to be something

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
and that this something is a certain way

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
not that it's merely some indistinct gray mush

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
anyway we'll get back to that

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
you see Kant had these universal categories

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
that everyone's mind has

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
that structures the world as it is to us

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
as it must be to us

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
that ontology wasn't about the world

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
independent of the mind

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
but the world as it is known by us

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
as it is observed by us

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
for example when it comes to the understanding

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
of bodies actually existing in our world

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
we have this kind of structure of understanding

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
that a body must have extension in the three dimensions

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
and if it really is existing

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
perhaps extension within the fourth dimension of time as well

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
or perhaps we can think of it kind of like as a net

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
that applied from our mind results in producing

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
the kind of things that we have contact with

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
now those are different kind of takes about what's going on

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
but in general this is a post Kantian picture

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
however to have a better understanding about how it is

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
that our concepts or the structure of our mind

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
is actually structuring the world as we observe it

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
as we make sense of it or understand or think about it

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
please check out that power of relativism video

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
it will give a much more detailed discussion

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
about how the mind is in some sense constructing

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
and if perhaps you are just more specifically concerned

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
about science

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
you can maybe check out my video on the philosopher

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and historian of science Thomas Kuhn

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
one video is his response to his predecessor Carl Popper

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
and the other one is a video I made

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
to explain how Kuhn's philosophy opened the gates

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
to those who wanted to bring this weapon

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
and make charges of relativism against even science

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
so if you're kind of more interested in that sort of construction

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
and the kind of relativization of even observation

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
you can go check out those videos

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
however while we're here in ontology though

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
let's continue with our discussion

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
in this case the world that we can know, speak of

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
or observe is only one that can exist

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
within the framework of our conceptual scheme

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
or categories or paradigm

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
or any other name used to describe how it is that our mind

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
is constructing the meaning of the world as we observe it

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
we have no access to this outside stuff

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
and because of this depending on who you ask

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
not only does it make no sense to talk about

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
whatever the outside is

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
it doesn't even make sense to say it exists

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
and I know that sounds kind of strange

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
but because they are not holding onto

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
or even actively denying the idea of a mind-independent reality

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
they are considered anti-realists

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and they are opposed by those who hold on

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
to the existence of a mind-independent reality

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
who are considered realists

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
and this is a battle that is near and dear to my heart

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
anyway we should note that because Kant held

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
according to him a more universal account of the categories

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
that is the kind of conceptual structure that structures

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
and gives meaning to the world as we observe or understand it

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
he nevertheless wasn't a relativist in that sense

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
however because other philosophers such as C.I. Lewis

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
and I would argue also resources from natural science

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
would hold that these categories that we have

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
or concepts and conceptual schemes that we use

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
in making the sense of the world as we know it

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
are also a product of a social, historical

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and cultural background

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
meaning they could actually be different

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
for different people

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
different people in different times in different cultures

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
have very different concepts

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
and the world as it is relative to those different sense of concepts

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
would be different

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
our ontology

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
what the world in this sense is

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
is therefore relative

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
this is ontological relativism

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
under that previous sense of anti-realism

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
again so we're clear relativism here is that

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
because people can have different concepts

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and different conceptual schemes

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
the world is different for everyone with a different conceptual scheme

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and also importantly

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
that these different worlds

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
perhaps not in small part because they are anti-realists

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
cannot be reduced to each other

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
or that there is one correct world type of thing

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
that is the ontological relativist position

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
they cannot be reduced

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
and one is not more correct

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
since certainly at least according to their conception

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
there isn't exactly a mind independent reality

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
in order to appeal to

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
in order to say one is correct

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
so Ogrady presents the main battle in ontology

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
between these two positions

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
an anti-realist position

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
called the ontological relativist

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and a realist position

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
called the sophisticated realist

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
both in some sense actually accept

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
and have moved on to a post-continent type of picture

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
the sophisticated realist

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
is a realist because they still want to hold on

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
that there is a mind independent reality or world

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
but they are actually unlikely naive realist

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
that was probably far more likely to exist in the pre-continent picture

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
a realist that believed there was only one theory

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
one could say that we have

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
that is of a mind independent reality

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
one theory that is the most correct one

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
or that other theories can be reduced to just one theory

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
for example in the old school

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
perhaps we may have thought that physics is the ultimate theory

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
other stuff whether psychology or sociology

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
everything can be reduced to physics

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
and physics being not merely about the world as we know it

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
but about a mind independent reality as well

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
that's not really a sophisticated realist position

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
in the post-continent picture however

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
the sophisticated realist holds that we can actually have

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
different theories of the world

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
based in part because they give a sense to the idea

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
how different conceptual schemes are giving meaning to the worlds

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
different worlds

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
so there would be different theories of the world

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
and yet one of those theories isn't considered the correct one

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
or most correct one

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
that they can all exist and yet not be reduced to each other

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
but they are still nevertheless about a mind independent reality

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
that exists and is a certain way

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
it has certain properties

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
that I guess they would say either is successfully or not conveyed

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
or somehow connected to those theories

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and so somehow or other structure

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
or perhaps how Paulo Grady would phrase it

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
constraint on what our theories can even be

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
is coming in part from here as well

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
a mind independent reality

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
not just there

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
not just the mind

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
in this sense the sophisticated realist feels that they have

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
accommodated relativism

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
and how our conceptual seems construct what we know

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
but still are realist about reality

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
this in modern philosophic warfare is the main battle

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
happening in ontology as it is presented by Paulo Grady

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
a battle between the ontological relativist

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and the sophisticated realist

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
while it may seem like the sophisticated realist

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
is actually pretty accommodating

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
the ontological relativist still being an anti-realist

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
denies the sophisticated realist position

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
saying there is no sense of the world beyond the mind

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
that it makes no sense to speak of it having properties

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
or being a certain way

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
because of course in order for something to be discussed

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
as being a certain way

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
having certain properties

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
only ever make sense within a conceptual scheme

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
it only makes sense if concepts are being applied

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
and if it is then we aren't actually talking about a mind

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
independent reality

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
also it seems to be that part of the ontological relativist point

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
is to say that if theories can in fact be different

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
and not reducible and that one theory isn't the most correct one

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
and what point also is there even mentioning that there is this thing

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
why bother bringing that up then

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
now this may seem super frustrating for those of us who are realists

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
but it's not like we didn't in some sense feel a similar way

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
when it came to big

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
remember talking about this cube as if it is big

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
makes no sense

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
it can't be called that

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
that's how we felt

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
so the ontological relativist may actually be equally frustrated with us

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
in insisting that reality is a certain way and has certain properties

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
as we might be with someone else who doesn't understand why this cube

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
that has nothing else to be compared to

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
cannot be described as big

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
since big is relative

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
the ontological relativist feel that all properties

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
or description, everything

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
is relative to a conceptual scheme

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
comes from a mind

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
and yet here we are trying to describe mind independent reality

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
with no conceptual scheme applied

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
yet still trying to say it has certain properties and is a certain way

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
that equally doesn't seem to have any meaning or have any sense

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
in the way that describing a cube as being big

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
when it's the only thing in existence seems to be meaningless

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
or like an empty idea

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
now as an aside note

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
there's also another reason that works for them in their perspective

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
not only is there this basis of how our conceptual scheme

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
is giving shape or constructing

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
or at least providing the schemata for which things can have meaning in the first place

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
but they also feel that this in some way helps them defend against skepticism

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
because one of the big issues in philosophy

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
is that despite what we claim to know

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
it's possible that no matter how much justification we have

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
that a mind independent reality could nevertheless be different

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
in more of a classic way of phrasing it

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
I guess we could say we could hold full justified belief

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
about what the truth is

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
and yet the truth could still nevertheless be different

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
hence we would not have knowledge

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
in fact that possibility is always the case

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
meaning we could never really know if we actually have knowledge or not

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
which is pretty skeptical

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
because a mind independent reality may always turn out different

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
now Kant thought something like this too

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
that he had somehow solved this kind of skeptical issue in some way

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
because when ontology is about this

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
then the possibility about being wrong of a mind independent reality

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
isn't really an issue for the anti-realist that drops that concept

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
but that isn't all that convincing to the realist

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
who would say dropping this

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
that we can ever know or understand it

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
or be in any way shape or form in contact with reality

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
is exactly skepticism

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
you haven't defeated it

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
you just given into it

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
so that isn't much of a motivator for a realist

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
but the ontological relativists say back

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
it's only not convincing because you are applying your unjustified view

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
about there being this thing

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
we didn't lose the world

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
we didn't lose objects

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
we didn't lose things

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
we don't deny reality exist

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
just that all those terms are about this

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
no words or terms or identifiers or symbols or anything

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
make sense about anything beyond this

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
a conceptual scheme or paradigm or language

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
is required for something to even make sense or have meaning

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
and so I find this is where most of the battle really is

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
about the frustration of trying to use terms

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
that are always nevertheless tied into this area for the ontological relativists

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
but I'll kind of show you what I mean

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
first it's important to note here

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
that for the ontological relativist in this sense

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
there is no division between epistemology

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
the study of knowledge

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and ontology then

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
because the ontological relativists deny the division between mind and world

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
there is no world beyond the mind

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
and accusing the ontological relativists

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
of simply conflating the issues

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
of what we can know and understand

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
with issues about what exists

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
well, the ontological relativist points out that

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
that conflation only makes sense

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
because you had already presumed an ontological perspective

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
with a mind-world distinction in the first place

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
some realists would argue

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
well, we have a realist conception first

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and that thereafter we actually need good reasons

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
to be able to switch to another ontology

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
and that there are no good reasons for that

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
but are we really ontological realists first?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I mean, common-day people aren't exactly philosophers

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
and also just the idea that it's first would eventually mean anything

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
as O'Grady says that doesn't actually cut much ice for philosophers

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I've never actually heard that expression before

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
but I think it's super dope

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
oh, it doesn't cut much ice for philosophers

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
like, you know, I don't know

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
do philosophers cut ice?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
I don't know what O'Grady is doing on his part-time

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
anyway, okay, so one of the main issues here

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
that I'm gonna describe is a big philosophic trouble actually

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
so please think of it yourself

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
and really try to grasp what the ontological relativist is saying here

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
because there is actually problems for both sides

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
because a problem for the sophisticated realist

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
is what exactly is coming from here

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
I mean, we want to say that the world is a certain way, right?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
it has to be or have

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
and this is my phrasing to help explain it in the way I think of it

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
but it has to have some kind of information then

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
but the relativist for good reason says

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
information cannot exist without a language for it to be expressed within

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
and even the realist wants to recognize this

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
they want to be able to recognize that without a conceptual scheme

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
to have any meaning in there can't be information

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
so it kind of seems impossible to be able to say or describe

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
what is out here that has any information

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
or properties or is a certain way

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
just simply impossible to convey what it's influencing here

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
what structure or what constraints it gives to what our theories can be

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
how can we express this inexpressible

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
how can we talk about information being in the world

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
when there is no language out there

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
language comes from us, our minds

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
but on the other hand, the problem for the ontological relativist

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
is that they don't really want to say that everything is coming from our mind

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
that would be a kind of radical idealistic picture that they deny

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
that the world is just ideas

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
that we can just literally flippantly change reality with different concepts

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
that we make up as we go along

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
O'Grady calls this Promethean Anti-Realism

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
but it's important to point out that reality there is meant in their sense

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
this middle thing

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
reality, the world, stuff, information, things, objects, matter, properties

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
and all of those only have meaning constrained within the conceptual scheme

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
so this conversation is really hard because anytime a realist tries to use these words

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
to describe what they're talking about

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
they can be pulled into the terms as used by the ontological relativist

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and that's super frustrating

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
but as it seems to me at least

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
they too, in their own terms, are inconsistent

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
even in this chapter as O'Grady is describing their position, they are inconsistent

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
part of this inconsistency which I would argue

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
and I think clearly is the more damning part is the fact that in order to explain their position

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
in order to deny that these words are about this thing

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
and are instead about this thing

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
to even make that clarification

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
they are in the process of speaking about this thing

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
which they say is meaningless or impossible to do

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
this kind of relates to the lesson Wiccanshine gives in On Certainty

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
where it's nonsense to respond to nonsense

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
and yet here they sometimes talk about the realist's position

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
in order to contrast against it in a meaningful way

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
again in the process of denying an unconceptualized reality

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
they employ that concept as if non-relative and as if meaningful

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
or if it could only actually even possibly be meant in a relative way

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
which is what they are fine with

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
then they would not be in a process of denying it

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
in their process of pulling terms into their relative stance

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
they sometimes use the terms in a non-relative way

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
to explain or elucidate the change or meaningful difference

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
so it seems it is possible then for those words to mean something

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
other than what the relativists insist that they can only possibly mean

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
so this move of mine here for this chapter

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I'm not really visualizing too much right now

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
because in part we've already seen it before in other applications for truth

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
so I hope you kind of still understand what the point is I'm making here

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
but also it will certainly be given much more detailing in the chapter on rationality

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
because it will be used by Paul O'Grady

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
and I promise that detailing will be wonderful

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
anyway there is another reason for their occasional inconsistency here

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
in order to deny just being full-blown idealist

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
they do seem to want a brute force say that it just exists

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
and don't get me wrong they are consistent that we can't talk about

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
what this stuff is like that it has any properties or information

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
but at most that it just is

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
hence the cosmic porridge or the visual of grey mush that I used

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
but at the same time and here's a problem that was even for Kant

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
it exists is a property

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
to say something exists is also to talk about it

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
and they actually do seem to need to employ it

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
other than the mind because they don't want to say the world is just the mind

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
but at the same time the world isn't beyond the mind

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
so you can see it seems to lead them in a kind of confused state

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
it definitely isn't the state that they want to say that something is beyond the mind

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
they want to say the world is within the mind

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
and yet they don't want to say that we are actually constructing everything from our own heads

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
or at least deny that it's possible that we could somehow just flippantly decide

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
or on a whim decide what concepts we want to use

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
and change reality as it is actually experienced by us

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
so because they don't want to say there can be any infinite random tandem amount of theories

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
they want to apply some restrictions to it

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
but deny that the restrictions to what the theories can be

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
come from a mind independent reality

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
instead they proclaim that the constraints on what theories can exist about the world

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
come from the mind itself

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
but that means this restraint which comes from the mind

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
could nevertheless be the means by which we criticize another

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
if that is itself universal in some way

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
and what are those constraints?

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
well, Paulo Grady is going to give an account of what those restrictions are

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
in his chapter 5 in rationality

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
now from here on in O Grady's chapter in ontology

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
he does have a kind of outline that mainly focuses on two philosophers

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
that are most well known for ontological relativism

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
both Quine and Putnam

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
and really he does go to some detail explaining their positions

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
because it's not exactly a simple thing to talk about

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
but I'm just going to skip all of it completely

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
after explaining both of their positions

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
he then has seven objections to ontological relativism

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
three of those objections are specifically targeted to Putnam

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
one objection is specifically targeted to Quine

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
and the final three are just general arguments against ontological relativism

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
some of these arguments work but seem to target just the philosopher

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
and not the kind of general position of ontological relativism

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
other arguments just seem to lead to other battlefields

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
like whether or not IBE inference to the best explanation

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
is appropriate to making ontological metaphysical arguments about the nature of reality

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
this is namely the no miracles argument

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
and like I said I don't want to get into all of this stuff

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
ultimately when it comes to these arguments

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
it simply seems that there isn't a kind of final blow

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
there isn't anything fully restricting the possibility of ontological relativism

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
so O Grady allows for ontological relativism here

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
he seems to settle on the idea that relativism does go all the way through to the end

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
and anything beyond that is meaningless to talk about

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
and so in some sense he also perhaps on that basis

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
I'm a little bit unsure but he does accept the kind of differentiation

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
between truth and ontology

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
he feels one can absolutely be an absolutist

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
that is a non-relativist about truth

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
while still being a relativist about ontology

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
and certainly that seems to work within the schema of the ontological relativist

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
since the ontological relativist is denying a mind-independent reality

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
so all you would have to do is discuss capital T truth

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
as if it doesn't have to do with a mind-independent reality

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
and indeed if you do go look back on that chapter

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
where he does absolutely defend a non-relativist truth

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
he isn't relying on appeals to a mind-independent reality

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
which is actually pretty great

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
but anyway here in this chapter

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
is actually where I'm kind of really critical of O Grady

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
well maybe not really critical but kind of critical

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
and in my final video about this book

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
I will take a closer look at the chapter to outline the kind of criticism that I have

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
but to me and I'm just a shadowy character on the internet here

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
still he seems to be tricked by a technique used by the relativist

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
and maybe not exactly tricked

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
because the technique is used in other areas

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
and he combats against that same technique

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
so instead I currently feel like

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
even though he could have actually made a stronger case

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
against the relativist in ontology

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
he really is instead merely allowing for relativism in ontology

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
to a much greater extent

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
both because he feels it's safer than in epistemology

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
where it can cause damage to rationality

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
since rationality actually plays a role in epistemology

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
but also because he feels he can agree to segregating the areas of truth

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
from ontology

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
saving his victory there

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
not only is it safest to allow it here

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
I think in part his technique in this book overall

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
is simply to funnel the relativist away from other areas to this place

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
where they can cause the least amount of damage to the areas he battles against it

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
in any case there are still some good battles in this chapter

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
and he does give much more detail in the dealings with three philosophers in particular

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
David, Quine and Putnam

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
if you, my subscribers, really would like a detailed look at this chapter

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
perhaps I will do it at some point in time

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
but you gotta let me know

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
because these videos, they're super hard to make all by myself

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
I have no editors, no animators, no co-writers

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
and no funding beyond my one Patreon supporter, Slickpockets

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
as yet

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
and like I said, I didn't really come here to the battlefield of metaphysics for this

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
even though, yeah, this is probably the most metaphysical stuff that I'm talking about

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
even in this whole series

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
in other case this issue as I see it and we will see it again

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
is a problem in different areas

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
and can be described and visualized in many ways

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and this is just one way

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
the question and issue is

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
how is information outside

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
if language can't be

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
how is that outside

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
influencing the inside

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
what of our descriptions of the world

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
what amount, what way

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
what properties is from outside

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
how can we ever know

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
since we cannot know the outside

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I can go on and on for hours rephrasing that

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
so instead I would try to ask you to phrase the problem yourself

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
in your own mind

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
to get a good grip with what the problem really is

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
because you really do come to grip with the philosophic problem

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
when you realize due to this new post-continent picture

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
simply saying we get the outside

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
by observing, seeing, touching, etc

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
no longer is sufficient

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
as even those acts

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
what we are seeing

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
what information we are getting when we touch

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
it is structured by the kind of creatures we are

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the kind of interests we have

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
the kind of minds we have

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
the influence of the kind of conceptual scheme we have built for ourselves

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
influenced by our histories

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
like if we are in the medieval ages

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
or after Einstein

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and many other things

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
so I do have my own opinion

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
and my own kind of answer in some sense about some of these things

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
but it's not my place to say it here

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
as I said

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I will talk about ontology again

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
after I am done

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
and giving an evaluation of this book

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
but I simply do not think I have any right here

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
at least in this place

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
to start telling you what I think the proper solution is

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
in my kind of formal idea and presentation of it

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I'm not trying to do that

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I was just trying to give you

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
an outlay of what's going on in ontological...

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
what's going on in ontological relativism

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
the kind of issues that are in play

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
and the kind of position that Paulo Grady settles on

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
now let's move on to that next area

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
epistemological relativism

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
see you there for the battle

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
oh please subscribe and stuff

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
that would be like super nice because I think

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I really want to be able to prove that a philosopher can exist out here on the internet

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
and it can provide a place for us

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
anyway
