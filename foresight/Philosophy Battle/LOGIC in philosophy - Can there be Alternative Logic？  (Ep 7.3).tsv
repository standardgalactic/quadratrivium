0	3200	Hey everyone, my name is Ajay and welcome to Philosophy Battle.
3200	8560	Before this video starts I just want to make clear that this video is about logic and whether
8560	12120	or to what extent there can be alternative logics.
12120	16960	Because if there can be alternative logics, then which logic we are using can be considered
16960	19180	relative to some other factors.
19180	24840	And typically logic is taken to be one of the strongholds against claims to relativism.
24840	30040	Logic is often taken to be as proof of something that isn't relative, much like math.
30040	35320	So this video will introduce also some basic logic and the basic concepts of logic and
35320	39800	if you are already familiar with logic, well just be a little bit patient.
39800	43720	The more philosophically gripping stuff will come at the end.
43720	48000	Either way it does get progressively more intense, but stick to it.
48000	52240	Even if you don't get certain parts or know what's going on, it could still be very well
52240	57120	cleared up later on at some point and at the end the main point or main conclusion will
57120	59760	be made pretty clear, at least I think so.
59760	64440	Now the video will be covering a section from a book of a philosopher, a lecturer at Trinity
64440	69720	College in Dublin, philosopher Paul O'Grady, because I think that his book has got a lot
69720	73080	of great and interesting battles in it and a lot for us to learn.
73080	77480	But if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having
77480	79560	here, that's okay.
79560	83640	You don't have to watch anything else other than this if you're just interested in logic,
83640	85040	even if I'm suggesting it.
85040	89880	Just take it more as a kind of signpost if you want more information, if I do suggest
89880	92600	another video at various parts of this one.
92600	97040	Trust me, even if you don't watch any other things, this will still be a great video introducing
97040	100960	the ideas of logic and the possibility of alternatives in philosophy.
100960	105640	Finally, I just want to thank my Patreon supporters.
105640	106640	Slick Pockets
106640	110940	Now let's start the show and hear a short recap of how we got here first.
110940	112440	Logic vs. Relativism
112440	116760	This video is part of a series covering a few books on relativism before we go back to
116760	122120	the battlefield of the philosophy of science, where we had encountered some extreme relativists.
122120	125940	And trust me, it's going to be awesome when we do go back because of what we learn here
125940	128120	in the battlefield of metaphysics.
128120	132880	In particular, this video is covering a section in this green book simply called Relativism
132880	134320	by Paul O'Grady.
134320	140000	We previously already covered in a video his first chapter that explains the power of relativism
140000	142880	that I visualize as this philosophic weapon.
142880	148240	That video explains how this philosophic weapon came into being in modern philosophic warfare
148240	154120	as empowered by five great philosophers and thus how it's possible that even a reasonable
154120	159960	person may perhaps be led into believing that everything is relative.
159960	164320	Not just what flowers look the best, or what candy tastes the best, or who's the best
164320	167280	philosophy YouTuber, it's me obviously.
167280	169600	But that everything is relative.
169600	177060	They feel truth, knowledge, scientific fact, logic, even reality is relative.
177060	178560	Nothing is objective.
178560	179560	Nothing.
179560	180560	Absolute.
180560	182280	Now that's an extreme position.
182280	186360	But the powers of this weapon is actually based in philosophic writing and the history
186360	187360	of science.
187360	191800	It's not just some made up contrived stuff here, so please go check out that video if
191800	197560	you'd like to really understand why one can't just offhand dismiss a relativist.
197560	202420	When you really see the reasoning, it can be clearly a difficult enemy to challenge.
202420	207760	But also, this wickedly powerful weapon is an important one for philosophers to use ourselves
207760	212200	in investigation to challenge to question claims of objectivity.
212200	217080	It's just that unlike these extreme relativists, we will gain the understanding to see that
217080	219960	it does still in fact have limits.
219960	225920	And Paulo Grady in his book covers two places where he defends against the charges of relativism,
225920	231520	where those limits of this weapon should be, on truth and rationality.
231520	236840	So these are the two battles that I wanted to cover, one on truth and one on rationality.
236840	241120	And actually we already covered that first battle defending truth, and trust me it was
241120	242120	so awesome.
242120	245920	So if you're interested in just trying to figure out how to defeat this enemy in terms
245920	251680	of defending a non-relative truth in particular, then you can check out this video.
251680	255880	But to be honest, the way I presented it was that Ogrady does a kind of setup first, where
255880	262400	he actually uses a logical principle of non-contradiction to then go into battle on these two areas.
262400	267240	So it's understandable that he actually has a section devoted to relativism about logic
267240	272800	in particular right in that first chapter, where he's going to discuss whether or not,
272800	278840	or to what extent, we can have alternative logics, whether logic is relative.
278840	282280	So that's what we're going to be covering right now, and I did promise I'm going to
282280	286240	try and go a little faster in this normal one because it kind of was just an additional
286240	288500	section to that first great battle.
288500	292240	But I thought it might be also nice for me to show you all what formal symbolic logic
292240	295960	actually looks like if you're not familiar with it, it might be kind of cool to actually
295960	299840	visually see, and it will also give you a kind of good mental understanding to sit in
299840	303600	the background of what philosophers really mean when we're talking about logic.
303600	307080	First is just some, you know, I don't know, it's like a political hack on the internet
307080	312560	touting rhetoric about how logic is on their side, we mean something much more than that.
312560	317560	So despite me trying to blast through some stuff, since I am still covering what Ogrady
317560	322200	says, as usual I will cite things down to the line, and when I'm not speaking for or
322200	327400	giving my interpretation a presentation for our purposes of what Ogrady says in the text,
327400	330600	then the citation in the corner of the screen will just disappear.
330600	334440	That way you'll know it's coming from me, and what is coming from my interpretation
334440	335640	of what he's saying.
335640	336640	Cool?
336640	337640	Get it?
337640	339040	Okay, let's go.
339040	344680	Logic is intimately tied into issues of truth because of the notions of coherence and contradiction.
344680	348840	Not everyone feels that way though, some will say it's more noticeably about inferences
348840	350340	than about truth.
350340	354640	But I don't have time to deal with them here, and most do see logic as having something
354640	358880	to do with truth, and I already mentioned a couple of logical laws in the previous battle
358880	364400	against the Alithic Relativist, Alithic being about truth and relativism as in being dependent
364400	365920	on something else.
365920	371380	And namely, I mentioned the laws of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle.
371380	374600	And if you want to see that, you know what to do, hehe.
374600	379800	Anyway, the question is, even if yes, so say the truth isn't relative, even if the truth
379800	385360	is absolute, couldn't there still be legitimate alternative systems of logic?
385360	389320	Or is there just one most basic, one correct one?
389320	395000	Ogrity then tries to explain what logic even is, saying it's fundamental to human reasoning.
395000	400400	It governs the process of inferring beliefs in a truth-preserving way, such that if one
400400	406240	starts with true beliefs and then makes no mistakes in logic, one is guaranteed to have
406240	409080	true beliefs as a conclusion.
409080	413280	This is usually what we call validity, and it's the central notion in logic.
413280	418920	A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.
418920	424360	Now thousands of years ago, Aristotle was the first to codify logical laws and principles,
424360	430000	but they were around even before him, but this codification marks it as a formal discipline.
430000	434680	So I'm gonna try now and explain this as best as I can with some actual visual examples
434680	438240	that might help us for the background for the rest of this video.
438240	442320	Logic is a way of reasoning, and let's look at three examples of mine.
442320	447920	If it's true that if it rains you should put on a coat, and then you find out it is raining,
447920	450800	we can conclude you should put on a coat.
450800	455920	We just kind of reason it out, or for another example, if it's true that if it rains then
455920	462080	the street would be wet, but then you find out the street isn't wet, then you can conclude
462080	464080	that it didn't rain.
464080	467280	This is us using logic to figure this out.
467840	469680	But let's do one more.
469680	474000	Let's just for the sake of argument imagine that it's true that either it's raining
474000	476440	or we're eating pizza.
476440	483760	But we find out, hey, we're not eating pizza, we can conclude then it is raining.
483760	488120	So logic is the ability for us to figure out a conclusion that kind of preserves the same
488120	492000	amount of certainty as the stuff that led to the conclusion.
492000	497160	So technically logic isn't about figuring out if those premises are true or not, but
497200	500440	just that if they are the conclusion must be true.
500440	504960	So like in this example logic won't be telling us if it's actually true that it's actually
504960	510280	raining outside for example, unless of course you know it's raining is derived from some
510280	512560	other argument prior.
512560	516400	In any case logic is just what's helping us reason out this conclusion.
516400	520440	And philosophers have codified that like math has been codified.
520440	524280	And just to help us with a comparison to math which actually is going to be a running theme
524280	529720	later on, reasoning in math doesn't need to look like this.
529720	533800	This is kind of a codification and symbolization of math.
533800	538080	Technically one doesn't even need to know any of what these things even mean to reason
538080	539800	out mathematically.
539800	544400	In fact when we first teach this symbolic math to children we actually teach them the
544400	549160	reasoning in other ways first without this symbolic language.
549160	554000	For example we might say hey look at all your fingers put them up, you see there is one
554000	557120	two three four five six seven eight nine ten up.
557120	559040	Now put two fingers down.
559040	561560	Now see how many fingers you have left up.
561560	563760	One two three four five six seven eight.
563760	566080	So there are eight fingers up.
566080	570720	Thus children may be able to figure out how many fingers are up without even being literate
570720	574640	or even ever having to see these particular symbols ever.
574640	580000	But math has been formalized and symbolized and has functions that we slowly begin to teach
580000	585720	children moving away from saying something like I give you five apples but you eat two
585720	592480	apples to just saying you have five apples but take away two apples.
592480	597140	Then we just stop saying take away and start saying minus two instead.
597140	602640	Also we'll just stop saying the apples so we end up saying just five minus two.
602640	606920	Then again perhaps we will teach them a more appropriate way of saying it as five subtract
606920	610760	two while showing these symbols in particular.
610760	615160	Then we fully begin to discuss our numerical or quantified reasoning through this mathematical
615160	619760	symbolic language in ways that don't even have to connect to real world stuff.
619760	624000	We don't have to be talking about apples and oranges or whatever else anymore to do math
624000	626040	like this through symbols.
626040	629520	So now a similar type of thing has happened and from here I'm just going to ask you to
629520	634680	follow along as much as you possibly can but if you get lost don't worry we're going
634680	638640	to go back to O'Grady but I think this will be pretty fun.
638640	643240	So similarly philosophers have made it so that we can symbolize the process of this
643240	648440	stuff but by representing these propositions as letters we'll be using in our calculations
648440	652640	and having certain symbols to represent those relations between propositions kind of like
652640	658480	these symbols in math I guess you could say such as the if then symbol a conditional symbol
658480	665440	so if p then q or this symbol for negation and while we have these symbols we also have
665440	669320	inference rules that allow us to use these symbols and figure things out using these
669320	677840	symbols in different ways for example if p then q well given p therefore q this is called
677840	683080	modus ponens it's super simple and it fits pretty well with our first example but now
683080	687600	let's look at that second example if these propositions are represented by these letters
687600	696880	then we can show it as if p then q and we find out that not q thus we can conclude not
696880	703840	p this is called modus ponens again so like that first one was allowing us to show the
703840	710880	truth of p that led us to the truth of q this one kind of allows us to use the negation
710880	719480	to move backwards the falsehood of q or rather not q allows us to figure out not p backwards
719480	723640	and now for our third example if these are our definitions we can present this with an
723640	731520	or symbol and we can do something called disjunctive syllogism where p or q means either this or
731520	738040	that which means both can't be false if one is false the other has to be true so if we
738040	744640	have not q it means that we can conclude p so that's what these would look like but
744640	751200	again remember logic isn't actually figuring out if not q is really true for this argument
751200	756560	we have to find out other ways to actually verify not q in this case it's just that
756560	763760	if it were not q then we can conclude p must be the case and so this is a valid deduction
764200	770800	is either valid or not if it is valid it can be sound or not and we know if it is sound
770800	776480	by some other means by figuring out if this particular argument still has all its premises
776480	781560	are actually true now that might not seem like an important distinction but actually it's
781560	786440	very important for a philosopher because sometimes your enemy presents an argument and technically
786440	792200	their logic is valid as in these things really do lead to this conclusion logically so the
792240	797640	problem isn't that it isn't valid just that perhaps you question one or more of the premises
797640	803520	as being true so you're not saying the argument isn't valid but that it isn't sound because
803520	809320	say this premise isn't true for example now that may be not super important for what we're
809320	813160	going to be talking about in this video so don't worry about trying to remember all
813160	817400	these things if you don't know about it but it is super important for philosophers just
817400	822040	to be accurate about what we're criticizing in another to ensure our attacks actually
822040	827640	land but getting back to the symbols now let's go and make a big old puzzle but now kind
827640	832480	of like not needing apples anymore we're not even going to need these definitions we're
832480	837160	just going to show these letters because we don't even really care if it's sound we're
837160	841760	just going to be trying to figure out if it's a valid deduction so let me just add a couple
841760	846600	of other things so we can make a bigger one just as an example first of all dn or double
846600	853400	negation it's where there's two knots two knots cancel each other out so not not p through
853400	859440	double negation just makes p and vice versa that one's pretty easy we kind of spoke about
859440	864640	this previously in the previous video but also there's another one where p and q written
864640	869600	maybe with this symbol instead of ampersand could be simplified through the process of
869600	876400	simplification either as p or as q and the other process can happen too where if you
876400	880800	have p and q in different places you could actually just put them together through something
880800	886440	called adjunction and have p and q anyway now let's look at this one for funsies if
886440	896200	q then p q or r if r then not s given t and s prove q it's like a puzzle isn't it let's
896200	904120	solve it now so we're given p and s we can simplify that to just s and with just s we
904120	910080	can make it not not s through double negation right because it's the same thing but with
910080	919160	not not s and if r not s we can do modus tolens and therefore get not r because remember whoop
919160	927000	so that's not r and with not r and q or r we can do disjunctive syllogism therefore getting
927000	935880	us q because remember if it's not r then it has to be q and with q and if q then p we
935880	943840	do our basic modus tonens and therefore conclude p boom done that's the proof we proved p if
943840	952280	these are all true then given this one can prove logically this must be true fun huh
952280	956320	well if you don't think so that's okay it's like a puzzle and if you learn all the rules
956320	961480	intimately and do more puzzles it can be super fun just like doing math or stats puzzles
961480	965960	or playing chess or doing sudoku I don't know they can all be super fun if you play
965960	971960	them and it can really be cool and enjoyable to take the truth of this and run it through
971960	978560	this big ol process and get a result here considered a proof this is really basic stuff though
978560	983360	and actually there are far more advanced logics than this but let me just stop there before
983360	988600	I cut myself off too early when it comes to logic being presented in this way it's called
988600	994000	formal logic and it is a kind of symbolic logic so personally just to be clear when
994000	999920	I find some in the common regular non mathematicians non philosophers non computer scientists
999920	1005640	saying logic they kind of just generally mean some kind of reasoning something like I believe
1005640	1011160	what I believe based on this this is what I think and I think this makes sense that's
1011160	1017240	my logic well that seems really loose and open and it seems to also sometimes mix or
1017240	1021800	not even regard the difference between soundness and validity but either way still there's
1021800	1025960	some understanding that logic has something to do with some kind of reasoning but when
1025960	1031440	philosophers say logic it pays to mention if you mean formal logic like this like as
1031440	1036880	in a system created for us to do reasoning in of a certain kind kind of like saying I'm
1036880	1042320	doing math to a mathematician they will tend to now really think of math in this way in
1042320	1047400	particular this may just seem like an aside but trust me we'll come into play later formal
1047400	1052400	logic just systematizes and articulates a kind of inferences we make in our everyday reasoning
1052400	1058080	processes to help us figure out valid reasoning versus fallacious reasoning fallacious is if
1058080	1063160	a conclusion doesn't actually follow from the premises well Aristotle's classic formal
1063160	1068440	logic was so good that a couple of thousand years later Emmanuel Kant was like logic is a
1068440	1073720	completed science nothing to add but then there was a renewed interest in logic in the 19th century
1073720	1078600	because of big developments happening in math and as we've been mentioning in like the last four
1078600	1084560	videos I think German mathematician and philosopher Gottlieb Frege made one of the most significant
1084560	1095880	contributions with his big big big riff bigger shrift forgive me for not knowing how to say
1095880	1101480	this properly read it a thousand times just don't have friends to tell me how to say things
1101480	1106360	and if a bigger shift actually kind of looks like this but it was Frege's writings who actually
1106360	1112200	brought for a more modern symbolic logic it was even more sophisticated than Aristotle's and
1112240	1118560	could articulate relations and generalities in such a way that one could even show mathematical
1118560	1125720	truths derived from logical truths so like I was saying earlier we can do a mental processing that
1125720	1130280	we call reasoning which makes use of a kind of logic in terms of inferring beliefs from other
1130280	1135400	beliefs and formal logic systematizes and makes a symbolic language of us doing that kind of
1135400	1139760	reasoning which actually helps us do that kind of thing but maybe we could say there's another
1139880	1144800	kind of mental processing perhaps we'll call it calculating which is the use of math and this
1144800	1149440	math stuff is also systematized and put into a symbolic kind of language which helps us do that
1149440	1155840	well Frege's articulation was actually so good it made it possible to show that maybe even math
1155840	1161640	actually is from logical reasoning that it isn't a unique different kind of thought processing
1161640	1167320	this was called logicism and Russell and Whitehead furthered that position in their famous
1167480	1172360	Principia Mathematica showing their logical systems and how they can derive mathematical
1172360	1179040	truths from them what logic was shown to be more fundamental to our mental processing than math
1179040	1188720	that actually math comes from it wow so cool at least I think that's pretty cool anyway they
1188720	1193640	only actually used five basic symbols in their logic but later Wittgenstein you know who came
1193640	1199080	after it goes Frege Russell Wittgenstein anyway Wittgenstein in the TLP the Tractatis logical
1199080	1203720	philosophicus which is his most famous writing from when he was younger actually suggested
1203720	1208360	breaking down all of logic to just one symbol actually I think Wittgenstein used the shepherd
1208360	1213000	stroke to show this and really shepherd was the first to show this I think to show that we can
1213000	1217880	do all of propositional logic with just one symbol but I'm not sure if he was the first to
1217880	1223560	actually show it so if you're a logician and you know who is actually the first to show this let
1223640	1228120	me know in the comments below but also if I remember correctly I think Wittgenstein was trying to
1228120	1232200	show that even predicate logic can be expressed with it too but anyway if that sounds like nonsense
1232200	1239080	don't worry about it basically we have these five symbols right the if then conditional the if and
1239080	1246360	only if by conditional this symbol which is basically and the or symbol which means that one of the
1246360	1253160	two must be true both can't be false and the negation symbol so there's five symbols right
1253160	1259400	but actually I can be fine doing it all with just one symbol what really just one symbol
1259400	1264840	how are you gonna do that well let me show you firstly this by conditional is pretty easy p if
1264840	1272360	and only q all it means that both if p then q and also if q then p it was just a combination of both
1272360	1277400	anyway to show that if you have one you can get the other and it goes both ways so scratch that one
1277400	1282360	since we can actually express it simply by using both of these in separate ways but now what about
1282360	1288200	this one the conditional if p then q how can I replace that well actually I can replace it with
1288200	1297000	the or symbol by saying not p or q wait what why well if you remember at least one must be true
1297000	1304600	so if one is false we know the other is true and so if q is false or not q then we can conclude
1304600	1311880	not p must be true and that's also basically modus tollens here if p then q but we have
1311960	1320840	not q then you know we would have not p so it works in both senses but now also if it's not not p
1321400	1328600	then it has to be q not not p is the same as p remember with double negation so that's the
1328600	1336280	same thing as saying if p then q so actually these are logically equivalent so I can express an if then
1336280	1343640	just using or so scratch that one too now what about these last three well check it out you can
1343640	1351160	take the chefer stroke to mean well it can either mean nand which is to say not and or nor which is
1351160	1356120	to say not or as far as I can tell I think you just got to be clear on which one you mean when
1356120	1361720	you're using it and for some reason it seems that people use the arrow down to be nor and is also
1361720	1367720	associated with pierce and this arrow the arrow up is more associated with nand and I don't really
1367720	1372280	know why I'm not really a logician or anything I'm just trying to be as honest and truthful as
1372280	1377640	possible here remember we're actually trying to talk about relativism but anyway I can't tell technically
1377640	1382360	why it is that way but as far as I can tell I think it just matters what you're actually clear on
1382360	1389160	when you actually do use it so if this lash means nor this chefer stroke then it means that both
1389160	1398280	must be false that neither this nor this so to show not p you would show neither p nor p
1399240	1405400	the only options for p here show that they are false so with this chefer stroke I don't technically
1405400	1415000	need this not symbol to show and p and q I can show it by saying neither neither p nor p nor
1415080	1422280	neither q nor q remember this is negating both sides saying both side must be false so to say
1422280	1429080	not p is to say this and if both of these are therefore not this and not this and both of
1429080	1433800	those are shown as being negative because they're shown with this and that flips them back to being
1433800	1440200	both true and thus you are saying p and q pretty cool huh anyway so that means I don't actually
1440200	1448120	need that symbol either I can show it all with just this stroke and also I can even show p or q
1448120	1454680	by showing neither neither p nor q nor neither p nor q and you can look at that and figure out how
1454680	1459160	that one makes sense yourself if you'd like but either way the point is I don't even need this
1459160	1466120	and so I can show all of these just by using one symbol this chefer stroke just this line and you
1466120	1471240	know what technically it doesn't even have to be this one symbol in fact I can make it all another
1471240	1477720	symbol or rather I can just take this line to mean something else the nand the arrow up instead
1477720	1485240	and they would look like this anyway this is not at all important to remember for us and our sake
1485240	1490360	so let's just take a deep breath and clear our mind a bit and not feel too bogged down if you
1490360	1495880	didn't get what I was saying let's just get back to oh grady the point is that we can break it all
1495960	1502360	down to just one symbol if we wanted or more if we wanted more depending on what suits us best
1502360	1510200	each would be its own system so we can make a new system with four or one with six but hey the real
1510200	1517880	question comes if maybe we can make an altogether new system we set up with new symbols that tell us
1517880	1526440	to do completely different things hmm anyway there's really no limit to how many systems you could
1526440	1532120	have one just set up a new set of symbols and a new system of rules of inference and a new system
1532120	1538600	appeared but these would be syntactic systems pure theoretical or formal like not connected to
1538600	1544200	anything outside of it when it comes to having to connect to things outside of it like those letters
1544200	1549560	representing real world stuff or true or false representing ones and zeros on a computer then
1549560	1554680	yeah then it seems like there's limits on what those systems could be and how are they these
1554680	1560440	new systems even related back to how we normally commonly just do reasoning logically you know
1560440	1566840	without these formal systems before us there were so many systems that could be very different not
1566840	1572440	just different from the principia mathematical but from the way we normally do daily common
1572440	1579480	logical reasoning now there were two fundamental laws in the principia mathematical that actually
1579480	1587480	go way back all the way as presented to Aristotle in ancient times those were the law of non-contradiction
1587480	1592600	and the law of the excluded middle the law of non-contradiction holds that a proposition
1592600	1599080	and its negation cannot be both true together the law of the excluded middle holds that all
1599080	1606040	propositions are either true or false there is no third value both of these came up before when
1606040	1611320	we battled against relativizing truth arguing to keep both of these and yo you really gotta
1611320	1616680	watch that previous video of truth versus relativism because Paulo Grady does some awesome stuff and
1616680	1621720	some important lessons there that could last forever in philosophy so please do check it out
1621720	1627480	well even those laws logicians have experimented with getting rid of them in these new various
1627480	1632680	systems that they can make but is it possible that even they can kind of represent how we in
1632680	1637560	common day do reasoning well well before we do that let's just be clear about the difference
1637560	1642600	between a classic logic with just a small change or a small difference and a full blown alternative
1642600	1648520	logic so philosopher susan hack actually has a very useful way of distinguishing between systems
1648520	1654920	that are actually rivals versus those that are just slightly added to so a basic logical system
1654920	1659560	is symbols that have rules on how to set up those symbols and what some of those symbols
1659560	1665880	mean as in what it says about their relation those are the inference rules or transformation rules
1665880	1670440	like modus ponens or modus tonens like i showed you earlier these things are also called well
1670440	1676520	formed formulas by hack but whatever anyway now this is just a syntactic characterization of how
1676520	1683080	thus a structure is set up a semantic characterization is the idea that truth of the premises that we
1683080	1689480	put into the system is preserved in the conclusion we get out now if we have two systems that are
1689480	1694760	set up the same with the same transformation rules but just looking different with different
1694760	1701480	symbols but they mean the same thing then that's not really a rival system the real differences
1701480	1709000	start when you get two systems let's call them a and b that share the same basic symbols but b
1709000	1716360	has more symbols and thus more theorems and greater expression we'll call this extended logic
1716360	1723160	it doesn't actually clash with the earlier classic system just adds to it ogready gives the example
1723160	1728280	of modal logic with the distinctions of necessity and possibility which is a kind of logic that i
1728280	1733560	didn't really do but i can imagine it one that i have done that i think would count here is called
1734520	1739560	quantified predicate logic is the one where you have the universal and existential symbols
1739560	1744280	logicians forgive me it's been a long time but anyway another difference here is if the symbols
1744280	1750440	actually mean something different if there's actually different rules of inference in that case
1750440	1758440	a would be a classic logic and b would be a deviant logic i assume because of how much it deviates
1758440	1765400	not because of how naughty it is in the bedroom to do or is it hey girl you down to do some deviant
1765400	1773160	logic with me back at my place okay sorry back to uh philosophy so an example of a deviant logic
1773160	1778520	would be a three-valued logic which we discussed three-value logic in the previous video again
1778520	1783640	please please do go check that one out it's a system where something doesn't have to be either
1783640	1789800	just true or false it can be even some other thing anyway another example would also be a
1789800	1795080	quantum logic where certain rules can be dropped in favor of different ones now some of these
1795080	1800600	deviant systems are actually proposed as a full-on replacement for classical logic like saying this
1800600	1806680	three-valued system is actually superior and should replace the two-valued one in all cases
1806680	1812920	to be clear for our question of relativism advocating that one is just right the right one
1812920	1819320	in all cases that we should always use it even if it is a deviant one therefore isn't relativism
1819320	1824440	it's still saying that just one is correct so it's not really relativism about logic even if
1824440	1831080	that one is a deviant one but how can we determine which is the true system of logic relativism
1831080	1836120	emerges if you say two or more systems are legitimate candidates and we can just choose
1836120	1842360	between them and even move back and forth even why would we want to be able to move to another system
1842360	1847480	well hack has four different sorts of reasons why one would want to do that that ogready outlines
1847480	1852040	and i'm gonna blast through these because i don't want this video to be too long like i said
1852040	1856840	i don't like how ogready phrase some stuff in here and really it's not all that important for us
1856840	1862760	to know the details of these only important that there are legitimate reasons to want to use a
1862760	1869000	deviant logic so this just goes to show that the issue goes well beyond just oh we can create them
1869720	1874920	firstly there's a general metaphysical reason an example of this is from dutch mathematician
1874920	1881320	bauer who thought unlike russell that math actually can't be derived from logic and while it can
1881320	1887320	exist as calculating in the mind in a way without an explicit symbolic language it is its own
1887320	1893640	fundamental way of thinking he felt the nature of math is that it is constructed by the intellect
1893640	1898840	so there couldn't be mathematical truths that are unknowable to the mind but this logical
1898840	1905960	principle of the excluded middle would mean that there are some math truths even things we don't
1905960	1912440	know that are still nevertheless true or false just we don't know them bauer denied this for
1912440	1918440	mathematical truth so he wanted to drop the law of the excluded middle so i guess like for bauer
1918440	1924200	that means math truths can't be unknown i'm not really sure here look this is a section where i
1924200	1929240	don't think ogrady says things right because clearly there's a difference between unknowable
1929240	1935880	or unjudgeable by the human mind versus just unknown or unjudged but anyway i guess if we really
1935880	1940120	wanted to see what's going on here or with any of these things i can just go and check out susan
1940120	1945960	hack's fuzzy book or maybe for this one in particular perhaps it came from bauer's two-part paper i
1945960	1950440	don't really know if that's where it came from i'm not sure because i didn't read susan hack's
1950440	1955880	book but if you want here's the journey for you you can read this and this and let us know anyway
1955880	1960280	maybe one day i can do hacks book in a series on logic like i'm doing these three books on
1960280	1966600	relativism right now but anyway the second reason hack presents is a desire to avoid philosophical
1966600	1971800	problems some philosophical commitments may be considered troublesome an example of that is
1971800	1978280	that someone wants to avoid fatalism the doctrine that events are predetermined and unmanable to
1978280	1984360	free will and one version of that comes just from accepting the law of the excluded middle
1984360	1990680	it is either true or false that i will be knocked down by a car tomorrow even though i have no way
1990680	1997800	of knowing which it is the case that one of these options is a determinate fact remember with excluded
1997800	2004840	middle something is either true or false not both not some new thing so facts about the future
2004840	2011080	must already be set in that way and for those of us who want to believe free will that my choice
2011080	2016840	which hasn't been made yet should impact what is true or false this could be seen as a problem
2017400	2022280	now there are different ways to deal with this one can just say that facts about the future can't
2022280	2027080	be true or false but doing that has a price you wouldn't even be able to say the sun will rise
2027080	2032680	tomorrow is true then so instead of doing that just denying the excluded middle could be one way of
2032680	2037880	diffusing the fatalist issue while at the same time allowing some future statements to be true
2037880	2042600	in any case the third source of reasons that motivates adopting another logic is a desire
2042600	2047960	to avoid scientific problems whereas the previous ones dealt more with dropping the excluded middle
2047960	2052520	this one's more closer to dropping the law of non-contradiction the reason being how these
2052520	2058200	deviant logics work with well-confirmed stuff happening in science namely quantum physics
2058200	2063960	now i had questioned this but whatever the idea is quantum particles behave in ways not
2063960	2070280	describable in the standard laws of logic like quantum superpositioning now ogrady uses david
2070280	2076280	z albert's quote about the path of quantum particles but ultimately says of this quantum
2077080	2082280	that it drops what are called the classical distribution laws but the distribution laws
2082280	2087480	isn't the law of non-contradiction i just want to be clear on that but anyway for the next one
2087480	2093720	the fourth reason is a desire for logical innovation systems can actually be made to
2093720	2099880	drop the law of non-contradiction why do that is it just useless well you know it's pretty much
2099880	2105480	just making them for the sake of expanding our minds sort of thing and maybe it can also help
2105480	2111400	us to understand paradoxes and stuff too so those are the four reasons ogrady outlines that hack
2111400	2116840	has for why someone would even move to an alternative logic it's not just a trivial or for the fun of
2116840	2122920	it type of thing that different systems can be made but now let's see some objections against
2122920	2129240	alternative logics ah the husband wife duo influential historians of logic w neal and
2129240	2134840	m neal hold that even from a purely formal point of view the ordinary two-valued system
2134840	2140920	has a unique status among deductive systems which can possibly be called logic since it contains
2140920	2147240	all others as fragments of itself in short they are not alternatives to classical logic
2148200	2154600	but this can be challenged truth for multi-valued logics actually may not appear in fact cannot
2154600	2160760	appear in classic two-valued systems i think that one's kind of obvious i don't know why they even
2160760	2167880	said that then ogrady says the distinctive position here seems just historical a long-standing tradition
2167880	2174200	but tradition can hardly stop philosophers and i agree with ogrady on that heavily but i would
2174200	2179160	like to note that from that quote though there's actually nothing in it to suggest that the neals
2179160	2184280	were making their claim on the basis of long-standing tradition but it reads like ogrady is saying
2184280	2190600	that's what it seems like their position also is but didn't cite that part or put a quote for it
2190840	2196360	not saying ogrady is wrong about them he certainly knows the neals ever more than i ever will but
2196360	2200680	just pointing it out that that quote actually had nothing to do with long-standing tradition of a
2200680	2205960	two-valued system anyway ogrady then devotes a few pages particularly to an argument by the
2205960	2212760	champion philosopher quine who uses the translation argument against deviant logics he gives us the
2212760	2217880	details of the background and all that and i don't really think that's fully necessary for our purposes
2217880	2223240	especially to show what ogrady's position ultimately is but i'll blast through it super fast
2223240	2227960	just so that i'm not depriving y'all of at least mentioning it given how much time ogrady devotes
2227960	2232440	to talking about it and i think you'll see why he's doing that though so like i said not to confuse
2232440	2236680	anyone but i'm gonna go kind of fast and be a little bit lax on this see first there was these
2236680	2240600	folks right and we'll call them rational intuitions who thought that logical truths can actually be
2240600	2244280	known in a special way prior to having any experience of anything so like you don't have to
2244280	2247720	make any observations in the world you can just kind of think about it and realize it's true
2247720	2252040	and so that's you using your kind of rational intuition to grasp its truth and while there are
2252040	2256200	a lot of logical truths that we know because we infer them from other ones some of them can actually
2256200	2260440	be known just straight up immediately with rational intuition no other premises required
2260440	2264920	and even some of those things that the rational intuition can figure out for us can even reveal
2264920	2268920	the nature of reality like some fundamental truths about how the world works anyway russell
2268920	2272920	who co-authored the principia of mathematically that book that shows logic more fundamental than
2272920	2277400	math you know logicism and whatnot well he felt this way too that logical truths are known through
2277400	2281880	our rational intuition not through any experience like other empirically dependent beliefs while at
2281880	2286200	first that kind of makes sense for us actually that would seem super spooky and mystical for the
2286200	2291880	positivists so they were all like yo f that but then to explain or make sense of how we grasp logical
2291880	2296200	truths then they claim that we know logical truths because they are dependent on the linguistic
2296200	2300520	framework we make or are using and if you think of it that also kind of makes sense based on what
2300520	2305880	we're saying remember we can make different syntactic structures if we want to so positivists
2305880	2311560	advanced a linguistic theory of logical truths holding that logic derives from linguistic rules
2311560	2315560	and there's different in many complex versions of this but carnap was one of them remember he was
2315560	2319880	a positivist philosopher who thought that we could make different linguistic frameworks or as we might
2319880	2324440	want to start calling it different logics for scientists to use so for those with the linguistic
2324440	2328840	theory of logic all logic really is is just following the rules within a linguistic practice
2328840	2333000	which if you think of it kind of implies there wasn't particularly anything special or deep about
2333000	2337160	logic beyond merely which linguistic framework we are using and i guess that's where we kind of are
2337160	2341160	now and now we're gonna see quine respond to this because quine ain't downwardist you see because
2341160	2346440	quine likes logic so quine agreed with the criticism against the intuitionist because he too wants to
2346440	2350520	be empirical in certain ways and we'll get to that in another chapter but he thought there was
2350520	2354680	actually no need to bother trying to explain logic with something else as if there's something more
2354680	2358600	fundamental to it quine be like logic is so fundamental to thought you can't explain or
2358600	2364360	argue for it with something else or gritty says of quine logic is so basic to our thinking that
2364360	2369080	nothing more fundamental could explain it so quine be like nah you don't need something to explain
2369080	2373720	it because if you understand the language you will just give a scent to logic anyway it's obvious
2373720	2379080	and anyone who correctly understands the language in question will just give a scent to a logical
2379080	2386040	truth as an obvious truth yeah you could have trivially different logical systems and textbooks
2386040	2392280	and whatnot but when it comes to actual deviant logics well if someone comes up to you and is like
2392280	2400920	ayo p and not p you will be like no this this isn't a sincere deviant logical person it's better to
2400920	2407480	just assume that they probably don't understand what and means or what not means or they actually
2407480	2411960	mean something completely different when they say it because the assumption is if they did know what
2411960	2417320	those things mean in the way that we do they simply would not be saying it it's just always better
2417320	2422280	to believe there's actually a mistranslation going on even if we don't know exactly what it is then to
2422280	2428120	believe someone is actually using a deviant logic he compares it to master david humes move of saying
2428120	2433320	if you come across some claims to miracles it's better to believe no there must be some explanation
2433320	2438040	to this than they're actually being a miracle and that it's always better to believe there is some
2438040	2442520	actual explanation for some event even if you don't know what that explanation is yet
2442520	2448920	then to believe there is a miracle and quines boy david sin well boy no uh sorry for my colloquialism
2448920	2455400	anyway that is quines former student david sin took this argument to a whole next level
2455400	2460680	not just for logic but even against different conceptual schemes now part of the reason of
2460680	2465320	this book isn't just to survey all the places where relativists can attack and where a gradey
2465320	2473240	can defend but also actually he wants to battle david sin to the death no i'm just kidding there's
2473240	2478840	no actual violence here and even what ogready wants to do isn't actually all that confrontational
2478840	2484600	with david sin i find he just wants to present a softer argument rather than a hard argument david
2484600	2490040	sin does in his chapter on rationality so maybe that explains why he went to some depth of the
2490040	2495640	background of this argument from quine 2 talking about it here even mentioning the positivists
2495640	2499960	and stuff like that which i didn't bother getting into ogready says he will talk about
2499960	2503880	both of these philosophers anyway in different places though when he gets to them but for
2503880	2508200	right now he's gonna suggest that quines argument ain't that perfect in part because it's coming
2508200	2514120	from him nothing personal just pointing out that this argument seems to anticipate or set up a just
2514200	2521320	offhand rejection of deviant logics a priori but quines whole epistemological thing is that there
2521320	2528200	are no a priori nothing we know before experiencing it everything can be changed with experience
2528200	2533880	no beliefs have any kind of special unchangeable place but at the same time it seems he's making
2533880	2539800	logic special here and remember the translation argument is an argument that a priori rejects
2539800	2546440	deviant logics so what's going on here quine you all over the place well ogready admits the
2546440	2552920	precise interpretation of quines position is a delicate and disputed issue so it seems ogready
2552920	2557800	is open to a quinian philosopher defending quine and clarifying the different positions quine has
2557800	2564200	taken and evolved over time in which particular ways also my presentation of quine would probably
2564200	2570200	make a quinian even more frustrated and heck this ain't even my own details covering of ogready
2570200	2576680	talking about quine it's just my blast through but to be fair again ogready does say he will
2576680	2582680	look into quine himself in more detail and clarify his position better than he has done here at least
2582680	2588440	in this chapter at least he will do better when he gets to his chapter in ontology anyway there's
2588440	2595240	other problems for quine's argument too like it just assumes a classic two-valued logic is what's
2595240	2600360	obviously deep in the mind fundamental and all so everything outside of it we kind of just translate
2600360	2606440	to it but there's no argument here in particular for why this obviously correct thing in the mind
2606440	2612760	can't be for someone else say an intuitionist logician having a three plus valued logic or
2612760	2618360	something else the argument just states that there is a base logic but there is no argument here
2618360	2624120	for what that logic has to be that it has to be a classic two-valued system and not a deviant one
2624120	2629640	also it seems quine is using considerations about translation because of his own commitment to
2629640	2635080	empiricism and behaviorism but one could argue that empirical evidence isn't appropriate to
2635080	2640280	determine the nature of logic i mean maybe there's some metaphysical underpinning that can explain
2640280	2645320	why logic is special in any case ogready seems to hold that there are indeed arguments against
2645320	2650840	deviant logics but they aren't all that perfect there's flaws in him ogready then goes on to
2650840	2656840	describe his own position that looks like this he says and we're going to quote this line by
2656840	2665480	line while i give my own visualization of it even if one accepts a deviant system and believes there
2665480	2672120	are good philosophical grounds for defending it there seems to be general regulative principles
2672760	2681240	governing the choice of a logical system these include consistency coherence simplicity efficacy
2681240	2689480	and so on our choice of a logical system is itself governed by a more general conception of
2689480	2696600	rationality he says there are notions of logic that operate up here and those are what he argues
2696600	2702760	for in his chapter on rationality the law of non-contradiction and he says he won't argue for
2702760	2709080	it but it's possible that for the reasons of simplicity we would also have up here a two valued
2709080	2714840	system the law of the excluded middle simply because then you don't have to mess around with truth
2715480	2721400	where does that leave the legitimacy of deviant logic well it's pretty clear that multi-valued
2721400	2728040	systems are possible and there's no compelling formal argument against having them but also
2728040	2735880	up here the meta level that governs the adoption of such systems is committed to at least the law
2735880	2743720	of non-contradiction and probably for reasons of simplicity to the law of the excluded middle lower
2743720	2750760	level contacts requiring suspension of this to require the existence of such a meta level
2750760	2757240	is to argue for the core conception of rationality which will be argued for in chapter five
2757960	2764840	this is an absolute non-relative conception governing degrees of diversity beneath it
2765560	2770760	so the upshot of this discussion is that there are legitimate alternative logical
2770760	2778360	calculi useful for various purposes but ultimately governed by a system adhering to the
2778360	2786280	traditional laws of logic and with that the chapter ends so we see ogredi does allow relativism
2786280	2791960	on logic in terms of the lower level but argues that there are some principles of logic on the
2791960	2798280	meta level or above which he defends and he will be calling the core conception of rationality
2798280	2802760	once again leading us to that second great battle where he defends against relativism
2802760	2808840	on his chapter on rationality so we gotta go and check that out this means though for some folks
2808840	2814760	that come up and be like hey this isn't relative it's logical you could say there are actually
2814760	2819640	different logics back to that but ultimately they may be just saying something about how
2819640	2825320	basic rationality that governs fundamental way we think is nevertheless beholden to logical
2825320	2831640	laws if that's what they are saying you could say so you mean rationality isn't relative
2831640	2837320	which is kind of different but maybe that's just not much criticism behind what they meant to say
2837320	2842040	only that it's probable that they don't really understand logic in the way philosophers or
2842040	2846840	logicians or mathematicians do certainly many people don't know there are different kinds of
2846840	2851720	maths as well different interpretations of what counts as the correct mathematical procedure
2851720	2856920	that perhaps mathematicians and philosophers are familiar with but the common person isn't so it's
2856920	2862360	much easier for the common person to say math and mean something about the fundamental ways we
2862360	2869560	think about things in any case is logic relative it seems like yeah it is but logical principles
2869560	2875480	kind of are necessary to the way we think certainly there are actual alternatives and you can actually
2875480	2881400	pick different logics depending on what you need but can we use a different logic at least in terms
2881400	2887560	of the principle of non-contradiction in the way we actually think in the way our rationality is
2887560	2894840	well Ogrady will argue nope we cannot so let's go see that awesome battle now against a relativist
2894840	2901800	that would argue even rationality is relative oh and before you go i just want to say very
2901800	2907560	quickly unscripted uh if you like my visualization or my videos here please go check out some of
2907560	2913240	the other ones and please actually do subscribe to my channel if you can please support me on
2913240	2918200	patreon or send me a direct donation to paypal it's really difficult and it takes hundreds
2918200	2923720	of hours to make these videos and i don't get much support even socially as you can see my subscriber
2923720	2928520	count isn't even that high so it's not like even youtube pays me for this so if you can do that that
2928520	2933480	would be great that could really be nice you know other than that i just want to say let's get to
2933480	2949400	the next battle of rationality versus relativism and remember philosophers keep battling
