0	1240	Hey again.
1240	5360	So this video is about the criticism I have of Paulo Grady's book on relativism.
5360	9240	So at very least a previous video with a summary of that book would be absolutely necessary
9240	11240	if you haven't watched the whole series.
11240	14920	And I know it may have already implied this, but seriously, once criticism is likely to
14920	19280	have actual weight, at least weight enough to even bother replying to, only if one has
19280	24120	actually done the reading, or in this case, actually watches the video properly that indicates
24120	25880	there was an entire series.
25880	29960	I really don't know what it is with the hubris of some of us to jump into like the 6th chapter
29960	34120	of a discussion and wonder why certain things are being spoken about or in a certain way
34120	38600	and why other things seem to be left out as if they hadn't been spoken about in great
38600	43360	depth in previous parts, or even ignoring how they were mentioned in that video itself
43360	44880	if it's watched well enough.
44880	49200	I mean, it's certainly one thing not to know that there were previous parts if nobody mentioned
49200	52800	it, but if I'm going through the trouble of mentioning the previous videos which I pretty
52800	57760	much always do and even often give full recap of each video and I don't know what to say
57760	58760	about that.
58760	69480	In any case, either way, this video is not going to be a great place for you to respond
69480	73440	to his arguments if I even bother mentioning them, it's just going to explain what actually
73440	76520	happened in his book Taken at Face Value.
76520	82480	So my criticism today is about how he presents himself versus what the book actually says,
82480	86920	in particular how open he presents himself to ontological relativism.
86920	92000	That is, relativism about the world, the properties or the furniture of reality, the account of
92000	93440	the world that we have.
93440	98760	He presents himself as very open, and I think he knows that if anyone attacks him, it would
98760	99760	be about ontology.
99760	104320	I say this because he kind of predicts that one might say that his principles are said
104320	109600	to be universal, so don't they constitute an exception to ontological relativity?
109600	113960	But he clearly answers that these principles are abstractions, codifications of a practice
114000	119200	that we do, they aren't entities themselves, they don't have an ontological status of
119200	124520	being universally existing in all ontologies, so no, it's not an exception.
124520	129440	Also by the way, they are abstracted principles, so it's not like they are written rules that
129440	131400	we observe and then follow.
131400	135520	No such things are written down anywhere, that doesn't exist as an entity or anything
135520	136520	like he was saying.
136520	141600	He is not even claiming that they are, it's just rather they articulate the nature of
141600	147040	that practice, which was the practice of being rational and deliberation, when we are thinking
147040	150200	about something, discussing it and judging, for example.
150200	154160	So if you're thinking he's wrong about rationality because there aren't written rules
154160	158280	somewhere that are then followed, well that would be misunderstanding about what's going
158280	159280	on here.
159280	162960	But more importantly, that's not what my issue is about at all.
162960	168560	To understand my criticism, let's look at what he says about the structure of his book.
168560	172960	At the very beginning of his book, he said, so the position staked out in this book is
172960	180800	one that denies relativism about truth, accepts a great deal of ontological relativity, and
180800	188080	a lesser amount of logical relativity resists radical epistemological relativity, and denies
188080	190360	relativism about reason.
190360	194680	So that's this kind of image that I made based on what he claimed, and I pretty much
194680	197680	showed an almost beginning of each of my videos.
197680	202240	But then after going thoroughly through his book and seeing how the various areas connect,
202240	204880	we actually end up with a very different picture.
204880	206040	This picture.
206040	210040	And there is no greater difference among these two pictures than how he presents himself
210040	217080	in one as accepting a great deal of relativism in ontology, or defending it, or even argued
217080	220200	for relativism about ontology.
220200	224280	Matter of fact, there's really only one place if I can recall where he uses a qualifier
224280	226360	of it being moderate.
226360	232040	But for the vast majority of cases, it's just open to ontological relativity, without
232040	236120	a distinction like moderate or limited or restricted or anything, distinctions that
236120	241600	he makes in other areas like logic or epistemology, but not in ontology.
241600	245000	I mean after having gone through the book when we clearly look at the book, it's actually
245000	250360	his core rationality providing at very least a minimum restraint against extreme relativism
250360	251600	in every section.
251600	255520	Yeah, in truth it provides a place where it's completely denied, but that's given
255520	259280	the precondition described in the truth video if you do want to check it out.
259280	262640	Either way, everywhere else, it's a minimum condition anyway.
262640	268480	Not like complete universal absolutism in some places and complete relativism in other places.
268480	273840	No, in fact, even in rationality itself, if you look at the rationality chapter, it's
273840	277500	just a minimum core that is universal anyway.
277500	282120	So he's actually open to relativism in all of these areas in a much greater sense than
282120	286520	the naivety of the traditional philosophers prior to him perhaps, but there is still a
286520	291880	minimum restriction in all of them and it's coming from his core rationality to everywhere
291880	298800	and as a result that makes him say it denies relativism, resisting radical relativism,
298800	303820	or that it only allows relativism in a very mitigated sense.
303820	309340	Then providing restriction and here's the contrast when it comes to ontology.
309340	315700	In the ontology chapter, not wanting to be charged as holding to Promethean anti-realism
315700	321220	and just making up whatever world we want as we go along, no restriction, but the ontological
321220	326300	relativist wants to hold that there are certain constraints on our thinking, we don't just
326300	328180	invent reality.
328180	332700	The realist is saying the constraint comes from the outside as in reality, that reality
332700	337140	constrains the theory of the world that we have at least to some degree, but the ontological
337140	342140	relativist for them, the discipline is an internal issue, not something imposed from
342140	343420	the outside.
343420	347900	Discipline and thought comes from proper methodology, from something such as a theory
347900	351500	of rational constraint, which is universal.
351500	356340	And that's his core figuring out here that he offers, in a way through epistemology.
356340	360940	In any case, it's pretty clear that there are restraints on ontology, certainly a variety
360940	365660	we are ruling out then is one that is the Promethean anti-realism, where we have no
365660	369860	restraint on our account of the world and we can just make up as we go along.
369860	373940	Someone might say though that that is the reason, because the restriction is internal
373940	378460	and not from a mind independent reality, that's why it's okay to just call it ontological
378460	383420	relativity and not mention any kind of qualifiers like limited or moderate or mitigated or anything
383420	384420	else.
384420	386300	But let's be clear about a few things first.
386580	391260	Firstly, there can be different levels of relativism within ontology, even if the extreme
391260	394860	one already has a name of Promethean anti-realism.
394860	399620	An example could be how we contrast the Strassonian limitation of cognitive capacities that we
399620	404380	have with Quine's seeming fluidity, or even actually contrasting the fluidity of Quine
404380	408620	with his later preference for a certain ontology, i.e. physics.
408620	412780	That was after all one of the tensions O'Grady points out in Quine's work.
412780	417380	So while they are of different strengths, they were all nevertheless internal restraints.
417380	420660	So a different degree of internal restraint does exist.
420660	424700	I mean, I think it's pretty clear if we are taking the ontological relativists at their
424700	430100	word and sourcing, or maybe outsourcing the restraint to epistemology, then there seems
430100	434900	to be a limitation depending on how much limitation there is in epistemology.
434900	439820	And there is certainly a limitation in epistemology according to O'Grady there, of different
439820	444940	degrees of how much relativism we could have in epistemology that we would select.
444940	450460	So why not by that nature say there are different degrees of limitation in ontology as well?
450460	453820	Certainly it wasn't complete relativism in epistemology.
453820	457700	There was a minimum restraint, that's why we called it moderate.
457700	462380	So then that should be worth noting that it means there is a restraint in ontology as
462380	463380	well.
463380	468380	It's precisely the reason why we mentioned it in truth, and in logic, and even in epistemology
468380	471060	where the restraint came from rationality.
471060	475940	That restraints do come in different strengths and are coming from another area still implies
475940	480380	that this area is restrained to different degrees, and that was a good enough reason
480380	485380	to still call it restraint against extreme relativism in other places like epistemology,
485380	487660	but he didn't do that for ontology.
487660	494020	Okay, so let's ask what does it mean to say that there is restraint if we did say it?
494020	500300	Well, one, for Ogrady it is possible that we may sometimes hold two sets of ontology
500300	501300	in tandem.
501300	506060	Two, Ogrady is open to the idea that worldviews can contradict.
506060	509760	After all, in the rationality chapter, when in discussion of how there can be different
509760	515180	empirically adequate metaphysical systems, he says, insofar as they, and he means chi
515180	520340	or the hopi metaphysical systems that he called absolutely developed worldviews, but
520340	525780	anyway, insofar as they are empirically adequate, they do not contradict empirical evidence.
525780	530740	However, they do cut against the materialistic or physicalistic metaphysics.
530740	534420	There is therefore an argument possible between two metaphysical systems.
534420	538100	So one, we can have two ontologies, two, they can contradict.
538100	541420	But also, three, one of them may be considered false.
541420	543100	They may be false.
543100	546820	So we can resolve this contradiction by considering one false.
546820	551340	So yeah, maybe it's not because of any metaphysical commitment to reality, but because of our
551340	556460	rational constraint that impacts what commitments we have to different ontologies.
556460	561940	Certainly he appears to admit that his core or his principles does govern our different
561940	565740	ontologies, as he says in his final chapter.
565740	571900	Whatever theory or ontology we deploy in interpreting and understanding reality is put together
571900	575020	under the governance of these principles.
575020	579700	So a certain kind of practice is regarded as universal, the practice of reasoning and
579700	580700	arguing.
580700	584060	This doesn't conflict with ontological relativism.
584060	589100	So here it is again, that he is saying in this line that it doesn't contradict with
589100	593780	ontological relativism because those principles aren't entities.
593780	597700	This line is after all taken from that exact same section earlier that I was quoting from
597700	601900	in the beginning, where he anticipated that kind of criticism, but at the same time he
601900	607660	is admitting here that our ontologies, and we can hold multiple, are governed by the principles
607660	609220	of core rationality.
609220	613420	But it's the same thing then as it was in logic or epistemology for example.
613420	618500	There is a core rationality that is governing there, and it was the basis by which we would
618500	623580	restrict against extreme relativism, carefully saying for logic that relativism would be
623580	628820	allowed but only in a mitigated sense, or in epistemology where it's by that restriction
628820	632540	just moderate epistemological relativism that is allowed.
632540	635940	So why is ontology being treated differently?
635940	641940	I mean it does mean something to mention that by rationality, even if not an appeal to external
641940	647580	mind-independent reality or anything, that we do rule against having contradictory ontologies,
647580	652060	or self-contradictory ontologies via our coherentist systems.
652060	658580	As such, valuing some, those with less contradiction, has greater than those with more contradictions,
658580	660560	so they're not equally viable.
660560	665940	As we examine them in our conscious deliberation, therefore not holding them as having equally
665940	667860	valuable status.
667860	672860	Perhaps some are more and some are less contradictory with other ontologies that we hold in tandem,
672860	678100	or within its own subsystem.
678100	683060	There is work being done here by rationality or the principles to limit ontologies, and
683060	688240	such is admitted and explicated in different places, for example in the epistemology chapter
688240	693020	when talking about different coherentist system, how it is restricting against the proliferation
693020	696660	of infinite number of coherentist systems that we may hold.
696660	701020	Or in another part of epistemology, the end where rationality being the means by which
701020	706120	we judge different A priori frameworks, that was explicitly explained as well.
706120	710320	So it is explicated, but not exactly in the way I just did now before.
710320	714460	The thing is, I'm just doing a little bit of hypothetical syllogism, you know, putting
714480	719760	things together to show and explicate the constraint that is an ontology based on his
719760	720760	work.
720760	724040	I mean, it's his work that suggests that this is the case, that that's what we do
724040	728040	with ontologies, but he doesn't spell it out for us like this.
728040	730520	For some reason I have to do that here.
730520	735760	I mean, I agree with it, but it's coming from my explication here, not his, even if
735760	738120	it is based directly on his work.
738120	742720	So what I disagree with, and what would have become very obvious had he explicated what
742740	748700	I just did, is how there is no distinction being given in ontology like there is in other
748700	754580	places for limited ontological relativism, or mitigated ontological relativism, versus
754580	760180	extreme or radical or stronger ontological relativism by Ogrady, in the most of the cases
760180	761860	that he presents himself.
761860	767300	So there is enough in this book from the structure itself, what it purports to say, what is happening
767300	772140	between these various areas and how they function together to see that what is described as
772160	778580	happening in other areas is also happening in a similar fashion in ontology, but in ontology
778580	781080	being described in a different way.
781080	782080	Why?
782080	783080	Hmm?
783080	786240	Some manipulative reason perhaps?
786240	787240	Hmmmm.
787240	794740	So the second part of my criticism is this kind of trick that seems to be happening.
794740	798680	I described it previously in the previous video how there's sort of different kind of relativists,
798680	803320	Which is in part what Ogrady is saying, we don't want to be a certain kind that is self-defeating.
803320	807160	But I suggested there's another kind which is one that doesn't know that stepping in
807160	812480	or pulling terms to avoid self-defeat still ends up in a place where they end up preventing
812480	814320	themselves from engagement.
814320	817800	As I mentioned, maybe in the previous video, this is what happened and this is the move
817800	824040	that was made against Barnes and Bloor, when they pulled terms using Mary Hess, I think,
824040	826080	with their balance of argument.
826080	830400	What you see the thing is, when Barnes and Bloor use terms like balance of argument or
830400	836080	empirical evidence, when they claim these things favor them and not the opposition, then they
836080	840880	obviously do mean them in a general sense outside of their position, or else there would
840880	844360	have been no efficacy in saying that they favored them in the first place.
844360	848400	And if not, there might be versions of balance of argument or empirical evidence that actually
848400	853400	weigh against them anyway, so there's no point in bringing up that theirs favor them.
853400	858540	And that's the reason why O'Grady says it seems clear that these terms are in fact intended
858540	860480	in a universal sense.
860480	864760	And it's not the only place where the effect of silence or lack of engagement is pointed
864760	868280	out when you pull terms like this, it happened in truth as well.
868280	872800	But it's being pointed out for O'Grady still is a reason to rule against relativism in
872800	877880	such places because of the effect of silence, since relativists do in fact want to engage
877880	879240	according to O'Grady.
879240	883440	So this technique didn't cut it for O'Grady in other places like truth or rationality.
883440	889760	But as I mentioned in the previous video, speaking in the ontology chapter itself about
889760	895040	one of the main ontological relativists discussed there, O'Grady says of Putnam, his argument
895040	898680	against extreme relativism is simply that it is self-refuting.
898680	903600	If one claims that each perspective is equally valid, then that very view is one among many
903600	909400	perspectives and it has no purchase on anyone else's position and may be safely ignored.
909400	914380	So the technique is mentioned there and why it doesn't work in ontology.
914380	918400	But to this, O'Grady just says that he will refer to other chapters and come back to what
918400	924080	epistemological or rational constraints can coexist with ontological relativism.
924080	928240	But first and foremost, he already did speak about the discipline coming from rationality
928240	931240	within this chapter, not really later.
931240	935920	But anyway, more importantly, it doesn't seem to even properly connect as a response
935920	937360	to what is said.
937360	942840	Why isn't the self-defeat or failure to engage rather nevertheless still pressed in response
942840	947960	to a relativist pulling terms in ontology like it is in other cases?
947960	950640	And they absolutely did do that in ontology.
950640	956240	The world, reality, ontology, properties, existence, all of it is pulled.
956240	961200	That was one of the main things that was done there in a way reducing ontology into epistemology.
961200	967360	It isn't clear why the restraint that is implied is only coexistence in ontology but
967360	968880	restriction in others.
968880	972960	So to make this clear about what I'm saying, just as I explained what restraint would mean
972960	977680	if it were explained in ontology, let me explain what would have happened if he didn't allow
977680	980560	this technique to work in ontology.
980560	982200	Ontology is relative.
982200	984920	Is itself a specific ontological view?
984920	990560	To say that we create our worldviews relative to our conceptual scheme is itself a worldview.
990560	994040	And it is being said as if in a non-relative sense.
994040	998240	It is being said as if in a general sense that is at least in a way that would oppose
998240	1002760	other ontologies such as one that says, for example, our account of the world is taken
1002760	1005280	directly from the properties of the world itself.
1005280	1007440	That's being opposed here.
1007440	1012680	To say our account of the world is exclusively relative to our internal working since there
1012680	1019240	is no meaning in speaking of an external influence is itself a claim about what is the case with
1019240	1020240	the accounts.
1020920	1026280	So we see this kind of counter in other areas but it's not being utilized here, biogradie,
1026280	1030960	and described as preventing extreme or radical ontological relativism.
1030960	1035240	If I may use some example, we pressed self-defeat in epistemology.
1035240	1037840	Each epoch judges itself.
1037840	1041600	One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they
1041600	1047160	seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.
1047160	1051080	One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared
1051080	1056480	among all of them, that one cannot judge among them, but in doing so they are speaking about
1056480	1060840	all of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common
1060840	1065280	and so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing
1065280	1067840	what they claim shouldn't be possible.
1067840	1072920	Or to defend Kuhn from being interpreted as using global K.I.
1072920	1079480	But Kuhn's own work itself shows that it is not global M.I. or K.I., or also would
1079480	1081440	have undermined his own work.
1081440	1084400	We saw this with Wartian Stitch and B.M.B.
1084400	1089480	Kuhn's work is describing different paradigms, as if from the outside of them.
1089480	1094440	If the claim is that terms cannot be understood outside the paradigm in which they are used,
1094440	1101320	then one cannot compare paradigms in the way Kuhn has done, or even used against McIntyre.
1102320	1107440	He says a significant challenge to universalism about rationality comes from McIntyre, who
1107440	1111960	espouses that there are different traditions of thought that embody their own criteria
1111960	1116280	of rationality and no neutral ground to evaluate them.
1116280	1119640	First off, the self-defeat, like we have seen many times now.
1119640	1126120	A quick response is to wonder which tradition McIntyre inhabits and how he manages to discuss
1126120	1132080	and evaluate the ideas of so many people from other apparently incommensurable traditions.
1132080	1136520	There are various areas where we notice the relativists are doing what they say they cannot
1136520	1141160	do, in order for them to take a position on matters where they are saying you can't take
1141160	1142160	a position.
1142160	1147280	But it isn't being used here in ontology to catch or prevent an extreme ontological
1147280	1151340	relativist in the ways that O'Grady suggests could happen in other places.
1151340	1152840	So why is he doing this?
1152880	1157520	Is he actually being tricked here or making a mistake, goofing up?
1157520	1161200	Well, I'm not capable of pointing out such an error, surely.
1161200	1165920	I am after all just a shadowy internet character after all.
1165920	1170640	But if I am right, then perhaps this was done on purpose.
1170640	1177080	Perhaps he is simply allowing for such a technique to work here and purposely portraying himself
1177080	1182220	as being more open than other areas to ontological relativism.
1182220	1183220	But why?
1183220	1184820	Why would he do that?
1184820	1189260	Why is ontological relativism getting such special treatment?
1189260	1193340	Well now, I made, if I think of it possibly, even a distasteful charge against O'Grady
1193340	1195140	at the end of the ontology video.
1195140	1196900	So I'm sorry that it is that way.
1196900	1199100	Again, it's probably my lack of understanding.
1199100	1200700	You know, my error here.
1200700	1201820	Surely it must be that.
1201820	1206380	But I think O'Grady absolutely does have enough tools in his arsenal within his book
1206380	1212660	to actually and has actually defended against ontological relativism of an extreme variety
1212660	1214380	in three different ways.
1214380	1218820	I have only presented two so far and the third one will come after this conclusion.
1218820	1224340	But instead he is purposely portraying himself as open to relativism in ontology just to
1224340	1226620	placate relativists.
1226620	1232580	By having an area they feel they are on good footing, a way of funneling relativists to
1232580	1236020	ontology away from other areas.
1236020	1240860	I'm actually prompted by him to see this as his motivation because of his insistence
1240860	1244660	that this is the best way to accommodate relativists.
1244660	1249460	About ontological relativism, he says at the very end of the ontological chapter, it appears
1249460	1254580	to be one of the best ways those attracted to the relativistic ideas can accommodate
1254580	1256460	that relativism.
1256460	1261580	And near the end of the book he says, much of what motivates people to accept relativism
1261580	1265660	can be accommodated by ontological relativism.
1265660	1270500	So in a way it appears that he's actually just placating relativists by not talking
1270500	1275700	about how he has actually restricted against ontological relativism in a number of ways.
1275700	1279540	So to be clear, I'm not disagreeing with him about the funneling, I agree with him
1279540	1283900	that many arguments for relativism, let's say in rationality for example, are only ever
1283900	1288780	really about conceptual or ontological relativity anyway when you actually analyze them.
1288780	1291780	And many relativists don't seem to recognize this because they're not very clear on which
1291780	1295020	relativism they're even talking about especially when they're presenting arguments.
1295100	1298540	And that's pointed out both by O'Grady and Philips, they talk about this kind of thing
1298540	1300300	but that's another thing anyway.
1300300	1306100	My issue here or claim is that while funneling into ontological relativism, he won't actually
1306100	1311180	mention that even in that area it is also just moderate relativism or restricted or
1311180	1312620	mitigated relativism.
1312620	1317820	Instead he portrays it as if his book is just openly accepting ontological relativism period
1317820	1321820	or just tentatively because he's not ruling against one way or another.
1321820	1327900	So I'm saying I think he does this on purpose to make the funneling just seem more acceptable
1327900	1332980	for the relativist, more appealing to do so, in a way purposely hiding the restrictions
1332980	1335220	that are in that area as well.
1335220	1340300	But you know, holding back attacks or defenses, just to make victories of yours in other areas
1340300	1345220	seem more acceptable to your opponents, which is a very maybe kind thing to do, I don't
1345220	1349460	know about emotions, but it does seem more like a psychological trick, a manipulative
1349460	1353900	technique played on the relativist than honest philosophic work.
1353900	1358220	Wow, are you saying O'Grady is being dishonest somehow?
1358220	1360660	That's not cool man, why would you say that?
1360660	1365820	Look, yeah I know, I know, okay listen, I don't know how else to feel about it though.
1365820	1369180	You know I very much love this book, it's very rich in texture, it goes through many
1369180	1373740	different philosophical discussions and discusses relativism in a very impactful way and that's
1373740	1377540	why I think there are such good lessons we can take from this book.
1377540	1379780	Even though I think there's a lot missing too.
1379780	1384380	But my issue would be that his stance ultimately leaves the work of discussing the role of
1384380	1389580	reality out and maybe we can talk about that more with Philips, but even that is a different
1389580	1395860	issue from what I'm actually criticizing here, based on his book, if we take it at face value.
1395860	1400580	And really my criticism isn't that massive in terms of his philosophy, which is largely
1400580	1405180	something I agree with, even if it is excluding or leaving open the discussion of reality playing
1405180	1409420	an important role in what we count as or think of as true or knowledge or facts.
1409420	1413840	In comparison to that, this is really a rather small criticism perhaps of just representing
1413840	1419340	oneself differently than one's work actually seems to be, so it could be an error in me
1419340	1424380	which is fine, I hope it is, but if it isn't then it's either some kind of error in his
1424380	1426900	work or purposely done.
1426900	1431300	It can't strictly be an error though because my criticism is about the way he's portraying
1431300	1434020	himself and I just find it misleading.
1434020	1439460	There is enough in his work to make movements against ontological relativism despite what
1439460	1440660	he says.
1440660	1445340	So again, my assessment is that O'Grady presents himself as much more relativistic than he
1445340	1449660	actually is based on the structure of his book, techniques of relativists that failed
1449660	1454580	in other areas but seem to work here, as well as one more reason that I'm going to cover.
1454580	1458100	I would agree with him that the middle ground is what this book is and I agree that the
1458100	1462620	middle ground between the extremes is a result of a more philosophically aware path and a
1462620	1465060	path of the future in philosophy.
1465060	1470020	And while this book is a little more favorably open to anti-realist philosophy than my position
1470020	1475860	would be, it's where he claims he lands on the middle path that does not seem to me to
1475860	1480060	be where the book itself actually is saying it is.
1480060	1484460	But now let's look at the most important component of my criticism that speaks about
1484460	1489420	ontology anyway and it will lead us into a discussion about what is left out in this
1489420	1491140	book.
1492140	1497220	You see this whole book, it's best case for the universal hinges on non-contradiction
1497220	1499940	and I doubt saying that is controversial at all.
1499940	1502820	And now we're going to see a little funny thing that can happen in philosophy, much
1502820	1507340	like it happened to Coon with just a few lines from his work leading to radical interpretation
1507340	1509340	as we have seen in the rationality video.
1509340	1513820	Well in this case it's a few words that O'Grady says when explaining assertion that
1513820	1516500	impacts a truth deeper than he discussed.
1516500	1522260	You see the argument for the principle of non-contradiction actually goes like this.
1522260	1527020	The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of
1527020	1529220	assertion and negation.
1529220	1534900	When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content, and then endorses
1534900	1536460	it as true.
1536460	1540700	This content holds that something in the world is in such a way.
1540780	1547700	Assertion also rules out various other things, namely the negation of that assertion.
1547700	1553140	So assertion implies the rejection of the negation of the assertion.
1553140	1558940	But a contradiction makes an assertion and simultaneously asserts the negation of that
1558940	1560580	first assertion.
1560580	1565980	Because of this, a contradiction undermines the very process of making an assertion.
1565980	1571300	To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.
1571300	1575260	Hence, contradictions must be avoided.
1575260	1581060	So the principle of non-contradiction is itself being defended in order to preserve the very
1581060	1583900	act of assertion, also negation.
1583900	1589900	So again despite what I am saying next, this defense is not about esoteric objective assumptions
1589900	1594020	or whatever have you assumptions about an ignorant or naive realist, that would be after
1594060	1598940	all a derogatory description and a philosophic failure to grasp the argument that's happening
1598940	1601340	here that Ogrady is offering.
1601340	1606300	The defense is actually based on what it even means to say anything meaningfully.
1606300	1612140	But that means it is actually the nature of assertion first that is really doing the work.
1612140	1616940	And thus why we cannot have contradiction, because it would undermine the very process
1616940	1619260	of assertion according to him.
1619260	1625420	So let's focus on assertion and ask again, what does assertion even mean according to
1625420	1626420	Ogrady?
1626420	1630140	How do we cash out this concept of assertion?
1630140	1633940	So I am going to read it again but slowly so we can really figure out what I am trying
1633940	1635420	to say here.
1635420	1642460	When one makes an assertion, one first of all expresses a content and endorses it as true.
1642460	1644980	Now the word true here, I am just going to leave alone.
1644980	1648420	I don't even think he needed to bring that up because it may introduce some questions
1648580	1651140	that he may not have wanted at that point in time.
1651140	1653060	But anyway that's not what I am doing.
1653060	1656900	I wonder what is expresses a content?
1656900	1658900	What is this content?
1658900	1666700	Well he says this content holds that something in the world is in such a way.
1666700	1673460	This line itself describes that assertion as fundamentally making an ontological claim,
1673460	1675500	a claim about the world.
1675500	1681900	The very act of assertion is actually inherently tied into issues of ontology to say that the
1681900	1687260	world is a certain way, in such a way.
1687260	1691980	That is the nature of all assertion and it may take some philosophic reflection to realize
1691980	1696460	it that there is an implicit claim about how things are and when we bother to say how things
1696460	1701380	are however qualified it is, there is some connection to a certain way in the general
1701380	1702380	sense.
1702380	1707140	We couple this with his explication of how we cannot escape the notion of general truth.
1707140	1712740	In all claims of speaking, even when you are talking about yourself, your sense, your feelings,
1712740	1715860	is an attempt to state reality as being in such a way.
1715860	1721020	However fallible and unjustified, this attempt to do so is a necessary component.
1721020	1726860	All claims involve content that is conversationally intended to be about the world being a certain
1726860	1732180	way, stating what is the case in such a way that rules out the opposite of what one is
1732180	1733820	saying.
1733820	1740060	This is the philosophic eye, the recognition of what it even means to take a position,
1740060	1744620	to make an assertion, to speak of anything in any field.
1744620	1747100	That's why I sometimes call it metaphysical.
1747100	1752700	I'm not saying the eye exists as an entity somewhere ontologically, there's no magical
1752700	1755180	spiritual superpowers I'm talking about here.
1755180	1762420	I'm just theatrically presenting this philosophic awareness as an eye, an eye for its recognition
1762420	1768580	that philosophers recognize certain necessities in order to take a position at all.
1768580	1773180	And so this eye would activate or just notice and recognize that one is trying to take a
1773180	1776140	position that would undermine doing so.
1776140	1778460	Let's look at some of that activation.
1778460	1781580	No one can say anything at all.
1781580	1783500	Then how did you say that?
1783500	1786340	No one should be denied at all.
1786340	1790020	So aren't you denying those who would deny?
1790020	1793460	We can only speak about ourselves.
1793460	1796140	Then how are you speaking about others now?
1796140	1800260	I disagree with the idea that disagreement is possible.
1800260	1802660	Then how are you disagreeing?
1802660	1805660	No one can speak in the general sense.
1805660	1808540	Then why is that in the general sense?
1808540	1811140	No one can objectively evaluate.
1811140	1814260	Then how did you make that evaluation?
1814260	1818300	We should no longer take any philosophic positions.
1818300	1822300	That is itself a philosophic position.
1822300	1825420	Philosophy is garbage and pointless.
1825420	1829380	Is itself your philosophic position?
1829380	1832820	Philosophy is garbage and science is the best.
1832820	1836900	That itself is philosophy, philosophy of science.
1836900	1840340	Talking with any authority is not possible.
1840340	1844180	And what's your authority behind saying that?
1844180	1849100	Whether it's based on reason or evidence, empirical structures, logic, whatever it is,
1849100	1854700	however which way we feel the need then or ability to participate in the battlefield,
1854700	1859940	that becomes something that shouldn't also at the same time be at risk when we are there,
1859940	1862460	at very least, by us.
1862460	1867060	So do not be tricked by the extreme relativists to shoulder the burden of providing something
1867060	1873580	impossible in objective language or in objective observation or absolute anything.
1873580	1877820	They are powerful enough to attack anything that comes across them in a certain way and
1877820	1881420	that's the way that they're going to continue to emphasize and always see.
1881420	1885540	And so they will claim that everything is relative ignoring the assumptions made in
1885540	1886980	their own claim.
1886980	1891700	There is a necessary assumption that something of what I bothered to say when I make an assertion
1891700	1897700	about how things are, whether currently or forever inexplicable or not, conveys something
1897700	1904220	about reality beyond the individual speaking and taking a stance in order to engage.
1904220	1909620	That even if a proposition is completely relative, in that the proposition is relative to many
1909620	1910620	factors.
1910620	1915100	Sure, but there is an assumption that one of those things that it is relative to is
1915100	1919620	a shared reality as a medium to whomever I am speaking with.
1919620	1924420	That there is something of my assertion that has to do with how the world is in a certain
1924420	1931140	way, beyond that which is created by my mind alone and thus ruling out the opposite way
1931140	1932940	at the same time.
1932940	1938380	This section of this video, the philosophic eye, I would like you to couple with my video,
1938380	1943300	the my move video which is a part of the Kirk series so you may have to watch the Kirk series
1943300	1944580	to really appreciate it.
1944580	1949460	But if you connect the my move video from that series with this part of this video, I would
1949500	1953460	really appreciate it, please maybe rewatch that one or check it out or something, but
1953460	1958780	you will see how there is a deep, socially ethical aspect of this as well.
1958780	1962140	And there certainly is these kind of social and ethical aspects which O'Grady doesn't
1962140	1965340	do too much a discussion of, but we will get to next.
1965340	1970220	But as a preview, the more powerful relativists often discussed here in O'Grady's version
1970220	1975540	use philosophies to talk about how things are relative to a society, to a community.
1975540	1980780	But in such a view, the existence of a society or the community is implicit in such a philosophy
1980780	1983220	and so it is not in question.
1983220	1989020	And in a way that definitely would contradict the individualist based extreme relativists.
1989020	1992780	Even though they don't really account for that, I've encountered some people who would
1992780	1996820	immediately agree with, as I say, any kind of relativism, so they would immediately agree
1996820	2002260	with extreme individualistic based relativism even though that relativism may be in contradiction
2002260	2007220	with community based relativisms which are the more powerful varieties, seemingly ones
2007220	2010940	that are based on actual philosophers' writings in history and so on.
2010940	2014940	Anyway, the move to more powerful relativism then definitely makes it even more favorable,
2014940	2019220	the kind of point I was making there, that it will connect important ways to the point
2019220	2024220	I made about the conversational standards of behaving as if committed to a metaphysical
2024220	2031580	reality of another's existence and the independent agency of others outside of you and your own
2031580	2033380	personal perception.
2033380	2041260	Now of course relativists may say, oh, okay, so it's just a necessary assumption for conversations.
2041260	2042500	So what?
2042500	2048180	That doesn't really mean there is a mind-independent reality, let alone any argument for the ability
2048180	2051900	for our language to convey non-relative reality.
2051900	2056420	So really, reality is still relative.
2056420	2063540	Well, welcome back relativists to the realist world where conversational standards don't
2063540	2069700	hold light against our concern for what really is the case.
2069700	2073060	That's actually a deep cut if you get what was done in ontology, so I hope you get the
2073060	2076420	joke because, you know, they were trying to pull terms in an important way and try to
2076420	2080380	make things more about the conversational standards rather than a discussion of metaphysical
2080380	2084860	reality beyond them, but that move really didn't help them and that's part of basically
2084980	2089820	the reason why I think this book is so good, because it connected the principle of non-contradiction
2089820	2094580	to the nature of assertion, the nature of communicating with others rather than what
2094580	2099340	is typically assumed, you know, metaphysical commitments, philosophers, traditional stuff.
2099340	2103220	Anyway, it's still rather important to note that many of the elements aren't made by
2103220	2107860	O'Grady or myself, they have been around for a while as I mentioned self-defeat and
2107860	2112180	incoherence of certain forms of relativism have been known for thousands of years, even
2112260	2117260	to many well-known relativists themselves and even this connection of the defense based
2117260	2121340	on assertion rather than a transcendental structure building you could actually see
2121340	2126580	in the positivist's writing, which O'Grady was probably heavily influenced by given he
2126580	2130900	wrote a whole book about him, but it's how O'Grady wrote it and put it all together
2130900	2135500	in the various fields that I really liked and yet for maybe that exact same reason of
2135500	2141220	the positivist's influence he didn't really draw out or address the ontological implications
2141220	2146500	and so that may be the tension of his own work for claiming to be open to ontological
2146500	2149140	relativism a great deal.
2149140	2151860	Let me give you some of my closing remarks now.
2151860	2155980	There are more criticisms I could have of O'Grady of course and I do have, but those
2155980	2160340	are mainly about what is left out and that being a discussion at least of Wittgenstein
2160340	2164800	in a more general sense that was mostly absent if not soft in this book.
2164800	2168780	This book was more kind of quine heavy and ironically I think it could have explicated
2168780	2172780	a more middle ground or more nuanced position if we could have actually taken a closer look
2172780	2173980	at Wittgenstein.
2173980	2177460	It really does highlight the difference between someone who thinks Wittgenstein's philosophy
2177460	2182820	leads to some radical relativism and someone who understands how that isn't so at all
2182820	2187460	as Patrick Phillips may say does violence to the spirit of Wittgenstein.
2187460	2191820	Phillips specifically looks closely at Wittgenstein and uproots misinterpretations of him from
2191820	2196060	relativistic thinkers, but hey O'Grady said he was on the one hand trying to be general
2196060	2200560	and cover a more broad range of things and a more surfaced way even though this is definitely
2200560	2202980	far too textured for somebody new to philosophy.
2202980	2207360	Anyway, it's still rather clear that if you were trying to give a full treatment of relativism
2207360	2212420	everywhere then this book would be way freaking massive, so I'm glad it's not.
2212420	2216800	Anyway, so that's my criticism and the explanation of the power that I promised you.
2216800	2222620	You may agree with O'Grady or disagree in ways that I have about what is necessary in
2222620	2225020	order to take a position at all.
2225020	2230420	But the power is at very least to recognize that there is something necessary and therefore
2230420	2235740	not relative in order to take a position at all or at least is necessary for those who
2235740	2241580	are in combat or in conversation or sharing among each other in a shared way.
2241580	2245820	And your philosophic eye will hopefully now activate whenever you hear someone or some
2245820	2250940	other warrior saying or doing something on the basis of what they are attacking.
2250940	2254680	So we're going to Phillips next and I have spoken a lot about him already, you know without
2254680	2258200	perfect citations, so forgive me for that, I'll get to it when I do cover him.
2258200	2261080	But when we do get to it, we are going to be forced into talking about some politics
2261080	2263880	and there's some politically related stuff in this philosophy.
2263880	2268360	But please understand that a far more nuanced understanding elevates a conversation philosophically
2268360	2273400	from kind of typical tribalistic political talk is definitely more complicated than the
2273400	2277680	reductive simplicity that would aid tribalism a lot in any case.
2277680	2281600	I will be clear about what I'm saying later if it hasn't already been made to some of
2281600	2286260	us, I know there are a number of places where I've given like clues.
2286260	2291440	Join us, good warrior, for we travel now to see the insights of Patrick J.J. Phillips.
2291440	2295160	Then finally, after all this time, return to the battlefield of fellow sigh, philosophy
2295160	2299800	of science, and explain how these science wars are impacting the world to this very
2299800	2300800	day.
2300800	2305880	Oh, and I'm sorry I never actually properly covered Davidson, Davidson versus Ogrady is
2305880	2309520	something that I said I would do and something that Ogrady talked about in this book and
2309520	2311080	so I never really covered it.
2311080	2315760	I'm actually very attracted to some of Davidson's arguments, so maybe one day I can cover specifically
2315760	2320920	Ogrady versus Davidson after I take a closer look at Davidson directly instead of just
2320920	2325280	relying on what Ogrady says, because right now I can't recall from Davidson what Ogrady
2325280	2327160	says and what he was referring to.
2327160	2331160	But you know, there's also so much I promise to do, I pop anyway.
