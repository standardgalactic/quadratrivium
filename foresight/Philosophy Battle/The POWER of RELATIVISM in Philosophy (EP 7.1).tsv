0	6000	Relativism. It is one of the most powerful modern philosophic weapons. Its power is immense,
6000	12240	however it can become dangerous if wielded to extreme degrees, by those with insufficient
12240	18560	philosophic understanding. While it can be traced back to ancient times, it is philosophies from
18560	24720	five different great philosophers that are noted to have been imbued into this weapon,
24800	31280	empowering it into the modern philosophic warfare. Relativism is most useful in carving out the
31280	38400	layers of presumed objectivity and the naivety of our old ways. We use relativism now as more
38400	44320	a clear path to being skeptical about all sorts of claims, not just who makes the best pizza,
44320	50640	or even what is right and wrong, but now, even what we may have previously called facts.
51440	56480	And so this weapon becomes incredibly crucial for any good philosophic warrior to appreciate its
56480	65840	power, but equally important, also its limits. And ignoring those limits can create dangerous and
65840	71760	frustrating enemies for us on the battlefield. We must learn to wield relativism to become
71760	78320	good philosophers, to question, to be skeptical of all sorts of claims to objectivity. We must use
78320	85760	it whenever it can be used, but we must also be cautious and not be impatient in our journey to
85760	93200	investigate cases where perhaps it cannot. The limits of its use. So today we're gonna explain
93200	100000	those two things, the power and limits of this tremendous philosophic weapon called relativism.
100800	106000	Which is why we came here to the battlefield of metaphysics in the first place, so we can dismantle
106400	112080	it and see more than merely a blur of all it can destroy, to see that it indeed does have limits
112080	119280	and indeed does become volatile when those limits are crossed. Limits that we will later point out,
119280	125280	if it should be crossed by those on the battlefield of the philosophy of science in particular,
125840	134560	when we get back to the battlefield science, if we ever get back. Anyway, we'll be looking at
134560	140720	the power and limits as explained and set out in this green book, Relativism by Paul O'Grady.
140720	146320	In the last episode we looked at a battle in this red book, Relativism and Reality by Robert Kirk,
146320	152000	because I wanted to make a social point. You see, as it is clearly outlined in all three books I may
152000	157520	want to cover on relativism, including this blue book, The Challenge of Relativism by Patrick J.J.
158320	166000	most find relativism alluring for social reasons. Because we want to be open and tolerant to people
166000	172160	of different perspectives, different viewpoints, and understanding from different political spheres,
172160	178320	different cultures, races, genders, and so on. But if we jump into it, guns ablazing as the
178320	184080	phrase goes, without sufficient philosophical understanding first, one might hastily end up
184080	190480	wielding relativism to an unlimited degree such that one takes the position that everything is
190480	198720	relative. Even truth, yep, knowledge, truth, reality, everything. And that's what we might call
198720	205680	an extreme relativist. So while I personally find those in the pursuit of tolerance, not just noble
205680	212880	but necessary, I present extreme relativism as a terrible strategy in that pursuit. Now it might
212880	217520	sound kind of ridiculous right now, like who would think that say oh I don't know that literal
217520	224160	scientific facts are relative. It does happen though, it did happen, and probably it still will
224160	230880	happen. But we will explain in this video how this weapon appears to become even that powerful
230880	237840	as wielded by sophisticated relativists, with seemingly good reasons. In any case, Robert Kirk
237840	243440	in a section of that red book that I have here took an unsophisticated version of that extreme
243440	248640	relativist that's known as the true for me relativist, or if you're fancy the protagorean
248640	254720	relativist. Anyway for that version of the extreme relativist, there is no truth, there is just whatever
254720	260640	is true for me or true for you. So what counts as truth depends on the personal perspective of the
260640	266000	speaker. Though at first it may have seemed kind of funny, but we actually encounter people who
266080	271440	hold this kind of belief at all levels of society, not just in the philosophy classrooms,
271440	276240	people use this to express their truths about politics, religion, and even about
276240	282560	literal states of the world, facts, and so on. From the newsroom to the bar conversation,
282560	288800	arguing over global warming, alternative medicine, or even if the dragon eater sports team should have
288800	294880	won the golden cup. True for me is often used to speak without trying to offend others or tell
294880	300000	others that they are wrong for having a different position, or perhaps just to hold on to what you
300000	306160	believe despite evidence shown otherwise. And I go over a few different reasons why people do this
306160	312720	in that Robert Kirk video series, episode 6. Now back in that last episode though, episode 6,
312720	318160	in that battle Kirk shows that this position of saying everything is just true for me or true for
318160	325440	you actually can't support the idea that everything is relative, but also that in trying to defend
325440	331760	against Kirk's attacks, the extreme relativist also becomes further committed to a path that leads
331760	338800	them to becoming a solipsist. What is a solipsist? It's thinking that you're the only one that exists,
338800	345280	that there are no other minds, just one mind, just you. Everything else is just a presentation around
346240	350560	you. Please check out that last episode if you like to see how TFM, true for me,
350560	357200	relativism leads to solipsism. But from there Kirk does show that that too,
357200	363280	solipsism, is a position that doesn't support this assertion, and I thought that was a pretty cool
363280	370720	philosophic move to do. But then I made my own move to re-explain why true for me or TFM leads to
370720	377840	solipsism in my own way. And then that a solipsist's position isn't actually open and tolerant,
377840	383680	that actually, while you may have started out as a relativist for those good noble reasons of
383680	389120	tolerance and openness that I agree with, that if you stay committed to TFM and become a solipsist,
389760	395760	it's actually close-minded, selfish, intolerant position that denies the agency of others,
395760	401520	and even defies the grasp of the very concept of otherness. Instead of bringing understanding
401520	407360	from different perspectives together, they actually become a segregationist of sorts,
407360	414240	preventing any real engagement with otherness, thus becoming exactly what they hate, opposing the
414240	421600	very heart or organs of why they wanted to be a relativist in the first place. Again, if you think
421600	426160	that's kind of interesting, and would like to see how all that happened, you can check out that
426160	432000	series of videos here. I'll put the links below in the description. And if you were or will be
432000	438640	influenced by my move made in that video, well, you know, even though this is a YouTube video and
438640	443760	not an academic source, you know, I'm just a shadowy nobody here, but please still credit that
443760	449200	video in some way, at least in the footnotes. It's about intellectual honesty, you know? Also,
449200	454480	that way, if I say anything wrong and you're influenced by it, others will know why, and blame
454480	460000	can also fall on my shoulders. And hopefully that might bring some other philosophers to come battle
460000	465760	me over it. And surely one of us will learn something from that battle. Anyway, that version of the
465760	471520	relativist isn't actually the more powerful version that philosophers battle against. So,
471520	476480	I ended up promising that we would go and move on to bigger, badder relativists,
476480	480400	ones who are actually empowered by arguments from philosophers themselves.
480960	487920	Those five that I mentioned earlier are the ones that Paul O'Grady specifically notes. For him,
487920	493680	it's actually one of three tendencies that showed up in the different areas of philosophy,
493680	501280	pushing out this more modernized weapon. So, here we are today looking at the imbuing of this power,
501280	506400	the three tendencies that includes ideas from these five philosophers.
507360	512400	Briefly, in Paul O'Grady's book, he has a general outline that looks like this. Here,
512400	516640	we will find the philosophies that helped embolden these relativists and empower that
516640	524880	relativist weapon. This is what this video will cover now, the power. Here and here, O'Grady draws
524880	532400	the limits of relativism, at truth and rationality. Now, on logic, relativism is sort of allowed in
532400	538480	the sense that it is allowed on a lower order, but I will explain that later. Relativism, however,
538480	544160	for O'Grady, is allowed in ontology. I find this much has to do with the basis of conceptual
544160	550800	relativity, but we won't be covering it for our purposes right now. Also, some relativization
550800	556880	is allowed in epistemology, but limited by the amount set out in chapter 5, limits on
556880	563520	relativism about rationality. Today though, we'll go over some of that power, as I promised. It may
563520	568960	seem kind of quick though, because O'Grady seems more about wanting to point out the sources of
568960	574880	this power than actually getting into with examples what those sources really are that gave it the
574880	581360	power. So hopefully at times I can assist there. Also, don't worry if it's a bit fast. In each
581360	586240	place, each battle, later on that we cover, the philosophic arguments from the actual
586240	592240	philosophic thought is often addressed anyway, and sometimes the philosophers are other than these
592240	599600	five. But one in particular, I will be doing myself, in an additional video, to help explain
599600	606080	so that people really understand why simply thinking literalism, or scientific physical
606080	612640	descriptions, is not actually strong enough to oppose this relativist, whose weapon has been
612640	618080	empowered by these five philosophers. After that, we'll move on to talk about each of the chapters
618080	625440	that include the limits of relativism, and the battles therein. So this part, power, may not
625520	631440	have much battle itself, but it is a look at that weapon that will be in play in the battles here
631440	637440	after. Finally, after all this, I will give my overall evaluation of the book, and maybe then
637440	641600	I'll touch on some of the chapters that I left out. So let's get to it.
642960	647920	Philosophy battle. The most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet,
647920	653200	probably. Now entering the battlefield of metaphysics.
656000	658000	Oh, light switch.
660320	662560	Oh, uh, I'm gonna keep this on.
664480	665760	Hmm, whoa.
668880	674080	That's better. Here is Paul O'Grady. That's not really him. That's just an image I made.
674080	678480	Support me on Patreon, or make a direct contribution to me on PayPal.
678480	682560	Who will give us a little history lesson that will lead us to explaining the powers of this
682560	688400	weapon. And to be clear, as he says it in his preface, he is more going to cover this topic
688400	694400	in an analytic tradition than a continental one. And also, he's not going to be covering Einstein,
694400	698640	which doesn't really have to do with what we're talking about here. Anyway, let's begin.
698640	706960	Long ago in the land before time. Oh, okay, wait. That was just me, not him. Listen, whenever I'm
706960	712080	speaking for O'Grady, it will be sited down to the line on the bottom of the screen. Unless I say
712080	718160	otherwise. That way, you know I make up nothing. And if I misinterpreted anything, you know exactly
718160	724320	which line I didn't do justice. Also, you will know that when I do say something from my own opinion
724320	729120	or my own information offered here, you won't misinterpret it as if he were saying it,
729120	734480	because then the citation will just disappear when it's me talking. Okay? That's how we roll in
734480	740320	philosophy battle. Citation down to the line. But on the other hand, while I am siding everything
740320	745920	down to the line, it will be my interpretation or my paraphrasing of what is being said, unless of
745920	750800	course I actually put it up in quotes on the screen. And it might be shifted just a tiny bit
750800	756320	in order to make sense for this video. Anyway, in the 20th century, there was the linguistic
756320	762880	turn in philosophy. Oh, wait. So this happened in large part because of a guy named Fraga,
762880	769280	who kind of tried to make a more scientific or math-like perfect language to do philosophy in.
769280	774480	It kind of looked like this. And hopefully we can talk about Fraga at length later. But anyway,
774480	780240	crudely crunched down for you guys now. Basically, traditional discussions about what is knowledge
780240	787600	turned into what can we say is true. And from that to how can sentences about the world,
787600	794960	i.e. propositions, be true. And how do they relate to each other? What even counts as a proposition?
795040	799760	Doesn't all information need to be in some sort of language? And if the world is made up of
799760	805920	information, is there an inherent language of reality? Or on the other hand, isn't language
805920	812800	a tool of communicating among different people? And so this linguistic turn led to a social turn
812800	818880	because language brings into the account of the social context that the language is created in.
818880	824560	And because there are different societies, previously stable philosophical concepts about
824560	832400	truth, meaning, ontology, knowledge, they became unstable. To be clear, I'm dealing
832400	838400	not with moral relativism, what's right and wrong, good or bad. I'm interested in cognitive
838400	845600	relativism. Relativism about things like truth, reality, and knowledge. Everything that isn't
845600	853760	aesthetics, like tastes or beauty and art, or morals, ethics, right and wrong. So in my terminology,
853760	860720	the opposite of relativism is absolutism. So, ferrogradi relativism is the opposite of absolutism,
860720	866640	just as the subjective would be opposite to objective. Just keep that in mind in case an
866640	873280	imperfect philosopher uses the term objective as opposite relative instead, as is my preference,
873280	879680	I tend to do this. But anyway, saying something is relative is saying that it comes from or is
879680	886000	determined or dependent on something else. For example, saying something is big, big relative
886000	892960	to what? To me or to an ant or to the planet Uranus. Big is a relative term that depends on
892960	899280	something else here. Something absolute is independent and doesn't require a relationship
899280	904560	to anything else. Ogrady then describes three traditions that in the beginning seemed more
904560	910960	unified, that later split with little contact in between them. He describes them as the English
910960	917120	based tradition of Russell, Wittgenstein, Ryle, and Austin, the American based tradition of James,
917120	922960	Lewis, Quine, and Putnam, and while they had little contact with each other, they pretty much
922960	928720	practically completely left alone the Husserl, Heidegger, Sacher, Derrida tradition, which Ogrady
928720	933680	doesn't call that tradition by any particular geographical name, but I would guess on that
933680	939200	basis he would call it the continental tradition therefore. Yet some tendencies began to emerge
939200	946000	among all sides and aided in the rise of cognitive relativism. Relativism about even those things.
946800	952720	Here are three of those tendencies that started emerging independently from different places.
952720	957600	Rejecting the theory practice dichotomy, rejecting the fact value dichotomy,
957600	965200	and framework ideas, which come from those five philosophers. So first let's deal with
965200	967680	rejecting the theory practice dichotomy.
979600	986320	In ancient times, morals, morality was just as much a part of the world in how the world is.
986880	993360	With technological and scientific advancement studying nature though, it left behind questions
993360	1000320	of behavior and human conduct. The investigation of nature actually pulled apart from that of
1000320	1008080	morality. The discussions of nature became disconnected to that of morals. A split appeared
1008080	1013760	in the kinds of knowledge we had. On the one hand we had the objective reliable nature,
1013760	1019920	on the other hand we had the subjective moral society and religion. So there was a realm of the
1019920	1027200	world that existed independent of us, that science investigated, and the human world that was dependent
1027200	1033680	on us. Philosophical conceptions developing from this reflected that split between a world
1033680	1040000	independent of human input, as reality, and a world dependent on human beings like morals,
1040000	1046480	ethics, and behavior. And he says what I suppose as it was taken at the time, that genuine knowledge
1046480	1052320	is knowledge of that which is there independent of our knowing of it, knowledge of what was there
1052320	1059760	anyway. Human knowledge is an effort to adequately capture or represent this reality. Philosophers
1059760	1065600	working within this built the conception of primary and secondary qualities. This is going to sound
1065600	1070720	a lot like the legendary John Locke now. Primary qualities were aspects of reality that were
1070800	1077440	independent of human cognition, like shape, motion, and mass. Things that are taken to be there as they
1077440	1083360	are even if no minds were around to perceive them. And then there were secondary qualities,
1083360	1090160	like color, sounds, and so on. Things that are dependent on our awareness of them. So like vibrations
1090160	1097280	in the air hitting my eardrum technically doesn't need to invoke consciousness, but actually hearing
1097280	1103520	sound does. To this day these appear to many as fundamentally different things. Like the difference
1103520	1109920	between the mind actually seeing the color red is thought to be fundamentally different, koalia,
1109920	1115760	than the mere detection of say 430 terahertz on the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.
1115760	1121840	So one set of phenomena was part of the furniture of the world itself, and the other are products of
1122720	1130080	products. And the other are products of human receptivity and dependent on human cognition.
1130800	1136640	Now it was taken to be that investigations of nature while helpful to make technology that
1136640	1142880	can be used for certain purposes by our society that the actual investigation of nature itself
1142880	1149760	was still nevertheless pure for the sake of truth itself. So you know they felt it was still
1149760	1155360	objective. That sure we made technology and make use of knowledge for different things depending
1155360	1159600	on our society based on the particular parts of the world we're in or in different periods of
1159600	1164800	history with certain levels of technology and advancement let's say. But at least practicing
1164800	1172480	the method of gaining knowledge of nature itself, practicing science, was still objective. But then
1172480	1179120	this came under attack from different areas in the 20th century. Scientists are members of society too,
1179120	1186240	like anyone else. Influenced by fashion, economics, politics, social status, etc. And also science
1186240	1192480	itself doesn't actually turn out to be so clear a systemic progression in its study with rules and
1192480	1198400	methods as it turns out. History in fact shows us that it's actually full of chance and lucky
1198400	1204240	screw-ups. But so what? One may say that despite still living in a messy human world, scientists
1204240	1210560	are still able to pull out the goods, unpolluted absolute conception of reality. As in the sentiments
1210560	1216400	yeah maybe how and why we get the knowledge is relative to the time and society we're in but
1216400	1222240	still like the knowledge itself was still objective right? Well to that Paulo Grady says
1222240	1229120	there's still a bigger challenge, a massive skeptical challenge. The sentiments that if such a
1229120	1236320	pure dehumanized picture of reality is the goal of inquiry, how can we ever reach it?
1236320	1243360	Surely we would inevitably infect it with human subjectivity in our efforts to grasp it. Imagine
1243360	1249280	knowledge is like a snowball or something super soft and we live in a blind world. To know it we
1249280	1256720	would have to grab it but by grabbing it we change sort of what it is. We forced our impression onto
1256720	1263680	it. We can't really know what it is on grasp. It's always going to be affected not just in
1263680	1271600	order to observe it but by observing it, by conceptualizing it, by knowing it. Things can't
1271600	1277600	be observed without a perspective from which we perceive so how could anything be known in ways
1277600	1284320	beyond a particular perspective? One might feel well we will never really have knowledge then of
1284320	1290640	reality itself. It will always be infected by us therefore. Now there's also a different conception
1290640	1296400	of objectivity which is inter subjectivity. That is the objective is just that which the
1296400	1301360	reasonable people agree upon. Well I'm not going to touch this for now but I just want to note
1301360	1307760	there's much to say about this to think of later on but anyway still even with this conception it
1307760	1313440	involves that for them while we do get in touch with a reality independent of human thought
1313440	1319520	but mediated via human thought. Now what this has to do with relativism is that reality can be
1319520	1326000	mediated in different ways. Representations of the same objective reality can be different
1326000	1331520	depending on the concepts we use to think about it. Different features of reality come to the
1331520	1338000	fore as we deploy different sets of concepts to deal with it. Quoting here, philosophers from
1338000	1344080	different traditions such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger and William James came to hold versions of this
1344080	1350000	view which are framework ideas but O'Grady will talk about them later more closely. In any case
1350000	1357120	this all goes against the idea that our practice or doing science or anything is somehow not altered
1357120	1363520	by our theories or our concepts which are relative to the type of creatures we are. How much we already
1363520	1370080	know, what we are still ignorant of, what time and place our society is based in etc and therefore
1370080	1375520	from different societies it would mean differences in our practice and concepts but I think this
1375520	1384080	issue is being kind of muddled with the next failing dichotomy so let's look at that now. Rejecting the fact value dichotomy.
1384480	1399360	The idea of facts is connected to the idea of an absolute conception of reality
1399920	1407280	as if they are independent, objective, solid, reliable and is contrasted with the subjective
1407280	1415120	unreliable things like feelings and desires. One of the big changes is the idea of value
1415120	1422480	no longer being inherently in certain things like gold but instead something we project
1422480	1429120	onto certain things. A way human beings have been coloring the facts so we could split language into
1429120	1435280	a descriptive vocabulary that just says what the facts are and an evaluative vocabulary that reports
1435280	1442800	how we feel about those facts. This is a fact value split. Facts are supposed to exist as if
1442800	1449840	independently of the mind but in order for a human to know a fact it has to be conceptualized by the
1449840	1456800	human mind. We dress the world in concepts in order to think of it. The world doesn't automatically
1456800	1463840	conceptualize itself. Throughout our own history we've created concepts to help describe the world
1463840	1469680	and the concepts we create pick out the things we are interested in. For example we use concepts
1469680	1476160	related to our senses. Take color. We had color concepts only for the part of the visual spectrum
1476160	1481680	that we can see before learning about light and how much bigger the spectrum is. There were no
1481680	1487360	concepts to discriminate the spectrum beyond what we saw. So before we may have only thought about
1487360	1493440	you know red, green and blue, yellow etc. We didn't even have the concepts to differentiate between
1493440	1499760	say infrared and ultraviolet for example until after we learned more about light. With this
1499760	1505440	we can still say that there are facts that are either true or false but what counts as a fact
1505440	1513200	also depends in part on us both in whether we have concepts to describe it but also if it even fits
1513200	1520320	with everything else that we already know. We can decide if something counts as a fact or not
1520320	1525600	if it fits with everything else we already know about the world. Our decision on saying
1525600	1530720	something as a fact is therefore based on a number of considerations that are actually
1530720	1538800	value laden. Value laden which means something like soaked in our values. If soaked or endowed
1538800	1543520	with our interests. Interests like whether or not it makes our theories more simple,
1543520	1548800	coheres with the facts, allows for greater generalizations etc. Things that will help
1548880	1555120	us make further predictions. These things aren't in the facts themselves, they're values where
1555120	1561920	human interests enter the picture. Now this alone doesn't make a fact subjective, just what counts
1561920	1568560	as an objective fact isn't independent of the subjective mind. So there's actually two pictures
1568560	1573920	here, an old picture where the world exists totally independent of the human mind constructing
1573920	1580320	anything and the mind merely mirrors that. And now a more recent picture where the mind is in
1580320	1587040	some way to some degree constructing the world that we live in. So this more recent picture
1587040	1593280	allows for describing the world in multiple ways since people could have different values,
1593280	1599920	thus their accounts of the facts will differ. Now anti-relativists will want to say it can't
1599920	1604880	be varied all that much, there's a limit to how different they can be, and we can work towards
1604880	1611440	unifying a picture of reality. But the relativists focus more on the differences themselves, that
1611440	1617600	they can't unify different versions of the world. And one of the ways that they do this is by using
1617600	1622800	the idea that the world is mediated through a structure that yields different accounts of
1622800	1629200	reality to us relative to that structure. And different terms are used by the relativists
1629200	1636960	for this structure such as conceptual scheme, paradigm, linguistic framework, and language
1636960	1643840	games. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to make that sound too spooky. I'm actually laughing with joy
1643840	1648960	because paradigms and language games are two that I feel reasonably comfortable talking about.
1648960	1655040	And the latter is often spooky because of its misunderstanding and again which I feel I can
1655040	1660000	contribute to getting rid of that misunderstanding and misconstruing. But don't worry now,
1660000	1664800	O'Grady is going to explain how these other philosophers, framework ideas, oh okay oh well
1664800	1670240	I guess we're going straight to the slide this time. So now O'Grady is going to quickly cover
1670240	1676400	some philosophers because he's more so trying to show the similarity in what he calls framework ideas
1676400	1681440	in all of them rather than actually go into depth explaining and giving details of their
1681440	1687360	philosophies. Some of it may then therefore seem unclear to you right now but just focus on what a
1687360	1693040	framework idea is generally even if you're unclear about a specific philosopher's version.
1693040	1698160	In any case, I'm here for y'all to help fill in some of what might be missing. And hopefully a
1698160	1708640	faithful way anyway. Let's start. C.I. Lewis American philosopher C.I. Lewis was influenced
1708720	1714320	by Immanuel Kant's idea that there was a division of knowledge between the given and that which
1714320	1721200	processes the given. To be understood by us I guess. Whoa wait a minute maybe we should stop early.
1721200	1726960	I realize Kant seems very much to be the backdrop behind a lot of this so I'm going to give a sort
1726960	1732240	of one of my visualizations of this kind of philosophic picture here. In this picture the
1732240	1738080	unprocessed reality outside what is currently grasped by the mind would be the sort of indistinct
1738080	1745680	undifferentiated gray mush but really I can't even say it's gray or I can't even say it's mush.
1745680	1751920	I can't say anything about it. I can only say things about what I do perceive and this stuff is
1751920	1759120	beyond perception but whatever it be if it be at all it then be processed by our minds through
1759120	1764880	these things called categories of understanding to produce the familiar perceptions that we do have.
1765520	1771840	So there's a difference between reality or the pure world in itself you could say or maybe we
1771840	1778320	would just make up a new word for it like numina and then there's our perception of the world as
1778320	1786080	we perceive it. That reality is processed filtered and shaped by our categories of understanding
1786080	1792240	aspects of our mind. We cut up things to understand the world as the kind of creatures we are
1792240	1799040	that results in our perceptions what we might call phenomena and I talk more about how this
1799040	1805360	relates to relativists in my bonus episode for episode six where I first introduced this kind
1805360	1811040	of image. So it would be lovely if you do check that out in fact you might get to appreciate
1811040	1815680	the powers of this philosophic weapon and the sophisticated relativist position to some degree
1815680	1821520	just from that bonus video alone. So again please do check out episode six I know it has a lot of
1821520	1827200	parts to it but hey it's a fun journey so anyway the basic idea for our purposes here
1827200	1833680	is that there is an input from outside our mind and then some processing of the mind
1833680	1839040	happens of whatever that outside input is in order to even perceive what we do and those
1839040	1845120	perceptions are what we would call observation. In this sense we don't actually directly observe
1845120	1851520	reality it's like we have spectacles on. So O'Grady is saying that Lewis was influenced by
1851520	1856240	this sort of picture which I made sort of loosely generally based on Immanuel Kant.
1857200	1863280	But Lewis was also influenced by pragmatists emphasizing the relation of thoughts to action
1863280	1869840	you know actually doing things. Ah good old pragmatics that things have value only if they're
1869840	1876160	useful to us to actually do things or survive. It's the spice of American style philosophy.
1876160	1882000	He fused both of these into a position that also denies the theory practice dichotomy and the fact
1882000	1888160	value dichotomy. He thought of philosophy as investigating these categories that we use to
1888160	1894400	think about the world. Denying that the world conceptualizes itself. Instead the way we think
1894400	1900800	about reality is socially and historically shaped. Concepts the meanings that are shared by human
1900800	1908160	beings are a product of human interaction with the world. Theory is infected by practice and facts
1908160	1915520	are shaped by values. Concepts structure our experience and reflect our interests attitudes
1915520	1923040	and needs. Think about that talk about light going from colors we normally see to now even
1923120	1931040	including ultraviolet. Violent. Ultraviolet and infrared. Or even and if you're big into history
1931040	1937520	you might get a kick out of this but blue was not recognized as a unique color concept until
1937520	1943440	practical societal reasons came about. More often in our cross-cultural history we find the color
1943440	1949360	concept that combines what we now consider green and blue. But as it seems to me the most popular
1949360	1956720	theory goes that we only began to use the color concept of blue uniquely after we became capable
1956720	1963440	of making blue pigment in ancient Egypt. A color which was otherwise very rare in nature itself
1963440	1969520	and perhaps it's just that blue did not require being uniquely identified prior to that.
1970160	1976720	Anyway back to Lewis though. The categories we use aren't from reality itself but reflect
1976800	1984480	enduring human interests. In that way reality is relative to a system of concepts. The world as
1984480	1990000	we know it is shaped by the concepts we use to interpret it. Experience though governs which
1990000	1996080	system of concepts we use and respect to which ones are successful. Faulty and useless concepts
1996080	2002560	lead to bad predictions and unsuccessful courses of action. It's come to my attention that I may
2002560	2007280	want to make something clear here even though I have already said it but I'm gonna say it again
2007280	2013840	but I'm not saying this gray mush is what's actually there. That reality is actually gray mush.
2013840	2019520	Really I don't know if it's gray and I don't know if it's mush. It's just that I can't say or
2019520	2024800	talk about it at all. And Kant's categories make it even difficult to even say that it is.
2024800	2029040	So there are different ways to interpret this that we will talk about later especially if we
2029040	2034240	cover chapter three on ontology. And I don't really know Lewis directly actually. I only know
2034240	2039760	what O'Grady says about him here but he does say much later on in a different chapter that Lewis
2039760	2046160	nevertheless does take the given as data of the senses upon which we build knowledge. So this is
2046160	2052080	just what it seems to me right now but it's more simply the eyes do very much still pick up this
2052080	2058160	visual light input let's say but whatever this light reflections mean to us in order for it to
2058160	2064800	mean anything in order for it to even be information in a sense at all it has to do with our concepts.
2064800	2071840	So this is as it appears or is given but then it's still the concepts that cut it up meaningfully.
2071840	2077600	So really there is all this then we have say a concept of saying something is edible and that
2077600	2082720	cuts this out and of course therefore I guess a concept of the non edible and maybe we have the
2082800	2088960	concept of things from nature and also things that are constructed from and for humans and then
2088960	2094960	we have concepts to identify colors. So it's really that concepts are cutting up all this
2094960	2100800	information that there is from the given and for Lewis those concepts themselves are a social
2100800	2106640	product certainly children are taught to recognize the type of things that are edible and not and
2106640	2110400	certainly children go through a process of recognizing the type of things that are just
2110400	2115520	there in nature and the kind of things that humans must have made these concepts came into
2115520	2121120	being and survived among any number of concepts because they help us survive or accomplish goals
2121120	2127520	ourselves. So that's my example of what's going on here I bring this up just to be clear that with
2127520	2135040	both of these the given or input doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't something if anything
2135040	2140080	scientifically it is nigh infinite information in a sense if there even is such a thing as
2140080	2146400	information at that stage and it isn't simply just gray mush I'm just visualizing it like that
2146400	2151680	that whatever is presented to the mind cannot be thought of or talked about or even recognized
2151680	2157200	without concepts to cut it up out of the rest of everything else that's just one interpretation of
2157200	2162320	what's going on but don't worry about it too much right now we're just trying to grasp this idea
2162320	2169440	that we're actually contributing to what we observe anyway so the framework idea for lewis
2169440	2176080	are systems of categories by which we mediate reality to ourselves for lewis these categories
2176080	2182800	are almost as much as social product shaped by our society as language itself is this is kind of
2182800	2188480	different from earlier contos categories appeared to be an attempt at more of a universal description
2188480	2194480	of how the human mind must conceptualize reality in order to understand it but from lewis these
2194480	2200560	categories are socially constructed from our social environment that you are in while lewis
2200560	2204800	really didn't talk much about how this would mean that there could be different sets of categories
2204800	2210080	therefore he has acknowledged the possibility on occasion and we can see that different categories
2210080	2215440	would mean that the world as it appears to us would be different in a sense according to different
2215520	2220960	societies if a different society can lead to different categories that leads to different
2220960	2227520	ways the world appears to us as at least what we can say about what we observe peaking out or even
2227520	2232720	recognizing only certain things we have the concepts our society has provided to pick out or
2232720	2241280	recognize but anyway there is no unmediated access to reality itself and the only curbs on the system
2241280	2247200	of categories would be pragmatic ones for lewis so possibly having different sets of socially
2247200	2254400	constructed categories that's what ogready calls lewis's framework idea a presentation of the world
2254400	2261920	comes with it a certain set of categories from which it was processed a framework now let's move to
2262080	2263120	rudolf karnab
2269600	2274880	sharing a lot of the same sources with lewis german philosopher rudolf karnab articulated
2274880	2281360	his framework idea of linguistic frameworks that was super relativistic he was also influenced
2281360	2287760	by kant thinking that our knowledge is a result of some kind of processing and shared the idea of
2287840	2294720	pragmatic value of applying one's knowledge but he was also influenced much by science as that
2294720	2301600	which constitute actual knowledge and as a force therefore to get rid of metaphysical and theological
2301600	2307680	fake knowledge this is a kind of deflationist view of philosophy where instead of talking about
2307680	2314960	things like truth and reality philosophies suggest clarify meanings for scientists doing that too
2314960	2320160	may have seemed itself another discussion of philosophical truths but when it came to certain
2320160	2326480	things in philosophy like what is really real these kind of questions seemed unanswerable
2326480	2331120	in a way that questions and science could be answered so instead philosophers should just
2331120	2337440	focus on investigating and creating these models which are like languages and systems where one
2337440	2342960	can calculate and identify things with clear meanings logical implications and criteria for
2342960	2349040	confirmation so that scientists can then go on and actually do the research using these models
2349840	2355360	this was to deflate philosophical questions into merely practical choices of which model
2355360	2362400	scientists wanted to use so central to karnab's project is this notion of frameworks frameworks
2362400	2368800	for karnab outline all the rules using the terms and relations between the terms so number terms
2368800	2373920	can be introduced and have a relationship or rules based on that relationship within the
2373920	2380240	framework of math let's say so for example in my interpretation of this it means that five seven
2380240	2386240	and two within the framework of math five has a relationship to seven being a difference of two
2386240	2392480	you can add two to five and get seven or subtract two from seven and get five those terms have a
2392480	2398720	relationship and they are clear in the framework of math relative to that framework questions about
2398720	2404160	numbers are easy these kind of questions about the relationships like what is nine plus eight
2404720	2410160	they are internal questions questions that presuppose the existence of such a framework
2410160	2416480	to get an answer relative to the framework internal questions are uncontroversially
2416480	2423040	answerable and there are different frameworks to discuss different kinds of things physical objects
2423040	2431520	properties or spatial temporal objects do numbers really exist do properties really exist
2432080	2437840	karnab calls these external questions because they are outside the context of a linguistic
2437840	2444880	framework such questions are improper because the choice of framework is pragmatically decided on
2444880	2450400	if it is useful to speak of numbers then such a framework will be used if it is useful to speak
2450400	2456400	of properties then that framework will be used the only appropriate external questions are ones
2456400	2462720	about the expediency of using a framework or not so pretty much within this linguistic frameworks
2462720	2468960	questions are answered easily within the structure of that framework but to try to step outside of
2468960	2475600	framework and discuss it itself the only meaningful question here is if that framework is useful us
2475600	2482960	to use right now or not but still this can lead to a huge number of frameworks so karnab points to
2482960	2489600	a kind of natural selection akin to biology to how we come to use particular ones reducing how
2489600	2495600	varied they can be but even with natural selection there's still a lot open here for relativists
2495600	2501440	but let's leave that there for now karnab will come up again in the battle and we will cover
2501440	2509280	again sort of what the idea is so anyway that's what ogready calls karnab's framework idea and now
2509280	2512320	for lw Ludwig Wittgenstein
2519520	2525360	he's probably the most important developer of framework ideas of the 20th century and is well
2525360	2530880	known for making two influential philosophies whoa wait a minute uh so to be honest with you
2530880	2536160	i do not think this section is very good at explaining what Wittgenstein's framework idea
2536160	2543040	is even less so than any of the other philosophers the framework idea of language games has less
2543040	2548320	time devoted to it than the other things and yet it's very important to grasp this idea in particular
2548320	2553920	especially considering ogready himself thinks he's the most important contributor to it but also it
2553920	2558880	could be very helpful for us in the future as well so i want to make clear it's not that
2558880	2564080	paul ogready has gotten wittgenstein wrong in this section or that ogready cannot do a better job at
2564080	2569440	explaining him or isn't so much smarter than me but that this particular section doesn't really
2569440	2575280	explain what a language game really is and how it leads to the other points that ogready brings up
2575280	2581920	so i will do that myself explain it in a separate video a video that's just off the cuff you know
2581920	2587920	not cited from the top of my head just me trying to explain with examples what language games are
2587920	2592320	and how it connects to the points that ogready is going to be bringing up for the purposes of
2592320	2597840	just getting the idea out there to move on but hey maybe it could also be a great standalone video
2597840	2602240	if you've kind of forgotten what wittgenstein's language games were kind of about at least until
2602240	2607840	i do make a proper video since we definitely will get into wittgenstein properly one day and i promise
2607840	2613760	to give away all my secret stash of important citation everything cited down to the line like
2613760	2618480	i normally do you know even back to his blue and brown books where we will find a cheat code
2619120	2624880	okay but for now let's see what ogready does say anyway ogready tells us that wittgenstein had two
2624880	2629920	influential philosophies one presented in his tractatis logical philosophicus that articulates
2629920	2635440	what essentially language is you know its essence and the picturing relation between language and
2635440	2641200	reality now ogready doesn't say what he thinks wittgenstein said is the essence of language
2641200	2645920	but i think it's simply that it has this picturing relationship that language is that
2645920	2650480	which corresponds to reality like a picture does with words and a proposition having the
2650480	2655360	same relationship to each other as the objects that they pick out or stand for in the world
2655360	2660080	the other philosophy later in life his latter philosophy is presented in his philosophical
2660080	2664240	investigations and it actually critiques a lot of what was said in that first account
2664240	2669440	rejecting the idea that language has a particular essence and that philosophy shouldn't focus on
2669440	2674960	advancing theses but be a kind of therapy to help clarify language instead of having a single
2674960	2680720	determinant language language is comprised of many language games now i'm just gonna read like six
2680720	2686400	lines and tell you what i think of them a language game is a complex whole of verbal usage and
2686400	2692640	associated activities words simply don't label or stand for objects but relate to each other and
2692640	2697920	the world in highly complex ways words are like tools there are many different kinds performing
2697920	2702960	many different kinds of activities therefore there are many different language games and many
2702960	2707680	different associated forms of life the kinds of activities associated with the language game
2707680	2712800	the language games are governed by grammatical rules rules of grammar prescribe the modes of
2712800	2723520	representation by which the world is represented to us oh super clear isn't it no look i don't
2723600	2728080	think old grady is wrong but only because i actually studied vikenshine but also i haven't
2728080	2733120	forgotten what's wrong with talking about vikenshine like this in part because i haven't forgotten
2733120	2738720	what it was like as a young philosopher that was unfamiliar i think this could to someone less
2738720	2745360	familiar make vikenshine seem complicated or even mystical in some sense neither of which is true
2745360	2751280	the last lines in particular could seem to imply something radical like what you say changes the
2751280	2757920	world itself that reality as commonly taken is literally changing when you change what you say
2757920	2762880	that's kind of extreme if you think about that kind of picture and not at all what vikenshine's
2762880	2769040	about though it's hard to say but also to deny what vikenshine's actual metaphysical position
2769040	2774880	really is because he himself won't do that since his philosophy aims to stop speaking metaphysically
2774880	2780400	in such a manner in the first place but if you insist to be unfaithful to his philosophy there
2780400	2785040	is still a cheat code in the blue and brown books like i said that i can give you later so subscribe
2786400	2792320	in any case i can imagine someone reading this and just feeling like oh whatever just another
2792320	2797520	philosopher using a bunch of words together to obfuscate their position to appear deep and
2797520	2803120	complicated but it's just vague nonsense jargon so this is why i believe my video becomes necessary
2803120	2808800	for anyone who hasn't studied vikenshine's language games already because you're not going to get a
2808800	2813360	good sense of it from ogready despite what it may seem like other actual philosophers say
2813360	2817920	for someone new and not familiar with the kind of concepts that philosophers use all the time
2817920	2823440	this really isn't easy text and i definitely think kirks book was probably much more palatable to
2823440	2827840	somebody new in any case there are a couple of more things that ogready does point out about
2827840	2832880	language games vikenshine's framework idea that are important so let's cover them ogready points
2832880	2837760	out three things and two of them are that vikenshine emphasized that it was important
2837760	2843520	not to conflate one language game with another or to think that there are super language games
2843520	2849760	that govern all others ogready also points out that there is a quite popular use of vikenshine's
2849760	2855840	idea was to try to defend religious belief against rationalistic critique by claiming that religion
2855840	2861520	is its own language game and that it is illicit to use criteria from another language game usually
2861520	2867680	science to challenge it but as it is always really important to point out this is not to say that
2867680	2873680	vikenshine himself espoused such views again as i said that he didn't mean and likely didn't want
2873680	2879040	his philosophy to be used by extreme relativists especially considering how he was trying to be
2879040	2885200	anti-philosophy in his own way but his views lent themselves to such use ogready then talks about
2885200	2889760	how in uncertainty vikenshine's latest writings that vikenshine does seem to have this image of
2889760	2895360	a riverbed with a bedrock below to kind of represent even how in a language game there are
2895360	2900800	beliefs that we are willing to change more easily and fluidly and some more deeply entrenched which
2900800	2907120	are likely bedrock at the bottom of a river but that even those can change just at a much slower
2907120	2912720	rate ogready brings us up to kind of say how it's this bedrock beliefs that are the framework upon
2912720	2919360	which the fluid beliefs depend and that this for ogready is also used to say the framework may alter
2919360	2924640	and indeed there may be alternative frameworks but really he didn't need to bring that up at all i
2924640	2928560	think the fact that there are different language games is enough to see how vikenshine's philosophy
2928560	2933200	empowers the relativists in fact as far as i have seen the issue of whether the bedrock can change
2933200	2937440	from within a language game isn't a discussion that the relativists using this weapon even bother
2937440	2941680	with it's seemingly to me always a discussion about how there are differing language games but
2941680	2946000	maybe i'm missing something as to why he felt this was important to bring up i mean i guess there's
2946000	2950480	another argument to how there can be different frameworks but really the language game argument
2950480	2955520	not the bedrocks can change argument is ultimately what's taken to be the power that is imbued into
2955520	2963200	this weapon from vikenshine now i do wish ogready would have done don't think look more which is
2963200	2967600	give more examples for us to actually look at in many places in his book but as i said in the
2967600	2971680	beginning of the video paul ogready does seem to be more concerned with pointing out the sources of
2971680	2976080	the powers of this weapon rather than actually explaining what the sources are which is why i
2976080	2980640	said i would try to hopefully fill that gap and bear that responsibility myself so again please
2980640	2985600	do go check out that video that i will be making i will definitely be more clearly explaining what
2985600	2991520	the idea of a language game is and i will explain why we would be against the idea of a super language
2991520	2996560	game and why we shouldn't mix language games as well as how these kind of vikenshinean philosophers
2996560	3001840	may be in a tight spot sometimes if one is trying to stay faithful to his philosophy while explaining
3002400	3006880	anyway please check out that video so now i'm going to give things back to ogready who will
3006880	3021280	talk about w v quine w v quine was one of the earliest to popularize the phrase conceptual
3021280	3027840	scheme the conceptual scheme is revisable but there is no neutral position to talk about the
3027840	3033920	world is to apply some conceptual scheme to it from childhood growing up we learn the conceptual
3033920	3041120	scheme and as we learn more the conceptual scheme gets refined and right now science is the best
3041120	3048160	as the most inclusive scheme that covers everything that exists it is the best to understand the world
3048160	3055280	and predict changes in it but borrowing the term language game from vikenshine quine says that there
3055280	3061520	are other kinds of language use for poetry or fiction for example and they are used to see the
3061520	3067440	world in a different way imaginary worlds so of course they'd have different conceptual schemes
3067440	3074480	which is fine but what if it's the same world like the real world can we nevertheless have
3074480	3080320	different conceptual schemes well it seems there's enough in quine to say yeah for sure
3080960	3087040	for example he believes that all beliefs can in fact be changed that none are unchangeable
3087040	3093520	and absolute that there are no a priori beliefs for quine but what that even means could use some
3093520	3098480	further detail but it's in a different chapter that again i'm not sure if i'm gonna cover
3099040	3106400	but also he did believe in under determination of theory by fact which is to say that any set
3106400	3112800	amount of evidence could support more than one theory so with my famous example i used in the
3112800	3118800	map of philosophy of science video check it out if you have time there i used an example of dots
3118800	3124880	on a graph that i give with the dots representing observations or even what counts as evidence
3124880	3130640	for any certain amount of dots can support more than one theory of what the shape the dots are
3130640	3137760	making and in fact no amount of dots will ever fully guarantee only one shape or theory that
3137760	3144400	could fit it so it would be like quine does believe that even in dealing with the real world
3144400	3150960	people could nevertheless have different conceptual schemes these two things that all our beliefs
3150960	3156480	can change so our conceptual scheme can change and that we can have different theories based off the
3156480	3162880	same observation thus different conceptual schemes while based in the real world would make quine
3162880	3168480	fertile ground for relativists but we'll talk later in chapter three whether that's actually
3168480	3175360	his position or not chapter three chapter three whoa okay so we can stop with that look i don't
3175360	3182960	know we're really gonna be covering that what okay fine we'll see anyway ogready is calling quine's
3182960	3188800	conceptual scheme which is like our best theory of the world that we use to make sense of the world
3188800	3198240	which can change and can be different quine's framework idea now finally drop that coon hold on
3202080	3211440	a philosopher and historian uh science ts coon helped relativists in a big way his notion of paradigms
3211440	3219040	not paradigms became influential well beyond philosophy of science a paradigm is a context
3219040	3224720	within which scientific inquiry proceeds like assumptions training methods standards goals
3224720	3230480	methods of experimentation again ogready doesn't provide examples even in places where they would
3230480	3236560	be super helpful but i would just say maybe it would be helpful to imagine a newtonian paradigm
3236560	3243200	let's say versus an einsteinian paradigm you know a paradigm of relativity or now say a quantum
3243200	3249360	physics paradigm they characterize a scientific community at a stable period but a crisis can
3249360	3255920	happen that lead to a new paradigm the paradigms themselves though are supposedly incommensurable
3255920	3262560	paradigms create their own context within which it rationally operates so one can't rationally
3262560	3268480	judge or decide between them here's where i think there's some leftover blood soaked soil of the
3268480	3274400	positivists that have us thinking of it like that which i mentioned in that map episode but yeah
3274400	3280880	think of it as in that evidence is interpreted through a paradigm so then it isn't evidence
3280880	3287760	that's actually deciding between paradigms we can't evaluate the evidence without a paradigm first
3287760	3293920	so each paradigm judges itself and one cannot judge a paradigm from another based on evidence
3293920	3301840	itself now i have actually created two videos on coon already one video is coon's response in his
3301840	3308000	own words to those that contrast him with his predecessor the great champion carl popper so
3308000	3314640	it gives i think a decent outline of what coon's position is but also i made a video explaining
3314640	3321360	in much more detail how it is specifically his philosophy that allowed these relativists therefore
3321360	3328400	to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science using his philosophy of paradigm shifts
3328400	3335680	and crises if you're interested please check them out the second video can be a bit spooky it's
3335680	3341920	called the gates of hell but uh i'm just being dramatic don't worry hell isn't really involved
3341920	3347840	in any case it's these philosophers that are the big names of whose philosophies are similar
3347840	3354400	enough in terms of a framework idea to be pressed into a single weapon and a nearly supremely
3354400	3361360	powerful position the relativist takes wielding this great weapon framework ideas from them
3361360	3366560	developed from very different places of the world and was one of the three big trends that brought
3367040	3372960	this weapon into the modern philosophic battle according to a gradient but i think he is missing
3372960	3377360	a couple of other things namely that there's also a lot of scientific discoveries that led
3377360	3383840	to similar beliefs about how what we perceive isn't objective reality that it is shaped by the type of
3383840	3389440	creatures that we are with the faculties that we have brain science shows all the ways we filter
3389440	3395360	out non-essential information and what counts as essential again has to do with our evolved histories
3395360	3400320	as human beings again such as what kind of colors we can see in the light spectrum and even many
3400320	3404960	people's beliefs and interpretation of what quantum physics supposedly shows us evidence for
3404960	3411120	that our act of observing itself affects the observed not that i believe that interpretation
3411120	3415920	but it is one that many more people have been taking on because of quantum physics of course
3415920	3422000	though ogready is talking about philosophy but i do think philosophical conversation is obviously
3422000	3427760	being influenced by discoveries and technological advancement in science in modern times as much
3427760	3433600	as it was in his own little history lesson given to us here describing the separation of nature and
3433600	3448720	morals the battle so we may find ourselves up against an enemy wielding this weapon in an extreme
3449440	3454560	let's say because we are endorsing the use of science to decide on the role of vaccines the
3454560	3459680	reality of global warming or the age of the earth we can actually believe that this position of
3459680	3464720	wielding this weapon to an extreme degree of thinking everything is relative was created not
3464720	3470480	because they are evil and want to attack science we may believe that they are actually sincere in
3470480	3476640	their honest virtuous morals of pursuing tolerance and open-mindedness of people of different perspectives
3476640	3482560	and a weary of western imperialist thinking of having used claims of rationality and logic and
3482560	3488080	scientific advancement as a reason to oppress and invalidate others of non-western belief systems
3488080	3495040	but of course it's that same extreme position that can be used to defend attacks from science
3495040	3501280	against the intolerant abusive tyrannical belief systems that will say science is just relative
3501280	3507280	so it cannot be used to attack their abusive beliefs that aren't grounded in reality but dogma
3507280	3513040	and deep rooted insecurities like misogyny or homophobia so taking this weapon as if it were
3513040	3518640	infinitely powerful isn't in the best interest of even those who are primordially interested in a
3518640	3524720	more tolerant social world and there is real-world evidence cases about this but we'll talk about
3524720	3532080	them later in any case we as good warriors on the philosophic battlefield should wonder how
3532080	3536480	if i do come up against an enemy wielding this weapon to an extreme degree enough to attack
3536480	3542320	science claims to truth or rationality let's say then how am i supposed to beat them when i want
3542320	3547280	to say something is science when i want to say something is the truth when i want to say something
3547280	3553440	makes rational sense so think about it against this enemy i cannot just take something out of my
3553520	3560640	pocket and say see this is the objective thing here it's not relative because everything i say
3561520	3568880	is merely relative to a language game i can't show any evidence either because evidence is relative
3568880	3576800	to a paradigm and i can't even show any observation of anything because all observations are structured
3576800	3582880	relative to our conceptual scheme there isn't anything i can produce anything i can offer
3582880	3589120	that cannot be attacked by this enemy so it's difficult to figure out how can i beat this
3589120	3595120	enemy when they can attack anything i show them if i say objects or reality they can even say
3595120	3600160	that those are just in fact words relative to a language game even if i try to be very clear that
3600160	3606320	i mean mind independent reality they can still attack that and say whatever mind independent
3606320	3611840	reality even means is structured by a conceptual scheme tied to particular social groups that
3611840	3617680	make use of such conceptual structures thus hastily concluding that reality is relative
3618400	3624400	so yes it is incredibly frustrating trying to deal with this kind of enemy who will continually
3624400	3631360	attack constantly so i want you to remember this situation facing an enemy that will always attack
3631360	3638160	no matter what is shown how can you win think of it for yourself first do you see a way we could
3638160	3643040	deal with this kind of enemy can you come up with a cool move or a counter think about it
3643040	3648080	before we get to the next video where we'll cover what paul o'grady does on the battlefield
3648080	3655280	choosing specific areas to defend against charges of relativism this weapon however made by philosophers
3655280	3661760	is being wielded to attack science not by philosophers themselves but by sociologists
3661760	3667840	who used kuhn to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science in order to attack it
3667840	3674320	and these sociologists do not understand this weapon well enough to grasp the dangers if it is
3674320	3681200	used as if unlimited they only know its power to attack the attempt to speak with authority
3681200	3688080	not the limits which we unlike them will learn in the next videos once we learn that this weapon
3688080	3693360	does in fact have limits and the dangers that happens when those limits are crossed we will
3693360	3698640	then return back to the battlefield of the philosophy of science where they had these
3698640	3704320	science wars the battlefield from where i came in this journey and then we will take on this
3704320	3711680	particular group of sociologists that are attacking science are those influenced by them called the ssk
3711680	3718240	who started the science wars so if you would like an account of what led to the science wars and who
3718240	3725120	are these ssk please watch my video voodoo sociology as paulo grady now prepares for battle
3725120	3731760	himself against this extreme relativist presented in the next video one that attempts to make a
3731760	3745280	few attacks on objectivity by proclaiming that even truth is relative
