0	18600	Welcome back, today on Philosophy Battle we are covering one of the greatest battles
18600	23280	that has ever influenced me, and namely it's actually the setup for the battle that will
23280	28680	finally allow us to gain the philosophic powers of this metaphysical eye that I've been promising.
28680	33600	The setup will lay the groundwork for the eternal traction in the slippery, perilous
33600	35520	battlefields of philosophy.
35520	40080	The awesome battle that we'll be covering though is from this green book, the second
40080	42680	of three books that I may cover on relativism.
42680	47800	A book simply titled, Relativism, by Paul O'Grady, a philosophy lecturer at Trinity
47800	49720	College in Dublin.
49720	54040	While there are a number of different battles in this green book, the one we'll be covering
54040	60800	today involves Paul O'Grady defending truth against the attacks of the extreme relativist.
60800	64280	That is, the relativist who believes everything is relative.
64280	69000	Not just matters of taste or beauty, or even what counts as right and wrong, but for them
69000	73920	even things like knowledge, truth, logic, and reality are relative.
73920	77320	For them, everything is relative.
77320	81040	Nothing is objective, nothing is absolute.
81040	84520	And that is what we would call the extreme relativist.
84520	89160	It may sound a little bit out there, but we're dealing with a sophisticated relativist whose
89160	94680	weapon has been empowered by three trends and namely five philosophers that Paul O'Grady
94680	100240	himself noted for us in his introductory chapter, where he helped explain the powers of this
100240	107320	wickedly awesome weapon and how it came into being, especially in modern philosophic warfare.
107320	111880	So if you'd like to see how it is possible that even a reasonable person may come to
111880	117280	feel that even things like truth or knowledge or facts are relative, please check out the
117280	121520	previous video, The Powers of Relativism.
121520	125760	Why are we considering the concerns of these relativists that make the charges that even
125760	129080	facts truth or logic is relative?
129080	133140	It's important for a good philosopher to understand that one cannot simply defeat an
133140	139060	enemy like this, an extreme relativist, who wishes to use relativism everywhere, not just
139060	145620	because they say so, but as empowered by actual philosophic writing, namely those five philosophers,
145620	150420	by simply proclaiming, hey, there's no problem, we could just literally objectively describe
150420	155420	things how they are and we have scientific facts and so on, you know, facts and logic.
155420	161660	So they aren't relative, well you may actually have to deal with them rather than try to
161660	163420	offhand dismiss them.
163420	168380	Because if science doesn't maintain its legitimacy and authority, you may have religious fanatics
168380	173820	teaching extreme spiritual beliefs in science class, you may have corporations or politicians
173820	179180	disregard scientific findings, and many other terrible things that happen sometimes simply
179180	181900	to spite scientific evidence.
181900	188020	And the arguments of the SSK, a particular group of sociologists that studied science
188020	193780	that used these powerful philosophic weapons to attack the authority and legitimacy of
193780	200940	science or arguments of their academic descendants can be used to do such things, even perhaps
200940	204180	pull funding away from the sciences.
204180	208220	Thinking all of this isn't really a problem because we could just describe reality objectively
208220	214180	with literalism and so that's not relative, against this extreme relativist with this
214180	219900	sophisticated weaponry is a very rudimentary attack that will be blown out of the water
219900	222180	by this powerful enemy.
222180	226060	Again to understand the main staples of how they could even do that, we covered that in
226060	229820	our last video covering the power of relativism.
229820	235220	So please check that out if you'd like to see how exactly this weapon can be so powerful.
235220	241220	Or check this out if you would like more detail on who these SSK are and what happened in what
241220	244140	was called the science wars.
244140	249540	But if you're more interested in the battle against this enemy, how we can defeat them,
249540	251780	that's what we got for you today.
251780	254820	That will show the limits of this weapon.
254820	259700	Well actually Paul Grady first makes a wonderful setup from which he is able to then go and
259700	266060	defend against charges of relativism on two fronts, the two limits, here and here.
266060	270580	As I said this setup will be used for me to explain the powers of the philosophic eye,
270580	274260	or at least what I mean by that in my own theatric way of describing things.
274260	279500	In any case, he defends truth and rationality from charges of relativism.
279500	283860	Those are the battles we are going to cover, but as I said for today, we'll just be covering
283860	288020	both that setup and the first battle, defending truth.
288020	293100	Now in this chapter on truth, he also discusses whether logic can be relative, so we will
293100	298580	look at logic as well in this video if not an additional one if this one gets too long.
298580	303700	By the way, O'Grady does accept relativism in ontology, of which ontology is a topic about
303700	307840	what there is, what kind of things there are in the world.
307840	312140	And he also accepts it sort of to a certain degree in epistemology, which is the study
312140	313140	of knowledge.
313140	318980	Here however, it is limited by how much relativism there can be in rationality, because rationality
318980	321500	plays an important role in knowledge.
321500	326420	Again though, he actually still defends rationality against the charges of relativism by the
326420	331060	extreme relativists, which is the other awesome battle in this book which we will definitely
331060	335060	eventually cover in a different video, in the next one hopefully.
335060	339900	After we cover both these battles though, perhaps I may make a video of an overall assessment
339900	344420	of the book talking about some of the other chapters maybe, you know, if you subscribe.
344420	345420	Hehe.
345420	351340	But enough about me, let's listen to Paul O'Grady to get that first important setup.
351340	355860	But let me point out whenever I am speaking for O'Grady, which will actually still be
355860	360820	my interpretation of paraphrasing of what he said, I will still cite it down through
360820	366020	the line in the corner of the screen, and when I speak more for myself, the citation
366020	367580	will disappear.
367580	372420	And that way you'll know what's from him sort of, and what's from me.
372420	376860	Also you can then check if I misinterpreted any of his lines and identify exactly where
376860	383380	I have failed, and that I always credit others in honesty if I'm covering their work.
383460	387620	And though I may just be a shadowy nobody on the internet here, please still mention
387620	392620	me, not as an academic source, but in a footnote or something if any of my videos have given
392620	394780	you formulation to your own thought.
394780	398940	You should do the same even if it's a conversation you've had with your professor and received
398940	402120	a clear idea from another person or something.
402120	405960	Be as honest and credit as much as possible.
405960	410780	Academic honesty and citation work hand in hand in improving your battle stance and philosophy,
410780	415100	helping to shelter you and support you by diverting attacks to others that you have
415100	420220	cited if certain attacks are inbound, but also allowing others to help correct your
420220	423340	stance if they can spot the sources of misunderstanding.
423340	426620	Wow, now that sounded like a big ethics lecture.
426620	432180	But anyway, so for today our battle is gonna focus specifically on Paul O'Grady's setup
432180	436900	and then ultimately his defense of truth against the charges of relativism by the
436900	444000	Allithic Relativist, Allithic meaning about truth, and Relative being that which is dependent
444000	445580	on something else.
445580	452620	He says, Allithic Relativism has often been invoked as a way of avoiding contradiction.
452620	457420	So his first section is going to be about how Allithic Relativism is motivated by wanting
457420	463140	to avoid contradiction, then all the different ways to relativize truth, all of which will
463140	464140	be rejected.
464420	469900	In the second section we'll look at different theories of truth that might defend and relativize
469900	474380	version of truth, though actually that for the most part counts against those theories
474380	475660	not for it.
475660	480700	In any case, the third section is going to be about logic, whether it is relative and
480700	484420	whether there can be alternative logics.
484420	491020	So it's true, people have different beliefs on politics, morals, religion, music, etc.
491020	495180	One of the motivations is to accommodate this diversity.
495180	500300	So as if to say that though there are different views, they can all be true.
500300	504160	Think about this, remember we have already attacked their organs in a previous episode
504160	508080	and videos for you are here if you followed my journey.
508080	512060	So let's hope they know that we're coming from a good place ourselves as well.
512060	517620	Anyway, because of this, they reject both positions of a non-relativist.
517620	523440	Those positions are first, dogmatism, that one view can be true and the rest must be
523440	529940	false, denying diversity, and the other of non-cognitivism, that no one has the truth
529940	533940	because what they're saying can't even be said to be true or false.
533940	538340	For this, because truth isn't at issue, diversity can easily exist.
538340	543100	It's kind of like saying some things can be true or false like in science, but these
543100	548500	things, values, moral views, religious views, etc, they aren't the type of things that
548500	554460	can even be true or false, and diversity can flourish when truth isn't in the picture.
554460	560860	So truth relativists, illithic relativists, hold that some competing views can both be
560860	567620	legitimate candidates for truth and competing views as legit candidates can both be true
567620	570700	despite them being opposing.
570700	576420	To accept opposing positions as both being true simultaneously is on the face of it to
576420	582500	accept contradiction, and to do such a thing is unacceptable.
582500	587060	So I said in a previous video while dealing with Robert Kirk, to forgive me for not showing
587060	591020	how Kirk explained how contradictions are bad and just to trust me that he actually
591020	592260	did show us that.
592260	596460	I didn't show it because I really wanted to get to and show how O'Grady does it.
596460	601620	And this is that important setup that I wanted to show, which will work for him to defend
601620	606360	in different places against the relativists, but also may be ultimately the basis for one
606360	611260	of the coolest things that it will ever show on the show, that metaphysical eye.
611260	615940	It has a number of implications, but starting it out it may seem super simple.
615940	619380	So if it's simple for you and obvious, still be patient with it.
619380	624780	Only later will we really begin to use what he sets up here in battle, then we will truly
624820	626540	see how awesome it is.
626540	629140	But for now, let's just take a look.
629140	631140	Let's see why contradictions are bad.
631140	634540	This is going to be awesome.
634540	640540	Contradiction is the assertion of a statement or proposition and the negation of that same
640540	645860	assertion or proposition at the same time in the same understanding.
645860	647820	And this is an important point.
647820	652140	Because it's like changing your mind over time, that really isn't a contradiction.
652140	656380	People may say I believe something then and I don't believe it now because now I know
656380	657500	it's wrong.
657500	662620	So there's a now versus then distinction, showing that it's not a legitimate contradiction.
662620	667900	And for what we're talking about, it has to be a legitimate contradiction, p and not
667900	668900	p.
668900	675380	Oh, so p is a proposition, which is a statement about what is or not, the state of affairs
675380	677180	as they are or not.
677180	681660	And a proposition doesn't have to be represented or presented with the letter p, it could be
681660	686780	represented with q or r or s, it's just a kind of variable like in math how we can use
686780	690940	x or y or z to represent consistent numerical variables.
690940	695060	Also for your sake, this symbol is the negation symbol in logic.
695060	699140	It means not, or the negative of what is expressed after it.
699140	703260	But I'll try to keep it simple for you and try to write it like this whenever I can at
703260	704260	first.
704260	707740	But anyway, so about being a genuine contradiction.
707740	713340	Everyone saying this is black and this is white isn't a legitimate or genuine contradiction.
713340	715700	Something can be black and white.
715700	720980	A legit contradiction would be more like to say this is black and this is not black.
720980	725500	Well, I kinda don't like this example too much because in normal everyday language,
725500	730860	if we are saying about say a soccer ball, we wouldn't actually just say it's black,
730860	732820	we would say it's black and white.
732820	736780	Just because we know it's kind of misleading to say just it's black.
736780	741660	And our general way of speaking would allow us to assume that it's not also white because
741660	746100	you would have said black and white if it were also white.
746100	750580	It would be kind of unusual to leave out white if your point was to say what color is the
750580	751980	ball is, you know?
751980	756460	But anyway, his point here is that there should be no sneaky way of showing that it's not
756460	758220	really a contradiction.
758220	763100	So it's black and it is not black is a very clear case of a contradiction.
763100	764660	And that's what he's trying to get at.
764660	772060	But to be a true relativist, they have to be willing to accept even these legitimate contradictions.
772060	776900	And what's the problem with accepting genuine cases of contradictions as possible?
776900	785060	The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of
785060	788100	assertion and negation.
788100	793860	This, this point here is one of the two main reasons I'm talking about O'Grady.
793860	799100	If you can grasp the essential nature of all assertion, you will have developed what I
799100	804780	call a metaphysical eye, a deeper philosophic understanding that allows you to catch enemies
804780	810220	who lack that understanding and end up committed to devastating and crippling positions.
810220	816220	So what comes next may on the one hand seem super obvious, but its implication we will
816220	819660	show later as being incredibly important.
819660	827300	You see, to make an assertion, you are expressing some content that something is the case.
827300	829220	Something is a certain way.
829220	835340	In doing that, you are at the same time denying its negation.
835340	838780	For example, the sun is shining at a certain time or place.
838780	843900	This rules out or denies the sun is not shining at that exact time or place or understanding
843900	846360	that is meant in the first proposition.
846360	850080	This is also a logical move called double negation here.
850080	854520	To say p is also equivalent to say not not p.
854520	858680	Now that's more of a formal logic way of expressing this rational principle.
858680	863800	Many of us learn in studying math say we're multiplying two negatives make a positive
863800	867240	or simply in English when we use the double negatives.
867240	872520	For example, someone that says it isn't true that we're not here means that it is true
872520	874120	that we are.
874120	880980	Or for example, it's not true that it's not raining means that it is true that it is raining.
880980	884560	So you see, double negatives make a positive.
884560	888280	But also a positive can be a double negative.
888280	892920	And that means a positive is like negating a negative.
892920	897480	Assertion implies the rejection of the negation of that assertion.
897480	900840	This is going to sound funny so for those of you who are listening to this and not
900840	904640	watching this, it might make more sense to watch this at the same time.
904640	913080	But asserting p, which is logically equal to not not p, shows it is not not p.
913080	916200	P denies not p.
916200	919920	This is really simple logic that we're familiar with.
919920	925000	But again, to be talking about it like this can feel a bit weird to someone new in philosophy.
925000	929480	So I hope I'm not actually confusing anyone by talking about something super basic but
929480	931800	in more formal logical ways.
931800	938960	But anyway, when it comes to contradiction, it is to assert and endorse both the assertion
938960	941040	and its negation.
941040	943560	P and not p.
943560	948440	This is kind of like cutting off its own legs maybe, that's the way of saying it, because
948440	951400	p should imply not not p.
951400	953920	Which denies not p.
953920	957600	And yet not p also denies p.
957640	961960	So a contradiction undermines the very process of asserting.
961960	968440	To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.
968440	972640	Two sides attacking each other in the same unit is nothing.
972640	977120	Like one part negative and one part positive cancelling each other out in math or perhaps
977120	978880	in physics let's say.
978880	983400	Since some basic math is plenty easier to grasp for many people I believe than maybe
983400	987160	my earlier logical stuff, let's look at it like this.
988000	994360	So it's like you might as well say nothing.
994360	999640	It's equal to saying you have no knowledge, no claim to anything at all.
999640	1005880	Also then a positive assertion like a plus one is equal to denying a negative or you
1005880	1008440	know minus a negative one.
1008440	1012040	Saying plus one minus one is to say nothing at all.
1012040	1016600	And then I would wonder why did you waste my time telling me something that yields nothing,
1016600	1020400	no claim, no stance, no belief, no anything.
1020400	1027160	To assert anything of substance that has a purpose meaning a stance requires that it
1027160	1033800	also denies the opposite of what is being asserted, lest it be rendered meaningless or
1033800	1035520	even false.
1035520	1041800	So this is a law of non-contradiction, a law against contradiction.
1041800	1049520	The law of non-contradiction is so basic and necessary that one cannot even argue for or
1049520	1055280	against it on the basis of anything more fundamental.
1055280	1060000	Because it's so fundamental, in fact it is the very basis of how we do argumentation
1060000	1061440	in the first place.
1061440	1068560	This makes it an insurmountable problem for anyone that tries to deny non-contradiction.
1068560	1073680	Even denying the principle, in so far as denying has any meaning whatsoever, must have
1073680	1080680	a determinate content that is not undermined by simultaneously affirming the principle.
1080680	1084600	So that is why contradictions must be avoided.
1084600	1085600	This is it.
1085600	1091360	If you get anything from this video, I hope it is this and it is tied to the very nature
1091360	1093400	of making any assertion.
1093400	1097280	With it you will see clearly what many have already begun to see in the previous Kirk
1097360	1104760	video series and what I spoke about as a crippling problem, which O'Grady now calls insurmountable.
1104760	1106600	Let me explain it like this.
1106600	1108320	It is self-defeat.
1108320	1113800	You see, this principle that contradictions are bad, let's say, it is actually the very
1113800	1116640	basis of arguing against something.
1116640	1123280	So to argue against this principle assumes this principle, that the principle works,
1123280	1126800	thus cutting off one's own legs in a way.
1126840	1134680	Even so we don't miss it, arguing for or asserting anything, no matter what, has a meaning
1134680	1140400	in so far as you are denying the opposite of what you are saying, as we stated earlier.
1140400	1146560	So an argument against this principle also requires it, in order for that argument to
1146560	1148560	have any meaning.
1148560	1152440	How can one contradict that contradictions happen?
1152440	1156320	It's an insurmountable problem for them who deny it.
1156320	1160640	And we saw this actually already in the Kirk video as I pointed it out for us.
1160640	1164280	And we'll talk about this again in my final talk about relativism before I'm done with
1164280	1165280	this whole topic.
1165280	1169320	But let me give it some more timeless, some very easy things that we may have encountered
1169320	1171520	in our lives that highlight this.
1171520	1179240	If one tries to deny that denial is possible, then how are you denying?
1179240	1181240	That is incoherent.
1181240	1189160	The TFM true for me relativist in the Kirk videos disagreed that disagreement happens.
1189160	1192440	How can you disagree that disagreement happens?
1192440	1194040	That's self-defeating.
1194040	1200480	If you try to say no one can say anything with any authority, then how did you say that?
1200480	1206400	In fact how can you say with authority, or even just substantively, what your own position
1206400	1210800	is unless it means to deny the opposite of that position?
1210800	1217680	I mean trying to say no one can talk is self-defeating and that you've just proven by what you're
1217680	1220080	doing that you are wrong.
1220080	1226680	One cannot deny that denial exists or claim that no one can make a claim nor say that
1226680	1230160	they know that there is no knowledge.
1230160	1236560	One should not be able to tell everyone to shut up that no one has the right to talk
1236560	1240760	because then that person too should have kept quiet.
1240760	1242760	If that were true.
1242760	1248240	While I always say philosophers keep battling, philosophers do battle about anything they
1248240	1254440	can but it takes short time for a philosopher to realize certain positions are terrible
1254440	1259720	either because they have more arguments against them than can have defending them but also
1259720	1267600	because it may be a self-defeating position and those must be avoided at all costs.
1267600	1275600	So Immanuel Kant once said and I quoted metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or a lighthouse
1275600	1278720	strewn with many a philosophic wreck.
1278720	1285840	Man eff that ship let me tell you this is from me not O'Grady not anyone else but metaphysics
1285840	1292480	epistemology philosophy of mind anywhere you are there is a lighthouse there is always
1292480	1299960	a lighthouse and it stands on the pillar of non-contribution a pillar of rationality
1299960	1306640	and connecting to another pillar the nature of assertion and thus the necessity of truth
1306640	1311520	this will be our lighthouse and I will talk more about this lighthouse in the future and
1311520	1318160	what my organs are perhaps but there is enough to understand to really see with what I theatrically
1318160	1324400	call your metaphysical eye when self-defeat is happening this is the philosophic eye that
1324400	1330000	will allow you to defeat your philosophic enemies from working within their own system but there
1330000	1336640	is a commitment here further that O'Grady will talk about later when he defends rationality
1336640	1342440	when he defends rationality itself against attack in the next battle but also something
1342440	1349200	metaphysical that I feel is actually left out from O'Grady's discussion that perhaps
1349200	1356120	I will address at the end but how exactly then does this seeming obvious point become
1356120	1363120	very useful on the battlefield how does this really help us in a way to conduct our lives
1363120	1370520	or our society and how deep does it impact philosophy or the world well this star allows
1370600	1377080	me to speak enough but maybe not enough to elaborate or visualize my metaphors here
1377080	1382760	if you subscribe though maybe I will gain more power to speak myself but we are here
1382760	1388760	not for some shadowy nobody like me but for a real human being Paulo Grady so let's
1388760	1396600	get back to him so you can't actually argue for or against non-contradiction for doing
1396600	1403880	that would assume it so to avoid contradiction because now we know contradictions are bad
1403880	1409880	the relativist denies that there is a real contradiction because truth itself is just
1409880	1417160	relative something is either true for you or true for me for some of them that's their
1417160	1422280	distinction like now and then except they're not using now and then they're using for me
1422360	1428360	or for you so it's opposing views but not in the same sense thus it's not a real contradiction
1428360	1433640	for them and this is what we covered in the last episode episode six we saw Robert Kirk
1433640	1439480	battle this kind of relativist the true for me relativist the tfm relativist in the last episode
1439480	1444600	but O'Grady makes kind of quicker work of them than Kirk did O'Grady however asks a bunch of
1444600	1449240	questions that we all would of someone that claims truth is relative but I guess I'd only
1449240	1456280	highlight this question in particular if all truth is relative is that itself relatively true
1456280	1462440	or absolutely true pointing to the incoherence of relativists once again in a way can you see it
1463080	1469000	but anyway leaving that for now O'Grady then says something that is more true in our common
1469000	1475240	lives which is why I spent so much time emphasizing it in the previous episode with Kirk he says that
1475240	1482680	at the crudest level saying something is like true for me is just a way of being polite and
1482680	1490200	non-confrontational like saying God exists is true for me but this doesn't actually stop us from
1490200	1496120	judging whether something is true or false just that we're no longer judging the true or false
1496120	1501960	whether God exists instead it is changed to merely if it is true or false whether or not you actually
1501960	1508440	do believe one way or another this is common but is not actually a way of relativizing truth
1508440	1514840	so it's a non-starter whoa actually I really love this this is a great point that makes quick work
1514840	1520440	of the tfm relativists many relativists believe they are not making objective statements about
1520440	1528840	how things are if they put in qualifiers like to person x y is true well okay y is true is now
1528840	1538040	relative to person x but it's still a proposition that reports the truth of to person x y is true
1538040	1544040	now is this non-relatively true perhaps here's where we covered another cool thing that I think
1544040	1550040	Kirk did about how there could be an infinite regress with this but to be clear simply saying
1550040	1557800	I think science is good doesn't mean you're not making an objective claim just that your objective
1557800	1565560	claim now isn't about science it is about the truth of what you think and so we could ask about
1565560	1571400	the objective truth of whether you actually think that about science or not and it would ascertain
1571400	1578520	the truth of your statement in a way that is for us and for everyone and not just for you simply
1578520	1585320	saying to me or for me or in my opinion or I believe doesn't mean one isn't making an objective
1585320	1592200	claim actually all it's doing is just reducing or preserving the space to where we feel more
1592200	1599400	entitled to be objective where we are less likely to be opposed or questioned to speak about what I
1599400	1605320	think or how I feel one is more entitled to objectively take a stance on what is the case
1605320	1612520	with these qualifiers again think about how every assertion still nevertheless needs to be substantive
1612600	1619080	to say something and thus to oppose its opposite anyway so as O'Grady says there's got to be a
1619080	1625720	better way to philosophically relativize truth because this actually is a non-starter well
1625720	1631560	I'm gonna talk about three ways these are going to be the three better more philosophically
1631560	1638120	empower ways to try and relativize truth that the relativist may choose other than just stating that
1638120	1643320	everything is simply true for me or true for you we're going to call these at least three attacks
1643320	1648600	the first attack is going to be artificial languages associated with Tarski and Carnep
1648600	1655400	that truth is relative to a language or a system and there can be many languages so truth is actually
1655400	1661640	just relative to the pragmatic reasons we have to which system we decide upon the second attack
1661640	1668520	is going to be about how true and false aren't the only options associated with Joseph Margolis
1668520	1674600	the third attack is an account that is given by Chris Sawyer but one that shifts the relativization
1674600	1682040	away from being about truth really so this is the battle so this is the battle
1682520	1688280	O'Grady versus the Alithic well attack one artificial languages
1698040	1703480	since ordinary natural language were vague and imprecise for scientific use and could
1703480	1709480	lead to philosophic problems Gottlieb Frege championed the construction of special languages for
1709480	1717160	philosophy called Burgerschrift okay so I can't pronounce it despite having read it thousands
1717160	1722600	of times in many different places but hey I don't really have German philosophy friends to you know
1722600	1727800	have a quick talk about for this video you know so I could have learned how to pronounce it properly
1727800	1736760	I also don't have German friends to ask I also don't have friends anyway the idea was that if you
1736760	1742840	made language clear and precise enough like math you could clear away many philosophical problems
1742840	1748440	just by being clear about what is said to be and what is therefore implied by it and philosophers
1748440	1753560	could make these languages for scientists use we sort of already have been talking about this in
1753560	1760280	the last video when we discussed Carnap again check it out if you like but one of frega's students
1760280	1766200	Rudolph Carnap as I just mentioned took up the project various philosophic issues there in
1766280	1772280	ordinary language could actually be solved in these specially constructed precise languages
1772280	1779320	things like the analytic synthetic distinction logical consequence and even truth could be
1779320	1786760	clearly defined in such artificially constructed languages which language was chosen to be used
1786760	1793480	and therefore which definition of truth it entailed was a matter of pragmatic choice for the scientists
1793480	1798520	that philosophers would make these languages for you see Carnap at the time felt in normal
1798520	1803960	language the notion of truth is a sloppy concept that just ends up in unnecessary philosophical
1803960	1809960	debate about correspondence between appearance and reality in the new languages however truth
1809960	1817160	could be given clear and strict definitions but only holds within that language now when Polish
1817160	1824760	American Alfred Tarski made his celebrated account of truth he followed Carnap in dealing with only
1824760	1831720	artificial languages and his account of truth didn't work in natural language so the general
1831720	1839960	universal notions of truth began to be replaced with the notion of true in L where L is the
1839960	1844680	artificial language keep in mind that from the philosophic point of view the traditional
1844760	1850760	philosophic discussions about say what is the nature of truth were thought of as pseudo debates
1850760	1856360	arising from the confusion over language so really it became more preferable that truth
1856360	1861480	was thought of as merely a term with a clear definition that depends on which language you
1861480	1870280	choose in this way truth becomes relativized to each artificial language and in fact contradiction
1870280	1876520	can happen within a language but each language gets to set out its own criteria of what counts
1876520	1883880	as a contradiction too and so contradiction only happens within a particular language not across
1883880	1890440	different languages so the relativist employs the Tarski-Carnap argument that truth is just whatever
1890440	1897000	is true in L and different languages can actually be set so something doesn't count as a contradiction
1897000	1903560	within it and discussions of truth generally beyond what is true in L is just confusions
1904200	1911800	truth thus relativized well now Paulo Grady defends against this attack
1914920	1921160	firstly he points out what's the real relevance of artificial languages and definitions concerning
1921160	1926760	real beliefs genuine disputes between people about beliefs can't be sidestep because of the
1926760	1932280	employment of artificial languages that seems kind of like a common sense philosophy here but
1932280	1938200	Paulo Grady has an even more philosophic response to this issue check it out as he points out
1938760	1944360	remember choice between artificial language is a pragmatic issue which shouldn't itself
1944360	1950040	be a discussion of truth it's just a matter of whether one versus another is more useful or not
1950040	1960280	right but even to say even to make the judgment that this language is useful requires the notion
1960280	1969000	of truth that it's true that that language is useful this judgment of truth that a language is
1969000	1975640	indeed useful or not stands outside the particular artificial language themselves not relativized
1976200	1982920	and it's that notion of the truth in a general theoretical sense that this artificial languages
1982920	1992280	attack tried to remove well see it didn't such use seems unavoidable wow what a move that was
1992280	1997400	awesome Paulo Grady did something awesome here like uh i love this because it challenges that
1997400	2003960	naive notion that pragmatics somehow dissolves philosophic issues in all cases such as discussions
2003960	2010120	of truth and knowledge now you uh maybe perhaps don't do philosophy in academia but there's no
2010120	2015320	field of knowledge whether medicine sport science law or business analyst or something like that
2015320	2021960	where the discussion of how do we know something in that field isn't important or in this case
2021960	2029240	it helps to show that if you have a concern about is it true that trying to replace it with
2029240	2036920	its pragmatic that or its practical that doesn't actually really remove the philosophic concern
2036920	2043720	because someone with that concern would just move on to concerns of well is it true that it is
2043720	2050760	pragmatic and such and such this is a kind of similar move though isn't it to something we've
2050760	2058680	already seen saying true for me didn't stop our concern of objective claims nor does saying oh
2058680	2065960	it's pragmatic that stop our concerns with is it true that in a similar fashion do you see it
2066520	2075080	trying to say hey discussions about truth can be made to not count down here across languages
2075080	2082520	at the artificial level doesn't remove how they do happen up here because the notion of truth
2082520	2088520	can't be avoided so long as any judgment is happening from a kind of above position
2089560	2096760	above position i say hopefully my visuals are helping here and we will continue to use them
2096760	2103720	to show how in a sense we go high or above to speak about things anything when we are stating how
2103720	2111240	things are in a capital t truth way even when we qualify our statements with to me or to them or
2111240	2118280	in science or its practical that or its pragmatic that and hopefully by the end of this video
2118280	2123240	you will come to realize the necessity of this and it will actually build the power of this
2123240	2128760	philosophic eye that i promised so maybe it's worth rewatching this video twice uh to get what
2128760	2132840	i'm kind of saying here if it sounds a little confusing but don't worry about it like it will
2132840	2139240	really become much more clear once we covered both these battles in any case attack one has failed
2139240	2145560	but the wicked elithic relativist isn't done yet another far more spooky attack comes about
2146280	2154520	attack two multiple truth values conflicting views produce a contradiction in a classical logic
2154520	2163560	in which there are two truth values either the truth value of true or false two now relativists
2163560	2169160	are accused of self-refutation this is the self-defeat that we saw earlier with that circle
2169160	2176040	also sometimes called incoherence but to avoid that problem some say there's more than just
2176040	2184040	two truth values that there could be three or more which means they drop the classical logic law
2184040	2191160	of the excluded middle a law that states that there's only truth and false no third value
2191160	2195720	so just to re-explain this sort of sorry if this is repetitive but it's important to be
2195720	2200840	clear about what the strategy is here if you remember the relativists wanted to use something
2200840	2205720	the principle of non-contradiction because they needed in order to express a content
2205720	2213560	but the content that they wanted to express was to deny that principle p and not p that itself
2213560	2220520	is a contradiction both of these cannot be true or perhaps another way to look at it is p cannot
2220520	2229240	be both true and false but anyway looking at the example of p and not p because both cannot be true
2229240	2235640	then if one is true the other must be false this relied on the principle of non-contradiction as we
2235640	2244360	saw before if this is true then this has to be false but also the other way around if one is false
2244360	2251560	the other must be true easy enough right so choosing one of the two options forces the
2251560	2257560	opposite proposition to be the other option but this isn't just because of non-contradiction
2257560	2264760	it's also because there isn't a third option here and that's called the law of the excluded middle
2264760	2272520	things are either true or false no middle no new option but if we drop that law and we had like a
2272520	2279480	third option then saying this is false doesn't necessarily mean that this one has to be true
2280120	2286120	it could also possibly be this other thing whatever it is so dropping the excluded middle
2286120	2293240	law may save the relativist from self-defeat in this way that way they can deny p the principle of
2293240	2301080	non-contradiction while not necessarily asserting p as true it would be this new thing what would that
2301080	2311800	third value even look like well some say indeterminate so like t f and question mark maybe or others say
2311800	2319800	like mostly mainly or half truth and mostly mainly false well that's like seven different values there
2320360	2326520	but if you think of it if you can do something like that you can even do it using more numbers
2326520	2336600	for probability like between 0 and 1 0.1 true or 0.56 true doing this kind of thing instead of just
2336600	2343480	t and f doesn't necessarily make your relativist but it can be helpful to relativists in defusing
2343480	2350520	what could have been a contradiction if we had only a two-valued system p may be very probable
2350520	2361240	or 0.96 true while not p could be half or 0.5 true and so it is claimed a classical contradiction is
2361240	2369640	avoided joseph margulis makes a detailed relativist position that demands the rejection of the principle
2369640	2377160	of excluded middle rejecting the two values only systems because using a two value only system
2377160	2382600	could lead to a contradiction for relativists if they try to use this classical logic to defend
2382600	2387880	ontological relativism or incommensurability incommensurability is another thing that happens
2387880	2392520	to appear to promote relativism as it means there's no shared value or shared position from which you
2392520	2397800	can measure two different things so they can't be compared so to avoid contradiction they move to a
2397800	2403880	multi-valued logic instead but that might be the motivation behind why the relativists want to drop
2403880	2410760	the law of the excluded middle but margulis also had reasons presented in that he links his rejection
2410760	2422680	to what he calls cognitive intraintra what intrapah to what he calls cognitive intrapah shoot he links
2422680	2429640	his rejection to what he calls cognitive intransparency we don't really know the world in itself the
2429640	2433880	world is always mediated to us in historical and context laden ways
2436440	2441800	so how does polo grady deal with this multiple truth values attack it seems pretty radical
2441800	2450280	out there to say that there's more than just truth and falsehood well first off is it really a new
2450280	2455720	third value we're talking about here like look at this one like just because you don't know what the
2455720	2462680	value is and maybe you never can thus calling it indeterminate that doesn't mean it's a new value
2463240	2469240	it just means that you recognize that you don't know that it's a truth gap and they've already
2469240	2474840	been systems that developed with this truth gap in mind and they don't act like this is some kind
2474840	2483880	of new value somehow secondly just because you add modifiers like most or sometimes or 0.33 to
2483880	2490680	a classic two-value system hardly means that you actually made new values one obviously can see that
2490680	2496280	these things as merely saying probability of something but it isn't actually a new kind of
2496280	2501960	fundamental truth value being introduced here seems to be an epistemic issue that is an issue
2501960	2509080	about knowledge of how likely something is to be true rather than importing a new conception of truth
2509080	2513960	thirdly just like with the case with artificial languages is it really helpful to our cases of
2513960	2519240	contradiction it could be after all merely still relying on a two-valued system anyway
2520520	2528280	thus the second attack attack two while it seemed pretty radical still nevertheless
2528920	2534600	failed now ogredy just makes a quick point for himself he says look one of the main reasons
2534600	2540520	for ontological relativity is to avoid contradiction in ontology anyway what he's saying is that
2540520	2547640	relativists want to avoid contradiction even as they espouse the way the world is can be different
2547640	2553560	and relative but ogredy says we can have that without having to alter our conception of the
2553560	2559320	truth there are alternatives to get to ontological relativism without having to come up with new
2559320	2564360	truth values and presumably he will explain what those ways are in his chapter on ontology
2564600	2571320	where he himself allows for relativism and so as a larger strategy trying to go at it like this
2571320	2577480	and figure new ways to make new truth values is not necessary and paul ogredy then advocates for
2577480	2582840	what quine calls a policy of minimum mutilation this is like ogredy saying that if you want
2582840	2588600	relativism in ontology we can figure out a way to do that without having to do this massive change
2588600	2593880	when it's completely unnecessary to do so we should do the minimum amount of changing so i
2593880	2598840	guess the question then remains how how do we get that and wait what exactly is ontological
2598840	2605080	relativity because really i mean i really really didn't in detail explain it in this video yet
2605080	2610440	but neither did he so i guess we kind of have to wait to check out his chapter in ontology
2610440	2615560	to really see what's going on there and how we can get ontological relativity without massive
2615560	2622680	changes to truth but for now let's move on to the third attack attack three strong and weak
2622680	2629960	distinction chris soyer also investigated relativism while charging most arguments against
2629960	2635400	relativism as unfairly assuming absolutism in the first place he ultimately at least
2635400	2640760	this argument defends against a kind of alithic relativism as we shall see even while accepting
2640760	2646040	a few of their premises in any case he says the typical version of alithic relativism
2646040	2652360	employs a notion of frameworks as we have seen in the previous video about the power of relativism
2652360	2657800	similarly with terms like paradigm framework language games conceptual scheme while all can
2657800	2662520	come from different places they function in much the same way as to the arguments employed by
2662520	2668120	relativists and against i guess objectivists who think that there is some kind of director
2668120	2675320	unmediated access or observation or descriptive ability of reality itself relative truth is truth
2675320	2681960	that is relative to some framework this framework may be of different kinds historical cultural
2681960	2687880	linguistic or biological for example so like everything that so like everything that makes
2687880	2693560	up how you interpret or mediate the world so the issue is something that is true in one framework
2693560	2699400	but false in a different framework because it's relativized to different frameworks it avoids
2699400	2704680	the contradiction that would have happened if it was the same framework a grady points out as we
2704680	2710840	can tell it's basically the same thing as true and l where l was for an artificial language but
2710920	2715400	now it's just replaced with the notion of frameworks a grady then goes on to use an example
2715400	2720840	of the hopi indian tribe now the hopi indian tribe is one of the most widely cited examples by
2720840	2725400	relativists you know along with the azandei i guess and relativists of many stripes pushing
2725400	2730680	relativism into whichever field of investigation they desire the hopi indian do appear to have
2730680	2736040	different worldview and we'll talk about what that is in the next battle but a grady will argue that
2736040	2742200	that means they have different ontology not therefore different everything which some extreme
2742200	2747720	relativists might insist that they do have also different logic therefore and different rationality
2747720	2754040	and different truths even that is for the relativists their language is proof of relativism about
2754040	2758840	truth anyway this little note of mine here is kind of spilling the beans behind what o grady
2758840	2765800	will say as he puts it in brackets on a paragraph 13 line 67 a source of confusion here is that the
2765800	2772680	hopi do in fact have a different ontology soyer is exploring the possibility about relativism
2772680	2778680	about truth but it seems better to explain the difference in the hopi and the standard scientific
2778680	2786120	view with relativized ontology but keeping an absolute conception of truth soyer makes a distinction
2786120	2793240	between strong and weak relativism wherein strong relativism the same sentence can be true in one
2793320	2801240	framework but false in another so like spirits live in trees true in the hopi framework but false
2801240	2807720	translated to normal english and then there is weak relativism where one sentence cannot even be
2807720	2814200	expressed in another framework where translation is not possible soyer decides he's gonna focus on
2814200	2820600	the strong one because he says that's where most relativists are at anyway thinking that translation
2820600	2827800	is possible but the way he sees it is that there are two premises the world as experienced is
2827800	2836040	partially constituted by frameworks and translation is possible between frameworks and somehow this
2836040	2845640	is supposed to conclude to truth is relative in the strong sense but soyer doesn't think three
2845640	2851720	follows two is questionable especially if the statement becomes contradictory false in one and
2851720	2858040	true in another how could they have anything in common if the worlds the frameworks are so different
2858040	2863640	then what sense can the sentence even mean the same thing in what sense are they the same sentence
2863640	2869160	or equivalence if the ontology is different between the frameworks that is if the world is
2869160	2874280	different expressed by the two different frameworks then it seems that the meaning of the sentence
2874280	2881000	must be different as soyer pithley puts it and pithley means a brief or sharp or forcefully
2881000	2887800	like straight up soyer straight up says it like a change of world entails a change of meaning
2888520	2894680	so to encapsulate that saying that something can be false in another framework it shows that it's
2894680	2899400	not really the same thing then if you're really trying to say that the other framework can be so
2899400	2906440	radically different that can lead it to being false because of this attack three strong failed
2907400	2913320	so if you didn't get that strong relativism won't work or at least it seems if the worlds are so
2913320	2918760	different that the same sentence can be false in one yet true in another the sentence doesn't
2918760	2924040	really mean the same thing then the meaning of the sentence is changing if the worlds are so
2924120	2930760	radically different that we could even consider one thing false while true in another and our focus
2930760	2936440	as per ogready has been much more to do with seeing how the idea of worlds can be different
2936440	2942440	doesn't necessarily need to include that truth is relative okay so the strong attack failed but
2942440	2948120	what about the weak attack weak alithic relativism where a sentence is inexpressible in another
2948120	2953640	framework remember we kind of had that condition earlier about how legitimate relativism about
2953640	2959560	truth would allow for contradiction in a different context different sentences become
2959560	2966840	candidates for truth and false like a context of math taxonomy or genetic history etc in a
2966840	2972600	different context a sentence may not even appear so to make that easier to explain i guess while
2972600	2977960	playing basketball the truth of whether light is really the universal speed limit would not even show
2978360	2983800	it wouldn't even be a candidate for truth or false while playing basketball is it two hundred
2983800	2988920	and ninety nine million seven hundred ninety two thousand four hundred fifty eight meters per second
2988920	2995000	like i can't even ask such a question in basketball type of language so whether that's true or false
2995000	3000760	doesn't even register in basketball language let's say and therefore the truth of that sentence
3000760	3005640	is relative to languages where they would be even a candidate for truth and false
3005720	3012360	but already says that ain't really relativism about truth though for relativism we need something
3012360	3018440	to be true and false in different contexts but just cuz something isn't expressible in another
3018440	3023640	language doesn't mean there's a threat of contradiction it seems like these different
3023640	3028600	contexts or different styles of reasoning here whatever you'd like to call it can still nevertheless
3028600	3033800	be perfectly compatible different things are being discussed which can be lumped together in a larger
3033800	3039800	account with no contradiction so relativism about truth isn't defensible in that way either
3040760	3043800	attack three week failed
3043800	3053800	so
3066440	3071880	well that was an awesome battle wasn't it well oh grady did some good work there i think but
3071880	3076280	there's still more room more attack left in the relativist for those that believe that
3076280	3082120	different theories of truth can allow for more openness to a relativized version of truth so
3082120	3087480	now oh grady has a section where he talks about correspondence theory of truth epistemic theory
3087480	3093160	of truth and a deflationist theory of truth the former two being what he calls substantive he
3093160	3098200	discusses how depending on which theory you use it has different impacts for relativism in other
3098200	3103480	places but because i'm currently not thinking i'm necessarily going to be covering his entire book
3103480	3107960	or at least not sure to what depth i'm going to be doing that i'm just going to cover it quickly
3107960	3112840	with this kind of graph and then we'll go on to the second battle basically the ones that are
3112840	3118680	substantive are saying that truth is substantively important that it's a kind of property of some
3118680	3124920	sentences or belief that makes it explanatorily important the deflationist ones are where truth
3124920	3130760	is insignificant and just a kind of grammatical thing we say he talks about alfred he gives an
3130760	3136760	example using a tarski here but i'm just going to skip that part anyway of the substantive ones
3136760	3142920	he discusses too the first one being correspondence theory where truth is when propositions correspond
3142920	3147960	to reality he brings up a few reasons why this is actually untenable like how the best ones really
3147960	3154360	still entail how larger propositions rely on the truth of basic elements but there aren't basic
3154360	3160280	propositions in the natural language and how it's not actually well explained how there's a structure
3160280	3166040	in a proposition that is the same one in reality how they can both share that same structure
3166040	3170040	anyway if you like a detailed discussion of this kind of criticism of correspondence theory just
3170040	3174440	let me know in the comments below but the point is that correspondence theory doesn't leave room
3174440	3181400	open for relativism on ontology nor in epistemology or at least technically it can still be connected
3181480	3187000	to ontological relativism you know relativism about what there is or what kind of things there are
3187000	3190920	in the world but that would kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a correspondence
3190920	3195560	theorist in the first place because it makes correspondence theory not all that substantive
3195560	3201880	if language could connect to multiple realities then he talks about how there's an epistemological
3201880	3207880	theory of truth where truth is just the best of what we know this kind of has a problem of well
3207880	3214440	you know we can be wrong about things so truth seems to change as we adjust and the answer back
3214440	3220440	to that concern is usually like cool whatever truth is an ideal anyway like a goal that we
3220440	3226120	just never reach because we never truly finish investigating everything but we always will
3226120	3231800	try and the best of our trying is what we'll just call truth it makes it kind of grammatical I guess
3231800	3237560	in that sense responding to that however critics are often like you're just conflating issues with
3237560	3244360	knowledge and how or if we can have certainty with what the truth is but they respond back well
3244360	3248840	that's not much of a criticism you're just inherently assuming or stipulating that truth
3248840	3254920	is something other than what we propose here in any case this one though does leave the doors open
3254920	3260600	for relativism in ontology and in epistemology the study of knowledge but just because it leaves
3260600	3266360	doors open for relativism in ontology and in epistemology well does that really mean that it
3266360	3271640	can leave doors open for relativizing truth as well well O'Grady will argue that the amount of
3271640	3277240	relativism in the epistemology is actually limited by rationality which is another place he battles
3277240	3282280	to defend against relativism and the result of that kind of has a trickleback effect I guess you
3282280	3287560	could say to ensure that ultimately there is one absolute truth and that's what we're gonna see
3287560	3294120	next so let's see now how he defends against charges of relativism in rationality oh wait
3294200	3298840	before we do that we should look at logic logic in some sense already seems to be much of the
3298840	3304120	discussion in defending against relativism for O'Grady it's a part of his whole setup anyway
3304120	3308920	also it's often the go-to move for people to push back against claims of something being relative
3308920	3315640	they just say hey it's logic anyway so let's check that out the link for the next video will
3315640	3321560	be below I think you deserve a break but if you don't need a break and you're ready to go ready
3321560	3329640	get that next thing on then let's go now and see logic versus relativism by the way thank you for
3329640	3335160	watching this video give it a like and a comment too the comments I have received over the years
3335160	3340360	actually as well as my patreon supporter slick pockets are ultimately the greatest motivating
3340360	3346520	thing I see comments of support mentally really help me and honestly there are things that I find
3346520	3350920	in those comments that are sometimes so touching even though I don't reply like I really do read
3350920	3355720	all of them and I know I'm doing something good things here and maybe even with my life because
3355720	3360920	of those comments you know I don't even know if I've mentioned before but writing the script for
3360920	3366440	this episode episode seven like I literally heard gunshots out of my window while writing philosophy
3366440	3372760	it's it's caught me really questioning sometimes why I'm doing this so they help so if you can
3372760	3378680	please socially or financially help me you can support me on patreon or if you have paypal you
3378680	3384840	can send me money and a one-time direct donation and I understand that may not be easy for many so
3384840	3391960	if not those uh let's try to just get me to a thousand subs maybe then perhaps my creator will
3391960	3413240	grant me a neck finally also remember philosophers keep battling
