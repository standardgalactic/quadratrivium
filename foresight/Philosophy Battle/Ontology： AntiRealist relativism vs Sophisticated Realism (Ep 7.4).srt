00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Philosophy Battle, the most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet, probably.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, entering the battlefield of metaphysics.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey everyone, my name is AJ and welcome to Philosophy Battle.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Before this video starts, I want to make clear this video will introduce ontology, what it is and to what degree it can be relative.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is after all important to investigate because it matters if there are actual legitimate grounds

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
as to why someone might say we live in different worlds so you can't support or criticize one another.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Like, how exactly do we live in different worlds?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And how extreme can that claim actually be meant?

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But it will actually lead us into an exciting discussion about realism and anti-realism in philosophy.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Trust me, it's gonna be awesome.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's one of my favorite things to talk about in philosophy, so I may be a little bit theatrical at times.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We will be discussing pre and post Kantian views and well, it can be treacherous grounds,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so if you don't get certain parts or get lost or don't know what's going on, don't worry about it too much.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just be patient as it could very well be cleared up later and the point at the end will be made pretty clear, at least I think so.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The video is generally covering the discussion as it is presented in a book of a philosopher, Paul O'Grady, a pretty recent work

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because I felt his book has a lot of great and interesting battles in it as well as some important lessons for us.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, I may end up saying this again a little bit later after I do a sort of recap into the video, so forgive me if this is repeated,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having here, that's okay.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to, even if I'm suggesting another video in this video.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just take it more as a signpost, even an important signpost possibly if you want more information if I suggest other videos at various points, which I will.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I believe this will be a good video regardless for introducing one of the main problems in metaphysics about ontology or even in philosophy itself, so let's start the video.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ontological Relativism

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is it and why are we talking about it?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, ontology is a field of study under the branch of philosophy called metaphysics, so we're doing philosophy and we're having a metaphysical discussion.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A discussion about what though?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ontology is a discussion about what there is, what kind of things exist in the world and what the world is fundamentally made of

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
or what kind of properties are a part of the world.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So for example, believing there is only matter in the world that the world is just made up of matter only.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's your ontological position.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or if you think the world is made up of ideas, which includes these senses, you know, like the sense of touch and the sense of color, the sense of smells and so on.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All of these just being ideas coming to your mind and so the world is just that.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The world is just made up of ideas and maybe minds that give and receive ideas.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That would be an idealist ontology.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Or even if your view of the world is that there's earth and there's heaven and hell, that too is your ontological position.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A position about what there is in the world, what exists.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Though that has some religious connotations and we're not discussing religious views here.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is not about religion.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We're just having a discussion about what there is in the world.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And this conception seems to have a view that the world has different planes of existence.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Perhaps for someone it's not about heaven and earth, but about universal forms and particular manifestations of that.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All of these fit within the field of ontology.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So perhaps in some sense, if we can just crudely say epistemology is about knowledge, then ontology would be about the world.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Or reality.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
While people may have different views about what the world is fundamentally made of or what kind of structure reality really has,

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
our question today is about whether the world or reality is relative.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now we commonly already are relativists about a number of things, not just things like taste in music or preference in Pokemon.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But even in descriptions of physical things, like things being big, such descriptions are known to be relative.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The bird is big compared to the ant.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But compared to the tree, it's not.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The tree is actually big compared to the bird.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But compared to the mountain, it's not.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The mountain is actually big compared to the tree.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so on.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Big is a relative description.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
In fact, if you imagine this self illuminated cube were the only thing in the universe, nothing else,

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
not even the edges of the screen as you look at it,

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
then there's no way of knowing if it's big or small.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Without anything to compare it to, calling it big is meaningless.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
An empty idea.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And so there's no point here in talking about it like it could even be considered big.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So what if the world, reality itself, is relative?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What if our ontology is relative?

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wait, relative to what?

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, guess what, we actually came here to the battlefield of metaphysics

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
just to discuss the power and limits of this philosophic weapon called relativism.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why?

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because we actually came from the battlefield of the philosophy of science,

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
where we had encountered some enemies wielding this weapon to extreme degrees.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So because of that, I thought it would be beneficial to come here to the battlefield of metaphysics

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
just to dismantle this weapon.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
To show its power and limits.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So while there are a few books I may cover,

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
currently I'm covering this topic mostly based on the writings of philosopher Paul O'Grady

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
in this green book called relativism.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In his book, he covers a variety of different philosophic areas to discuss relativism.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's not going to be discussing ethics or morals, you know, what's right and wrong,

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
or aesthetics, like what counts as beautiful.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But he's more interested in cognitive things like truth and reality and knowledge

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
if even those things can be considered relative.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So after explaining the power of relativism, which is a wickedly powerful weapon,

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
he then goes on to defend against relativization in two areas.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He battles against relativization on truth and on rationality.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So I made a video covering his first chapter that I phrase as covering the power of relativism.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's my phrasing though.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I would really insist that you watch that video,

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
especially before thinking that one can just offhand dismiss this enemy.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you think it's obvious or evident that relativism is wrong for any reason,

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I put a lot of work into this video and I think you should definitely check it out

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because it will definitely pay for any good philosopher who wants to conceptually grip

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
what the issue really is in order to understand the power of this weapon.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not just in the sense to be able to dismantle our enemy to point out the flaws in their strategy,

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but also as a weapon to be wielded by us ourselves

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
in order to challenge anywhere that there are baseless assumptions of objectivity

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or naive thoughts about what's obvious and evident.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
On the other hand, this weapon does have limits that our enemies did not appear to be aware of.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The dangers of thinking everything is relative.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So we already covered the great and totally awesome battle

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
where Paul O'Grady defended truth against relativism.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And please go check out that video.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's definitely one of my favorite battles of all time

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and certainly has important lessons that can go along with us in our philosophic journey forever, probably, I don't know.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But he did also use a kind of principle of logic in order to make that defense

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and so it kind of made sense that in that first chapter he did also talk about whether logic itself can be relative.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So I guess I also therefore thought important to cover that topic

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and made a video discussing logic itself.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Logic in the way that philosophers or logicians or kind of I guess also mathematicians know it.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is looking at formal symbolic logic and really offers a much more in-depth understanding

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
of what logic is than the common person or lay person does.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It certainly goes beyond the mere rhetoric of political pundits online, for example.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There, however, Paul O'Grady did actually allow relativism

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that we did seem to accept relativism in logic

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but only in terms of a lower order.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That there seemed to be a higher order and a lower one

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in the higher order there still seems to have maintained certain principles of logic

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of which hasn't truly been argued for yet.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It will be argued for in that chapter 5, the next battle.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I wanted to skip to that rationality battle

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because I only came here to the battlefield of metaphysics

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to discuss the power and limits of this weapon.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Having already covered the power, I only wanted to cover the limits

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the places where he defends clearly against relativization.

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But I kind of noticed that in that area of rationality

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Paul O'Grady does seem to have certain strategies and techniques

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that make reference to these previous chapters.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it would leave something wanting if I didn't at least somehow explain

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what's going on in these other areas.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I thought it important to at least kind of cover what's happening over here

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
since it is part of his strategy in rationality.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But this video is going to be way different from what I normally do.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You see normally I cite everything I say down to the line

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
when I'm covering some philosophers writing.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But today I'm not really going to be covering Paul O'Grady that closely.

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm just going to give a more general description of what's going on in ontology in some way.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So it's going to be much less structured and less scripted

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
since there's not much citation that I'm going to be giving anymore.

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You see that kind of line to line citation that I was giving before

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
actually provided some kind of order and script

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
even though I don't ever use a kind of proper script

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the kind of citation was still giving me a kind of order for my videos.

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But without it this is much less scripted than my normal videos

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
so forgive me for that.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But nevertheless I will still try to present sort of what his framing

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
of the main battles and the main issues are in this chapter

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
as he presents it kind of.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Though I will still be clear about certain things that are framed in his way

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
versus things that are framed from me.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm just not actually going to be covering either of these chapters

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
like fully or in depth as I did the other battles

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
where the battles are happening that I'm interested in.

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In any case I will come back to talk about this chapter maybe later

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
when I kind of finish off doing Paul O'Grady

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and want to give a full evaluation of this book.

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There's a reason why this chapter in particular is something that I might want to talk to

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
in more depth or detail in the future.

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And I'll talk about what that reason is.

156
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In any case the point of this video is just to generally cover ontological relativism

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and the kind of issues that are happening here

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the sort of battles that are going on

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
in the more modern type of take

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
both as O'Grady frames it and as I would

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then we'll just discuss where O'Grady lands on this issue going forward.

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So if you don't know who O'Grady is or anyone else don't worry about it.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you're here just to talk about ontological relativism

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
this video will still be very helpful

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
at least giving a kind of outlay of the kind of battle that's going on

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and the different issues and different perspectives

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
that come to conflict with each other.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay?

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As already discussed in the Power of Relativism episode

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
O'Grady points out a pre and post Kantian view

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and don't let those words be spooky.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll explain them.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Basically back in the pre Kantian

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
or Kant days there was this kind of image

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
the idea that there was the world and us

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
or our mind

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and we have beliefs and propositions

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or observations about the world

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the world as it is

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
so ontology was about that

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the world that would be a certain way

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
even if we aren't there with our observations

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
beliefs or thoughts

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
so like the tree is here

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
not there

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the mountain is denser than the clouds

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
et cetera et cetera

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that the world independent of our minds is

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and is a certain way

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the world that would be that way

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
even if no humans existed

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
even if all species capable of having beliefs

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and observations had gone extinct

195
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the world in of itself

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
not relative to someone's perspective

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
would be there and be a certain way

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
so that's more of a pre Kantian kind of picture

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and while we can all have different kind of ontological beliefs

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
about what that world is like

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
there still seem to be some agreement pre Kant

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that that's what we were talking about

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
but then Kant came along

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and he done messed that whole thing up

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
he changed the game for real

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and now we have this new picture

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
where this world that we observe

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that we have beliefs about

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
or thoughts of and make propositions about

210
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is actually constructed in part by our minds

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the mind by our categories of understanding

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
as Kant call them

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
needs to give shape to whatever it is that's out there

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to make a world that is even understandable by us

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in this sense we never directly observe reality itself

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we can never really know in any way or form

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
what this outside stuff is

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or anything about it

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
even possibly that it exists

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
so I represent it as this gray mush

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but really I can't say it's gray

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or say that it's mush

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't really say anything at all

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but I'm using this as a visual

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
just to show that the concepts of color or shape

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that would come from us and our minds have not applied here

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in fact Robert Kirk calls this cosmic porridge

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and this is not that I or Kirk are advocating

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that this is what reality really is

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in fact Kirk argues against this cosmic porridge kind of picture

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
because as a realist we want there to be something

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and that this something is a certain way

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
not that it's merely some indistinct gray mush

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
anyway we'll get back to that

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you see Kant had these universal categories

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that everyone's mind has

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that structures the world as it is to us

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
as it must be to us

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
that ontology wasn't about the world

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
independent of the mind

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but the world as it is known by us

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
as it is observed by us

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
for example when it comes to the understanding

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
of bodies actually existing in our world

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
we have this kind of structure of understanding

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that a body must have extension in the three dimensions

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and if it really is existing

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
perhaps extension within the fourth dimension of time as well

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
or perhaps we can think of it kind of like as a net

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that applied from our mind results in producing

251
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the kind of things that we have contact with

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
now those are different kind of takes about what's going on

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
but in general this is a post Kantian picture

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
however to have a better understanding about how it is

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that our concepts or the structure of our mind

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is actually structuring the world as we observe it

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
as we make sense of it or understand or think about it

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
please check out that power of relativism video

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it will give a much more detailed discussion

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
about how the mind is in some sense constructing

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and if perhaps you are just more specifically concerned

262
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
about science

263
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you can maybe check out my video on the philosopher

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and historian of science Thomas Kuhn

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
one video is his response to his predecessor Carl Popper

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and the other one is a video I made

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to explain how Kuhn's philosophy opened the gates

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to those who wanted to bring this weapon

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and make charges of relativism against even science

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so if you're kind of more interested in that sort of construction

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and the kind of relativization of even observation

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you can go check out those videos

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
however while we're here in ontology though

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
let's continue with our discussion

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in this case the world that we can know, speak of

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
or observe is only one that can exist

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
within the framework of our conceptual scheme

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
or categories or paradigm

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
or any other name used to describe how it is that our mind

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
is constructing the meaning of the world as we observe it

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
we have no access to this outside stuff

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and because of this depending on who you ask

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
not only does it make no sense to talk about

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
whatever the outside is

285
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
it doesn't even make sense to say it exists

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and I know that sounds kind of strange

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but because they are not holding onto

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
or even actively denying the idea of a mind-independent reality

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
they are considered anti-realists

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and they are opposed by those who hold on

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
to the existence of a mind-independent reality

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
who are considered realists

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and this is a battle that is near and dear to my heart

294
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
anyway we should note that because Kant held

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
according to him a more universal account of the categories

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
that is the kind of conceptual structure that structures

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and gives meaning to the world as we observe or understand it

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
he nevertheless wasn't a relativist in that sense

299
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
however because other philosophers such as C.I. Lewis

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and I would argue also resources from natural science

301
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
would hold that these categories that we have

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or concepts and conceptual schemes that we use

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
in making the sense of the world as we know it

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
are also a product of a social, historical

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and cultural background

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
meaning they could actually be different

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
for different people

308
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
different people in different times in different cultures

309
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
have very different concepts

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and the world as it is relative to those different sense of concepts

311
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
would be different

312
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
our ontology

313
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
what the world in this sense is

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
is therefore relative

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
this is ontological relativism

316
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
under that previous sense of anti-realism

317
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
again so we're clear relativism here is that

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because people can have different concepts

319
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and different conceptual schemes

320
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the world is different for everyone with a different conceptual scheme

321
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and also importantly

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that these different worlds

323
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
perhaps not in small part because they are anti-realists

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
cannot be reduced to each other

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
or that there is one correct world type of thing

326
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that is the ontological relativist position

327
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
they cannot be reduced

328
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and one is not more correct

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
since certainly at least according to their conception

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
there isn't exactly a mind independent reality

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
in order to appeal to

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
in order to say one is correct

333
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
so Ogrady presents the main battle in ontology

334
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
between these two positions

335
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
an anti-realist position

336
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
called the ontological relativist

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and a realist position

338
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
called the sophisticated realist

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
both in some sense actually accept

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and have moved on to a post-continent type of picture

341
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the sophisticated realist

342
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is a realist because they still want to hold on

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that there is a mind independent reality or world

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but they are actually unlikely naive realist

345
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that was probably far more likely to exist in the pre-continent picture

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
a realist that believed there was only one theory

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
one could say that we have

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
that is of a mind independent reality

349
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
one theory that is the most correct one

350
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
or that other theories can be reduced to just one theory

351
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
for example in the old school

352
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
perhaps we may have thought that physics is the ultimate theory

353
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
other stuff whether psychology or sociology

354
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
everything can be reduced to physics

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and physics being not merely about the world as we know it

356
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
but about a mind independent reality as well

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
that's not really a sophisticated realist position

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
in the post-continent picture however

359
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the sophisticated realist holds that we can actually have

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
different theories of the world

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
based in part because they give a sense to the idea

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
how different conceptual schemes are giving meaning to the worlds

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
different worlds

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
so there would be different theories of the world

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and yet one of those theories isn't considered the correct one

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
or most correct one

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
that they can all exist and yet not be reduced to each other

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but they are still nevertheless about a mind independent reality

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that exists and is a certain way

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it has certain properties

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that I guess they would say either is successfully or not conveyed

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
or somehow connected to those theories

373
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and so somehow or other structure

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
or perhaps how Paulo Grady would phrase it

375
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
constraint on what our theories can even be

376
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is coming in part from here as well

377
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
a mind independent reality

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
not just there

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
not just the mind

380
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in this sense the sophisticated realist feels that they have

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
accommodated relativism

382
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and how our conceptual seems construct what we know

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but still are realist about reality

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
this in modern philosophic warfare is the main battle

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
happening in ontology as it is presented by Paulo Grady

386
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a battle between the ontological relativist

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and the sophisticated realist

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
while it may seem like the sophisticated realist

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is actually pretty accommodating

390
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
the ontological relativist still being an anti-realist

391
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
denies the sophisticated realist position

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
saying there is no sense of the world beyond the mind

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that it makes no sense to speak of it having properties

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
or being a certain way

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
because of course in order for something to be discussed

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
as being a certain way

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
having certain properties

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
only ever make sense within a conceptual scheme

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
it only makes sense if concepts are being applied

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and if it is then we aren't actually talking about a mind

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
independent reality

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
also it seems to be that part of the ontological relativist point

403
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is to say that if theories can in fact be different

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and not reducible and that one theory isn't the most correct one

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and what point also is there even mentioning that there is this thing

406
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
why bother bringing that up then

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
now this may seem super frustrating for those of us who are realists

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
but it's not like we didn't in some sense feel a similar way

409
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
when it came to big

410
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
remember talking about this cube as if it is big

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
makes no sense

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
it can't be called that

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that's how we felt

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
so the ontological relativist may actually be equally frustrated with us

415
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
in insisting that reality is a certain way and has certain properties

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
as we might be with someone else who doesn't understand why this cube

417
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that has nothing else to be compared to

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
cannot be described as big

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
since big is relative

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the ontological relativist feel that all properties

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
or description, everything

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
is relative to a conceptual scheme

423
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
comes from a mind

424
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and yet here we are trying to describe mind independent reality

425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
with no conceptual scheme applied

426
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
yet still trying to say it has certain properties and is a certain way

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
that equally doesn't seem to have any meaning or have any sense

428
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
in the way that describing a cube as being big

429
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
when it's the only thing in existence seems to be meaningless

430
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or like an empty idea

431
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
now as an aside note

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
there's also another reason that works for them in their perspective

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
not only is there this basis of how our conceptual scheme

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
is giving shape or constructing

435
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
or at least providing the schemata for which things can have meaning in the first place

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but they also feel that this in some way helps them defend against skepticism

437
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
because one of the big issues in philosophy

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
is that despite what we claim to know

439
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
it's possible that no matter how much justification we have

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that a mind independent reality could nevertheless be different

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
in more of a classic way of phrasing it

442
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I guess we could say we could hold full justified belief

443
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
about what the truth is

444
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and yet the truth could still nevertheless be different

445
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
hence we would not have knowledge

446
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
in fact that possibility is always the case

447
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
meaning we could never really know if we actually have knowledge or not

448
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
which is pretty skeptical

449
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
because a mind independent reality may always turn out different

450
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
now Kant thought something like this too

451
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
that he had somehow solved this kind of skeptical issue in some way

452
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
because when ontology is about this

453
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
then the possibility about being wrong of a mind independent reality

454
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
isn't really an issue for the anti-realist that drops that concept

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but that isn't all that convincing to the realist

456
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
who would say dropping this

457
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that we can ever know or understand it

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
or be in any way shape or form in contact with reality

459
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
is exactly skepticism

460
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
you haven't defeated it

461
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you just given into it

462
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
so that isn't much of a motivator for a realist

463
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
but the ontological relativists say back

464
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
it's only not convincing because you are applying your unjustified view

465
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
about there being this thing

466
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
we didn't lose the world

467
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
we didn't lose objects

468
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
we didn't lose things

469
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
we don't deny reality exist

470
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
just that all those terms are about this

471
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
no words or terms or identifiers or symbols or anything

472
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
make sense about anything beyond this

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
a conceptual scheme or paradigm or language

474
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
is required for something to even make sense or have meaning

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and so I find this is where most of the battle really is

476
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
about the frustration of trying to use terms

477
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that are always nevertheless tied into this area for the ontological relativists

478
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but I'll kind of show you what I mean

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
first it's important to note here

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
that for the ontological relativist in this sense

481
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
there is no division between epistemology

482
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the study of knowledge

483
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and ontology then

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
because the ontological relativists deny the division between mind and world

485
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
there is no world beyond the mind

486
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and accusing the ontological relativists

487
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
of simply conflating the issues

488
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
of what we can know and understand

489
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
with issues about what exists

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
well, the ontological relativist points out that

491
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that conflation only makes sense

492
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
because you had already presumed an ontological perspective

493
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
with a mind-world distinction in the first place

494
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
some realists would argue

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
well, we have a realist conception first

496
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and that thereafter we actually need good reasons

497
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to be able to switch to another ontology

498
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and that there are no good reasons for that

499
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
but are we really ontological realists first?

500
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I mean, common-day people aren't exactly philosophers

501
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and also just the idea that it's first would eventually mean anything

502
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
as O'Grady says that doesn't actually cut much ice for philosophers

503
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I've never actually heard that expression before

504
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
but I think it's super dope

505
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
oh, it doesn't cut much ice for philosophers

506
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
like, you know, I don't know

507
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
do philosophers cut ice?

508
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't know what O'Grady is doing on his part-time

509
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
anyway, okay, so one of the main issues here

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that I'm gonna describe is a big philosophic trouble actually

511
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
so please think of it yourself

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and really try to grasp what the ontological relativist is saying here

513
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
because there is actually problems for both sides

514
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
because a problem for the sophisticated realist

515
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
is what exactly is coming from here

516
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I mean, we want to say that the world is a certain way, right?

517
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
it has to be or have

518
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and this is my phrasing to help explain it in the way I think of it

519
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but it has to have some kind of information then

520
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but the relativist for good reason says

521
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
information cannot exist without a language for it to be expressed within

522
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and even the realist wants to recognize this

523
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
they want to be able to recognize that without a conceptual scheme

524
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to have any meaning in there can't be information

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
so it kind of seems impossible to be able to say or describe

526
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
what is out here that has any information

527
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
or properties or is a certain way

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
just simply impossible to convey what it's influencing here

529
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
what structure or what constraints it gives to what our theories can be

530
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
how can we express this inexpressible

531
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
how can we talk about information being in the world

532
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
when there is no language out there

533
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
language comes from us, our minds

534
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
but on the other hand, the problem for the ontological relativist

535
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
is that they don't really want to say that everything is coming from our mind

536
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that would be a kind of radical idealistic picture that they deny

537
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
that the world is just ideas

538
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that we can just literally flippantly change reality with different concepts

539
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
that we make up as we go along

540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
O'Grady calls this Promethean Anti-Realism

541
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
but it's important to point out that reality there is meant in their sense

542
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
this middle thing

543
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
reality, the world, stuff, information, things, objects, matter, properties

544
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and all of those only have meaning constrained within the conceptual scheme

545
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
so this conversation is really hard because anytime a realist tries to use these words

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to describe what they're talking about

547
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
they can be pulled into the terms as used by the ontological relativist

548
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and that's super frustrating

549
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but as it seems to me at least

550
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
they too, in their own terms, are inconsistent

551
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
even in this chapter as O'Grady is describing their position, they are inconsistent

552
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
part of this inconsistency which I would argue

553
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and I think clearly is the more damning part is the fact that in order to explain their position

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in order to deny that these words are about this thing

555
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and are instead about this thing

556
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to even make that clarification

557
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
they are in the process of speaking about this thing

558
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
which they say is meaningless or impossible to do

559
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
this kind of relates to the lesson Wiccanshine gives in On Certainty

560
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
where it's nonsense to respond to nonsense

561
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and yet here they sometimes talk about the realist's position

562
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in order to contrast against it in a meaningful way

563
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
again in the process of denying an unconceptualized reality

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
they employ that concept as if non-relative and as if meaningful

565
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or if it could only actually even possibly be meant in a relative way

566
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
which is what they are fine with

567
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
then they would not be in a process of denying it

568
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
in their process of pulling terms into their relative stance

569
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
they sometimes use the terms in a non-relative way

570
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to explain or elucidate the change or meaningful difference

571
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
so it seems it is possible then for those words to mean something

572
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
other than what the relativists insist that they can only possibly mean

573
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
so this move of mine here for this chapter

574
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm not really visualizing too much right now

575
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
because in part we've already seen it before in other applications for truth

576
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
so I hope you kind of still understand what the point is I'm making here

577
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
but also it will certainly be given much more detailing in the chapter on rationality

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because it will be used by Paul O'Grady

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and I promise that detailing will be wonderful

580
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
anyway there is another reason for their occasional inconsistency here

581
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
in order to deny just being full-blown idealist

582
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
they do seem to want a brute force say that it just exists

583
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and don't get me wrong they are consistent that we can't talk about

584
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
what this stuff is like that it has any properties or information

585
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
but at most that it just is

586
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
hence the cosmic porridge or the visual of grey mush that I used

587
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but at the same time and here's a problem that was even for Kant

588
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
it exists is a property

589
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to say something exists is also to talk about it

590
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and they actually do seem to need to employ it

591
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
other than the mind because they don't want to say the world is just the mind

592
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but at the same time the world isn't beyond the mind

593
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
so you can see it seems to lead them in a kind of confused state

594
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it definitely isn't the state that they want to say that something is beyond the mind

595
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
they want to say the world is within the mind

596
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and yet they don't want to say that we are actually constructing everything from our own heads

597
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
or at least deny that it's possible that we could somehow just flippantly decide

598
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
or on a whim decide what concepts we want to use

599
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and change reality as it is actually experienced by us

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
so because they don't want to say there can be any infinite random tandem amount of theories

601
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
they want to apply some restrictions to it

602
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
but deny that the restrictions to what the theories can be

603
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
come from a mind independent reality

604
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
instead they proclaim that the constraints on what theories can exist about the world

605
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
come from the mind itself

606
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but that means this restraint which comes from the mind

607
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
could nevertheless be the means by which we criticize another

608
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
if that is itself universal in some way

609
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and what are those constraints?

610
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
well, Paulo Grady is going to give an account of what those restrictions are

611
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
in his chapter 5 in rationality

612
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
now from here on in O Grady's chapter in ontology

613
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
he does have a kind of outline that mainly focuses on two philosophers

614
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that are most well known for ontological relativism

615
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
both Quine and Putnam

616
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and really he does go to some detail explaining their positions

617
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
because it's not exactly a simple thing to talk about

618
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but I'm just going to skip all of it completely

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
after explaining both of their positions

620
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
he then has seven objections to ontological relativism

621
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
three of those objections are specifically targeted to Putnam

622
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
one objection is specifically targeted to Quine

623
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and the final three are just general arguments against ontological relativism

624
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
some of these arguments work but seem to target just the philosopher

625
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and not the kind of general position of ontological relativism

626
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
other arguments just seem to lead to other battlefields

627
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
like whether or not IBE inference to the best explanation

628
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
is appropriate to making ontological metaphysical arguments about the nature of reality

629
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
this is namely the no miracles argument

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and like I said I don't want to get into all of this stuff

631
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ultimately when it comes to these arguments

632
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
it simply seems that there isn't a kind of final blow

633
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
there isn't anything fully restricting the possibility of ontological relativism

634
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
so O Grady allows for ontological relativism here

635
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
he seems to settle on the idea that relativism does go all the way through to the end

636
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and anything beyond that is meaningless to talk about

637
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and so in some sense he also perhaps on that basis

638
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm a little bit unsure but he does accept the kind of differentiation

639
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
between truth and ontology

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
he feels one can absolutely be an absolutist

641
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that is a non-relativist about truth

642
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
while still being a relativist about ontology

643
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and certainly that seems to work within the schema of the ontological relativist

644
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
since the ontological relativist is denying a mind-independent reality

645
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
so all you would have to do is discuss capital T truth

646
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
as if it doesn't have to do with a mind-independent reality

647
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and indeed if you do go look back on that chapter

648
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
where he does absolutely defend a non-relativist truth

649
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
he isn't relying on appeals to a mind-independent reality

650
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
which is actually pretty great

651
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but anyway here in this chapter

652
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
is actually where I'm kind of really critical of O Grady

653
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
well maybe not really critical but kind of critical

654
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and in my final video about this book

655
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I will take a closer look at the chapter to outline the kind of criticism that I have

656
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but to me and I'm just a shadowy character on the internet here

657
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
still he seems to be tricked by a technique used by the relativist

658
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and maybe not exactly tricked

659
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
because the technique is used in other areas

660
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and he combats against that same technique

661
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
so instead I currently feel like

662
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
even though he could have actually made a stronger case

663
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
against the relativist in ontology

664
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
he really is instead merely allowing for relativism in ontology

665
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to a much greater extent

666
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
both because he feels it's safer than in epistemology

667
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
where it can cause damage to rationality

668
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
since rationality actually plays a role in epistemology

669
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
but also because he feels he can agree to segregating the areas of truth

670
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
from ontology

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
saving his victory there

672
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
not only is it safest to allow it here

673
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I think in part his technique in this book overall

674
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
is simply to funnel the relativist away from other areas to this place

675
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
where they can cause the least amount of damage to the areas he battles against it

676
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
in any case there are still some good battles in this chapter

677
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and he does give much more detail in the dealings with three philosophers in particular

678
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
David, Quine and Putnam

679
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
if you, my subscribers, really would like a detailed look at this chapter

680
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
perhaps I will do it at some point in time

681
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
but you gotta let me know

682
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
because these videos, they're super hard to make all by myself

683
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I have no editors, no animators, no co-writers

684
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and no funding beyond my one Patreon supporter, Slickpockets

685
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
as yet

686
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and like I said, I didn't really come here to the battlefield of metaphysics for this

687
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
even though, yeah, this is probably the most metaphysical stuff that I'm talking about

688
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
even in this whole series

689
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in other case this issue as I see it and we will see it again

690
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is a problem in different areas

691
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and can be described and visualized in many ways

692
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and this is just one way

693
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the question and issue is

694
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
how is information outside

695
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
if language can't be

696
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
how is that outside

697
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
influencing the inside

698
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
what of our descriptions of the world

699
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
what amount, what way

700
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
what properties is from outside

701
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
how can we ever know

702
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
since we cannot know the outside

703
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can go on and on for hours rephrasing that

704
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
so instead I would try to ask you to phrase the problem yourself

705
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
in your own mind

706
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to get a good grip with what the problem really is

707
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
because you really do come to grip with the philosophic problem

708
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
when you realize due to this new post-continent picture

709
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
simply saying we get the outside

710
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
by observing, seeing, touching, etc

711
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
no longer is sufficient

712
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
as even those acts

713
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
what we are seeing

714
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
what information we are getting when we touch

715
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
it is structured by the kind of creatures we are

716
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the kind of interests we have

717
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the kind of minds we have

718
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
the influence of the kind of conceptual scheme we have built for ourselves

719
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
influenced by our histories

720
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
like if we are in the medieval ages

721
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
or after Einstein

722
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and many other things

723
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so I do have my own opinion

724
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and my own kind of answer in some sense about some of these things

725
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
but it's not my place to say it here

726
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
as I said

727
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I will talk about ontology again

728
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
after I am done

729
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and giving an evaluation of this book

730
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but I simply do not think I have any right here

731
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
at least in this place

732
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
to start telling you what I think the proper solution is

733
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
in my kind of formal idea and presentation of it

734
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm not trying to do that

735
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I was just trying to give you

736
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
an outlay of what's going on in ontological...

737
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
what's going on in ontological relativism

738
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the kind of issues that are in play

739
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and the kind of position that Paulo Grady settles on

740
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
now let's move on to that next area

741
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
epistemological relativism

742
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
see you there for the battle

743
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
oh please subscribe and stuff

744
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that would be like super nice because I think

745
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I really want to be able to prove that a philosopher can exist out here on the internet

746
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and it can provide a place for us

747
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
anyway
