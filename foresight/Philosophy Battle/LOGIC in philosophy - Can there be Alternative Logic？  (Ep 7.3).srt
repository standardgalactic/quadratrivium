00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hey everyone, my name is Ajay and welcome to Philosophy Battle.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,560
Before this video starts I just want to make clear that this video is about logic and whether

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,120
or to what extent there can be alternative logics.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,960
Because if there can be alternative logics, then which logic we are using can be considered

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,180
relative to some other factors.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,840
And typically logic is taken to be one of the strongholds against claims to relativism.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,040
Logic is often taken to be as proof of something that isn't relative, much like math.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,320
So this video will introduce also some basic logic and the basic concepts of logic and

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,800
if you are already familiar with logic, well just be a little bit patient.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,720
The more philosophically gripping stuff will come at the end.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,000
Either way it does get progressively more intense, but stick to it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,240
Even if you don't get certain parts or know what's going on, it could still be very well

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,120
cleared up later on at some point and at the end the main point or main conclusion will

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
be made pretty clear, at least I think so.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,440
Now the video will be covering a section from a book of a philosopher, a lecturer at Trinity

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,720
College in Dublin, philosopher Paul O'Grady, because I think that his book has got a lot

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,080
of great and interesting battles in it and a lot for us to learn.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,480
But if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,560
here, that's okay.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,640
You don't have to watch anything else other than this if you're just interested in logic,

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,040
even if I'm suggesting it.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Just take it more as a kind of signpost if you want more information, if I do suggest

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,600
another video at various parts of this one.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,040
Trust me, even if you don't watch any other things, this will still be a great video introducing

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
the ideas of logic and the possibility of alternatives in philosophy.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,640
Finally, I just want to thank my Patreon supporters.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Slick Pockets

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,940
Now let's start the show and hear a short recap of how we got here first.

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,440
Logic vs. Relativism

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,760
This video is part of a series covering a few books on relativism before we go back to

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,120
the battlefield of the philosophy of science, where we had encountered some extreme relativists.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,940
And trust me, it's going to be awesome when we do go back because of what we learn here

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,120
in the battlefield of metaphysics.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,880
In particular, this video is covering a section in this green book simply called Relativism

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,320
by Paul O'Grady.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,000
We previously already covered in a video his first chapter that explains the power of relativism

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,880
that I visualize as this philosophic weapon.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,240
That video explains how this philosophic weapon came into being in modern philosophic warfare

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,120
as empowered by five great philosophers and thus how it's possible that even a reasonable

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,960
person may perhaps be led into believing that everything is relative.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,320
Not just what flowers look the best, or what candy tastes the best, or who's the best

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,280
philosophy YouTuber, it's me obviously.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,600
But that everything is relative.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:57,060
They feel truth, knowledge, scientific fact, logic, even reality is relative.

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,560
Nothing is objective.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Nothing.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Absolute.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
Now that's an extreme position.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,360
But the powers of this weapon is actually based in philosophic writing and the history

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
of science.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,800
It's not just some made up contrived stuff here, so please go check out that video if

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,560
you'd like to really understand why one can't just offhand dismiss a relativist.

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,420
When you really see the reasoning, it can be clearly a difficult enemy to challenge.

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,760
But also, this wickedly powerful weapon is an important one for philosophers to use ourselves

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
in investigation to challenge to question claims of objectivity.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,080
It's just that unlike these extreme relativists, we will gain the understanding to see that

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,960
it does still in fact have limits.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,920
And Paulo Grady in his book covers two places where he defends against the charges of relativism,

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,520
where those limits of this weapon should be, on truth and rationality.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,840
So these are the two battles that I wanted to cover, one on truth and one on rationality.

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,120
And actually we already covered that first battle defending truth, and trust me it was

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
so awesome.

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,920
So if you're interested in just trying to figure out how to defeat this enemy in terms

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,680
of defending a non-relative truth in particular, then you can check out this video.

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,880
But to be honest, the way I presented it was that Ogrady does a kind of setup first, where

66
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,400
he actually uses a logical principle of non-contradiction to then go into battle on these two areas.

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,240
So it's understandable that he actually has a section devoted to relativism about logic

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,800
in particular right in that first chapter, where he's going to discuss whether or not,

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,840
or to what extent, we can have alternative logics, whether logic is relative.

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,280
So that's what we're going to be covering right now, and I did promise I'm going to

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,240
try and go a little faster in this normal one because it kind of was just an additional

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,500
section to that first great battle.

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,240
But I thought it might be also nice for me to show you all what formal symbolic logic

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,960
actually looks like if you're not familiar with it, it might be kind of cool to actually

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,840
visually see, and it will also give you a kind of good mental understanding to sit in

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,600
the background of what philosophers really mean when we're talking about logic.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,080
First is just some, you know, I don't know, it's like a political hack on the internet

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,560
touting rhetoric about how logic is on their side, we mean something much more than that.

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,560
So despite me trying to blast through some stuff, since I am still covering what Ogrady

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,200
says, as usual I will cite things down to the line, and when I'm not speaking for or

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,400
giving my interpretation a presentation for our purposes of what Ogrady says in the text,

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,600
then the citation in the corner of the screen will just disappear.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,440
That way you'll know it's coming from me, and what is coming from my interpretation

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,640
of what he's saying.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Cool?

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Get it?

87
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
Okay, let's go.

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,680
Logic is intimately tied into issues of truth because of the notions of coherence and contradiction.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,840
Not everyone feels that way though, some will say it's more noticeably about inferences

90
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
than about truth.

91
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,640
But I don't have time to deal with them here, and most do see logic as having something

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,880
to do with truth, and I already mentioned a couple of logical laws in the previous battle

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,400
against the Alithic Relativist, Alithic being about truth and relativism as in being dependent

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,920
on something else.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,380
And namely, I mentioned the laws of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle.

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,600
And if you want to see that, you know what to do, hehe.

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Anyway, the question is, even if yes, so say the truth isn't relative, even if the truth

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,360
is absolute, couldn't there still be legitimate alternative systems of logic?

99
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,320
Or is there just one most basic, one correct one?

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,000
Ogrity then tries to explain what logic even is, saying it's fundamental to human reasoning.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,400
It governs the process of inferring beliefs in a truth-preserving way, such that if one

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,240
starts with true beliefs and then makes no mistakes in logic, one is guaranteed to have

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,080
true beliefs as a conclusion.

104
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,280
This is usually what we call validity, and it's the central notion in logic.

105
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,920
A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,360
Now thousands of years ago, Aristotle was the first to codify logical laws and principles,

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,000
but they were around even before him, but this codification marks it as a formal discipline.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,680
So I'm gonna try now and explain this as best as I can with some actual visual examples

109
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,240
that might help us for the background for the rest of this video.

110
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Logic is a way of reasoning, and let's look at three examples of mine.

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,920
If it's true that if it rains you should put on a coat, and then you find out it is raining,

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,800
we can conclude you should put on a coat.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,920
We just kind of reason it out, or for another example, if it's true that if it rains then

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,080
the street would be wet, but then you find out the street isn't wet, then you can conclude

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
that it didn't rain.

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
This is us using logic to figure this out.

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
But let's do one more.

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's just for the sake of argument imagine that it's true that either it's raining

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,440
or we're eating pizza.

120
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,760
But we find out, hey, we're not eating pizza, we can conclude then it is raining.

121
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,120
So logic is the ability for us to figure out a conclusion that kind of preserves the same

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,000
amount of certainty as the stuff that led to the conclusion.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,160
So technically logic isn't about figuring out if those premises are true or not, but

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,440
just that if they are the conclusion must be true.

125
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,960
So like in this example logic won't be telling us if it's actually true that it's actually

126
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,280
raining outside for example, unless of course you know it's raining is derived from some

127
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,560
other argument prior.

128
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,400
In any case logic is just what's helping us reason out this conclusion.

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,440
And philosophers have codified that like math has been codified.

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,280
And just to help us with a comparison to math which actually is going to be a running theme

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,720
later on, reasoning in math doesn't need to look like this.

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,800
This is kind of a codification and symbolization of math.

133
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,080
Technically one doesn't even need to know any of what these things even mean to reason

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,800
out mathematically.

135
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,400
In fact when we first teach this symbolic math to children we actually teach them the

136
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,160
reasoning in other ways first without this symbolic language.

137
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,000
For example we might say hey look at all your fingers put them up, you see there is one

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
two three four five six seven eight nine ten up.

139
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
Now put two fingers down.

140
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Now see how many fingers you have left up.

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,760
One two three four five six seven eight.

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
So there are eight fingers up.

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Thus children may be able to figure out how many fingers are up without even being literate

144
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
or even ever having to see these particular symbols ever.

145
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,000
But math has been formalized and symbolized and has functions that we slowly begin to teach

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,720
children moving away from saying something like I give you five apples but you eat two

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,480
apples to just saying you have five apples but take away two apples.

148
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,140
Then we just stop saying take away and start saying minus two instead.

149
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,640
Also we'll just stop saying the apples so we end up saying just five minus two.

150
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,920
Then again perhaps we will teach them a more appropriate way of saying it as five subtract

151
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,760
two while showing these symbols in particular.

152
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,160
Then we fully begin to discuss our numerical or quantified reasoning through this mathematical

153
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,760
symbolic language in ways that don't even have to connect to real world stuff.

154
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
We don't have to be talking about apples and oranges or whatever else anymore to do math

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,040
like this through symbols.

156
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,520
So now a similar type of thing has happened and from here I'm just going to ask you to

157
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,680
follow along as much as you possibly can but if you get lost don't worry we're going

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,640
to go back to O'Grady but I think this will be pretty fun.

159
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,240
So similarly philosophers have made it so that we can symbolize the process of this

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,440
stuff but by representing these propositions as letters we'll be using in our calculations

161
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,640
and having certain symbols to represent those relations between propositions kind of like

162
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,480
these symbols in math I guess you could say such as the if then symbol a conditional symbol

163
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,440
so if p then q or this symbol for negation and while we have these symbols we also have

164
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,320
inference rules that allow us to use these symbols and figure things out using these

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:17,840
symbols in different ways for example if p then q well given p therefore q this is called

166
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,080
modus ponens it's super simple and it fits pretty well with our first example but now

167
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,600
let's look at that second example if these propositions are represented by these letters

168
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:36,880
then we can show it as if p then q and we find out that not q thus we can conclude not

169
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,840
p this is called modus ponens again so like that first one was allowing us to show the

170
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,880
truth of p that led us to the truth of q this one kind of allows us to use the negation

171
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:59,480
to move backwards the falsehood of q or rather not q allows us to figure out not p backwards

172
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,640
and now for our third example if these are our definitions we can present this with an

173
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:11,520
or symbol and we can do something called disjunctive syllogism where p or q means either this or

174
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,040
that which means both can't be false if one is false the other has to be true so if we

175
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,640
have not q it means that we can conclude p so that's what these would look like but

176
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,200
again remember logic isn't actually figuring out if not q is really true for this argument

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,560
we have to find out other ways to actually verify not q in this case it's just that

178
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,760
if it were not q then we can conclude p must be the case and so this is a valid deduction

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,800
is either valid or not if it is valid it can be sound or not and we know if it is sound

180
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,480
by some other means by figuring out if this particular argument still has all its premises

181
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,560
are actually true now that might not seem like an important distinction but actually it's

182
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,440
very important for a philosopher because sometimes your enemy presents an argument and technically

183
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,200
their logic is valid as in these things really do lead to this conclusion logically so the

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,640
problem isn't that it isn't valid just that perhaps you question one or more of the premises

185
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,520
as being true so you're not saying the argument isn't valid but that it isn't sound because

186
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,320
say this premise isn't true for example now that may be not super important for what we're

187
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,160
going to be talking about in this video so don't worry about trying to remember all

188
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,400
these things if you don't know about it but it is super important for philosophers just

189
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,040
to be accurate about what we're criticizing in another to ensure our attacks actually

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,640
land but getting back to the symbols now let's go and make a big old puzzle but now kind

191
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,480
of like not needing apples anymore we're not even going to need these definitions we're

192
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,160
just going to show these letters because we don't even really care if it's sound we're

193
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,760
just going to be trying to figure out if it's a valid deduction so let me just add a couple

194
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,600
of other things so we can make a bigger one just as an example first of all dn or double

195
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,400
negation it's where there's two knots two knots cancel each other out so not not p through

196
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,440
double negation just makes p and vice versa that one's pretty easy we kind of spoke about

197
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,640
this previously in the previous video but also there's another one where p and q written

198
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,600
maybe with this symbol instead of ampersand could be simplified through the process of

199
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,400
simplification either as p or as q and the other process can happen too where if you

200
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,800
have p and q in different places you could actually just put them together through something

201
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,440
called adjunction and have p and q anyway now let's look at this one for funsies if

202
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:56,200
q then p q or r if r then not s given t and s prove q it's like a puzzle isn't it let's

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:04,120
solve it now so we're given p and s we can simplify that to just s and with just s we

204
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,080
can make it not not s through double negation right because it's the same thing but with

205
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:19,160
not not s and if r not s we can do modus tolens and therefore get not r because remember whoop

206
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:27,000
so that's not r and with not r and q or r we can do disjunctive syllogism therefore getting

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,880
us q because remember if it's not r then it has to be q and with q and if q then p we

208
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:43,840
do our basic modus tonens and therefore conclude p boom done that's the proof we proved p if

209
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:52,280
these are all true then given this one can prove logically this must be true fun huh

210
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,320
well if you don't think so that's okay it's like a puzzle and if you learn all the rules

211
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,480
intimately and do more puzzles it can be super fun just like doing math or stats puzzles

212
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,960
or playing chess or doing sudoku I don't know they can all be super fun if you play

213
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,960
them and it can really be cool and enjoyable to take the truth of this and run it through

214
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,560
this big ol process and get a result here considered a proof this is really basic stuff though

215
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,360
and actually there are far more advanced logics than this but let me just stop there before

216
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,600
I cut myself off too early when it comes to logic being presented in this way it's called

217
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,000
formal logic and it is a kind of symbolic logic so personally just to be clear when

218
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,920
I find some in the common regular non mathematicians non philosophers non computer scientists

219
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,640
saying logic they kind of just generally mean some kind of reasoning something like I believe

220
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,160
what I believe based on this this is what I think and I think this makes sense that's

221
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,240
my logic well that seems really loose and open and it seems to also sometimes mix or

222
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,800
not even regard the difference between soundness and validity but either way still there's

223
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,960
some understanding that logic has something to do with some kind of reasoning but when

224
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,440
philosophers say logic it pays to mention if you mean formal logic like this like as

225
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,880
in a system created for us to do reasoning in of a certain kind kind of like saying I'm

226
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,320
doing math to a mathematician they will tend to now really think of math in this way in

227
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,400
particular this may just seem like an aside but trust me we'll come into play later formal

228
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,400
logic just systematizes and articulates a kind of inferences we make in our everyday reasoning

229
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,080
processes to help us figure out valid reasoning versus fallacious reasoning fallacious is if

230
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,160
a conclusion doesn't actually follow from the premises well Aristotle's classic formal

231
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,440
logic was so good that a couple of thousand years later Emmanuel Kant was like logic is a

232
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,720
completed science nothing to add but then there was a renewed interest in logic in the 19th century

233
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,600
because of big developments happening in math and as we've been mentioning in like the last four

234
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,560
videos I think German mathematician and philosopher Gottlieb Frege made one of the most significant

235
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:15,880
contributions with his big big big riff bigger shrift forgive me for not knowing how to say

236
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,480
this properly read it a thousand times just don't have friends to tell me how to say things

237
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,360
and if a bigger shift actually kind of looks like this but it was Frege's writings who actually

238
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,200
brought for a more modern symbolic logic it was even more sophisticated than Aristotle's and

239
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,560
could articulate relations and generalities in such a way that one could even show mathematical

240
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,720
truths derived from logical truths so like I was saying earlier we can do a mental processing that

241
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,280
we call reasoning which makes use of a kind of logic in terms of inferring beliefs from other

242
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,400
beliefs and formal logic systematizes and makes a symbolic language of us doing that kind of

243
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,760
reasoning which actually helps us do that kind of thing but maybe we could say there's another

244
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,800
kind of mental processing perhaps we'll call it calculating which is the use of math and this

245
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,440
math stuff is also systematized and put into a symbolic kind of language which helps us do that

246
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,840
well Frege's articulation was actually so good it made it possible to show that maybe even math

247
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,640
actually is from logical reasoning that it isn't a unique different kind of thought processing

248
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,320
this was called logicism and Russell and Whitehead furthered that position in their famous

249
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,360
Principia Mathematica showing their logical systems and how they can derive mathematical

250
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,040
truths from them what logic was shown to be more fundamental to our mental processing than math

251
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:48,720
that actually math comes from it wow so cool at least I think that's pretty cool anyway they

252
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,640
only actually used five basic symbols in their logic but later Wittgenstein you know who came

253
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,080
after it goes Frege Russell Wittgenstein anyway Wittgenstein in the TLP the Tractatis logical

254
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,720
philosophicus which is his most famous writing from when he was younger actually suggested

255
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,360
breaking down all of logic to just one symbol actually I think Wittgenstein used the shepherd

256
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,000
stroke to show this and really shepherd was the first to show this I think to show that we can

257
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,880
do all of propositional logic with just one symbol but I'm not sure if he was the first to

258
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,560
actually show it so if you're a logician and you know who is actually the first to show this let

259
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,120
me know in the comments below but also if I remember correctly I think Wittgenstein was trying to

260
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,200
show that even predicate logic can be expressed with it too but anyway if that sounds like nonsense

261
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,080
don't worry about it basically we have these five symbols right the if then conditional the if and

262
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:46,360
only if by conditional this symbol which is basically and the or symbol which means that one of the

263
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,160
two must be true both can't be false and the negation symbol so there's five symbols right

264
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:59,400
but actually I can be fine doing it all with just one symbol what really just one symbol

265
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,840
how are you gonna do that well let me show you firstly this by conditional is pretty easy p if

266
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:12,360
and only q all it means that both if p then q and also if q then p it was just a combination of both

267
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,400
anyway to show that if you have one you can get the other and it goes both ways so scratch that one

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,360
since we can actually express it simply by using both of these in separate ways but now what about

269
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,200
this one the conditional if p then q how can I replace that well actually I can replace it with

270
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:37,000
the or symbol by saying not p or q wait what why well if you remember at least one must be true

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,600
so if one is false we know the other is true and so if q is false or not q then we can conclude

272
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,880
not p must be true and that's also basically modus tollens here if p then q but we have

273
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:00,840
not q then you know we would have not p so it works in both senses but now also if it's not not p

274
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,600
then it has to be q not not p is the same as p remember with double negation so that's the

275
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:16,280
same thing as saying if p then q so actually these are logically equivalent so I can express an if then

276
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,640
just using or so scratch that one too now what about these last three well check it out you can

277
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:31,160
take the chefer stroke to mean well it can either mean nand which is to say not and or nor which is

278
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,120
to say not or as far as I can tell I think you just got to be clear on which one you mean when

279
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,720
you're using it and for some reason it seems that people use the arrow down to be nor and is also

280
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,720
associated with pierce and this arrow the arrow up is more associated with nand and I don't really

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,280
know why I'm not really a logician or anything I'm just trying to be as honest and truthful as

282
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,640
possible here remember we're actually trying to talk about relativism but anyway I can't tell technically

283
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,360
why it is that way but as far as I can tell I think it just matters what you're actually clear on

284
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:09,160
when you actually do use it so if this lash means nor this chefer stroke then it means that both

285
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:18,280
must be false that neither this nor this so to show not p you would show neither p nor p

286
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,400
the only options for p here show that they are false so with this chefer stroke I don't technically

287
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:35,000
need this not symbol to show and p and q I can show it by saying neither neither p nor p nor

288
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:42,280
neither q nor q remember this is negating both sides saying both side must be false so to say

289
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:49,080
not p is to say this and if both of these are therefore not this and not this and both of

290
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,800
those are shown as being negative because they're shown with this and that flips them back to being

291
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,200
both true and thus you are saying p and q pretty cool huh anyway so that means I don't actually

292
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,120
need that symbol either I can show it all with just this stroke and also I can even show p or q

293
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,680
by showing neither neither p nor q nor neither p nor q and you can look at that and figure out how

294
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,160
that one makes sense yourself if you'd like but either way the point is I don't even need this

295
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,120
and so I can show all of these just by using one symbol this chefer stroke just this line and you

296
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,240
know what technically it doesn't even have to be this one symbol in fact I can make it all another

297
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,720
symbol or rather I can just take this line to mean something else the nand the arrow up instead

298
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,240
and they would look like this anyway this is not at all important to remember for us and our sake

299
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,360
so let's just take a deep breath and clear our mind a bit and not feel too bogged down if you

300
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,880
didn't get what I was saying let's just get back to oh grady the point is that we can break it all

301
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,360
down to just one symbol if we wanted or more if we wanted more depending on what suits us best

302
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:10,200
each would be its own system so we can make a new system with four or one with six but hey the real

303
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,880
question comes if maybe we can make an altogether new system we set up with new symbols that tell us

304
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:26,440
to do completely different things hmm anyway there's really no limit to how many systems you could

305
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,120
have one just set up a new set of symbols and a new system of rules of inference and a new system

306
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,600
appeared but these would be syntactic systems pure theoretical or formal like not connected to

307
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,200
anything outside of it when it comes to having to connect to things outside of it like those letters

308
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,560
representing real world stuff or true or false representing ones and zeros on a computer then

309
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,680
yeah then it seems like there's limits on what those systems could be and how are they these

310
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,440
new systems even related back to how we normally commonly just do reasoning logically you know

311
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,840
without these formal systems before us there were so many systems that could be very different not

312
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,440
just different from the principia mathematical but from the way we normally do daily common

313
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,480
logical reasoning now there were two fundamental laws in the principia mathematical that actually

314
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,480
go way back all the way as presented to Aristotle in ancient times those were the law of non-contradiction

315
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,600
and the law of the excluded middle the law of non-contradiction holds that a proposition

316
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,080
and its negation cannot be both true together the law of the excluded middle holds that all

317
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:46,040
propositions are either true or false there is no third value both of these came up before when

318
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,320
we battled against relativizing truth arguing to keep both of these and yo you really gotta

319
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,680
watch that previous video of truth versus relativism because Paulo Grady does some awesome stuff and

320
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,720
some important lessons there that could last forever in philosophy so please do check it out

321
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,480
well even those laws logicians have experimented with getting rid of them in these new various

322
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,680
systems that they can make but is it possible that even they can kind of represent how we in

323
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,560
common day do reasoning well well before we do that let's just be clear about the difference

324
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,600
between a classic logic with just a small change or a small difference and a full blown alternative

325
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,520
logic so philosopher susan hack actually has a very useful way of distinguishing between systems

326
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:34,920
that are actually rivals versus those that are just slightly added to so a basic logical system

327
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,560
is symbols that have rules on how to set up those symbols and what some of those symbols

328
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,880
mean as in what it says about their relation those are the inference rules or transformation rules

329
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,440
like modus ponens or modus tonens like i showed you earlier these things are also called well

330
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,520
formed formulas by hack but whatever anyway now this is just a syntactic characterization of how

331
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:03,080
thus a structure is set up a semantic characterization is the idea that truth of the premises that we

332
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,480
put into the system is preserved in the conclusion we get out now if we have two systems that are

333
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,760
set up the same with the same transformation rules but just looking different with different

334
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,480
symbols but they mean the same thing then that's not really a rival system the real differences

335
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:29,000
start when you get two systems let's call them a and b that share the same basic symbols but b

336
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,360
has more symbols and thus more theorems and greater expression we'll call this extended logic

337
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,160
it doesn't actually clash with the earlier classic system just adds to it ogready gives the example

338
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,280
of modal logic with the distinctions of necessity and possibility which is a kind of logic that i

339
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,560
didn't really do but i can imagine it one that i have done that i think would count here is called

340
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,560
quantified predicate logic is the one where you have the universal and existential symbols

341
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,280
logicians forgive me it's been a long time but anyway another difference here is if the symbols

342
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,440
actually mean something different if there's actually different rules of inference in that case

343
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:18,440
a would be a classic logic and b would be a deviant logic i assume because of how much it deviates

344
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,400
not because of how naughty it is in the bedroom to do or is it hey girl you down to do some deviant

345
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:33,160
logic with me back at my place okay sorry back to uh philosophy so an example of a deviant logic

346
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,520
would be a three-valued logic which we discussed three-value logic in the previous video again

347
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,640
please please do go check that one out it's a system where something doesn't have to be either

348
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,800
just true or false it can be even some other thing anyway another example would also be a

349
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,080
quantum logic where certain rules can be dropped in favor of different ones now some of these

350
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,600
deviant systems are actually proposed as a full-on replacement for classical logic like saying this

351
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,680
three-valued system is actually superior and should replace the two-valued one in all cases

352
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,920
to be clear for our question of relativism advocating that one is just right the right one

353
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:19,320
in all cases that we should always use it even if it is a deviant one therefore isn't relativism

354
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,440
it's still saying that just one is correct so it's not really relativism about logic even if

355
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,080
that one is a deviant one but how can we determine which is the true system of logic relativism

356
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,120
emerges if you say two or more systems are legitimate candidates and we can just choose

357
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,360
between them and even move back and forth even why would we want to be able to move to another system

358
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,480
well hack has four different sorts of reasons why one would want to do that that ogready outlines

359
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,040
and i'm gonna blast through these because i don't want this video to be too long like i said

360
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,840
i don't like how ogready phrase some stuff in here and really it's not all that important for us

361
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,760
to know the details of these only important that there are legitimate reasons to want to use a

362
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,000
deviant logic so this just goes to show that the issue goes well beyond just oh we can create them

363
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,920
firstly there's a general metaphysical reason an example of this is from dutch mathematician

364
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:21,320
bauer who thought unlike russell that math actually can't be derived from logic and while it can

365
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,320
exist as calculating in the mind in a way without an explicit symbolic language it is its own

366
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,640
fundamental way of thinking he felt the nature of math is that it is constructed by the intellect

367
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,840
so there couldn't be mathematical truths that are unknowable to the mind but this logical

368
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,960
principle of the excluded middle would mean that there are some math truths even things we don't

369
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,440
know that are still nevertheless true or false just we don't know them bauer denied this for

370
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,440
mathematical truth so he wanted to drop the law of the excluded middle so i guess like for bauer

371
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,200
that means math truths can't be unknown i'm not really sure here look this is a section where i

372
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,240
don't think ogrady says things right because clearly there's a difference between unknowable

373
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,880
or unjudgeable by the human mind versus just unknown or unjudged but anyway i guess if we really

374
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,120
wanted to see what's going on here or with any of these things i can just go and check out susan

375
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,960
hack's fuzzy book or maybe for this one in particular perhaps it came from bauer's two-part paper i

376
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,440
don't really know if that's where it came from i'm not sure because i didn't read susan hack's

377
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,880
book but if you want here's the journey for you you can read this and this and let us know anyway

378
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,280
maybe one day i can do hacks book in a series on logic like i'm doing these three books on

379
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,600
relativism right now but anyway the second reason hack presents is a desire to avoid philosophical

380
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,800
problems some philosophical commitments may be considered troublesome an example of that is

381
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:58,280
that someone wants to avoid fatalism the doctrine that events are predetermined and unmanable to

382
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,360
free will and one version of that comes just from accepting the law of the excluded middle

383
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,680
it is either true or false that i will be knocked down by a car tomorrow even though i have no way

384
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,800
of knowing which it is the case that one of these options is a determinate fact remember with excluded

385
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:24,840
middle something is either true or false not both not some new thing so facts about the future

386
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:31,080
must already be set in that way and for those of us who want to believe free will that my choice

387
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,840
which hasn't been made yet should impact what is true or false this could be seen as a problem

388
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,280
now there are different ways to deal with this one can just say that facts about the future can't

389
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,080
be true or false but doing that has a price you wouldn't even be able to say the sun will rise

390
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,680
tomorrow is true then so instead of doing that just denying the excluded middle could be one way of

391
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,880
diffusing the fatalist issue while at the same time allowing some future statements to be true

392
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,600
in any case the third source of reasons that motivates adopting another logic is a desire

393
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,960
to avoid scientific problems whereas the previous ones dealt more with dropping the excluded middle

394
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,520
this one's more closer to dropping the law of non-contradiction the reason being how these

395
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,200
deviant logics work with well-confirmed stuff happening in science namely quantum physics

396
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,960
now i had questioned this but whatever the idea is quantum particles behave in ways not

397
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,280
describable in the standard laws of logic like quantum superpositioning now ogrady uses david

398
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,280
z albert's quote about the path of quantum particles but ultimately says of this quantum

399
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,280
that it drops what are called the classical distribution laws but the distribution laws

400
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,480
isn't the law of non-contradiction i just want to be clear on that but anyway for the next one

401
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,720
the fourth reason is a desire for logical innovation systems can actually be made to

402
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,880
drop the law of non-contradiction why do that is it just useless well you know it's pretty much

403
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,480
just making them for the sake of expanding our minds sort of thing and maybe it can also help

404
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,400
us to understand paradoxes and stuff too so those are the four reasons ogrady outlines that hack

405
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,840
has for why someone would even move to an alternative logic it's not just a trivial or for the fun of

406
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,920
it type of thing that different systems can be made but now let's see some objections against

407
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,240
alternative logics ah the husband wife duo influential historians of logic w neal and

408
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,840
m neal hold that even from a purely formal point of view the ordinary two-valued system

409
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,920
has a unique status among deductive systems which can possibly be called logic since it contains

410
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,240
all others as fragments of itself in short they are not alternatives to classical logic

411
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,600
but this can be challenged truth for multi-valued logics actually may not appear in fact cannot

412
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,760
appear in classic two-valued systems i think that one's kind of obvious i don't know why they even

413
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,880
said that then ogrady says the distinctive position here seems just historical a long-standing tradition

414
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,200
but tradition can hardly stop philosophers and i agree with ogrady on that heavily but i would

415
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,160
like to note that from that quote though there's actually nothing in it to suggest that the neals

416
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,280
were making their claim on the basis of long-standing tradition but it reads like ogrady is saying

417
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,600
that's what it seems like their position also is but didn't cite that part or put a quote for it

418
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,360
not saying ogrady is wrong about them he certainly knows the neals ever more than i ever will but

419
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,680
just pointing it out that that quote actually had nothing to do with long-standing tradition of a

420
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,960
two-valued system anyway ogrady then devotes a few pages particularly to an argument by the

421
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,760
champion philosopher quine who uses the translation argument against deviant logics he gives us the

422
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,880
details of the background and all that and i don't really think that's fully necessary for our purposes

423
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,240
especially to show what ogrady's position ultimately is but i'll blast through it super fast

424
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,960
just so that i'm not depriving y'all of at least mentioning it given how much time ogrady devotes

425
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,440
to talking about it and i think you'll see why he's doing that though so like i said not to confuse

426
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,680
anyone but i'm gonna go kind of fast and be a little bit lax on this see first there was these

427
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,600
folks right and we'll call them rational intuitions who thought that logical truths can actually be

428
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,280
known in a special way prior to having any experience of anything so like you don't have to

429
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,720
make any observations in the world you can just kind of think about it and realize it's true

430
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,040
and so that's you using your kind of rational intuition to grasp its truth and while there are

431
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,200
a lot of logical truths that we know because we infer them from other ones some of them can actually

432
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,440
be known just straight up immediately with rational intuition no other premises required

433
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,920
and even some of those things that the rational intuition can figure out for us can even reveal

434
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,920
the nature of reality like some fundamental truths about how the world works anyway russell

435
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,920
who co-authored the principia of mathematically that book that shows logic more fundamental than

436
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,400
math you know logicism and whatnot well he felt this way too that logical truths are known through

437
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,880
our rational intuition not through any experience like other empirically dependent beliefs while at

438
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,200
first that kind of makes sense for us actually that would seem super spooky and mystical for the

439
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,880
positivists so they were all like yo f that but then to explain or make sense of how we grasp logical

440
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,200
truths then they claim that we know logical truths because they are dependent on the linguistic

441
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,520
framework we make or are using and if you think of it that also kind of makes sense based on what

442
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,880
we're saying remember we can make different syntactic structures if we want to so positivists

443
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,560
advanced a linguistic theory of logical truths holding that logic derives from linguistic rules

444
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,560
and there's different in many complex versions of this but carnap was one of them remember he was

445
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,880
a positivist philosopher who thought that we could make different linguistic frameworks or as we might

446
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,440
want to start calling it different logics for scientists to use so for those with the linguistic

447
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,840
theory of logic all logic really is is just following the rules within a linguistic practice

448
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,000
which if you think of it kind of implies there wasn't particularly anything special or deep about

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,160
logic beyond merely which linguistic framework we are using and i guess that's where we kind of are

450
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,160
now and now we're gonna see quine respond to this because quine ain't downwardist you see because

451
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,440
quine likes logic so quine agreed with the criticism against the intuitionist because he too wants to

452
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,520
be empirical in certain ways and we'll get to that in another chapter but he thought there was

453
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,680
actually no need to bother trying to explain logic with something else as if there's something more

454
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,600
fundamental to it quine be like logic is so fundamental to thought you can't explain or

455
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,360
argue for it with something else or gritty says of quine logic is so basic to our thinking that

456
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,080
nothing more fundamental could explain it so quine be like nah you don't need something to explain

457
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,720
it because if you understand the language you will just give a scent to logic anyway it's obvious

458
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,080
and anyone who correctly understands the language in question will just give a scent to a logical

459
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,040
truth as an obvious truth yeah you could have trivially different logical systems and textbooks

460
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,280
and whatnot but when it comes to actual deviant logics well if someone comes up to you and is like

461
00:39:52,280 --> 00:40:00,920
ayo p and not p you will be like no this this isn't a sincere deviant logical person it's better to

462
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,480
just assume that they probably don't understand what and means or what not means or they actually

463
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,960
mean something completely different when they say it because the assumption is if they did know what

464
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,320
those things mean in the way that we do they simply would not be saying it it's just always better

465
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,280
to believe there's actually a mistranslation going on even if we don't know exactly what it is then to

466
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,120
believe someone is actually using a deviant logic he compares it to master david humes move of saying

467
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,320
if you come across some claims to miracles it's better to believe no there must be some explanation

468
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,040
to this than they're actually being a miracle and that it's always better to believe there is some

469
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,520
actual explanation for some event even if you don't know what that explanation is yet

470
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,920
then to believe there is a miracle and quines boy david sin well boy no uh sorry for my colloquialism

471
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,400
anyway that is quines former student david sin took this argument to a whole next level

472
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,680
not just for logic but even against different conceptual schemes now part of the reason of

473
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,320
this book isn't just to survey all the places where relativists can attack and where a gradey

474
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:13,240
can defend but also actually he wants to battle david sin to the death no i'm just kidding there's

475
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,840
no actual violence here and even what ogready wants to do isn't actually all that confrontational

476
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,600
with david sin i find he just wants to present a softer argument rather than a hard argument david

477
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,040
sin does in his chapter on rationality so maybe that explains why he went to some depth of the

478
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,640
background of this argument from quine 2 talking about it here even mentioning the positivists

479
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,960
and stuff like that which i didn't bother getting into ogready says he will talk about

480
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,880
both of these philosophers anyway in different places though when he gets to them but for

481
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,200
right now he's gonna suggest that quines argument ain't that perfect in part because it's coming

482
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,120
from him nothing personal just pointing out that this argument seems to anticipate or set up a just

483
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,320
offhand rejection of deviant logics a priori but quines whole epistemological thing is that there

484
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:08,200
are no a priori nothing we know before experiencing it everything can be changed with experience

485
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,880
no beliefs have any kind of special unchangeable place but at the same time it seems he's making

486
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,800
logic special here and remember the translation argument is an argument that a priori rejects

487
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,440
deviant logics so what's going on here quine you all over the place well ogready admits the

488
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,920
precise interpretation of quines position is a delicate and disputed issue so it seems ogready

489
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,800
is open to a quinian philosopher defending quine and clarifying the different positions quine has

490
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,200
taken and evolved over time in which particular ways also my presentation of quine would probably

491
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,200
make a quinian even more frustrated and heck this ain't even my own details covering of ogready

492
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,680
talking about quine it's just my blast through but to be fair again ogready does say he will

493
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,680
look into quine himself in more detail and clarify his position better than he has done here at least

494
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,440
in this chapter at least he will do better when he gets to his chapter in ontology anyway there's

495
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,240
other problems for quine's argument too like it just assumes a classic two-valued logic is what's

496
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,360
obviously deep in the mind fundamental and all so everything outside of it we kind of just translate

497
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:26,440
to it but there's no argument here in particular for why this obviously correct thing in the mind

498
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:32,760
can't be for someone else say an intuitionist logician having a three plus valued logic or

499
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,360
something else the argument just states that there is a base logic but there is no argument here

500
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:44,120
for what that logic has to be that it has to be a classic two-valued system and not a deviant one

501
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,640
also it seems quine is using considerations about translation because of his own commitment to

502
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,080
empiricism and behaviorism but one could argue that empirical evidence isn't appropriate to

503
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,280
determine the nature of logic i mean maybe there's some metaphysical underpinning that can explain

504
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,320
why logic is special in any case ogready seems to hold that there are indeed arguments against

505
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,840
deviant logics but they aren't all that perfect there's flaws in him ogready then goes on to

506
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,840
describe his own position that looks like this he says and we're going to quote this line by

507
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:25,480
line while i give my own visualization of it even if one accepts a deviant system and believes there

508
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,120
are good philosophical grounds for defending it there seems to be general regulative principles

509
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:41,240
governing the choice of a logical system these include consistency coherence simplicity efficacy

510
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:49,480
and so on our choice of a logical system is itself governed by a more general conception of

511
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,600
rationality he says there are notions of logic that operate up here and those are what he argues

512
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:02,760
for in his chapter on rationality the law of non-contradiction and he says he won't argue for

513
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,080
it but it's possible that for the reasons of simplicity we would also have up here a two valued

514
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,840
system the law of the excluded middle simply because then you don't have to mess around with truth

515
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,400
where does that leave the legitimacy of deviant logic well it's pretty clear that multi-valued

516
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:28,040
systems are possible and there's no compelling formal argument against having them but also

517
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:35,880
up here the meta level that governs the adoption of such systems is committed to at least the law

518
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:43,720
of non-contradiction and probably for reasons of simplicity to the law of the excluded middle lower

519
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,760
level contacts requiring suspension of this to require the existence of such a meta level

520
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:57,240
is to argue for the core conception of rationality which will be argued for in chapter five

521
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:04,840
this is an absolute non-relative conception governing degrees of diversity beneath it

522
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,760
so the upshot of this discussion is that there are legitimate alternative logical

523
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:18,360
calculi useful for various purposes but ultimately governed by a system adhering to the

524
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:26,280
traditional laws of logic and with that the chapter ends so we see ogredi does allow relativism

525
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,960
on logic in terms of the lower level but argues that there are some principles of logic on the

526
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,280
meta level or above which he defends and he will be calling the core conception of rationality

527
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,760
once again leading us to that second great battle where he defends against relativism

528
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,840
on his chapter on rationality so we gotta go and check that out this means though for some folks

529
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,760
that come up and be like hey this isn't relative it's logical you could say there are actually

530
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,640
different logics back to that but ultimately they may be just saying something about how

531
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,320
basic rationality that governs fundamental way we think is nevertheless beholden to logical

532
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:11,640
laws if that's what they are saying you could say so you mean rationality isn't relative

533
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,320
which is kind of different but maybe that's just not much criticism behind what they meant to say

534
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,040
only that it's probable that they don't really understand logic in the way philosophers or

535
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,840
logicians or mathematicians do certainly many people don't know there are different kinds of

536
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,720
maths as well different interpretations of what counts as the correct mathematical procedure

537
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,920
that perhaps mathematicians and philosophers are familiar with but the common person isn't so it's

538
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,360
much easier for the common person to say math and mean something about the fundamental ways we

539
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:49,560
think about things in any case is logic relative it seems like yeah it is but logical principles

540
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:55,480
kind of are necessary to the way we think certainly there are actual alternatives and you can actually

541
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,400
pick different logics depending on what you need but can we use a different logic at least in terms

542
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,560
of the principle of non-contradiction in the way we actually think in the way our rationality is

543
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:14,840
well Ogrady will argue nope we cannot so let's go see that awesome battle now against a relativist

544
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,800
that would argue even rationality is relative oh and before you go i just want to say very

545
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,560
quickly unscripted uh if you like my visualization or my videos here please go check out some of

546
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,240
the other ones and please actually do subscribe to my channel if you can please support me on

547
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,200
patreon or send me a direct donation to paypal it's really difficult and it takes hundreds

548
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,720
of hours to make these videos and i don't get much support even socially as you can see my subscriber

549
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,520
count isn't even that high so it's not like even youtube pays me for this so if you can do that that

550
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,480
would be great that could really be nice you know other than that i just want to say let's get to

551
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:09,400
the next battle of rationality versus relativism and remember philosophers keep battling
