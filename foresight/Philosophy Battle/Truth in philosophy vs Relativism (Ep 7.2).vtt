00:00.000 --> 00:18.600
Welcome back, today on Philosophy Battle we are covering one of the greatest battles

00:18.600 --> 00:23.280
that has ever influenced me, and namely it's actually the setup for the battle that will

00:23.280 --> 00:28.680
finally allow us to gain the philosophic powers of this metaphysical eye that I've been promising.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.600
The setup will lay the groundwork for the eternal traction in the slippery, perilous

00:33.600 --> 00:35.520
battlefields of philosophy.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.080
The awesome battle that we'll be covering though is from this green book, the second

00:40.080 --> 00:42.680
of three books that I may cover on relativism.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.800
A book simply titled, Relativism, by Paul O'Grady, a philosophy lecturer at Trinity

00:47.800 --> 00:49.720
College in Dublin.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.040
While there are a number of different battles in this green book, the one we'll be covering

00:54.040 --> 01:00.800
today involves Paul O'Grady defending truth against the attacks of the extreme relativist.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.280
That is, the relativist who believes everything is relative.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.000
Not just matters of taste or beauty, or even what counts as right and wrong, but for them

01:09.000 --> 01:13.920
even things like knowledge, truth, logic, and reality are relative.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.320
For them, everything is relative.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.040
Nothing is objective, nothing is absolute.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.520
And that is what we would call the extreme relativist.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.160
It may sound a little bit out there, but we're dealing with a sophisticated relativist whose

01:29.160 --> 01:34.680
weapon has been empowered by three trends and namely five philosophers that Paul O'Grady

01:34.680 --> 01:40.240
himself noted for us in his introductory chapter, where he helped explain the powers of this

01:40.240 --> 01:47.320
wickedly awesome weapon and how it came into being, especially in modern philosophic warfare.

01:47.320 --> 01:51.880
So if you'd like to see how it is possible that even a reasonable person may come to

01:51.880 --> 01:57.280
feel that even things like truth or knowledge or facts are relative, please check out the

01:57.280 --> 02:01.520
previous video, The Powers of Relativism.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.760
Why are we considering the concerns of these relativists that make the charges that even

02:05.760 --> 02:09.080
facts truth or logic is relative?

02:09.080 --> 02:13.140
It's important for a good philosopher to understand that one cannot simply defeat an

02:13.140 --> 02:19.060
enemy like this, an extreme relativist, who wishes to use relativism everywhere, not just

02:19.060 --> 02:25.620
because they say so, but as empowered by actual philosophic writing, namely those five philosophers,

02:25.620 --> 02:30.420
by simply proclaiming, hey, there's no problem, we could just literally objectively describe

02:30.420 --> 02:35.420
things how they are and we have scientific facts and so on, you know, facts and logic.

02:35.420 --> 02:41.660
So they aren't relative, well you may actually have to deal with them rather than try to

02:41.660 --> 02:43.420
offhand dismiss them.

02:43.420 --> 02:48.380
Because if science doesn't maintain its legitimacy and authority, you may have religious fanatics

02:48.380 --> 02:53.820
teaching extreme spiritual beliefs in science class, you may have corporations or politicians

02:53.820 --> 02:59.180
disregard scientific findings, and many other terrible things that happen sometimes simply

02:59.180 --> 03:01.900
to spite scientific evidence.

03:01.900 --> 03:08.020
And the arguments of the SSK, a particular group of sociologists that studied science

03:08.020 --> 03:13.780
that used these powerful philosophic weapons to attack the authority and legitimacy of

03:13.780 --> 03:20.940
science or arguments of their academic descendants can be used to do such things, even perhaps

03:20.940 --> 03:24.180
pull funding away from the sciences.

03:24.180 --> 03:28.220
Thinking all of this isn't really a problem because we could just describe reality objectively

03:28.220 --> 03:34.180
with literalism and so that's not relative, against this extreme relativist with this

03:34.180 --> 03:39.900
sophisticated weaponry is a very rudimentary attack that will be blown out of the water

03:39.900 --> 03:42.180
by this powerful enemy.

03:42.180 --> 03:46.060
Again to understand the main staples of how they could even do that, we covered that in

03:46.060 --> 03:49.820
our last video covering the power of relativism.

03:49.820 --> 03:55.220
So please check that out if you'd like to see how exactly this weapon can be so powerful.

03:55.220 --> 04:01.220
Or check this out if you would like more detail on who these SSK are and what happened in what

04:01.220 --> 04:04.140
was called the science wars.

04:04.140 --> 04:09.540
But if you're more interested in the battle against this enemy, how we can defeat them,

04:09.540 --> 04:11.780
that's what we got for you today.

04:11.780 --> 04:14.820
That will show the limits of this weapon.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.700
Well actually Paul Grady first makes a wonderful setup from which he is able to then go and

04:19.700 --> 04:26.060
defend against charges of relativism on two fronts, the two limits, here and here.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.580
As I said this setup will be used for me to explain the powers of the philosophic eye,

04:30.580 --> 04:34.260
or at least what I mean by that in my own theatric way of describing things.

04:34.260 --> 04:39.500
In any case, he defends truth and rationality from charges of relativism.

04:39.500 --> 04:43.860
Those are the battles we are going to cover, but as I said for today, we'll just be covering

04:43.860 --> 04:48.020
both that setup and the first battle, defending truth.

04:48.020 --> 04:53.100
Now in this chapter on truth, he also discusses whether logic can be relative, so we will

04:53.100 --> 04:58.580
look at logic as well in this video if not an additional one if this one gets too long.

04:58.580 --> 05:03.700
By the way, O'Grady does accept relativism in ontology, of which ontology is a topic about

05:03.700 --> 05:07.840
what there is, what kind of things there are in the world.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.140
And he also accepts it sort of to a certain degree in epistemology, which is the study

05:12.140 --> 05:13.140
of knowledge.

05:13.140 --> 05:18.980
Here however, it is limited by how much relativism there can be in rationality, because rationality

05:18.980 --> 05:21.500
plays an important role in knowledge.

05:21.500 --> 05:26.420
Again though, he actually still defends rationality against the charges of relativism by the

05:26.420 --> 05:31.060
extreme relativists, which is the other awesome battle in this book which we will definitely

05:31.060 --> 05:35.060
eventually cover in a different video, in the next one hopefully.

05:35.060 --> 05:39.900
After we cover both these battles though, perhaps I may make a video of an overall assessment

05:39.900 --> 05:44.420
of the book talking about some of the other chapters maybe, you know, if you subscribe.

05:44.420 --> 05:45.420
Hehe.

05:45.420 --> 05:51.340
But enough about me, let's listen to Paul O'Grady to get that first important setup.

05:51.340 --> 05:55.860
But let me point out whenever I am speaking for O'Grady, which will actually still be

05:55.860 --> 06:00.820
my interpretation of paraphrasing of what he said, I will still cite it down through

06:00.820 --> 06:06.020
the line in the corner of the screen, and when I speak more for myself, the citation

06:06.020 --> 06:07.580
will disappear.

06:07.580 --> 06:12.420
And that way you'll know what's from him sort of, and what's from me.

06:12.420 --> 06:16.860
Also you can then check if I misinterpreted any of his lines and identify exactly where

06:16.860 --> 06:23.380
I have failed, and that I always credit others in honesty if I'm covering their work.

06:23.460 --> 06:27.620
And though I may just be a shadowy nobody on the internet here, please still mention

06:27.620 --> 06:32.620
me, not as an academic source, but in a footnote or something if any of my videos have given

06:32.620 --> 06:34.780
you formulation to your own thought.

06:34.780 --> 06:38.940
You should do the same even if it's a conversation you've had with your professor and received

06:38.940 --> 06:42.120
a clear idea from another person or something.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.960
Be as honest and credit as much as possible.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.780
Academic honesty and citation work hand in hand in improving your battle stance and philosophy,

06:50.780 --> 06:55.100
helping to shelter you and support you by diverting attacks to others that you have

06:55.100 --> 07:00.220
cited if certain attacks are inbound, but also allowing others to help correct your

07:00.220 --> 07:03.340
stance if they can spot the sources of misunderstanding.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.620
Wow, now that sounded like a big ethics lecture.

07:06.620 --> 07:12.180
But anyway, so for today our battle is gonna focus specifically on Paul O'Grady's setup

07:12.180 --> 07:16.900
and then ultimately his defense of truth against the charges of relativism by the

07:16.900 --> 07:24.000
Allithic Relativist, Allithic meaning about truth, and Relative being that which is dependent

07:24.000 --> 07:25.580
on something else.

07:25.580 --> 07:32.620
He says, Allithic Relativism has often been invoked as a way of avoiding contradiction.

07:32.620 --> 07:37.420
So his first section is going to be about how Allithic Relativism is motivated by wanting

07:37.420 --> 07:43.140
to avoid contradiction, then all the different ways to relativize truth, all of which will

07:43.140 --> 07:44.140
be rejected.

07:44.420 --> 07:49.900
In the second section we'll look at different theories of truth that might defend and relativize

07:49.900 --> 07:54.380
version of truth, though actually that for the most part counts against those theories

07:54.380 --> 07:55.660
not for it.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.700
In any case, the third section is going to be about logic, whether it is relative and

08:00.700 --> 08:04.420
whether there can be alternative logics.

08:04.420 --> 08:11.020
So it's true, people have different beliefs on politics, morals, religion, music, etc.

08:11.020 --> 08:15.180
One of the motivations is to accommodate this diversity.

08:15.180 --> 08:20.300
So as if to say that though there are different views, they can all be true.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.160
Think about this, remember we have already attacked their organs in a previous episode

08:24.160 --> 08:28.080
and videos for you are here if you followed my journey.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.060
So let's hope they know that we're coming from a good place ourselves as well.

08:32.060 --> 08:37.620
Anyway, because of this, they reject both positions of a non-relativist.

08:37.620 --> 08:43.440
Those positions are first, dogmatism, that one view can be true and the rest must be

08:43.440 --> 08:49.940
false, denying diversity, and the other of non-cognitivism, that no one has the truth

08:49.940 --> 08:53.940
because what they're saying can't even be said to be true or false.

08:53.940 --> 08:58.340
For this, because truth isn't at issue, diversity can easily exist.

08:58.340 --> 09:03.100
It's kind of like saying some things can be true or false like in science, but these

09:03.100 --> 09:08.500
things, values, moral views, religious views, etc, they aren't the type of things that

09:08.500 --> 09:14.460
can even be true or false, and diversity can flourish when truth isn't in the picture.

09:14.460 --> 09:20.860
So truth relativists, illithic relativists, hold that some competing views can both be

09:20.860 --> 09:27.620
legitimate candidates for truth and competing views as legit candidates can both be true

09:27.620 --> 09:30.700
despite them being opposing.

09:30.700 --> 09:36.420
To accept opposing positions as both being true simultaneously is on the face of it to

09:36.420 --> 09:42.500
accept contradiction, and to do such a thing is unacceptable.

09:42.500 --> 09:47.060
So I said in a previous video while dealing with Robert Kirk, to forgive me for not showing

09:47.060 --> 09:51.020
how Kirk explained how contradictions are bad and just to trust me that he actually

09:51.020 --> 09:52.260
did show us that.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.460
I didn't show it because I really wanted to get to and show how O'Grady does it.

09:56.460 --> 10:01.620
And this is that important setup that I wanted to show, which will work for him to defend

10:01.620 --> 10:06.360
in different places against the relativists, but also may be ultimately the basis for one

10:06.360 --> 10:11.260
of the coolest things that it will ever show on the show, that metaphysical eye.

10:11.260 --> 10:15.940
It has a number of implications, but starting it out it may seem super simple.

10:15.940 --> 10:19.380
So if it's simple for you and obvious, still be patient with it.

10:19.380 --> 10:24.780
Only later will we really begin to use what he sets up here in battle, then we will truly

10:24.820 --> 10:26.540
see how awesome it is.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.140
But for now, let's just take a look.

10:29.140 --> 10:31.140
Let's see why contradictions are bad.

10:31.140 --> 10:34.540
This is going to be awesome.

10:34.540 --> 10:40.540
Contradiction is the assertion of a statement or proposition and the negation of that same

10:40.540 --> 10:45.860
assertion or proposition at the same time in the same understanding.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.820
And this is an important point.

10:47.820 --> 10:52.140
Because it's like changing your mind over time, that really isn't a contradiction.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.380
People may say I believe something then and I don't believe it now because now I know

10:56.380 --> 10:57.500
it's wrong.

10:57.500 --> 11:02.620
So there's a now versus then distinction, showing that it's not a legitimate contradiction.

11:02.620 --> 11:07.900
And for what we're talking about, it has to be a legitimate contradiction, p and not

11:07.900 --> 11:08.900
p.

11:08.900 --> 11:15.380
Oh, so p is a proposition, which is a statement about what is or not, the state of affairs

11:15.380 --> 11:17.180
as they are or not.

11:17.180 --> 11:21.660
And a proposition doesn't have to be represented or presented with the letter p, it could be

11:21.660 --> 11:26.780
represented with q or r or s, it's just a kind of variable like in math how we can use

11:26.780 --> 11:30.940
x or y or z to represent consistent numerical variables.

11:30.940 --> 11:35.060
Also for your sake, this symbol is the negation symbol in logic.

11:35.060 --> 11:39.140
It means not, or the negative of what is expressed after it.

11:39.140 --> 11:43.260
But I'll try to keep it simple for you and try to write it like this whenever I can at

11:43.260 --> 11:44.260
first.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.740
But anyway, so about being a genuine contradiction.

11:47.740 --> 11:53.340
Everyone saying this is black and this is white isn't a legitimate or genuine contradiction.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.700
Something can be black and white.

11:55.700 --> 12:00.980
A legit contradiction would be more like to say this is black and this is not black.

12:00.980 --> 12:05.500
Well, I kinda don't like this example too much because in normal everyday language,

12:05.500 --> 12:10.860
if we are saying about say a soccer ball, we wouldn't actually just say it's black,

12:10.860 --> 12:12.820
we would say it's black and white.

12:12.820 --> 12:16.780
Just because we know it's kind of misleading to say just it's black.

12:16.780 --> 12:21.660
And our general way of speaking would allow us to assume that it's not also white because

12:21.660 --> 12:26.100
you would have said black and white if it were also white.

12:26.100 --> 12:30.580
It would be kind of unusual to leave out white if your point was to say what color is the

12:30.580 --> 12:31.980
ball is, you know?

12:31.980 --> 12:36.460
But anyway, his point here is that there should be no sneaky way of showing that it's not

12:36.460 --> 12:38.220
really a contradiction.

12:38.220 --> 12:43.100
So it's black and it is not black is a very clear case of a contradiction.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.660
And that's what he's trying to get at.

12:44.660 --> 12:52.060
But to be a true relativist, they have to be willing to accept even these legitimate contradictions.

12:52.060 --> 12:56.900
And what's the problem with accepting genuine cases of contradictions as possible?

12:56.900 --> 13:05.060
The basic problem is that the notion of contradiction is essentially connected to the notion of

13:05.060 --> 13:08.100
assertion and negation.

13:08.100 --> 13:13.860
This, this point here is one of the two main reasons I'm talking about O'Grady.

13:13.860 --> 13:19.100
If you can grasp the essential nature of all assertion, you will have developed what I

13:19.100 --> 13:24.780
call a metaphysical eye, a deeper philosophic understanding that allows you to catch enemies

13:24.780 --> 13:30.220
who lack that understanding and end up committed to devastating and crippling positions.

13:30.220 --> 13:36.220
So what comes next may on the one hand seem super obvious, but its implication we will

13:36.220 --> 13:39.660
show later as being incredibly important.

13:39.660 --> 13:47.300
You see, to make an assertion, you are expressing some content that something is the case.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.220
Something is a certain way.

13:49.220 --> 13:55.340
In doing that, you are at the same time denying its negation.

13:55.340 --> 13:58.780
For example, the sun is shining at a certain time or place.

13:58.780 --> 14:03.900
This rules out or denies the sun is not shining at that exact time or place or understanding

14:03.900 --> 14:06.360
that is meant in the first proposition.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.080
This is also a logical move called double negation here.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.520
To say p is also equivalent to say not not p.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.680
Now that's more of a formal logic way of expressing this rational principle.

14:18.680 --> 14:23.800
Many of us learn in studying math say we're multiplying two negatives make a positive

14:23.800 --> 14:27.240
or simply in English when we use the double negatives.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.520
For example, someone that says it isn't true that we're not here means that it is true

14:32.520 --> 14:34.120
that we are.

14:34.120 --> 14:40.980
Or for example, it's not true that it's not raining means that it is true that it is raining.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.560
So you see, double negatives make a positive.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.280
But also a positive can be a double negative.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.920
And that means a positive is like negating a negative.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.480
Assertion implies the rejection of the negation of that assertion.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.840
This is going to sound funny so for those of you who are listening to this and not

15:00.840 --> 15:04.640
watching this, it might make more sense to watch this at the same time.

15:04.640 --> 15:13.080
But asserting p, which is logically equal to not not p, shows it is not not p.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.200
P denies not p.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.920
This is really simple logic that we're familiar with.

15:19.920 --> 15:25.000
But again, to be talking about it like this can feel a bit weird to someone new in philosophy.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.480
So I hope I'm not actually confusing anyone by talking about something super basic but

15:29.480 --> 15:31.800
in more formal logical ways.

15:31.800 --> 15:38.960
But anyway, when it comes to contradiction, it is to assert and endorse both the assertion

15:38.960 --> 15:41.040
and its negation.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.560
P and not p.

15:43.560 --> 15:48.440
This is kind of like cutting off its own legs maybe, that's the way of saying it, because

15:48.440 --> 15:51.400
p should imply not not p.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.920
Which denies not p.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.600
And yet not p also denies p.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.960
So a contradiction undermines the very process of asserting.

16:01.960 --> 16:08.440
To accept a contradiction means to render empty the very act of asserting.

16:08.440 --> 16:12.640
Two sides attacking each other in the same unit is nothing.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.120
Like one part negative and one part positive cancelling each other out in math or perhaps

16:17.120 --> 16:18.880
in physics let's say.

16:18.880 --> 16:23.400
Since some basic math is plenty easier to grasp for many people I believe than maybe

16:23.400 --> 16:27.160
my earlier logical stuff, let's look at it like this.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.360
So it's like you might as well say nothing.

16:34.360 --> 16:39.640
It's equal to saying you have no knowledge, no claim to anything at all.

16:39.640 --> 16:45.880
Also then a positive assertion like a plus one is equal to denying a negative or you

16:45.880 --> 16:48.440
know minus a negative one.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.040
Saying plus one minus one is to say nothing at all.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.600
And then I would wonder why did you waste my time telling me something that yields nothing,

16:56.600 --> 17:00.400
no claim, no stance, no belief, no anything.

17:00.400 --> 17:07.160
To assert anything of substance that has a purpose meaning a stance requires that it

17:07.160 --> 17:13.800
also denies the opposite of what is being asserted, lest it be rendered meaningless or

17:13.800 --> 17:15.520
even false.

17:15.520 --> 17:21.800
So this is a law of non-contradiction, a law against contradiction.

17:21.800 --> 17:29.520
The law of non-contradiction is so basic and necessary that one cannot even argue for or

17:29.520 --> 17:35.280
against it on the basis of anything more fundamental.

17:35.280 --> 17:40.000
Because it's so fundamental, in fact it is the very basis of how we do argumentation

17:40.000 --> 17:41.440
in the first place.

17:41.440 --> 17:48.560
This makes it an insurmountable problem for anyone that tries to deny non-contradiction.

17:48.560 --> 17:53.680
Even denying the principle, in so far as denying has any meaning whatsoever, must have

17:53.680 --> 18:00.680
a determinate content that is not undermined by simultaneously affirming the principle.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.600
So that is why contradictions must be avoided.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
This is it.

18:05.600 --> 18:11.360
If you get anything from this video, I hope it is this and it is tied to the very nature

18:11.360 --> 18:13.400
of making any assertion.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.280
With it you will see clearly what many have already begun to see in the previous Kirk

18:17.360 --> 18:24.760
video series and what I spoke about as a crippling problem, which O'Grady now calls insurmountable.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.600
Let me explain it like this.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.320
It is self-defeat.

18:28.320 --> 18:33.800
You see, this principle that contradictions are bad, let's say, it is actually the very

18:33.800 --> 18:36.640
basis of arguing against something.

18:36.640 --> 18:43.280
So to argue against this principle assumes this principle, that the principle works,

18:43.280 --> 18:46.800
thus cutting off one's own legs in a way.

18:46.840 --> 18:54.680
Even so we don't miss it, arguing for or asserting anything, no matter what, has a meaning

18:54.680 --> 19:00.400
in so far as you are denying the opposite of what you are saying, as we stated earlier.

19:00.400 --> 19:06.560
So an argument against this principle also requires it, in order for that argument to

19:06.560 --> 19:08.560
have any meaning.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.440
How can one contradict that contradictions happen?

19:12.440 --> 19:16.320
It's an insurmountable problem for them who deny it.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.640
And we saw this actually already in the Kirk video as I pointed it out for us.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.280
And we'll talk about this again in my final talk about relativism before I'm done with

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
this whole topic.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.320
But let me give it some more timeless, some very easy things that we may have encountered

19:29.320 --> 19:31.520
in our lives that highlight this.

19:31.520 --> 19:39.240
If one tries to deny that denial is possible, then how are you denying?

19:39.240 --> 19:41.240
That is incoherent.

19:41.240 --> 19:49.160
The TFM true for me relativist in the Kirk videos disagreed that disagreement happens.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.440
How can you disagree that disagreement happens?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.040
That's self-defeating.

19:54.040 --> 20:00.480
If you try to say no one can say anything with any authority, then how did you say that?

20:00.480 --> 20:06.400
In fact how can you say with authority, or even just substantively, what your own position

20:06.400 --> 20:10.800
is unless it means to deny the opposite of that position?

20:10.800 --> 20:17.680
I mean trying to say no one can talk is self-defeating and that you've just proven by what you're

20:17.680 --> 20:20.080
doing that you are wrong.

20:20.080 --> 20:26.680
One cannot deny that denial exists or claim that no one can make a claim nor say that

20:26.680 --> 20:30.160
they know that there is no knowledge.

20:30.160 --> 20:36.560
One should not be able to tell everyone to shut up that no one has the right to talk

20:36.560 --> 20:40.760
because then that person too should have kept quiet.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
If that were true.

20:42.760 --> 20:48.240
While I always say philosophers keep battling, philosophers do battle about anything they

20:48.240 --> 20:54.440
can but it takes short time for a philosopher to realize certain positions are terrible

20:54.440 --> 20:59.720
either because they have more arguments against them than can have defending them but also

20:59.720 --> 21:07.600
because it may be a self-defeating position and those must be avoided at all costs.

21:07.600 --> 21:15.600
So Immanuel Kant once said and I quoted metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or a lighthouse

21:15.600 --> 21:18.720
strewn with many a philosophic wreck.

21:18.720 --> 21:25.840
Man eff that ship let me tell you this is from me not O'Grady not anyone else but metaphysics

21:25.840 --> 21:32.480
epistemology philosophy of mind anywhere you are there is a lighthouse there is always

21:32.480 --> 21:39.960
a lighthouse and it stands on the pillar of non-contribution a pillar of rationality

21:39.960 --> 21:46.640
and connecting to another pillar the nature of assertion and thus the necessity of truth

21:46.640 --> 21:51.520
this will be our lighthouse and I will talk more about this lighthouse in the future and

21:51.520 --> 21:58.160
what my organs are perhaps but there is enough to understand to really see with what I theatrically

21:58.160 --> 22:04.400
call your metaphysical eye when self-defeat is happening this is the philosophic eye that

22:04.400 --> 22:10.000
will allow you to defeat your philosophic enemies from working within their own system but there

22:10.000 --> 22:16.640
is a commitment here further that O'Grady will talk about later when he defends rationality

22:16.640 --> 22:22.440
when he defends rationality itself against attack in the next battle but also something

22:22.440 --> 22:29.200
metaphysical that I feel is actually left out from O'Grady's discussion that perhaps

22:29.200 --> 22:36.120
I will address at the end but how exactly then does this seeming obvious point become

22:36.120 --> 22:43.120
very useful on the battlefield how does this really help us in a way to conduct our lives

22:43.120 --> 22:50.520
or our society and how deep does it impact philosophy or the world well this star allows

22:50.600 --> 22:57.080
me to speak enough but maybe not enough to elaborate or visualize my metaphors here

22:57.080 --> 23:02.760
if you subscribe though maybe I will gain more power to speak myself but we are here

23:02.760 --> 23:08.760
not for some shadowy nobody like me but for a real human being Paulo Grady so let's

23:08.760 --> 23:16.600
get back to him so you can't actually argue for or against non-contradiction for doing

23:16.600 --> 23:23.880
that would assume it so to avoid contradiction because now we know contradictions are bad

23:23.880 --> 23:29.880
the relativist denies that there is a real contradiction because truth itself is just

23:29.880 --> 23:37.160
relative something is either true for you or true for me for some of them that's their

23:37.160 --> 23:42.280
distinction like now and then except they're not using now and then they're using for me

23:42.360 --> 23:48.360
or for you so it's opposing views but not in the same sense thus it's not a real contradiction

23:48.360 --> 23:53.640
for them and this is what we covered in the last episode episode six we saw Robert Kirk

23:53.640 --> 23:59.480
battle this kind of relativist the true for me relativist the tfm relativist in the last episode

23:59.480 --> 24:04.600
but O'Grady makes kind of quicker work of them than Kirk did O'Grady however asks a bunch of

24:04.600 --> 24:09.240
questions that we all would of someone that claims truth is relative but I guess I'd only

24:09.240 --> 24:16.280
highlight this question in particular if all truth is relative is that itself relatively true

24:16.280 --> 24:22.440
or absolutely true pointing to the incoherence of relativists once again in a way can you see it

24:23.080 --> 24:29.000
but anyway leaving that for now O'Grady then says something that is more true in our common

24:29.000 --> 24:35.240
lives which is why I spent so much time emphasizing it in the previous episode with Kirk he says that

24:35.240 --> 24:42.680
at the crudest level saying something is like true for me is just a way of being polite and

24:42.680 --> 24:50.200
non-confrontational like saying God exists is true for me but this doesn't actually stop us from

24:50.200 --> 24:56.120
judging whether something is true or false just that we're no longer judging the true or false

24:56.120 --> 25:01.960
whether God exists instead it is changed to merely if it is true or false whether or not you actually

25:01.960 --> 25:08.440
do believe one way or another this is common but is not actually a way of relativizing truth

25:08.440 --> 25:14.840
so it's a non-starter whoa actually I really love this this is a great point that makes quick work

25:14.840 --> 25:20.440
of the tfm relativists many relativists believe they are not making objective statements about

25:20.440 --> 25:28.840
how things are if they put in qualifiers like to person x y is true well okay y is true is now

25:28.840 --> 25:38.040
relative to person x but it's still a proposition that reports the truth of to person x y is true

25:38.040 --> 25:44.040
now is this non-relatively true perhaps here's where we covered another cool thing that I think

25:44.040 --> 25:50.040
Kirk did about how there could be an infinite regress with this but to be clear simply saying

25:50.040 --> 25:57.800
I think science is good doesn't mean you're not making an objective claim just that your objective

25:57.800 --> 26:05.560
claim now isn't about science it is about the truth of what you think and so we could ask about

26:05.560 --> 26:11.400
the objective truth of whether you actually think that about science or not and it would ascertain

26:11.400 --> 26:18.520
the truth of your statement in a way that is for us and for everyone and not just for you simply

26:18.520 --> 26:25.320
saying to me or for me or in my opinion or I believe doesn't mean one isn't making an objective

26:25.320 --> 26:32.200
claim actually all it's doing is just reducing or preserving the space to where we feel more

26:32.200 --> 26:39.400
entitled to be objective where we are less likely to be opposed or questioned to speak about what I

26:39.400 --> 26:45.320
think or how I feel one is more entitled to objectively take a stance on what is the case

26:45.320 --> 26:52.520
with these qualifiers again think about how every assertion still nevertheless needs to be substantive

26:52.600 --> 26:59.080
to say something and thus to oppose its opposite anyway so as O'Grady says there's got to be a

26:59.080 --> 27:05.720
better way to philosophically relativize truth because this actually is a non-starter well

27:05.720 --> 27:11.560
I'm gonna talk about three ways these are going to be the three better more philosophically

27:11.560 --> 27:18.120
empower ways to try and relativize truth that the relativist may choose other than just stating that

27:18.120 --> 27:23.320
everything is simply true for me or true for you we're going to call these at least three attacks

27:23.320 --> 27:28.600
the first attack is going to be artificial languages associated with Tarski and Carnep

27:28.600 --> 27:35.400
that truth is relative to a language or a system and there can be many languages so truth is actually

27:35.400 --> 27:41.640
just relative to the pragmatic reasons we have to which system we decide upon the second attack

27:41.640 --> 27:48.520
is going to be about how true and false aren't the only options associated with Joseph Margolis

27:48.520 --> 27:54.600
the third attack is an account that is given by Chris Sawyer but one that shifts the relativization

27:54.600 --> 28:02.040
away from being about truth really so this is the battle so this is the battle

28:02.520 --> 28:08.280
O'Grady versus the Alithic well attack one artificial languages

28:18.040 --> 28:23.480
since ordinary natural language were vague and imprecise for scientific use and could

28:23.480 --> 28:29.480
lead to philosophic problems Gottlieb Frege championed the construction of special languages for

28:29.480 --> 28:37.160
philosophy called Burgerschrift okay so I can't pronounce it despite having read it thousands

28:37.160 --> 28:42.600
of times in many different places but hey I don't really have German philosophy friends to you know

28:42.600 --> 28:47.800
have a quick talk about for this video you know so I could have learned how to pronounce it properly

28:47.800 --> 28:56.760
I also don't have German friends to ask I also don't have friends anyway the idea was that if you

28:56.760 --> 29:02.840
made language clear and precise enough like math you could clear away many philosophical problems

29:02.840 --> 29:08.440
just by being clear about what is said to be and what is therefore implied by it and philosophers

29:08.440 --> 29:13.560
could make these languages for scientists use we sort of already have been talking about this in

29:13.560 --> 29:20.280
the last video when we discussed Carnap again check it out if you like but one of frega's students

29:20.280 --> 29:26.200
Rudolph Carnap as I just mentioned took up the project various philosophic issues there in

29:26.280 --> 29:32.280
ordinary language could actually be solved in these specially constructed precise languages

29:32.280 --> 29:39.320
things like the analytic synthetic distinction logical consequence and even truth could be

29:39.320 --> 29:46.760
clearly defined in such artificially constructed languages which language was chosen to be used

29:46.760 --> 29:53.480
and therefore which definition of truth it entailed was a matter of pragmatic choice for the scientists

29:53.480 --> 29:58.520
that philosophers would make these languages for you see Carnap at the time felt in normal

29:58.520 --> 30:03.960
language the notion of truth is a sloppy concept that just ends up in unnecessary philosophical

30:03.960 --> 30:09.960
debate about correspondence between appearance and reality in the new languages however truth

30:09.960 --> 30:17.160
could be given clear and strict definitions but only holds within that language now when Polish

30:17.160 --> 30:24.760
American Alfred Tarski made his celebrated account of truth he followed Carnap in dealing with only

30:24.760 --> 30:31.720
artificial languages and his account of truth didn't work in natural language so the general

30:31.720 --> 30:39.960
universal notions of truth began to be replaced with the notion of true in L where L is the

30:39.960 --> 30:44.680
artificial language keep in mind that from the philosophic point of view the traditional

30:44.760 --> 30:50.760
philosophic discussions about say what is the nature of truth were thought of as pseudo debates

30:50.760 --> 30:56.360
arising from the confusion over language so really it became more preferable that truth

30:56.360 --> 31:01.480
was thought of as merely a term with a clear definition that depends on which language you

31:01.480 --> 31:10.280
choose in this way truth becomes relativized to each artificial language and in fact contradiction

31:10.280 --> 31:16.520
can happen within a language but each language gets to set out its own criteria of what counts

31:16.520 --> 31:23.880
as a contradiction too and so contradiction only happens within a particular language not across

31:23.880 --> 31:30.440
different languages so the relativist employs the Tarski-Carnap argument that truth is just whatever

31:30.440 --> 31:37.000
is true in L and different languages can actually be set so something doesn't count as a contradiction

31:37.000 --> 31:43.560
within it and discussions of truth generally beyond what is true in L is just confusions

31:44.200 --> 31:51.800
truth thus relativized well now Paulo Grady defends against this attack

31:54.920 --> 32:01.160
firstly he points out what's the real relevance of artificial languages and definitions concerning

32:01.160 --> 32:06.760
real beliefs genuine disputes between people about beliefs can't be sidestep because of the

32:06.760 --> 32:12.280
employment of artificial languages that seems kind of like a common sense philosophy here but

32:12.280 --> 32:18.200
Paulo Grady has an even more philosophic response to this issue check it out as he points out

32:18.760 --> 32:24.360
remember choice between artificial language is a pragmatic issue which shouldn't itself

32:24.360 --> 32:30.040
be a discussion of truth it's just a matter of whether one versus another is more useful or not

32:30.040 --> 32:40.280
right but even to say even to make the judgment that this language is useful requires the notion

32:40.280 --> 32:49.000
of truth that it's true that that language is useful this judgment of truth that a language is

32:49.000 --> 32:55.640
indeed useful or not stands outside the particular artificial language themselves not relativized

32:56.200 --> 33:02.920
and it's that notion of the truth in a general theoretical sense that this artificial languages

33:02.920 --> 33:12.280
attack tried to remove well see it didn't such use seems unavoidable wow what a move that was

33:12.280 --> 33:17.400
awesome Paulo Grady did something awesome here like uh i love this because it challenges that

33:17.400 --> 33:23.960
naive notion that pragmatics somehow dissolves philosophic issues in all cases such as discussions

33:23.960 --> 33:30.120
of truth and knowledge now you uh maybe perhaps don't do philosophy in academia but there's no

33:30.120 --> 33:35.320
field of knowledge whether medicine sport science law or business analyst or something like that

33:35.320 --> 33:41.960
where the discussion of how do we know something in that field isn't important or in this case

33:41.960 --> 33:49.240
it helps to show that if you have a concern about is it true that trying to replace it with

33:49.240 --> 33:56.920
its pragmatic that or its practical that doesn't actually really remove the philosophic concern

33:56.920 --> 34:03.720
because someone with that concern would just move on to concerns of well is it true that it is

34:03.720 --> 34:10.760
pragmatic and such and such this is a kind of similar move though isn't it to something we've

34:10.760 --> 34:18.680
already seen saying true for me didn't stop our concern of objective claims nor does saying oh

34:18.680 --> 34:25.960
it's pragmatic that stop our concerns with is it true that in a similar fashion do you see it

34:26.520 --> 34:35.080
trying to say hey discussions about truth can be made to not count down here across languages

34:35.080 --> 34:42.520
at the artificial level doesn't remove how they do happen up here because the notion of truth

34:42.520 --> 34:48.520
can't be avoided so long as any judgment is happening from a kind of above position

34:49.560 --> 34:56.760
above position i say hopefully my visuals are helping here and we will continue to use them

34:56.760 --> 35:03.720
to show how in a sense we go high or above to speak about things anything when we are stating how

35:03.720 --> 35:11.240
things are in a capital t truth way even when we qualify our statements with to me or to them or

35:11.240 --> 35:18.280
in science or its practical that or its pragmatic that and hopefully by the end of this video

35:18.280 --> 35:23.240
you will come to realize the necessity of this and it will actually build the power of this

35:23.240 --> 35:28.760
philosophic eye that i promised so maybe it's worth rewatching this video twice uh to get what

35:28.760 --> 35:32.840
i'm kind of saying here if it sounds a little confusing but don't worry about it like it will

35:32.840 --> 35:39.240
really become much more clear once we covered both these battles in any case attack one has failed

35:39.240 --> 35:45.560
but the wicked elithic relativist isn't done yet another far more spooky attack comes about

35:46.280 --> 35:54.520
attack two multiple truth values conflicting views produce a contradiction in a classical logic

35:54.520 --> 36:03.560
in which there are two truth values either the truth value of true or false two now relativists

36:03.560 --> 36:09.160
are accused of self-refutation this is the self-defeat that we saw earlier with that circle

36:09.160 --> 36:16.040
also sometimes called incoherence but to avoid that problem some say there's more than just

36:16.040 --> 36:24.040
two truth values that there could be three or more which means they drop the classical logic law

36:24.040 --> 36:31.160
of the excluded middle a law that states that there's only truth and false no third value

36:31.160 --> 36:35.720
so just to re-explain this sort of sorry if this is repetitive but it's important to be

36:35.720 --> 36:40.840
clear about what the strategy is here if you remember the relativists wanted to use something

36:40.840 --> 36:45.720
the principle of non-contradiction because they needed in order to express a content

36:45.720 --> 36:53.560
but the content that they wanted to express was to deny that principle p and not p that itself

36:53.560 --> 37:00.520
is a contradiction both of these cannot be true or perhaps another way to look at it is p cannot

37:00.520 --> 37:09.240
be both true and false but anyway looking at the example of p and not p because both cannot be true

37:09.240 --> 37:15.640
then if one is true the other must be false this relied on the principle of non-contradiction as we

37:15.640 --> 37:24.360
saw before if this is true then this has to be false but also the other way around if one is false

37:24.360 --> 37:31.560
the other must be true easy enough right so choosing one of the two options forces the

37:31.560 --> 37:37.560
opposite proposition to be the other option but this isn't just because of non-contradiction

37:37.560 --> 37:44.760
it's also because there isn't a third option here and that's called the law of the excluded middle

37:44.760 --> 37:52.520
things are either true or false no middle no new option but if we drop that law and we had like a

37:52.520 --> 37:59.480
third option then saying this is false doesn't necessarily mean that this one has to be true

38:00.120 --> 38:06.120
it could also possibly be this other thing whatever it is so dropping the excluded middle

38:06.120 --> 38:13.240
law may save the relativist from self-defeat in this way that way they can deny p the principle of

38:13.240 --> 38:21.080
non-contradiction while not necessarily asserting p as true it would be this new thing what would that

38:21.080 --> 38:31.800
third value even look like well some say indeterminate so like t f and question mark maybe or others say

38:31.800 --> 38:39.800
like mostly mainly or half truth and mostly mainly false well that's like seven different values there

38:40.360 --> 38:46.520
but if you think of it if you can do something like that you can even do it using more numbers

38:46.520 --> 38:56.600
for probability like between 0 and 1 0.1 true or 0.56 true doing this kind of thing instead of just

38:56.600 --> 39:03.480
t and f doesn't necessarily make your relativist but it can be helpful to relativists in defusing

39:03.480 --> 39:10.520
what could have been a contradiction if we had only a two-valued system p may be very probable

39:10.520 --> 39:21.240
or 0.96 true while not p could be half or 0.5 true and so it is claimed a classical contradiction is

39:21.240 --> 39:29.640
avoided joseph margulis makes a detailed relativist position that demands the rejection of the principle

39:29.640 --> 39:37.160
of excluded middle rejecting the two values only systems because using a two value only system

39:37.160 --> 39:42.600
could lead to a contradiction for relativists if they try to use this classical logic to defend

39:42.600 --> 39:47.880
ontological relativism or incommensurability incommensurability is another thing that happens

39:47.880 --> 39:52.520
to appear to promote relativism as it means there's no shared value or shared position from which you

39:52.520 --> 39:57.800
can measure two different things so they can't be compared so to avoid contradiction they move to a

39:57.800 --> 40:03.880
multi-valued logic instead but that might be the motivation behind why the relativists want to drop

40:03.880 --> 40:10.760
the law of the excluded middle but margulis also had reasons presented in that he links his rejection

40:10.760 --> 40:22.680
to what he calls cognitive intraintra what intrapah to what he calls cognitive intrapah shoot he links

40:22.680 --> 40:29.640
his rejection to what he calls cognitive intransparency we don't really know the world in itself the

40:29.640 --> 40:33.880
world is always mediated to us in historical and context laden ways

40:36.440 --> 40:41.800
so how does polo grady deal with this multiple truth values attack it seems pretty radical

40:41.800 --> 40:50.280
out there to say that there's more than just truth and falsehood well first off is it really a new

40:50.280 --> 40:55.720
third value we're talking about here like look at this one like just because you don't know what the

40:55.720 --> 41:02.680
value is and maybe you never can thus calling it indeterminate that doesn't mean it's a new value

41:03.240 --> 41:09.240
it just means that you recognize that you don't know that it's a truth gap and they've already

41:09.240 --> 41:14.840
been systems that developed with this truth gap in mind and they don't act like this is some kind

41:14.840 --> 41:23.880
of new value somehow secondly just because you add modifiers like most or sometimes or 0.33 to

41:23.880 --> 41:30.680
a classic two-value system hardly means that you actually made new values one obviously can see that

41:30.680 --> 41:36.280
these things as merely saying probability of something but it isn't actually a new kind of

41:36.280 --> 41:41.960
fundamental truth value being introduced here seems to be an epistemic issue that is an issue

41:41.960 --> 41:49.080
about knowledge of how likely something is to be true rather than importing a new conception of truth

41:49.080 --> 41:53.960
thirdly just like with the case with artificial languages is it really helpful to our cases of

41:53.960 --> 41:59.240
contradiction it could be after all merely still relying on a two-valued system anyway

42:00.520 --> 42:08.280
thus the second attack attack two while it seemed pretty radical still nevertheless

42:08.920 --> 42:14.600
failed now ogredy just makes a quick point for himself he says look one of the main reasons

42:14.600 --> 42:20.520
for ontological relativity is to avoid contradiction in ontology anyway what he's saying is that

42:20.520 --> 42:27.640
relativists want to avoid contradiction even as they espouse the way the world is can be different

42:27.640 --> 42:33.560
and relative but ogredy says we can have that without having to alter our conception of the

42:33.560 --> 42:39.320
truth there are alternatives to get to ontological relativism without having to come up with new

42:39.320 --> 42:44.360
truth values and presumably he will explain what those ways are in his chapter on ontology

42:44.600 --> 42:51.320
where he himself allows for relativism and so as a larger strategy trying to go at it like this

42:51.320 --> 42:57.480
and figure new ways to make new truth values is not necessary and paul ogredy then advocates for

42:57.480 --> 43:02.840
what quine calls a policy of minimum mutilation this is like ogredy saying that if you want

43:02.840 --> 43:08.600
relativism in ontology we can figure out a way to do that without having to do this massive change

43:08.600 --> 43:13.880
when it's completely unnecessary to do so we should do the minimum amount of changing so i

43:13.880 --> 43:18.840
guess the question then remains how how do we get that and wait what exactly is ontological

43:18.840 --> 43:25.080
relativity because really i mean i really really didn't in detail explain it in this video yet

43:25.080 --> 43:30.440
but neither did he so i guess we kind of have to wait to check out his chapter in ontology

43:30.440 --> 43:35.560
to really see what's going on there and how we can get ontological relativity without massive

43:35.560 --> 43:42.680
changes to truth but for now let's move on to the third attack attack three strong and weak

43:42.680 --> 43:49.960
distinction chris soyer also investigated relativism while charging most arguments against

43:49.960 --> 43:55.400
relativism as unfairly assuming absolutism in the first place he ultimately at least

43:55.400 --> 44:00.760
this argument defends against a kind of alithic relativism as we shall see even while accepting

44:00.760 --> 44:06.040
a few of their premises in any case he says the typical version of alithic relativism

44:06.040 --> 44:12.360
employs a notion of frameworks as we have seen in the previous video about the power of relativism

44:12.360 --> 44:17.800
similarly with terms like paradigm framework language games conceptual scheme while all can

44:17.800 --> 44:22.520
come from different places they function in much the same way as to the arguments employed by

44:22.520 --> 44:28.120
relativists and against i guess objectivists who think that there is some kind of director

44:28.120 --> 44:35.320
unmediated access or observation or descriptive ability of reality itself relative truth is truth

44:35.320 --> 44:41.960
that is relative to some framework this framework may be of different kinds historical cultural

44:41.960 --> 44:47.880
linguistic or biological for example so like everything that so like everything that makes

44:47.880 --> 44:53.560
up how you interpret or mediate the world so the issue is something that is true in one framework

44:53.560 --> 44:59.400
but false in a different framework because it's relativized to different frameworks it avoids

44:59.400 --> 45:04.680
the contradiction that would have happened if it was the same framework a grady points out as we

45:04.680 --> 45:10.840
can tell it's basically the same thing as true and l where l was for an artificial language but

45:10.920 --> 45:15.400
now it's just replaced with the notion of frameworks a grady then goes on to use an example

45:15.400 --> 45:20.840
of the hopi indian tribe now the hopi indian tribe is one of the most widely cited examples by

45:20.840 --> 45:25.400
relativists you know along with the azandei i guess and relativists of many stripes pushing

45:25.400 --> 45:30.680
relativism into whichever field of investigation they desire the hopi indian do appear to have

45:30.680 --> 45:36.040
different worldview and we'll talk about what that is in the next battle but a grady will argue that

45:36.040 --> 45:42.200
that means they have different ontology not therefore different everything which some extreme

45:42.200 --> 45:47.720
relativists might insist that they do have also different logic therefore and different rationality

45:47.720 --> 45:54.040
and different truths even that is for the relativists their language is proof of relativism about

45:54.040 --> 45:58.840
truth anyway this little note of mine here is kind of spilling the beans behind what o grady

45:58.840 --> 46:05.800
will say as he puts it in brackets on a paragraph 13 line 67 a source of confusion here is that the

46:05.800 --> 46:12.680
hopi do in fact have a different ontology soyer is exploring the possibility about relativism

46:12.680 --> 46:18.680
about truth but it seems better to explain the difference in the hopi and the standard scientific

46:18.680 --> 46:26.120
view with relativized ontology but keeping an absolute conception of truth soyer makes a distinction

46:26.120 --> 46:33.240
between strong and weak relativism wherein strong relativism the same sentence can be true in one

46:33.320 --> 46:41.240
framework but false in another so like spirits live in trees true in the hopi framework but false

46:41.240 --> 46:47.720
translated to normal english and then there is weak relativism where one sentence cannot even be

46:47.720 --> 46:54.200
expressed in another framework where translation is not possible soyer decides he's gonna focus on

46:54.200 --> 47:00.600
the strong one because he says that's where most relativists are at anyway thinking that translation

47:00.600 --> 47:07.800
is possible but the way he sees it is that there are two premises the world as experienced is

47:07.800 --> 47:16.040
partially constituted by frameworks and translation is possible between frameworks and somehow this

47:16.040 --> 47:25.640
is supposed to conclude to truth is relative in the strong sense but soyer doesn't think three

47:25.640 --> 47:31.720
follows two is questionable especially if the statement becomes contradictory false in one and

47:31.720 --> 47:38.040
true in another how could they have anything in common if the worlds the frameworks are so different

47:38.040 --> 47:43.640
then what sense can the sentence even mean the same thing in what sense are they the same sentence

47:43.640 --> 47:49.160
or equivalence if the ontology is different between the frameworks that is if the world is

47:49.160 --> 47:54.280
different expressed by the two different frameworks then it seems that the meaning of the sentence

47:54.280 --> 48:01.000
must be different as soyer pithley puts it and pithley means a brief or sharp or forcefully

48:01.000 --> 48:07.800
like straight up soyer straight up says it like a change of world entails a change of meaning

48:08.520 --> 48:14.680
so to encapsulate that saying that something can be false in another framework it shows that it's

48:14.680 --> 48:19.400
not really the same thing then if you're really trying to say that the other framework can be so

48:19.400 --> 48:26.440
radically different that can lead it to being false because of this attack three strong failed

48:27.400 --> 48:33.320
so if you didn't get that strong relativism won't work or at least it seems if the worlds are so

48:33.320 --> 48:38.760
different that the same sentence can be false in one yet true in another the sentence doesn't

48:38.760 --> 48:44.040
really mean the same thing then the meaning of the sentence is changing if the worlds are so

48:44.120 --> 48:50.760
radically different that we could even consider one thing false while true in another and our focus

48:50.760 --> 48:56.440
as per ogready has been much more to do with seeing how the idea of worlds can be different

48:56.440 --> 49:02.440
doesn't necessarily need to include that truth is relative okay so the strong attack failed but

49:02.440 --> 49:08.120
what about the weak attack weak alithic relativism where a sentence is inexpressible in another

49:08.120 --> 49:13.640
framework remember we kind of had that condition earlier about how legitimate relativism about

49:13.640 --> 49:19.560
truth would allow for contradiction in a different context different sentences become

49:19.560 --> 49:26.840
candidates for truth and false like a context of math taxonomy or genetic history etc in a

49:26.840 --> 49:32.600
different context a sentence may not even appear so to make that easier to explain i guess while

49:32.600 --> 49:37.960
playing basketball the truth of whether light is really the universal speed limit would not even show

49:38.360 --> 49:43.800
it wouldn't even be a candidate for truth or false while playing basketball is it two hundred

49:43.800 --> 49:48.920
and ninety nine million seven hundred ninety two thousand four hundred fifty eight meters per second

49:48.920 --> 49:55.000
like i can't even ask such a question in basketball type of language so whether that's true or false

49:55.000 --> 50:00.760
doesn't even register in basketball language let's say and therefore the truth of that sentence

50:00.760 --> 50:05.640
is relative to languages where they would be even a candidate for truth and false

50:05.720 --> 50:12.360
but already says that ain't really relativism about truth though for relativism we need something

50:12.360 --> 50:18.440
to be true and false in different contexts but just cuz something isn't expressible in another

50:18.440 --> 50:23.640
language doesn't mean there's a threat of contradiction it seems like these different

50:23.640 --> 50:28.600
contexts or different styles of reasoning here whatever you'd like to call it can still nevertheless

50:28.600 --> 50:33.800
be perfectly compatible different things are being discussed which can be lumped together in a larger

50:33.800 --> 50:39.800
account with no contradiction so relativism about truth isn't defensible in that way either

50:40.760 --> 50:43.800
attack three week failed

50:43.800 --> 50:53.800
so

51:06.440 --> 51:11.880
well that was an awesome battle wasn't it well oh grady did some good work there i think but

51:11.880 --> 51:16.280
there's still more room more attack left in the relativist for those that believe that

51:16.280 --> 51:22.120
different theories of truth can allow for more openness to a relativized version of truth so

51:22.120 --> 51:27.480
now oh grady has a section where he talks about correspondence theory of truth epistemic theory

51:27.480 --> 51:33.160
of truth and a deflationist theory of truth the former two being what he calls substantive he

51:33.160 --> 51:38.200
discusses how depending on which theory you use it has different impacts for relativism in other

51:38.200 --> 51:43.480
places but because i'm currently not thinking i'm necessarily going to be covering his entire book

51:43.480 --> 51:47.960
or at least not sure to what depth i'm going to be doing that i'm just going to cover it quickly

51:47.960 --> 51:52.840
with this kind of graph and then we'll go on to the second battle basically the ones that are

51:52.840 --> 51:58.680
substantive are saying that truth is substantively important that it's a kind of property of some

51:58.680 --> 52:04.920
sentences or belief that makes it explanatorily important the deflationist ones are where truth

52:04.920 --> 52:10.760
is insignificant and just a kind of grammatical thing we say he talks about alfred he gives an

52:10.760 --> 52:16.760
example using a tarski here but i'm just going to skip that part anyway of the substantive ones

52:16.760 --> 52:22.920
he discusses too the first one being correspondence theory where truth is when propositions correspond

52:22.920 --> 52:27.960
to reality he brings up a few reasons why this is actually untenable like how the best ones really

52:27.960 --> 52:34.360
still entail how larger propositions rely on the truth of basic elements but there aren't basic

52:34.360 --> 52:40.280
propositions in the natural language and how it's not actually well explained how there's a structure

52:40.280 --> 52:46.040
in a proposition that is the same one in reality how they can both share that same structure

52:46.040 --> 52:50.040
anyway if you like a detailed discussion of this kind of criticism of correspondence theory just

52:50.040 --> 52:54.440
let me know in the comments below but the point is that correspondence theory doesn't leave room

52:54.440 --> 53:01.400
open for relativism on ontology nor in epistemology or at least technically it can still be connected

53:01.480 --> 53:07.000
to ontological relativism you know relativism about what there is or what kind of things there are

53:07.000 --> 53:10.920
in the world but that would kind of defeat the whole purpose of being a correspondence

53:10.920 --> 53:15.560
theorist in the first place because it makes correspondence theory not all that substantive

53:15.560 --> 53:21.880
if language could connect to multiple realities then he talks about how there's an epistemological

53:21.880 --> 53:27.880
theory of truth where truth is just the best of what we know this kind of has a problem of well

53:27.880 --> 53:34.440
you know we can be wrong about things so truth seems to change as we adjust and the answer back

53:34.440 --> 53:40.440
to that concern is usually like cool whatever truth is an ideal anyway like a goal that we

53:40.440 --> 53:46.120
just never reach because we never truly finish investigating everything but we always will

53:46.120 --> 53:51.800
try and the best of our trying is what we'll just call truth it makes it kind of grammatical I guess

53:51.800 --> 53:57.560
in that sense responding to that however critics are often like you're just conflating issues with

53:57.560 --> 54:04.360
knowledge and how or if we can have certainty with what the truth is but they respond back well

54:04.360 --> 54:08.840
that's not much of a criticism you're just inherently assuming or stipulating that truth

54:08.840 --> 54:14.920
is something other than what we propose here in any case this one though does leave the doors open

54:14.920 --> 54:20.600
for relativism in ontology and in epistemology the study of knowledge but just because it leaves

54:20.600 --> 54:26.360
doors open for relativism in ontology and in epistemology well does that really mean that it

54:26.360 --> 54:31.640
can leave doors open for relativizing truth as well well O'Grady will argue that the amount of

54:31.640 --> 54:37.240
relativism in the epistemology is actually limited by rationality which is another place he battles

54:37.240 --> 54:42.280
to defend against relativism and the result of that kind of has a trickleback effect I guess you

54:42.280 --> 54:47.560
could say to ensure that ultimately there is one absolute truth and that's what we're gonna see

54:47.560 --> 54:54.120
next so let's see now how he defends against charges of relativism in rationality oh wait

54:54.200 --> 54:58.840
before we do that we should look at logic logic in some sense already seems to be much of the

54:58.840 --> 55:04.120
discussion in defending against relativism for O'Grady it's a part of his whole setup anyway

55:04.120 --> 55:08.920
also it's often the go-to move for people to push back against claims of something being relative

55:08.920 --> 55:15.640
they just say hey it's logic anyway so let's check that out the link for the next video will

55:15.640 --> 55:21.560
be below I think you deserve a break but if you don't need a break and you're ready to go ready

55:21.560 --> 55:29.640
get that next thing on then let's go now and see logic versus relativism by the way thank you for

55:29.640 --> 55:35.160
watching this video give it a like and a comment too the comments I have received over the years

55:35.160 --> 55:40.360
actually as well as my patreon supporter slick pockets are ultimately the greatest motivating

55:40.360 --> 55:46.520
thing I see comments of support mentally really help me and honestly there are things that I find

55:46.520 --> 55:50.920
in those comments that are sometimes so touching even though I don't reply like I really do read

55:50.920 --> 55:55.720
all of them and I know I'm doing something good things here and maybe even with my life because

55:55.720 --> 56:00.920
of those comments you know I don't even know if I've mentioned before but writing the script for

56:00.920 --> 56:06.440
this episode episode seven like I literally heard gunshots out of my window while writing philosophy

56:06.440 --> 56:12.760
it's it's caught me really questioning sometimes why I'm doing this so they help so if you can

56:12.760 --> 56:18.680
please socially or financially help me you can support me on patreon or if you have paypal you

56:18.680 --> 56:24.840
can send me money and a one-time direct donation and I understand that may not be easy for many so

56:24.840 --> 56:31.960
if not those uh let's try to just get me to a thousand subs maybe then perhaps my creator will

56:31.960 --> 56:53.240
grant me a neck finally also remember philosophers keep battling
