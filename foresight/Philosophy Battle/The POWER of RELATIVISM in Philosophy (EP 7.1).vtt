00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Relativism. It is one of the most powerful modern philosophic weapons. Its power is immense,

00:06.000 --> 00:12.240
however it can become dangerous if wielded to extreme degrees, by those with insufficient

00:12.240 --> 00:18.560
philosophic understanding. While it can be traced back to ancient times, it is philosophies from

00:18.560 --> 00:24.720
five different great philosophers that are noted to have been imbued into this weapon,

00:24.800 --> 00:31.280
empowering it into the modern philosophic warfare. Relativism is most useful in carving out the

00:31.280 --> 00:38.400
layers of presumed objectivity and the naivety of our old ways. We use relativism now as more

00:38.400 --> 00:44.320
a clear path to being skeptical about all sorts of claims, not just who makes the best pizza,

00:44.320 --> 00:50.640
or even what is right and wrong, but now, even what we may have previously called facts.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.480
And so this weapon becomes incredibly crucial for any good philosophic warrior to appreciate its

00:56.480 --> 01:05.840
power, but equally important, also its limits. And ignoring those limits can create dangerous and

01:05.840 --> 01:11.760
frustrating enemies for us on the battlefield. We must learn to wield relativism to become

01:11.760 --> 01:18.320
good philosophers, to question, to be skeptical of all sorts of claims to objectivity. We must use

01:18.320 --> 01:25.760
it whenever it can be used, but we must also be cautious and not be impatient in our journey to

01:25.760 --> 01:33.200
investigate cases where perhaps it cannot. The limits of its use. So today we're gonna explain

01:33.200 --> 01:40.000
those two things, the power and limits of this tremendous philosophic weapon called relativism.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.000
Which is why we came here to the battlefield of metaphysics in the first place, so we can dismantle

01:46.400 --> 01:52.080
it and see more than merely a blur of all it can destroy, to see that it indeed does have limits

01:52.080 --> 01:59.280
and indeed does become volatile when those limits are crossed. Limits that we will later point out,

01:59.280 --> 02:05.280
if it should be crossed by those on the battlefield of the philosophy of science in particular,

02:05.840 --> 02:14.560
when we get back to the battlefield science, if we ever get back. Anyway, we'll be looking at

02:14.560 --> 02:20.720
the power and limits as explained and set out in this green book, Relativism by Paul O'Grady.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.320
In the last episode we looked at a battle in this red book, Relativism and Reality by Robert Kirk,

02:26.320 --> 02:32.000
because I wanted to make a social point. You see, as it is clearly outlined in all three books I may

02:32.000 --> 02:37.520
want to cover on relativism, including this blue book, The Challenge of Relativism by Patrick J.J.

02:38.320 --> 02:46.000
most find relativism alluring for social reasons. Because we want to be open and tolerant to people

02:46.000 --> 02:52.160
of different perspectives, different viewpoints, and understanding from different political spheres,

02:52.160 --> 02:58.320
different cultures, races, genders, and so on. But if we jump into it, guns ablazing as the

02:58.320 --> 03:04.080
phrase goes, without sufficient philosophical understanding first, one might hastily end up

03:04.080 --> 03:10.480
wielding relativism to an unlimited degree such that one takes the position that everything is

03:10.480 --> 03:18.720
relative. Even truth, yep, knowledge, truth, reality, everything. And that's what we might call

03:18.720 --> 03:25.680
an extreme relativist. So while I personally find those in the pursuit of tolerance, not just noble

03:25.680 --> 03:32.880
but necessary, I present extreme relativism as a terrible strategy in that pursuit. Now it might

03:32.880 --> 03:37.520
sound kind of ridiculous right now, like who would think that say oh I don't know that literal

03:37.520 --> 03:44.160
scientific facts are relative. It does happen though, it did happen, and probably it still will

03:44.160 --> 03:50.880
happen. But we will explain in this video how this weapon appears to become even that powerful

03:50.880 --> 03:57.840
as wielded by sophisticated relativists, with seemingly good reasons. In any case, Robert Kirk

03:57.840 --> 04:03.440
in a section of that red book that I have here took an unsophisticated version of that extreme

04:03.440 --> 04:08.640
relativist that's known as the true for me relativist, or if you're fancy the protagorean

04:08.640 --> 04:14.720
relativist. Anyway for that version of the extreme relativist, there is no truth, there is just whatever

04:14.720 --> 04:20.640
is true for me or true for you. So what counts as truth depends on the personal perspective of the

04:20.640 --> 04:26.000
speaker. Though at first it may have seemed kind of funny, but we actually encounter people who

04:26.080 --> 04:31.440
hold this kind of belief at all levels of society, not just in the philosophy classrooms,

04:31.440 --> 04:36.240
people use this to express their truths about politics, religion, and even about

04:36.240 --> 04:42.560
literal states of the world, facts, and so on. From the newsroom to the bar conversation,

04:42.560 --> 04:48.800
arguing over global warming, alternative medicine, or even if the dragon eater sports team should have

04:48.800 --> 04:54.880
won the golden cup. True for me is often used to speak without trying to offend others or tell

04:54.880 --> 05:00.000
others that they are wrong for having a different position, or perhaps just to hold on to what you

05:00.000 --> 05:06.160
believe despite evidence shown otherwise. And I go over a few different reasons why people do this

05:06.160 --> 05:12.720
in that Robert Kirk video series, episode 6. Now back in that last episode though, episode 6,

05:12.720 --> 05:18.160
in that battle Kirk shows that this position of saying everything is just true for me or true for

05:18.160 --> 05:25.440
you actually can't support the idea that everything is relative, but also that in trying to defend

05:25.440 --> 05:31.760
against Kirk's attacks, the extreme relativist also becomes further committed to a path that leads

05:31.760 --> 05:38.800
them to becoming a solipsist. What is a solipsist? It's thinking that you're the only one that exists,

05:38.800 --> 05:45.280
that there are no other minds, just one mind, just you. Everything else is just a presentation around

05:46.240 --> 05:50.560
you. Please check out that last episode if you like to see how TFM, true for me,

05:50.560 --> 05:57.200
relativism leads to solipsism. But from there Kirk does show that that too,

05:57.200 --> 06:03.280
solipsism, is a position that doesn't support this assertion, and I thought that was a pretty cool

06:03.280 --> 06:10.720
philosophic move to do. But then I made my own move to re-explain why true for me or TFM leads to

06:10.720 --> 06:17.840
solipsism in my own way. And then that a solipsist's position isn't actually open and tolerant,

06:17.840 --> 06:23.680
that actually, while you may have started out as a relativist for those good noble reasons of

06:23.680 --> 06:29.120
tolerance and openness that I agree with, that if you stay committed to TFM and become a solipsist,

06:29.760 --> 06:35.760
it's actually close-minded, selfish, intolerant position that denies the agency of others,

06:35.760 --> 06:41.520
and even defies the grasp of the very concept of otherness. Instead of bringing understanding

06:41.520 --> 06:47.360
from different perspectives together, they actually become a segregationist of sorts,

06:47.360 --> 06:54.240
preventing any real engagement with otherness, thus becoming exactly what they hate, opposing the

06:54.240 --> 07:01.600
very heart or organs of why they wanted to be a relativist in the first place. Again, if you think

07:01.600 --> 07:06.160
that's kind of interesting, and would like to see how all that happened, you can check out that

07:06.160 --> 07:12.000
series of videos here. I'll put the links below in the description. And if you were or will be

07:12.000 --> 07:18.640
influenced by my move made in that video, well, you know, even though this is a YouTube video and

07:18.640 --> 07:23.760
not an academic source, you know, I'm just a shadowy nobody here, but please still credit that

07:23.760 --> 07:29.200
video in some way, at least in the footnotes. It's about intellectual honesty, you know? Also,

07:29.200 --> 07:34.480
that way, if I say anything wrong and you're influenced by it, others will know why, and blame

07:34.480 --> 07:40.000
can also fall on my shoulders. And hopefully that might bring some other philosophers to come battle

07:40.000 --> 07:45.760
me over it. And surely one of us will learn something from that battle. Anyway, that version of the

07:45.760 --> 07:51.520
relativist isn't actually the more powerful version that philosophers battle against. So,

07:51.520 --> 07:56.480
I ended up promising that we would go and move on to bigger, badder relativists,

07:56.480 --> 08:00.400
ones who are actually empowered by arguments from philosophers themselves.

08:00.960 --> 08:07.920
Those five that I mentioned earlier are the ones that Paul O'Grady specifically notes. For him,

08:07.920 --> 08:13.680
it's actually one of three tendencies that showed up in the different areas of philosophy,

08:13.680 --> 08:21.280
pushing out this more modernized weapon. So, here we are today looking at the imbuing of this power,

08:21.280 --> 08:26.400
the three tendencies that includes ideas from these five philosophers.

08:27.360 --> 08:32.400
Briefly, in Paul O'Grady's book, he has a general outline that looks like this. Here,

08:32.400 --> 08:36.640
we will find the philosophies that helped embolden these relativists and empower that

08:36.640 --> 08:44.880
relativist weapon. This is what this video will cover now, the power. Here and here, O'Grady draws

08:44.880 --> 08:52.400
the limits of relativism, at truth and rationality. Now, on logic, relativism is sort of allowed in

08:52.400 --> 08:58.480
the sense that it is allowed on a lower order, but I will explain that later. Relativism, however,

08:58.480 --> 09:04.160
for O'Grady, is allowed in ontology. I find this much has to do with the basis of conceptual

09:04.160 --> 09:10.800
relativity, but we won't be covering it for our purposes right now. Also, some relativization

09:10.800 --> 09:16.880
is allowed in epistemology, but limited by the amount set out in chapter 5, limits on

09:16.880 --> 09:23.520
relativism about rationality. Today though, we'll go over some of that power, as I promised. It may

09:23.520 --> 09:28.960
seem kind of quick though, because O'Grady seems more about wanting to point out the sources of

09:28.960 --> 09:34.880
this power than actually getting into with examples what those sources really are that gave it the

09:34.880 --> 09:41.360
power. So hopefully at times I can assist there. Also, don't worry if it's a bit fast. In each

09:41.360 --> 09:46.240
place, each battle, later on that we cover, the philosophic arguments from the actual

09:46.240 --> 09:52.240
philosophic thought is often addressed anyway, and sometimes the philosophers are other than these

09:52.240 --> 09:59.600
five. But one in particular, I will be doing myself, in an additional video, to help explain

09:59.600 --> 10:06.080
so that people really understand why simply thinking literalism, or scientific physical

10:06.080 --> 10:12.640
descriptions, is not actually strong enough to oppose this relativist, whose weapon has been

10:12.640 --> 10:18.080
empowered by these five philosophers. After that, we'll move on to talk about each of the chapters

10:18.080 --> 10:25.440
that include the limits of relativism, and the battles therein. So this part, power, may not

10:25.520 --> 10:31.440
have much battle itself, but it is a look at that weapon that will be in play in the battles here

10:31.440 --> 10:37.440
after. Finally, after all this, I will give my overall evaluation of the book, and maybe then

10:37.440 --> 10:41.600
I'll touch on some of the chapters that I left out. So let's get to it.

10:42.960 --> 10:47.920
Philosophy battle. The most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet,

10:47.920 --> 10:53.200
probably. Now entering the battlefield of metaphysics.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, light switch.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.560
Oh, uh, I'm gonna keep this on.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.760
Hmm, whoa.

11:08.880 --> 11:14.080
That's better. Here is Paul O'Grady. That's not really him. That's just an image I made.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.480
Support me on Patreon, or make a direct contribution to me on PayPal.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.560
Who will give us a little history lesson that will lead us to explaining the powers of this

11:22.560 --> 11:28.400
weapon. And to be clear, as he says it in his preface, he is more going to cover this topic

11:28.400 --> 11:34.400
in an analytic tradition than a continental one. And also, he's not going to be covering Einstein,

11:34.400 --> 11:38.640
which doesn't really have to do with what we're talking about here. Anyway, let's begin.

11:38.640 --> 11:46.960
Long ago in the land before time. Oh, okay, wait. That was just me, not him. Listen, whenever I'm

11:46.960 --> 11:52.080
speaking for O'Grady, it will be sited down to the line on the bottom of the screen. Unless I say

11:52.080 --> 11:58.160
otherwise. That way, you know I make up nothing. And if I misinterpreted anything, you know exactly

11:58.160 --> 12:04.320
which line I didn't do justice. Also, you will know that when I do say something from my own opinion

12:04.320 --> 12:09.120
or my own information offered here, you won't misinterpret it as if he were saying it,

12:09.120 --> 12:14.480
because then the citation will just disappear when it's me talking. Okay? That's how we roll in

12:14.480 --> 12:20.320
philosophy battle. Citation down to the line. But on the other hand, while I am siding everything

12:20.320 --> 12:25.920
down to the line, it will be my interpretation or my paraphrasing of what is being said, unless of

12:25.920 --> 12:30.800
course I actually put it up in quotes on the screen. And it might be shifted just a tiny bit

12:30.800 --> 12:36.320
in order to make sense for this video. Anyway, in the 20th century, there was the linguistic

12:36.320 --> 12:42.880
turn in philosophy. Oh, wait. So this happened in large part because of a guy named Fraga,

12:42.880 --> 12:49.280
who kind of tried to make a more scientific or math-like perfect language to do philosophy in.

12:49.280 --> 12:54.480
It kind of looked like this. And hopefully we can talk about Fraga at length later. But anyway,

12:54.480 --> 13:00.240
crudely crunched down for you guys now. Basically, traditional discussions about what is knowledge

13:00.240 --> 13:07.600
turned into what can we say is true. And from that to how can sentences about the world,

13:07.600 --> 13:14.960
i.e. propositions, be true. And how do they relate to each other? What even counts as a proposition?

13:15.040 --> 13:19.760
Doesn't all information need to be in some sort of language? And if the world is made up of

13:19.760 --> 13:25.920
information, is there an inherent language of reality? Or on the other hand, isn't language

13:25.920 --> 13:32.800
a tool of communicating among different people? And so this linguistic turn led to a social turn

13:32.800 --> 13:38.880
because language brings into the account of the social context that the language is created in.

13:38.880 --> 13:44.560
And because there are different societies, previously stable philosophical concepts about

13:44.560 --> 13:52.400
truth, meaning, ontology, knowledge, they became unstable. To be clear, I'm dealing

13:52.400 --> 13:58.400
not with moral relativism, what's right and wrong, good or bad. I'm interested in cognitive

13:58.400 --> 14:05.600
relativism. Relativism about things like truth, reality, and knowledge. Everything that isn't

14:05.600 --> 14:13.760
aesthetics, like tastes or beauty and art, or morals, ethics, right and wrong. So in my terminology,

14:13.760 --> 14:20.720
the opposite of relativism is absolutism. So, ferrogradi relativism is the opposite of absolutism,

14:20.720 --> 14:26.640
just as the subjective would be opposite to objective. Just keep that in mind in case an

14:26.640 --> 14:33.280
imperfect philosopher uses the term objective as opposite relative instead, as is my preference,

14:33.280 --> 14:39.680
I tend to do this. But anyway, saying something is relative is saying that it comes from or is

14:39.680 --> 14:46.000
determined or dependent on something else. For example, saying something is big, big relative

14:46.000 --> 14:52.960
to what? To me or to an ant or to the planet Uranus. Big is a relative term that depends on

14:52.960 --> 14:59.280
something else here. Something absolute is independent and doesn't require a relationship

14:59.280 --> 15:04.560
to anything else. Ogrady then describes three traditions that in the beginning seemed more

15:04.560 --> 15:10.960
unified, that later split with little contact in between them. He describes them as the English

15:10.960 --> 15:17.120
based tradition of Russell, Wittgenstein, Ryle, and Austin, the American based tradition of James,

15:17.120 --> 15:22.960
Lewis, Quine, and Putnam, and while they had little contact with each other, they pretty much

15:22.960 --> 15:28.720
practically completely left alone the Husserl, Heidegger, Sacher, Derrida tradition, which Ogrady

15:28.720 --> 15:33.680
doesn't call that tradition by any particular geographical name, but I would guess on that

15:33.680 --> 15:39.200
basis he would call it the continental tradition therefore. Yet some tendencies began to emerge

15:39.200 --> 15:46.000
among all sides and aided in the rise of cognitive relativism. Relativism about even those things.

15:46.800 --> 15:52.720
Here are three of those tendencies that started emerging independently from different places.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.600
Rejecting the theory practice dichotomy, rejecting the fact value dichotomy,

15:57.600 --> 16:05.200
and framework ideas, which come from those five philosophers. So first let's deal with

16:05.200 --> 16:07.680
rejecting the theory practice dichotomy.

16:19.600 --> 16:26.320
In ancient times, morals, morality was just as much a part of the world in how the world is.

16:26.880 --> 16:33.360
With technological and scientific advancement studying nature though, it left behind questions

16:33.360 --> 16:40.320
of behavior and human conduct. The investigation of nature actually pulled apart from that of

16:40.320 --> 16:48.080
morality. The discussions of nature became disconnected to that of morals. A split appeared

16:48.080 --> 16:53.760
in the kinds of knowledge we had. On the one hand we had the objective reliable nature,

16:53.760 --> 16:59.920
on the other hand we had the subjective moral society and religion. So there was a realm of the

16:59.920 --> 17:07.200
world that existed independent of us, that science investigated, and the human world that was dependent

17:07.200 --> 17:13.680
on us. Philosophical conceptions developing from this reflected that split between a world

17:13.680 --> 17:20.000
independent of human input, as reality, and a world dependent on human beings like morals,

17:20.000 --> 17:26.480
ethics, and behavior. And he says what I suppose as it was taken at the time, that genuine knowledge

17:26.480 --> 17:32.320
is knowledge of that which is there independent of our knowing of it, knowledge of what was there

17:32.320 --> 17:39.760
anyway. Human knowledge is an effort to adequately capture or represent this reality. Philosophers

17:39.760 --> 17:45.600
working within this built the conception of primary and secondary qualities. This is going to sound

17:45.600 --> 17:50.720
a lot like the legendary John Locke now. Primary qualities were aspects of reality that were

17:50.800 --> 17:57.440
independent of human cognition, like shape, motion, and mass. Things that are taken to be there as they

17:57.440 --> 18:03.360
are even if no minds were around to perceive them. And then there were secondary qualities,

18:03.360 --> 18:10.160
like color, sounds, and so on. Things that are dependent on our awareness of them. So like vibrations

18:10.160 --> 18:17.280
in the air hitting my eardrum technically doesn't need to invoke consciousness, but actually hearing

18:17.280 --> 18:23.520
sound does. To this day these appear to many as fundamentally different things. Like the difference

18:23.520 --> 18:29.920
between the mind actually seeing the color red is thought to be fundamentally different, koalia,

18:29.920 --> 18:35.760
than the mere detection of say 430 terahertz on the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.

18:35.760 --> 18:41.840
So one set of phenomena was part of the furniture of the world itself, and the other are products of

18:42.720 --> 18:50.080
products. And the other are products of human receptivity and dependent on human cognition.

18:50.800 --> 18:56.640
Now it was taken to be that investigations of nature while helpful to make technology that

18:56.640 --> 19:02.880
can be used for certain purposes by our society that the actual investigation of nature itself

19:02.880 --> 19:09.760
was still nevertheless pure for the sake of truth itself. So you know they felt it was still

19:09.760 --> 19:15.360
objective. That sure we made technology and make use of knowledge for different things depending

19:15.360 --> 19:19.600
on our society based on the particular parts of the world we're in or in different periods of

19:19.600 --> 19:24.800
history with certain levels of technology and advancement let's say. But at least practicing

19:24.800 --> 19:32.480
the method of gaining knowledge of nature itself, practicing science, was still objective. But then

19:32.480 --> 19:39.120
this came under attack from different areas in the 20th century. Scientists are members of society too,

19:39.120 --> 19:46.240
like anyone else. Influenced by fashion, economics, politics, social status, etc. And also science

19:46.240 --> 19:52.480
itself doesn't actually turn out to be so clear a systemic progression in its study with rules and

19:52.480 --> 19:58.400
methods as it turns out. History in fact shows us that it's actually full of chance and lucky

19:58.400 --> 20:04.240
screw-ups. But so what? One may say that despite still living in a messy human world, scientists

20:04.240 --> 20:10.560
are still able to pull out the goods, unpolluted absolute conception of reality. As in the sentiments

20:10.560 --> 20:16.400
yeah maybe how and why we get the knowledge is relative to the time and society we're in but

20:16.400 --> 20:22.240
still like the knowledge itself was still objective right? Well to that Paulo Grady says

20:22.240 --> 20:29.120
there's still a bigger challenge, a massive skeptical challenge. The sentiments that if such a

20:29.120 --> 20:36.320
pure dehumanized picture of reality is the goal of inquiry, how can we ever reach it?

20:36.320 --> 20:43.360
Surely we would inevitably infect it with human subjectivity in our efforts to grasp it. Imagine

20:43.360 --> 20:49.280
knowledge is like a snowball or something super soft and we live in a blind world. To know it we

20:49.280 --> 20:56.720
would have to grab it but by grabbing it we change sort of what it is. We forced our impression onto

20:56.720 --> 21:03.680
it. We can't really know what it is on grasp. It's always going to be affected not just in

21:03.680 --> 21:11.600
order to observe it but by observing it, by conceptualizing it, by knowing it. Things can't

21:11.600 --> 21:17.600
be observed without a perspective from which we perceive so how could anything be known in ways

21:17.600 --> 21:24.320
beyond a particular perspective? One might feel well we will never really have knowledge then of

21:24.320 --> 21:30.640
reality itself. It will always be infected by us therefore. Now there's also a different conception

21:30.640 --> 21:36.400
of objectivity which is inter subjectivity. That is the objective is just that which the

21:36.400 --> 21:41.360
reasonable people agree upon. Well I'm not going to touch this for now but I just want to note

21:41.360 --> 21:47.760
there's much to say about this to think of later on but anyway still even with this conception it

21:47.760 --> 21:53.440
involves that for them while we do get in touch with a reality independent of human thought

21:53.440 --> 21:59.520
but mediated via human thought. Now what this has to do with relativism is that reality can be

21:59.520 --> 22:06.000
mediated in different ways. Representations of the same objective reality can be different

22:06.000 --> 22:11.520
depending on the concepts we use to think about it. Different features of reality come to the

22:11.520 --> 22:18.000
fore as we deploy different sets of concepts to deal with it. Quoting here, philosophers from

22:18.000 --> 22:24.080
different traditions such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger and William James came to hold versions of this

22:24.080 --> 22:30.000
view which are framework ideas but O'Grady will talk about them later more closely. In any case

22:30.000 --> 22:37.120
this all goes against the idea that our practice or doing science or anything is somehow not altered

22:37.120 --> 22:43.520
by our theories or our concepts which are relative to the type of creatures we are. How much we already

22:43.520 --> 22:50.080
know, what we are still ignorant of, what time and place our society is based in etc and therefore

22:50.080 --> 22:55.520
from different societies it would mean differences in our practice and concepts but I think this

22:55.520 --> 23:04.080
issue is being kind of muddled with the next failing dichotomy so let's look at that now. Rejecting the fact value dichotomy.

23:04.480 --> 23:19.360
The idea of facts is connected to the idea of an absolute conception of reality

23:19.920 --> 23:27.280
as if they are independent, objective, solid, reliable and is contrasted with the subjective

23:27.280 --> 23:35.120
unreliable things like feelings and desires. One of the big changes is the idea of value

23:35.120 --> 23:42.480
no longer being inherently in certain things like gold but instead something we project

23:42.480 --> 23:49.120
onto certain things. A way human beings have been coloring the facts so we could split language into

23:49.120 --> 23:55.280
a descriptive vocabulary that just says what the facts are and an evaluative vocabulary that reports

23:55.280 --> 24:02.800
how we feel about those facts. This is a fact value split. Facts are supposed to exist as if

24:02.800 --> 24:09.840
independently of the mind but in order for a human to know a fact it has to be conceptualized by the

24:09.840 --> 24:16.800
human mind. We dress the world in concepts in order to think of it. The world doesn't automatically

24:16.800 --> 24:23.840
conceptualize itself. Throughout our own history we've created concepts to help describe the world

24:23.840 --> 24:29.680
and the concepts we create pick out the things we are interested in. For example we use concepts

24:29.680 --> 24:36.160
related to our senses. Take color. We had color concepts only for the part of the visual spectrum

24:36.160 --> 24:41.680
that we can see before learning about light and how much bigger the spectrum is. There were no

24:41.680 --> 24:47.360
concepts to discriminate the spectrum beyond what we saw. So before we may have only thought about

24:47.360 --> 24:53.440
you know red, green and blue, yellow etc. We didn't even have the concepts to differentiate between

24:53.440 --> 24:59.760
say infrared and ultraviolet for example until after we learned more about light. With this

24:59.760 --> 25:05.440
we can still say that there are facts that are either true or false but what counts as a fact

25:05.440 --> 25:13.200
also depends in part on us both in whether we have concepts to describe it but also if it even fits

25:13.200 --> 25:20.320
with everything else that we already know. We can decide if something counts as a fact or not

25:20.320 --> 25:25.600
if it fits with everything else we already know about the world. Our decision on saying

25:25.600 --> 25:30.720
something as a fact is therefore based on a number of considerations that are actually

25:30.720 --> 25:38.800
value laden. Value laden which means something like soaked in our values. If soaked or endowed

25:38.800 --> 25:43.520
with our interests. Interests like whether or not it makes our theories more simple,

25:43.520 --> 25:48.800
coheres with the facts, allows for greater generalizations etc. Things that will help

25:48.880 --> 25:55.120
us make further predictions. These things aren't in the facts themselves, they're values where

25:55.120 --> 26:01.920
human interests enter the picture. Now this alone doesn't make a fact subjective, just what counts

26:01.920 --> 26:08.560
as an objective fact isn't independent of the subjective mind. So there's actually two pictures

26:08.560 --> 26:13.920
here, an old picture where the world exists totally independent of the human mind constructing

26:13.920 --> 26:20.320
anything and the mind merely mirrors that. And now a more recent picture where the mind is in

26:20.320 --> 26:27.040
some way to some degree constructing the world that we live in. So this more recent picture

26:27.040 --> 26:33.280
allows for describing the world in multiple ways since people could have different values,

26:33.280 --> 26:39.920
thus their accounts of the facts will differ. Now anti-relativists will want to say it can't

26:39.920 --> 26:44.880
be varied all that much, there's a limit to how different they can be, and we can work towards

26:44.880 --> 26:51.440
unifying a picture of reality. But the relativists focus more on the differences themselves, that

26:51.440 --> 26:57.600
they can't unify different versions of the world. And one of the ways that they do this is by using

26:57.600 --> 27:02.800
the idea that the world is mediated through a structure that yields different accounts of

27:02.800 --> 27:09.200
reality to us relative to that structure. And different terms are used by the relativists

27:09.200 --> 27:16.960
for this structure such as conceptual scheme, paradigm, linguistic framework, and language

27:16.960 --> 27:23.840
games. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to make that sound too spooky. I'm actually laughing with joy

27:23.840 --> 27:28.960
because paradigms and language games are two that I feel reasonably comfortable talking about.

27:28.960 --> 27:35.040
And the latter is often spooky because of its misunderstanding and again which I feel I can

27:35.040 --> 27:40.000
contribute to getting rid of that misunderstanding and misconstruing. But don't worry now,

27:40.000 --> 27:44.800
O'Grady is going to explain how these other philosophers, framework ideas, oh okay oh well

27:44.800 --> 27:50.240
I guess we're going straight to the slide this time. So now O'Grady is going to quickly cover

27:50.240 --> 27:56.400
some philosophers because he's more so trying to show the similarity in what he calls framework ideas

27:56.400 --> 28:01.440
in all of them rather than actually go into depth explaining and giving details of their

28:01.440 --> 28:07.360
philosophies. Some of it may then therefore seem unclear to you right now but just focus on what a

28:07.360 --> 28:13.040
framework idea is generally even if you're unclear about a specific philosopher's version.

28:13.040 --> 28:18.160
In any case, I'm here for y'all to help fill in some of what might be missing. And hopefully a

28:18.160 --> 28:28.640
faithful way anyway. Let's start. C.I. Lewis American philosopher C.I. Lewis was influenced

28:28.720 --> 28:34.320
by Immanuel Kant's idea that there was a division of knowledge between the given and that which

28:34.320 --> 28:41.200
processes the given. To be understood by us I guess. Whoa wait a minute maybe we should stop early.

28:41.200 --> 28:46.960
I realize Kant seems very much to be the backdrop behind a lot of this so I'm going to give a sort

28:46.960 --> 28:52.240
of one of my visualizations of this kind of philosophic picture here. In this picture the

28:52.240 --> 28:58.080
unprocessed reality outside what is currently grasped by the mind would be the sort of indistinct

28:58.080 --> 29:05.680
undifferentiated gray mush but really I can't even say it's gray or I can't even say it's mush.

29:05.680 --> 29:11.920
I can't say anything about it. I can only say things about what I do perceive and this stuff is

29:11.920 --> 29:19.120
beyond perception but whatever it be if it be at all it then be processed by our minds through

29:19.120 --> 29:24.880
these things called categories of understanding to produce the familiar perceptions that we do have.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.840
So there's a difference between reality or the pure world in itself you could say or maybe we

29:31.840 --> 29:38.320
would just make up a new word for it like numina and then there's our perception of the world as

29:38.320 --> 29:46.080
we perceive it. That reality is processed filtered and shaped by our categories of understanding

29:46.080 --> 29:52.240
aspects of our mind. We cut up things to understand the world as the kind of creatures we are

29:52.240 --> 29:59.040
that results in our perceptions what we might call phenomena and I talk more about how this

29:59.040 --> 30:05.360
relates to relativists in my bonus episode for episode six where I first introduced this kind

30:05.360 --> 30:11.040
of image. So it would be lovely if you do check that out in fact you might get to appreciate

30:11.040 --> 30:15.680
the powers of this philosophic weapon and the sophisticated relativist position to some degree

30:15.680 --> 30:21.520
just from that bonus video alone. So again please do check out episode six I know it has a lot of

30:21.520 --> 30:27.200
parts to it but hey it's a fun journey so anyway the basic idea for our purposes here

30:27.200 --> 30:33.680
is that there is an input from outside our mind and then some processing of the mind

30:33.680 --> 30:39.040
happens of whatever that outside input is in order to even perceive what we do and those

30:39.040 --> 30:45.120
perceptions are what we would call observation. In this sense we don't actually directly observe

30:45.120 --> 30:51.520
reality it's like we have spectacles on. So O'Grady is saying that Lewis was influenced by

30:51.520 --> 30:56.240
this sort of picture which I made sort of loosely generally based on Immanuel Kant.

30:57.200 --> 31:03.280
But Lewis was also influenced by pragmatists emphasizing the relation of thoughts to action

31:03.280 --> 31:09.840
you know actually doing things. Ah good old pragmatics that things have value only if they're

31:09.840 --> 31:16.160
useful to us to actually do things or survive. It's the spice of American style philosophy.

31:16.160 --> 31:22.000
He fused both of these into a position that also denies the theory practice dichotomy and the fact

31:22.000 --> 31:28.160
value dichotomy. He thought of philosophy as investigating these categories that we use to

31:28.160 --> 31:34.400
think about the world. Denying that the world conceptualizes itself. Instead the way we think

31:34.400 --> 31:40.800
about reality is socially and historically shaped. Concepts the meanings that are shared by human

31:40.800 --> 31:48.160
beings are a product of human interaction with the world. Theory is infected by practice and facts

31:48.160 --> 31:55.520
are shaped by values. Concepts structure our experience and reflect our interests attitudes

31:55.520 --> 32:03.040
and needs. Think about that talk about light going from colors we normally see to now even

32:03.120 --> 32:11.040
including ultraviolet. Violent. Ultraviolet and infrared. Or even and if you're big into history

32:11.040 --> 32:17.520
you might get a kick out of this but blue was not recognized as a unique color concept until

32:17.520 --> 32:23.440
practical societal reasons came about. More often in our cross-cultural history we find the color

32:23.440 --> 32:29.360
concept that combines what we now consider green and blue. But as it seems to me the most popular

32:29.360 --> 32:36.720
theory goes that we only began to use the color concept of blue uniquely after we became capable

32:36.720 --> 32:43.440
of making blue pigment in ancient Egypt. A color which was otherwise very rare in nature itself

32:43.440 --> 32:49.520
and perhaps it's just that blue did not require being uniquely identified prior to that.

32:50.160 --> 32:56.720
Anyway back to Lewis though. The categories we use aren't from reality itself but reflect

32:56.800 --> 33:04.480
enduring human interests. In that way reality is relative to a system of concepts. The world as

33:04.480 --> 33:10.000
we know it is shaped by the concepts we use to interpret it. Experience though governs which

33:10.000 --> 33:16.080
system of concepts we use and respect to which ones are successful. Faulty and useless concepts

33:16.080 --> 33:22.560
lead to bad predictions and unsuccessful courses of action. It's come to my attention that I may

33:22.560 --> 33:27.280
want to make something clear here even though I have already said it but I'm gonna say it again

33:27.280 --> 33:33.840
but I'm not saying this gray mush is what's actually there. That reality is actually gray mush.

33:33.840 --> 33:39.520
Really I don't know if it's gray and I don't know if it's mush. It's just that I can't say or

33:39.520 --> 33:44.800
talk about it at all. And Kant's categories make it even difficult to even say that it is.

33:44.800 --> 33:49.040
So there are different ways to interpret this that we will talk about later especially if we

33:49.040 --> 33:54.240
cover chapter three on ontology. And I don't really know Lewis directly actually. I only know

33:54.240 --> 33:59.760
what O'Grady says about him here but he does say much later on in a different chapter that Lewis

33:59.760 --> 34:06.160
nevertheless does take the given as data of the senses upon which we build knowledge. So this is

34:06.160 --> 34:12.080
just what it seems to me right now but it's more simply the eyes do very much still pick up this

34:12.080 --> 34:18.160
visual light input let's say but whatever this light reflections mean to us in order for it to

34:18.160 --> 34:24.800
mean anything in order for it to even be information in a sense at all it has to do with our concepts.

34:24.800 --> 34:31.840
So this is as it appears or is given but then it's still the concepts that cut it up meaningfully.

34:31.840 --> 34:37.600
So really there is all this then we have say a concept of saying something is edible and that

34:37.600 --> 34:42.720
cuts this out and of course therefore I guess a concept of the non edible and maybe we have the

34:42.800 --> 34:48.960
concept of things from nature and also things that are constructed from and for humans and then

34:48.960 --> 34:54.960
we have concepts to identify colors. So it's really that concepts are cutting up all this

34:54.960 --> 35:00.800
information that there is from the given and for Lewis those concepts themselves are a social

35:00.800 --> 35:06.640
product certainly children are taught to recognize the type of things that are edible and not and

35:06.640 --> 35:10.400
certainly children go through a process of recognizing the type of things that are just

35:10.400 --> 35:15.520
there in nature and the kind of things that humans must have made these concepts came into

35:15.520 --> 35:21.120
being and survived among any number of concepts because they help us survive or accomplish goals

35:21.120 --> 35:27.520
ourselves. So that's my example of what's going on here I bring this up just to be clear that with

35:27.520 --> 35:35.040
both of these the given or input doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't something if anything

35:35.040 --> 35:40.080
scientifically it is nigh infinite information in a sense if there even is such a thing as

35:40.080 --> 35:46.400
information at that stage and it isn't simply just gray mush I'm just visualizing it like that

35:46.400 --> 35:51.680
that whatever is presented to the mind cannot be thought of or talked about or even recognized

35:51.680 --> 35:57.200
without concepts to cut it up out of the rest of everything else that's just one interpretation of

35:57.200 --> 36:02.320
what's going on but don't worry about it too much right now we're just trying to grasp this idea

36:02.320 --> 36:09.440
that we're actually contributing to what we observe anyway so the framework idea for lewis

36:09.440 --> 36:16.080
are systems of categories by which we mediate reality to ourselves for lewis these categories

36:16.080 --> 36:22.800
are almost as much as social product shaped by our society as language itself is this is kind of

36:22.800 --> 36:28.480
different from earlier contos categories appeared to be an attempt at more of a universal description

36:28.480 --> 36:34.480
of how the human mind must conceptualize reality in order to understand it but from lewis these

36:34.480 --> 36:40.560
categories are socially constructed from our social environment that you are in while lewis

36:40.560 --> 36:44.800
really didn't talk much about how this would mean that there could be different sets of categories

36:44.800 --> 36:50.080
therefore he has acknowledged the possibility on occasion and we can see that different categories

36:50.080 --> 36:55.440
would mean that the world as it appears to us would be different in a sense according to different

36:55.520 --> 37:00.960
societies if a different society can lead to different categories that leads to different

37:00.960 --> 37:07.520
ways the world appears to us as at least what we can say about what we observe peaking out or even

37:07.520 --> 37:12.720
recognizing only certain things we have the concepts our society has provided to pick out or

37:12.720 --> 37:21.280
recognize but anyway there is no unmediated access to reality itself and the only curbs on the system

37:21.280 --> 37:27.200
of categories would be pragmatic ones for lewis so possibly having different sets of socially

37:27.200 --> 37:34.400
constructed categories that's what ogready calls lewis's framework idea a presentation of the world

37:34.400 --> 37:41.920
comes with it a certain set of categories from which it was processed a framework now let's move to

37:42.080 --> 37:43.120
rudolf karnab

37:49.600 --> 37:54.880
sharing a lot of the same sources with lewis german philosopher rudolf karnab articulated

37:54.880 --> 38:01.360
his framework idea of linguistic frameworks that was super relativistic he was also influenced

38:01.360 --> 38:07.760
by kant thinking that our knowledge is a result of some kind of processing and shared the idea of

38:07.840 --> 38:14.720
pragmatic value of applying one's knowledge but he was also influenced much by science as that

38:14.720 --> 38:21.600
which constitute actual knowledge and as a force therefore to get rid of metaphysical and theological

38:21.600 --> 38:27.680
fake knowledge this is a kind of deflationist view of philosophy where instead of talking about

38:27.680 --> 38:34.960
things like truth and reality philosophies suggest clarify meanings for scientists doing that too

38:34.960 --> 38:40.160
may have seemed itself another discussion of philosophical truths but when it came to certain

38:40.160 --> 38:46.480
things in philosophy like what is really real these kind of questions seemed unanswerable

38:46.480 --> 38:51.120
in a way that questions and science could be answered so instead philosophers should just

38:51.120 --> 38:57.440
focus on investigating and creating these models which are like languages and systems where one

38:57.440 --> 39:02.960
can calculate and identify things with clear meanings logical implications and criteria for

39:02.960 --> 39:09.040
confirmation so that scientists can then go on and actually do the research using these models

39:09.840 --> 39:15.360
this was to deflate philosophical questions into merely practical choices of which model

39:15.360 --> 39:22.400
scientists wanted to use so central to karnab's project is this notion of frameworks frameworks

39:22.400 --> 39:28.800
for karnab outline all the rules using the terms and relations between the terms so number terms

39:28.800 --> 39:33.920
can be introduced and have a relationship or rules based on that relationship within the

39:33.920 --> 39:40.240
framework of math let's say so for example in my interpretation of this it means that five seven

39:40.240 --> 39:46.240
and two within the framework of math five has a relationship to seven being a difference of two

39:46.240 --> 39:52.480
you can add two to five and get seven or subtract two from seven and get five those terms have a

39:52.480 --> 39:58.720
relationship and they are clear in the framework of math relative to that framework questions about

39:58.720 --> 40:04.160
numbers are easy these kind of questions about the relationships like what is nine plus eight

40:04.720 --> 40:10.160
they are internal questions questions that presuppose the existence of such a framework

40:10.160 --> 40:16.480
to get an answer relative to the framework internal questions are uncontroversially

40:16.480 --> 40:23.040
answerable and there are different frameworks to discuss different kinds of things physical objects

40:23.040 --> 40:31.520
properties or spatial temporal objects do numbers really exist do properties really exist

40:32.080 --> 40:37.840
karnab calls these external questions because they are outside the context of a linguistic

40:37.840 --> 40:44.880
framework such questions are improper because the choice of framework is pragmatically decided on

40:44.880 --> 40:50.400
if it is useful to speak of numbers then such a framework will be used if it is useful to speak

40:50.400 --> 40:56.400
of properties then that framework will be used the only appropriate external questions are ones

40:56.400 --> 41:02.720
about the expediency of using a framework or not so pretty much within this linguistic frameworks

41:02.720 --> 41:08.960
questions are answered easily within the structure of that framework but to try to step outside of

41:08.960 --> 41:15.600
framework and discuss it itself the only meaningful question here is if that framework is useful us

41:15.600 --> 41:22.960
to use right now or not but still this can lead to a huge number of frameworks so karnab points to

41:22.960 --> 41:29.600
a kind of natural selection akin to biology to how we come to use particular ones reducing how

41:29.600 --> 41:35.600
varied they can be but even with natural selection there's still a lot open here for relativists

41:35.600 --> 41:41.440
but let's leave that there for now karnab will come up again in the battle and we will cover

41:41.440 --> 41:49.280
again sort of what the idea is so anyway that's what ogready calls karnab's framework idea and now

41:49.280 --> 41:52.320
for lw Ludwig Wittgenstein

41:59.520 --> 42:05.360
he's probably the most important developer of framework ideas of the 20th century and is well

42:05.360 --> 42:10.880
known for making two influential philosophies whoa wait a minute uh so to be honest with you

42:10.880 --> 42:16.160
i do not think this section is very good at explaining what Wittgenstein's framework idea

42:16.160 --> 42:23.040
is even less so than any of the other philosophers the framework idea of language games has less

42:23.040 --> 42:28.320
time devoted to it than the other things and yet it's very important to grasp this idea in particular

42:28.320 --> 42:33.920
especially considering ogready himself thinks he's the most important contributor to it but also it

42:33.920 --> 42:38.880
could be very helpful for us in the future as well so i want to make clear it's not that

42:38.880 --> 42:44.080
paul ogready has gotten wittgenstein wrong in this section or that ogready cannot do a better job at

42:44.080 --> 42:49.440
explaining him or isn't so much smarter than me but that this particular section doesn't really

42:49.440 --> 42:55.280
explain what a language game really is and how it leads to the other points that ogready brings up

42:55.280 --> 43:01.920
so i will do that myself explain it in a separate video a video that's just off the cuff you know

43:01.920 --> 43:07.920
not cited from the top of my head just me trying to explain with examples what language games are

43:07.920 --> 43:12.320
and how it connects to the points that ogready is going to be bringing up for the purposes of

43:12.320 --> 43:17.840
just getting the idea out there to move on but hey maybe it could also be a great standalone video

43:17.840 --> 43:22.240
if you've kind of forgotten what wittgenstein's language games were kind of about at least until

43:22.240 --> 43:27.840
i do make a proper video since we definitely will get into wittgenstein properly one day and i promise

43:27.840 --> 43:33.760
to give away all my secret stash of important citation everything cited down to the line like

43:33.760 --> 43:38.480
i normally do you know even back to his blue and brown books where we will find a cheat code

43:39.120 --> 43:44.880
okay but for now let's see what ogready does say anyway ogready tells us that wittgenstein had two

43:44.880 --> 43:49.920
influential philosophies one presented in his tractatis logical philosophicus that articulates

43:49.920 --> 43:55.440
what essentially language is you know its essence and the picturing relation between language and

43:55.440 --> 44:01.200
reality now ogready doesn't say what he thinks wittgenstein said is the essence of language

44:01.200 --> 44:05.920
but i think it's simply that it has this picturing relationship that language is that

44:05.920 --> 44:10.480
which corresponds to reality like a picture does with words and a proposition having the

44:10.480 --> 44:15.360
same relationship to each other as the objects that they pick out or stand for in the world

44:15.360 --> 44:20.080
the other philosophy later in life his latter philosophy is presented in his philosophical

44:20.080 --> 44:24.240
investigations and it actually critiques a lot of what was said in that first account

44:24.240 --> 44:29.440
rejecting the idea that language has a particular essence and that philosophy shouldn't focus on

44:29.440 --> 44:34.960
advancing theses but be a kind of therapy to help clarify language instead of having a single

44:34.960 --> 44:40.720
determinant language language is comprised of many language games now i'm just gonna read like six

44:40.720 --> 44:46.400
lines and tell you what i think of them a language game is a complex whole of verbal usage and

44:46.400 --> 44:52.640
associated activities words simply don't label or stand for objects but relate to each other and

44:52.640 --> 44:57.920
the world in highly complex ways words are like tools there are many different kinds performing

44:57.920 --> 45:02.960
many different kinds of activities therefore there are many different language games and many

45:02.960 --> 45:07.680
different associated forms of life the kinds of activities associated with the language game

45:07.680 --> 45:12.800
the language games are governed by grammatical rules rules of grammar prescribe the modes of

45:12.800 --> 45:23.520
representation by which the world is represented to us oh super clear isn't it no look i don't

45:23.600 --> 45:28.080
think old grady is wrong but only because i actually studied vikenshine but also i haven't

45:28.080 --> 45:33.120
forgotten what's wrong with talking about vikenshine like this in part because i haven't forgotten

45:33.120 --> 45:38.720
what it was like as a young philosopher that was unfamiliar i think this could to someone less

45:38.720 --> 45:45.360
familiar make vikenshine seem complicated or even mystical in some sense neither of which is true

45:45.360 --> 45:51.280
the last lines in particular could seem to imply something radical like what you say changes the

45:51.280 --> 45:57.920
world itself that reality as commonly taken is literally changing when you change what you say

45:57.920 --> 46:02.880
that's kind of extreme if you think about that kind of picture and not at all what vikenshine's

46:02.880 --> 46:09.040
about though it's hard to say but also to deny what vikenshine's actual metaphysical position

46:09.040 --> 46:14.880
really is because he himself won't do that since his philosophy aims to stop speaking metaphysically

46:14.880 --> 46:20.400
in such a manner in the first place but if you insist to be unfaithful to his philosophy there

46:20.400 --> 46:25.040
is still a cheat code in the blue and brown books like i said that i can give you later so subscribe

46:26.400 --> 46:32.320
in any case i can imagine someone reading this and just feeling like oh whatever just another

46:32.320 --> 46:37.520
philosopher using a bunch of words together to obfuscate their position to appear deep and

46:37.520 --> 46:43.120
complicated but it's just vague nonsense jargon so this is why i believe my video becomes necessary

46:43.120 --> 46:48.800
for anyone who hasn't studied vikenshine's language games already because you're not going to get a

46:48.800 --> 46:53.360
good sense of it from ogready despite what it may seem like other actual philosophers say

46:53.360 --> 46:57.920
for someone new and not familiar with the kind of concepts that philosophers use all the time

46:57.920 --> 47:03.440
this really isn't easy text and i definitely think kirks book was probably much more palatable to

47:03.440 --> 47:07.840
somebody new in any case there are a couple of more things that ogready does point out about

47:07.840 --> 47:12.880
language games vikenshine's framework idea that are important so let's cover them ogready points

47:12.880 --> 47:17.760
out three things and two of them are that vikenshine emphasized that it was important

47:17.760 --> 47:23.520
not to conflate one language game with another or to think that there are super language games

47:23.520 --> 47:29.760
that govern all others ogready also points out that there is a quite popular use of vikenshine's

47:29.760 --> 47:35.840
idea was to try to defend religious belief against rationalistic critique by claiming that religion

47:35.840 --> 47:41.520
is its own language game and that it is illicit to use criteria from another language game usually

47:41.520 --> 47:47.680
science to challenge it but as it is always really important to point out this is not to say that

47:47.680 --> 47:53.680
vikenshine himself espoused such views again as i said that he didn't mean and likely didn't want

47:53.680 --> 47:59.040
his philosophy to be used by extreme relativists especially considering how he was trying to be

47:59.040 --> 48:05.200
anti-philosophy in his own way but his views lent themselves to such use ogready then talks about

48:05.200 --> 48:09.760
how in uncertainty vikenshine's latest writings that vikenshine does seem to have this image of

48:09.760 --> 48:15.360
a riverbed with a bedrock below to kind of represent even how in a language game there are

48:15.360 --> 48:20.800
beliefs that we are willing to change more easily and fluidly and some more deeply entrenched which

48:20.800 --> 48:27.120
are likely bedrock at the bottom of a river but that even those can change just at a much slower

48:27.120 --> 48:32.720
rate ogready brings us up to kind of say how it's this bedrock beliefs that are the framework upon

48:32.720 --> 48:39.360
which the fluid beliefs depend and that this for ogready is also used to say the framework may alter

48:39.360 --> 48:44.640
and indeed there may be alternative frameworks but really he didn't need to bring that up at all i

48:44.640 --> 48:48.560
think the fact that there are different language games is enough to see how vikenshine's philosophy

48:48.560 --> 48:53.200
empowers the relativists in fact as far as i have seen the issue of whether the bedrock can change

48:53.200 --> 48:57.440
from within a language game isn't a discussion that the relativists using this weapon even bother

48:57.440 --> 49:01.680
with it's seemingly to me always a discussion about how there are differing language games but

49:01.680 --> 49:06.000
maybe i'm missing something as to why he felt this was important to bring up i mean i guess there's

49:06.000 --> 49:10.480
another argument to how there can be different frameworks but really the language game argument

49:10.480 --> 49:15.520
not the bedrocks can change argument is ultimately what's taken to be the power that is imbued into

49:15.520 --> 49:23.200
this weapon from vikenshine now i do wish ogready would have done don't think look more which is

49:23.200 --> 49:27.600
give more examples for us to actually look at in many places in his book but as i said in the

49:27.600 --> 49:31.680
beginning of the video paul ogready does seem to be more concerned with pointing out the sources of

49:31.680 --> 49:36.080
the powers of this weapon rather than actually explaining what the sources are which is why i

49:36.080 --> 49:40.640
said i would try to hopefully fill that gap and bear that responsibility myself so again please

49:40.640 --> 49:45.600
do go check out that video that i will be making i will definitely be more clearly explaining what

49:45.600 --> 49:51.520
the idea of a language game is and i will explain why we would be against the idea of a super language

49:51.520 --> 49:56.560
game and why we shouldn't mix language games as well as how these kind of vikenshinean philosophers

49:56.560 --> 50:01.840
may be in a tight spot sometimes if one is trying to stay faithful to his philosophy while explaining

50:02.400 --> 50:06.880
anyway please check out that video so now i'm going to give things back to ogready who will

50:06.880 --> 50:21.280
talk about w v quine w v quine was one of the earliest to popularize the phrase conceptual

50:21.280 --> 50:27.840
scheme the conceptual scheme is revisable but there is no neutral position to talk about the

50:27.840 --> 50:33.920
world is to apply some conceptual scheme to it from childhood growing up we learn the conceptual

50:33.920 --> 50:41.120
scheme and as we learn more the conceptual scheme gets refined and right now science is the best

50:41.120 --> 50:48.160
as the most inclusive scheme that covers everything that exists it is the best to understand the world

50:48.160 --> 50:55.280
and predict changes in it but borrowing the term language game from vikenshine quine says that there

50:55.280 --> 51:01.520
are other kinds of language use for poetry or fiction for example and they are used to see the

51:01.520 --> 51:07.440
world in a different way imaginary worlds so of course they'd have different conceptual schemes

51:07.440 --> 51:14.480
which is fine but what if it's the same world like the real world can we nevertheless have

51:14.480 --> 51:20.320
different conceptual schemes well it seems there's enough in quine to say yeah for sure

51:20.960 --> 51:27.040
for example he believes that all beliefs can in fact be changed that none are unchangeable

51:27.040 --> 51:33.520
and absolute that there are no a priori beliefs for quine but what that even means could use some

51:33.520 --> 51:38.480
further detail but it's in a different chapter that again i'm not sure if i'm gonna cover

51:39.040 --> 51:46.400
but also he did believe in under determination of theory by fact which is to say that any set

51:46.400 --> 51:52.800
amount of evidence could support more than one theory so with my famous example i used in the

51:52.800 --> 51:58.800
map of philosophy of science video check it out if you have time there i used an example of dots

51:58.800 --> 52:04.880
on a graph that i give with the dots representing observations or even what counts as evidence

52:04.880 --> 52:10.640
for any certain amount of dots can support more than one theory of what the shape the dots are

52:10.640 --> 52:17.760
making and in fact no amount of dots will ever fully guarantee only one shape or theory that

52:17.760 --> 52:24.400
could fit it so it would be like quine does believe that even in dealing with the real world

52:24.400 --> 52:30.960
people could nevertheless have different conceptual schemes these two things that all our beliefs

52:30.960 --> 52:36.480
can change so our conceptual scheme can change and that we can have different theories based off the

52:36.480 --> 52:42.880
same observation thus different conceptual schemes while based in the real world would make quine

52:42.880 --> 52:48.480
fertile ground for relativists but we'll talk later in chapter three whether that's actually

52:48.480 --> 52:55.360
his position or not chapter three chapter three whoa okay so we can stop with that look i don't

52:55.360 --> 53:02.960
know we're really gonna be covering that what okay fine we'll see anyway ogready is calling quine's

53:02.960 --> 53:08.800
conceptual scheme which is like our best theory of the world that we use to make sense of the world

53:08.800 --> 53:18.240
which can change and can be different quine's framework idea now finally drop that coon hold on

53:22.080 --> 53:31.440
a philosopher and historian uh science ts coon helped relativists in a big way his notion of paradigms

53:31.440 --> 53:39.040
not paradigms became influential well beyond philosophy of science a paradigm is a context

53:39.040 --> 53:44.720
within which scientific inquiry proceeds like assumptions training methods standards goals

53:44.720 --> 53:50.480
methods of experimentation again ogready doesn't provide examples even in places where they would

53:50.480 --> 53:56.560
be super helpful but i would just say maybe it would be helpful to imagine a newtonian paradigm

53:56.560 --> 54:03.200
let's say versus an einsteinian paradigm you know a paradigm of relativity or now say a quantum

54:03.200 --> 54:09.360
physics paradigm they characterize a scientific community at a stable period but a crisis can

54:09.360 --> 54:15.920
happen that lead to a new paradigm the paradigms themselves though are supposedly incommensurable

54:15.920 --> 54:22.560
paradigms create their own context within which it rationally operates so one can't rationally

54:22.560 --> 54:28.480
judge or decide between them here's where i think there's some leftover blood soaked soil of the

54:28.480 --> 54:34.400
positivists that have us thinking of it like that which i mentioned in that map episode but yeah

54:34.400 --> 54:40.880
think of it as in that evidence is interpreted through a paradigm so then it isn't evidence

54:40.880 --> 54:47.760
that's actually deciding between paradigms we can't evaluate the evidence without a paradigm first

54:47.760 --> 54:53.920
so each paradigm judges itself and one cannot judge a paradigm from another based on evidence

54:53.920 --> 55:01.840
itself now i have actually created two videos on coon already one video is coon's response in his

55:01.840 --> 55:08.000
own words to those that contrast him with his predecessor the great champion carl popper so

55:08.000 --> 55:14.640
it gives i think a decent outline of what coon's position is but also i made a video explaining

55:14.640 --> 55:21.360
in much more detail how it is specifically his philosophy that allowed these relativists therefore

55:21.360 --> 55:28.400
to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science using his philosophy of paradigm shifts

55:28.400 --> 55:35.680
and crises if you're interested please check them out the second video can be a bit spooky it's

55:35.680 --> 55:41.920
called the gates of hell but uh i'm just being dramatic don't worry hell isn't really involved

55:41.920 --> 55:47.840
in any case it's these philosophers that are the big names of whose philosophies are similar

55:47.840 --> 55:54.400
enough in terms of a framework idea to be pressed into a single weapon and a nearly supremely

55:54.400 --> 56:01.360
powerful position the relativist takes wielding this great weapon framework ideas from them

56:01.360 --> 56:06.560
developed from very different places of the world and was one of the three big trends that brought

56:07.040 --> 56:12.960
this weapon into the modern philosophic battle according to a gradient but i think he is missing

56:12.960 --> 56:17.360
a couple of other things namely that there's also a lot of scientific discoveries that led

56:17.360 --> 56:23.840
to similar beliefs about how what we perceive isn't objective reality that it is shaped by the type of

56:23.840 --> 56:29.440
creatures that we are with the faculties that we have brain science shows all the ways we filter

56:29.440 --> 56:35.360
out non-essential information and what counts as essential again has to do with our evolved histories

56:35.360 --> 56:40.320
as human beings again such as what kind of colors we can see in the light spectrum and even many

56:40.320 --> 56:44.960
people's beliefs and interpretation of what quantum physics supposedly shows us evidence for

56:44.960 --> 56:51.120
that our act of observing itself affects the observed not that i believe that interpretation

56:51.120 --> 56:55.920
but it is one that many more people have been taking on because of quantum physics of course

56:55.920 --> 57:02.000
though ogready is talking about philosophy but i do think philosophical conversation is obviously

57:02.000 --> 57:07.760
being influenced by discoveries and technological advancement in science in modern times as much

57:07.760 --> 57:13.600
as it was in his own little history lesson given to us here describing the separation of nature and

57:13.600 --> 57:28.720
morals the battle so we may find ourselves up against an enemy wielding this weapon in an extreme

57:29.440 --> 57:34.560
let's say because we are endorsing the use of science to decide on the role of vaccines the

57:34.560 --> 57:39.680
reality of global warming or the age of the earth we can actually believe that this position of

57:39.680 --> 57:44.720
wielding this weapon to an extreme degree of thinking everything is relative was created not

57:44.720 --> 57:50.480
because they are evil and want to attack science we may believe that they are actually sincere in

57:50.480 --> 57:56.640
their honest virtuous morals of pursuing tolerance and open-mindedness of people of different perspectives

57:56.640 --> 58:02.560
and a weary of western imperialist thinking of having used claims of rationality and logic and

58:02.560 --> 58:08.080
scientific advancement as a reason to oppress and invalidate others of non-western belief systems

58:08.080 --> 58:15.040
but of course it's that same extreme position that can be used to defend attacks from science

58:15.040 --> 58:21.280
against the intolerant abusive tyrannical belief systems that will say science is just relative

58:21.280 --> 58:27.280
so it cannot be used to attack their abusive beliefs that aren't grounded in reality but dogma

58:27.280 --> 58:33.040
and deep rooted insecurities like misogyny or homophobia so taking this weapon as if it were

58:33.040 --> 58:38.640
infinitely powerful isn't in the best interest of even those who are primordially interested in a

58:38.640 --> 58:44.720
more tolerant social world and there is real-world evidence cases about this but we'll talk about

58:44.720 --> 58:52.080
them later in any case we as good warriors on the philosophic battlefield should wonder how

58:52.080 --> 58:56.480
if i do come up against an enemy wielding this weapon to an extreme degree enough to attack

58:56.480 --> 59:02.320
science claims to truth or rationality let's say then how am i supposed to beat them when i want

59:02.320 --> 59:07.280
to say something is science when i want to say something is the truth when i want to say something

59:07.280 --> 59:13.440
makes rational sense so think about it against this enemy i cannot just take something out of my

59:13.520 --> 59:20.640
pocket and say see this is the objective thing here it's not relative because everything i say

59:21.520 --> 59:28.880
is merely relative to a language game i can't show any evidence either because evidence is relative

59:28.880 --> 59:36.800
to a paradigm and i can't even show any observation of anything because all observations are structured

59:36.800 --> 59:42.880
relative to our conceptual scheme there isn't anything i can produce anything i can offer

59:42.880 --> 59:49.120
that cannot be attacked by this enemy so it's difficult to figure out how can i beat this

59:49.120 --> 59:55.120
enemy when they can attack anything i show them if i say objects or reality they can even say

59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.160
that those are just in fact words relative to a language game even if i try to be very clear that

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.320
i mean mind independent reality they can still attack that and say whatever mind independent

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.840
reality even means is structured by a conceptual scheme tied to particular social groups that

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.680
make use of such conceptual structures thus hastily concluding that reality is relative

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.400
so yes it is incredibly frustrating trying to deal with this kind of enemy who will continually

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:31.360
attack constantly so i want you to remember this situation facing an enemy that will always attack

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.160
no matter what is shown how can you win think of it for yourself first do you see a way we could

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.040
deal with this kind of enemy can you come up with a cool move or a counter think about it

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.080
before we get to the next video where we'll cover what paul o'grady does on the battlefield

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:55.280
choosing specific areas to defend against charges of relativism this weapon however made by philosophers

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.760
is being wielded to attack science not by philosophers themselves but by sociologists

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.840
who used kuhn to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science in order to attack it

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:14.320
and these sociologists do not understand this weapon well enough to grasp the dangers if it is

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.200
used as if unlimited they only know its power to attack the attempt to speak with authority

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.080
not the limits which we unlike them will learn in the next videos once we learn that this weapon

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.360
does in fact have limits and the dangers that happens when those limits are crossed we will

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.640
then return back to the battlefield of the philosophy of science where they had these

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.320
science wars the battlefield from where i came in this journey and then we will take on this

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:51.680
particular group of sociologists that are attacking science are those influenced by them called the ssk

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:58.240
who started the science wars so if you would like an account of what led to the science wars and who

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:05.120
are these ssk please watch my video voodoo sociology as paulo grady now prepares for battle

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:11.760
himself against this extreme relativist presented in the next video one that attempts to make a

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:25.280
few attacks on objectivity by proclaiming that even truth is relative
