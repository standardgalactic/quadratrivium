0	7000	Philosophy Battle, the most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet, probably.
7000	13000	Now, entering the battlefield of metaphysics.
13000	17000	Hey everyone, my name is AJ and welcome to Philosophy Battle.
17000	25000	Before this video starts, I want to make clear this video will introduce ontology, what it is and to what degree it can be relative.
25000	30000	It is after all important to investigate because it matters if there are actual legitimate grounds
30000	36000	as to why someone might say we live in different worlds so you can't support or criticize one another.
36000	40000	Like, how exactly do we live in different worlds?
40000	44000	And how extreme can that claim actually be meant?
44000	50000	But it will actually lead us into an exciting discussion about realism and anti-realism in philosophy.
50000	52000	Trust me, it's gonna be awesome.
52000	57000	It's one of my favorite things to talk about in philosophy, so I may be a little bit theatrical at times.
57000	62000	We will be discussing pre and post Kantian views and well, it can be treacherous grounds,
62000	68000	so if you don't get certain parts or get lost or don't know what's going on, don't worry about it too much.
68000	75000	Just be patient as it could very well be cleared up later and the point at the end will be made pretty clear, at least I think so.
75000	82000	The video is generally covering the discussion as it is presented in a book of a philosopher, Paul O'Grady, a pretty recent work
82000	87000	because I felt his book has a lot of great and interesting battles in it as well as some important lessons for us.
87000	94000	Now, I may end up saying this again a little bit later after I do a sort of recap into the video, so forgive me if this is repeated,
94000	101000	but if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having here, that's okay.
101000	108000	You don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to, even if I'm suggesting another video in this video.
108000	118000	Just take it more as a signpost, even an important signpost possibly if you want more information if I suggest other videos at various points, which I will.
118000	130000	I believe this will be a good video regardless for introducing one of the main problems in metaphysics about ontology or even in philosophy itself, so let's start the video.
132000	135000	Ontological Relativism
135000	137000	What is it and why are we talking about it?
137000	146000	Well, ontology is a field of study under the branch of philosophy called metaphysics, so we're doing philosophy and we're having a metaphysical discussion.
146000	148000	A discussion about what though?
148000	156000	Ontology is a discussion about what there is, what kind of things exist in the world and what the world is fundamentally made of
156000	159000	or what kind of properties are a part of the world.
159000	165000	So for example, believing there is only matter in the world that the world is just made up of matter only.
165000	167000	That's your ontological position.
167000	176000	Or if you think the world is made up of ideas, which includes these senses, you know, like the sense of touch and the sense of color, the sense of smells and so on.
176000	181000	All of these just being ideas coming to your mind and so the world is just that.
181000	186000	The world is just made up of ideas and maybe minds that give and receive ideas.
186000	189000	That would be an idealist ontology.
189000	197000	Or even if your view of the world is that there's earth and there's heaven and hell, that too is your ontological position.
197000	201000	A position about what there is in the world, what exists.
201000	206000	Though that has some religious connotations and we're not discussing religious views here.
206000	208000	This is not about religion.
208000	211000	We're just having a discussion about what there is in the world.
211000	216000	And this conception seems to have a view that the world has different planes of existence.
216000	222000	Perhaps for someone it's not about heaven and earth, but about universal forms and particular manifestations of that.
222000	226000	All of these fit within the field of ontology.
226000	234000	So perhaps in some sense, if we can just crudely say epistemology is about knowledge, then ontology would be about the world.
234000	236000	Or reality.
236000	242000	While people may have different views about what the world is fundamentally made of or what kind of structure reality really has,
242000	249000	our question today is about whether the world or reality is relative.
249000	257000	Now we commonly already are relativists about a number of things, not just things like taste in music or preference in Pokemon.
257000	264000	But even in descriptions of physical things, like things being big, such descriptions are known to be relative.
264000	267000	The bird is big compared to the ant.
267000	270000	But compared to the tree, it's not.
270000	273000	The tree is actually big compared to the bird.
273000	276000	But compared to the mountain, it's not.
276000	280000	The mountain is actually big compared to the tree.
280000	281000	And so on.
281000	284000	Big is a relative description.
284000	290000	In fact, if you imagine this self illuminated cube were the only thing in the universe, nothing else,
290000	293000	not even the edges of the screen as you look at it,
293000	298000	then there's no way of knowing if it's big or small.
298000	304000	Without anything to compare it to, calling it big is meaningless.
304000	305000	An empty idea.
305000	311000	And so there's no point here in talking about it like it could even be considered big.
311000	316000	So what if the world, reality itself, is relative?
316000	319000	What if our ontology is relative?
319000	322000	Wait, relative to what?
322000	327000	Well, guess what, we actually came here to the battlefield of metaphysics
327000	333000	just to discuss the power and limits of this philosophic weapon called relativism.
333000	334000	Why?
334000	339000	Because we actually came from the battlefield of the philosophy of science,
339000	344000	where we had encountered some enemies wielding this weapon to extreme degrees.
344000	349000	So because of that, I thought it would be beneficial to come here to the battlefield of metaphysics
349000	351000	just to dismantle this weapon.
351000	354000	To show its power and limits.
354000	356000	So while there are a few books I may cover,
356000	362000	currently I'm covering this topic mostly based on the writings of philosopher Paul O'Grady
362000	365000	in this green book called relativism.
365000	371000	In his book, he covers a variety of different philosophic areas to discuss relativism.
371000	375000	He's not going to be discussing ethics or morals, you know, what's right and wrong,
375000	378000	or aesthetics, like what counts as beautiful.
378000	384000	But he's more interested in cognitive things like truth and reality and knowledge
384000	387000	if even those things can be considered relative.
387000	392000	So after explaining the power of relativism, which is a wickedly powerful weapon,
392000	397000	he then goes on to defend against relativization in two areas.
397000	402000	He battles against relativization on truth and on rationality.
402000	408000	So I made a video covering his first chapter that I phrase as covering the power of relativism.
408000	410000	That's my phrasing though.
410000	413000	And I would really insist that you watch that video,
413000	418000	especially before thinking that one can just offhand dismiss this enemy.
418000	422000	If you think it's obvious or evident that relativism is wrong for any reason,
422000	426000	I put a lot of work into this video and I think you should definitely check it out
426000	431000	because it will definitely pay for any good philosopher who wants to conceptually grip
431000	436000	what the issue really is in order to understand the power of this weapon.
436000	442000	Not just in the sense to be able to dismantle our enemy to point out the flaws in their strategy,
442000	446000	but also as a weapon to be wielded by us ourselves
446000	451000	in order to challenge anywhere that there are baseless assumptions of objectivity
451000	454000	or naive thoughts about what's obvious and evident.
454000	460000	On the other hand, this weapon does have limits that our enemies did not appear to be aware of.
460000	464000	The dangers of thinking everything is relative.
464000	468000	So we already covered the great and totally awesome battle
468000	472000	where Paul O'Grady defended truth against relativism.
472000	474000	And please go check out that video.
474000	477000	It's definitely one of my favorite battles of all time
477000	483000	and certainly has important lessons that can go along with us in our philosophic journey forever, probably, I don't know.
483000	488000	But he did also use a kind of principle of logic in order to make that defense
488000	495000	and so it kind of made sense that in that first chapter he did also talk about whether logic itself can be relative.
495000	499000	So I guess I also therefore thought important to cover that topic
499000	502000	and made a video discussing logic itself.
502000	508000	Logic in the way that philosophers or logicians or kind of I guess also mathematicians know it.
508000	513000	This is looking at formal symbolic logic and really offers a much more in-depth understanding
513000	517000	of what logic is than the common person or lay person does.
517000	522000	It certainly goes beyond the mere rhetoric of political pundits online, for example.
522000	526000	There, however, Paul O'Grady did actually allow relativism
526000	529000	that we did seem to accept relativism in logic
529000	532000	but only in terms of a lower order.
532000	535000	That there seemed to be a higher order and a lower one
535000	539000	in the higher order there still seems to have maintained certain principles of logic
539000	542000	of which hasn't truly been argued for yet.
542000	547000	It will be argued for in that chapter 5, the next battle.
547000	550000	So I wanted to skip to that rationality battle
550000	553000	because I only came here to the battlefield of metaphysics
553000	556000	to discuss the power and limits of this weapon.
556000	560000	Having already covered the power, I only wanted to cover the limits
560000	564000	the places where he defends clearly against relativization.
564000	568000	But I kind of noticed that in that area of rationality
568000	572000	Paul O'Grady does seem to have certain strategies and techniques
572000	575000	that make reference to these previous chapters.
575000	579000	So it would leave something wanting if I didn't at least somehow explain
579000	582000	what's going on in these other areas.
582000	587000	So I thought it important to at least kind of cover what's happening over here
587000	591000	since it is part of his strategy in rationality.
591000	595000	But this video is going to be way different from what I normally do.
595000	598000	You see normally I cite everything I say down to the line
598000	601000	when I'm covering some philosophers writing.
601000	605000	But today I'm not really going to be covering Paul O'Grady that closely.
605000	610000	I'm just going to give a more general description of what's going on in ontology in some way.
610000	614000	So it's going to be much less structured and less scripted
614000	617000	since there's not much citation that I'm going to be giving anymore.
617000	620000	You see that kind of line to line citation that I was giving before
620000	623000	actually provided some kind of order and script
623000	626000	even though I don't ever use a kind of proper script
626000	630000	the kind of citation was still giving me a kind of order for my videos.
630000	634000	But without it this is much less scripted than my normal videos
634000	636000	so forgive me for that.
636000	640000	But nevertheless I will still try to present sort of what his framing
640000	644000	of the main battles and the main issues are in this chapter
644000	646000	as he presents it kind of.
646000	649000	Though I will still be clear about certain things that are framed in his way
649000	651000	versus things that are framed from me.
651000	655000	I'm just not actually going to be covering either of these chapters
655000	658000	like fully or in depth as I did the other battles
658000	661000	where the battles are happening that I'm interested in.
661000	665000	In any case I will come back to talk about this chapter maybe later
665000	668000	when I kind of finish off doing Paul O'Grady
668000	671000	and want to give a full evaluation of this book.
671000	675000	There's a reason why this chapter in particular is something that I might want to talk to
675000	678000	in more depth or detail in the future.
678000	680000	And I'll talk about what that reason is.
680000	686000	In any case the point of this video is just to generally cover ontological relativism
686000	688000	and the kind of issues that are happening here
688000	690000	the sort of battles that are going on
690000	692000	in the more modern type of take
692000	695000	both as O'Grady frames it and as I would
695000	700000	and then we'll just discuss where O'Grady lands on this issue going forward.
700000	704000	So if you don't know who O'Grady is or anyone else don't worry about it.
704000	707000	If you're here just to talk about ontological relativism
707000	709000	this video will still be very helpful
709000	713000	at least giving a kind of outlay of the kind of battle that's going on
713000	715000	and the different issues and different perspectives
715000	717000	that come to conflict with each other.
717000	718000	Okay?
718000	720000	Let's go.
720000	723000	As already discussed in the Power of Relativism episode
723000	727000	O'Grady points out a pre and post Kantian view
727000	730000	and don't let those words be spooky.
730000	732000	I'll explain them.
732000	735000	Basically back in the pre Kantian
735000	738000	or Kant days there was this kind of image
738000	741000	the idea that there was the world and us
741000	742000	or our mind
742000	744000	and we have beliefs and propositions
744000	746000	or observations about the world
746000	748000	the world as it is
748000	751000	so ontology was about that
751000	754000	the world that would be a certain way
754000	757000	even if we aren't there with our observations
757000	759000	beliefs or thoughts
759000	761000	so like the tree is here
761000	762000	not there
762000	765000	the mountain is denser than the clouds
765000	767000	et cetera et cetera
767000	770000	that the world independent of our minds is
770000	773000	and is a certain way
773000	775000	the world that would be that way
775000	778000	even if no humans existed
778000	781000	even if all species capable of having beliefs
781000	783000	and observations had gone extinct
783000	785000	the world in of itself
785000	787000	not relative to someone's perspective
787000	791000	would be there and be a certain way
791000	795000	so that's more of a pre Kantian kind of picture
795000	798000	and while we can all have different kind of ontological beliefs
798000	800000	about what that world is like
800000	803000	there still seem to be some agreement pre Kant
803000	806000	that that's what we were talking about
806000	808000	but then Kant came along
808000	810000	and he done messed that whole thing up
810000	813000	he changed the game for real
813000	815000	and now we have this new picture
815000	817000	where this world that we observe
817000	819000	that we have beliefs about
819000	822000	or thoughts of and make propositions about
822000	825000	is actually constructed in part by our minds
825000	828000	the mind by our categories of understanding
828000	830000	as Kant call them
830000	833000	needs to give shape to whatever it is that's out there
833000	836000	to make a world that is even understandable by us
836000	840000	in this sense we never directly observe reality itself
840000	843000	we can never really know in any way or form
843000	846000	what this outside stuff is
846000	848000	or anything about it
848000	851000	even possibly that it exists
851000	854000	so I represent it as this gray mush
854000	857000	but really I can't say it's gray
857000	859000	or say that it's mush
859000	862000	I can't really say anything at all
862000	864000	but I'm using this as a visual
864000	867000	just to show that the concepts of color or shape
867000	871000	that would come from us and our minds have not applied here
871000	875000	in fact Robert Kirk calls this cosmic porridge
875000	878000	and this is not that I or Kirk are advocating
878000	881000	that this is what reality really is
881000	886000	in fact Kirk argues against this cosmic porridge kind of picture
886000	890000	because as a realist we want there to be something
890000	894000	and that this something is a certain way
894000	897000	not that it's merely some indistinct gray mush
897000	900000	anyway we'll get back to that
900000	902000	you see Kant had these universal categories
902000	904000	that everyone's mind has
904000	908000	that structures the world as it is to us
908000	910000	as it must be to us
910000	913000	that ontology wasn't about the world
913000	915000	independent of the mind
915000	918000	but the world as it is known by us
918000	920000	as it is observed by us
920000	922000	for example when it comes to the understanding
922000	924000	of bodies actually existing in our world
924000	926000	we have this kind of structure of understanding
926000	930000	that a body must have extension in the three dimensions
931000	933000	and if it really is existing
933000	936000	perhaps extension within the fourth dimension of time as well
936000	939000	or perhaps we can think of it kind of like as a net
939000	942000	that applied from our mind results in producing
942000	945000	the kind of things that we have contact with
945000	948000	now those are different kind of takes about what's going on
948000	951000	but in general this is a post Kantian picture
951000	954000	however to have a better understanding about how it is
954000	957000	that our concepts or the structure of our mind
957000	960000	is actually structuring the world as we observe it
960000	963000	as we make sense of it or understand or think about it
963000	966000	please check out that power of relativism video
966000	968000	it will give a much more detailed discussion
968000	972000	about how the mind is in some sense constructing
972000	975000	and if perhaps you are just more specifically concerned
975000	977000	about science
977000	980000	you can maybe check out my video on the philosopher
980000	983000	and historian of science Thomas Kuhn
983000	986000	one video is his response to his predecessor Carl Popper
986000	989000	and the other one is a video I made
989000	992000	to explain how Kuhn's philosophy opened the gates
992000	995000	to those who wanted to bring this weapon
995000	998000	and make charges of relativism against even science
998000	1001000	so if you're kind of more interested in that sort of construction
1001000	1004000	and the kind of relativization of even observation
1004000	1007000	you can go check out those videos
1007000	1009000	however while we're here in ontology though
1009000	1011000	let's continue with our discussion
1011000	1014000	in this case the world that we can know, speak of
1014000	1017000	or observe is only one that can exist
1017000	1020000	within the framework of our conceptual scheme
1020000	1023000	or categories or paradigm
1023000	1026000	or any other name used to describe how it is that our mind
1026000	1030000	is constructing the meaning of the world as we observe it
1030000	1033000	we have no access to this outside stuff
1033000	1036000	and because of this depending on who you ask
1036000	1039000	not only does it make no sense to talk about
1039000	1041000	whatever the outside is
1041000	1044000	it doesn't even make sense to say it exists
1044000	1047000	and I know that sounds kind of strange
1047000	1050000	but because they are not holding onto
1050000	1054000	or even actively denying the idea of a mind-independent reality
1054000	1058000	they are considered anti-realists
1060000	1063000	and they are opposed by those who hold on
1063000	1066000	to the existence of a mind-independent reality
1066000	1069000	who are considered realists
1069000	1072000	and this is a battle that is near and dear to my heart
1072000	1075000	anyway we should note that because Kant held
1075000	1079000	according to him a more universal account of the categories
1079000	1082000	that is the kind of conceptual structure that structures
1082000	1085000	and gives meaning to the world as we observe or understand it
1085000	1089000	he nevertheless wasn't a relativist in that sense
1089000	1093000	however because other philosophers such as C.I. Lewis
1093000	1096000	and I would argue also resources from natural science
1096000	1099000	would hold that these categories that we have
1099000	1102000	or concepts and conceptual schemes that we use
1102000	1105000	in making the sense of the world as we know it
1105000	1108000	are also a product of a social, historical
1108000	1110000	and cultural background
1110000	1113000	meaning they could actually be different
1113000	1115000	for different people
1115000	1118000	different people in different times in different cultures
1118000	1121000	have very different concepts
1121000	1125000	and the world as it is relative to those different sense of concepts
1125000	1127000	would be different
1127000	1129000	our ontology
1129000	1132000	what the world in this sense is
1132000	1134000	is therefore relative
1134000	1137000	this is ontological relativism
1137000	1140000	under that previous sense of anti-realism
1140000	1143000	again so we're clear relativism here is that
1143000	1146000	because people can have different concepts
1146000	1148000	and different conceptual schemes
1148000	1152000	the world is different for everyone with a different conceptual scheme
1152000	1154000	and also importantly
1154000	1156000	that these different worlds
1156000	1160000	perhaps not in small part because they are anti-realists
1160000	1163000	cannot be reduced to each other
1163000	1167000	or that there is one correct world type of thing
1167000	1170000	that is the ontological relativist position
1170000	1172000	they cannot be reduced
1172000	1175000	and one is not more correct
1175000	1178000	since certainly at least according to their conception
1178000	1182000	there isn't exactly a mind independent reality
1182000	1184000	in order to appeal to
1184000	1186000	in order to say one is correct
1186000	1189000	so Ogrady presents the main battle in ontology
1189000	1191000	between these two positions
1191000	1193000	an anti-realist position
1193000	1195000	called the ontological relativist
1195000	1197000	and a realist position
1197000	1199000	called the sophisticated realist
1199000	1201000	both in some sense actually accept
1201000	1205000	and have moved on to a post-continent type of picture
1205000	1207000	the sophisticated realist
1207000	1210000	is a realist because they still want to hold on
1210000	1214000	that there is a mind independent reality or world
1214000	1217000	but they are actually unlikely naive realist
1217000	1222000	that was probably far more likely to exist in the pre-continent picture
1222000	1226000	a realist that believed there was only one theory
1226000	1228000	one could say that we have
1228000	1231000	that is of a mind independent reality
1231000	1234000	one theory that is the most correct one
1234000	1238000	or that other theories can be reduced to just one theory
1238000	1240000	for example in the old school
1240000	1244000	perhaps we may have thought that physics is the ultimate theory
1244000	1247000	other stuff whether psychology or sociology
1247000	1250000	everything can be reduced to physics
1250000	1253000	and physics being not merely about the world as we know it
1253000	1257000	but about a mind independent reality as well
1257000	1261000	that's not really a sophisticated realist position
1261000	1263000	in the post-continent picture however
1263000	1267000	the sophisticated realist holds that we can actually have
1267000	1269000	different theories of the world
1269000	1271000	based in part because they give a sense to the idea
1271000	1275000	how different conceptual schemes are giving meaning to the worlds
1275000	1276000	different worlds
1276000	1279000	so there would be different theories of the world
1279000	1283000	and yet one of those theories isn't considered the correct one
1283000	1285000	or most correct one
1285000	1289000	that they can all exist and yet not be reduced to each other
1289000	1293000	but they are still nevertheless about a mind independent reality
1293000	1297000	that exists and is a certain way
1297000	1299000	it has certain properties
1299000	1303000	that I guess they would say either is successfully or not conveyed
1303000	1306000	or somehow connected to those theories
1306000	1309000	and so somehow or other structure
1309000	1311000	or perhaps how Paulo Grady would phrase it
1311000	1315000	constraint on what our theories can even be
1315000	1317000	is coming in part from here as well
1317000	1320000	a mind independent reality
1320000	1322000	not just there
1322000	1324000	not just the mind
1324000	1327000	in this sense the sophisticated realist feels that they have
1327000	1329000	accommodated relativism
1329000	1332000	and how our conceptual seems construct what we know
1332000	1335000	but still are realist about reality
1335000	1339000	this in modern philosophic warfare is the main battle
1339000	1343000	happening in ontology as it is presented by Paulo Grady
1343000	1346000	a battle between the ontological relativist
1346000	1348000	and the sophisticated realist
1348000	1351000	while it may seem like the sophisticated realist
1351000	1353000	is actually pretty accommodating
1353000	1357000	the ontological relativist still being an anti-realist
1357000	1360000	denies the sophisticated realist position
1360000	1363000	saying there is no sense of the world beyond the mind
1363000	1367000	that it makes no sense to speak of it having properties
1367000	1369000	or being a certain way
1369000	1372000	because of course in order for something to be discussed
1372000	1374000	as being a certain way
1374000	1376000	having certain properties
1376000	1380000	only ever make sense within a conceptual scheme
1380000	1383000	it only makes sense if concepts are being applied
1383000	1387000	and if it is then we aren't actually talking about a mind
1387000	1389000	independent reality
1389000	1392000	also it seems to be that part of the ontological relativist point
1392000	1397000	is to say that if theories can in fact be different
1397000	1401000	and not reducible and that one theory isn't the most correct one
1401000	1406000	and what point also is there even mentioning that there is this thing
1406000	1409000	why bother bringing that up then
1409000	1413000	now this may seem super frustrating for those of us who are realists
1413000	1417000	but it's not like we didn't in some sense feel a similar way
1417000	1419000	when it came to big
1419000	1422000	remember talking about this cube as if it is big
1422000	1424000	makes no sense
1424000	1426000	it can't be called that
1426000	1427000	that's how we felt
1427000	1432000	so the ontological relativist may actually be equally frustrated with us
1432000	1436000	in insisting that reality is a certain way and has certain properties
1436000	1440000	as we might be with someone else who doesn't understand why this cube
1440000	1443000	that has nothing else to be compared to
1443000	1445000	cannot be described as big
1445000	1448000	since big is relative
1448000	1451000	the ontological relativist feel that all properties
1451000	1453000	or description, everything
1453000	1456000	is relative to a conceptual scheme
1456000	1458000	comes from a mind
1458000	1462000	and yet here we are trying to describe mind independent reality
1462000	1464000	with no conceptual scheme applied
1464000	1469000	yet still trying to say it has certain properties and is a certain way
1469000	1473000	that equally doesn't seem to have any meaning or have any sense
1473000	1476000	in the way that describing a cube as being big
1476000	1480000	when it's the only thing in existence seems to be meaningless
1480000	1482000	or like an empty idea
1482000	1484000	now as an aside note
1484000	1488000	there's also another reason that works for them in their perspective
1488000	1492000	not only is there this basis of how our conceptual scheme
1492000	1494000	is giving shape or constructing
1494000	1499000	or at least providing the schemata for which things can have meaning in the first place
1499000	1504000	but they also feel that this in some way helps them defend against skepticism
1504000	1507000	because one of the big issues in philosophy
1507000	1509000	is that despite what we claim to know
1509000	1513000	it's possible that no matter how much justification we have
1513000	1518000	that a mind independent reality could nevertheless be different
1518000	1521000	in more of a classic way of phrasing it
1521000	1525000	I guess we could say we could hold full justified belief
1525000	1527000	about what the truth is
1527000	1531000	and yet the truth could still nevertheless be different
1531000	1534000	hence we would not have knowledge
1534000	1537000	in fact that possibility is always the case
1537000	1541000	meaning we could never really know if we actually have knowledge or not
1541000	1543000	which is pretty skeptical
1543000	1548000	because a mind independent reality may always turn out different
1548000	1551000	now Kant thought something like this too
1551000	1555000	that he had somehow solved this kind of skeptical issue in some way
1555000	1558000	because when ontology is about this
1558000	1563000	then the possibility about being wrong of a mind independent reality
1563000	1568000	isn't really an issue for the anti-realist that drops that concept
1568000	1571000	but that isn't all that convincing to the realist
1571000	1573000	who would say dropping this
1573000	1575000	that we can ever know or understand it
1575000	1579000	or be in any way shape or form in contact with reality
1579000	1581000	is exactly skepticism
1581000	1583000	you haven't defeated it
1583000	1585000	you just given into it
1585000	1588000	so that isn't much of a motivator for a realist
1588000	1590000	but the ontological relativists say back
1590000	1594000	it's only not convincing because you are applying your unjustified view
1594000	1597000	about there being this thing
1597000	1599000	we didn't lose the world
1599000	1601000	we didn't lose objects
1601000	1602000	we didn't lose things
1602000	1604000	we don't deny reality exist
1604000	1608000	just that all those terms are about this
1608000	1612000	no words or terms or identifiers or symbols or anything
1612000	1616000	make sense about anything beyond this
1616000	1619000	a conceptual scheme or paradigm or language
1619000	1624000	is required for something to even make sense or have meaning
1624000	1628000	and so I find this is where most of the battle really is
1628000	1631000	about the frustration of trying to use terms
1631000	1636000	that are always nevertheless tied into this area for the ontological relativists
1636000	1638000	but I'll kind of show you what I mean
1638000	1640000	first it's important to note here
1640000	1643000	that for the ontological relativist in this sense
1643000	1646000	there is no division between epistemology
1646000	1647000	the study of knowledge
1647000	1649000	and ontology then
1649000	1654000	because the ontological relativists deny the division between mind and world
1654000	1657000	there is no world beyond the mind
1657000	1660000	and accusing the ontological relativists
1660000	1662000	of simply conflating the issues
1662000	1664000	of what we can know and understand
1664000	1666000	with issues about what exists
1666000	1669000	well, the ontological relativist points out that
1669000	1671000	that conflation only makes sense
1671000	1674000	because you had already presumed an ontological perspective
1674000	1678000	with a mind-world distinction in the first place
1678000	1680000	some realists would argue
1680000	1683000	well, we have a realist conception first
1683000	1686000	and that thereafter we actually need good reasons
1686000	1688000	to be able to switch to another ontology
1688000	1691000	and that there are no good reasons for that
1691000	1694000	but are we really ontological realists first?
1694000	1697000	I mean, common-day people aren't exactly philosophers
1697000	1701000	and also just the idea that it's first would eventually mean anything
1701000	1706000	as O'Grady says that doesn't actually cut much ice for philosophers
1706000	1708000	I've never actually heard that expression before
1708000	1710000	but I think it's super dope
1710000	1712000	oh, it doesn't cut much ice for philosophers
1712000	1714000	like, you know, I don't know
1714000	1715000	do philosophers cut ice?
1715000	1718000	I don't know what O'Grady is doing on his part-time
1718000	1721000	anyway, okay, so one of the main issues here
1721000	1725000	that I'm gonna describe is a big philosophic trouble actually
1725000	1727000	so please think of it yourself
1727000	1731000	and really try to grasp what the ontological relativist is saying here
1731000	1734000	because there is actually problems for both sides
1734000	1737000	because a problem for the sophisticated realist
1737000	1741000	is what exactly is coming from here
1741000	1744000	I mean, we want to say that the world is a certain way, right?
1744000	1746000	it has to be or have
1746000	1749000	and this is my phrasing to help explain it in the way I think of it
1749000	1753000	but it has to have some kind of information then
1753000	1756000	but the relativist for good reason says
1756000	1760000	information cannot exist without a language for it to be expressed within
1760000	1763000	and even the realist wants to recognize this
1763000	1767000	they want to be able to recognize that without a conceptual scheme
1767000	1771000	to have any meaning in there can't be information
1771000	1775000	so it kind of seems impossible to be able to say or describe
1775000	1779000	what is out here that has any information
1779000	1782000	or properties or is a certain way
1782000	1786000	just simply impossible to convey what it's influencing here
1786000	1791000	what structure or what constraints it gives to what our theories can be
1791000	1793000	how can we express this inexpressible
1793000	1796000	how can we talk about information being in the world
1796000	1799000	when there is no language out there
1799000	1802000	language comes from us, our minds
1802000	1806000	but on the other hand, the problem for the ontological relativist
1806000	1811000	is that they don't really want to say that everything is coming from our mind
1811000	1816000	that would be a kind of radical idealistic picture that they deny
1816000	1818000	that the world is just ideas
1818000	1822000	that we can just literally flippantly change reality with different concepts
1822000	1824000	that we make up as we go along
1824000	1828000	O'Grady calls this Promethean Anti-Realism
1828000	1832000	but it's important to point out that reality there is meant in their sense
1832000	1834000	this middle thing
1834000	1840000	reality, the world, stuff, information, things, objects, matter, properties
1840000	1845000	and all of those only have meaning constrained within the conceptual scheme
1845000	1850000	so this conversation is really hard because anytime a realist tries to use these words
1850000	1852000	to describe what they're talking about
1852000	1857000	they can be pulled into the terms as used by the ontological relativist
1857000	1859000	and that's super frustrating
1859000	1861000	but as it seems to me at least
1861000	1865000	they too, in their own terms, are inconsistent
1865000	1870000	even in this chapter as O'Grady is describing their position, they are inconsistent
1870000	1873000	part of this inconsistency which I would argue
1873000	1878000	and I think clearly is the more damning part is the fact that in order to explain their position
1878000	1882000	in order to deny that these words are about this thing
1882000	1885000	and are instead about this thing
1885000	1887000	to even make that clarification
1887000	1891000	they are in the process of speaking about this thing
1891000	1895000	which they say is meaningless or impossible to do
1895000	1898000	this kind of relates to the lesson Wiccanshine gives in On Certainty
1898000	1901000	where it's nonsense to respond to nonsense
1901000	1904000	and yet here they sometimes talk about the realist's position
1904000	1908000	in order to contrast against it in a meaningful way
1908000	1912000	again in the process of denying an unconceptualized reality
1912000	1917000	they employ that concept as if non-relative and as if meaningful
1917000	1922000	or if it could only actually even possibly be meant in a relative way
1922000	1924000	which is what they are fine with
1924000	1927000	then they would not be in a process of denying it
1927000	1931000	in their process of pulling terms into their relative stance
1931000	1935000	they sometimes use the terms in a non-relative way
1935000	1939000	to explain or elucidate the change or meaningful difference
1939000	1943000	so it seems it is possible then for those words to mean something
1943000	1947000	other than what the relativists insist that they can only possibly mean
1947000	1949000	so this move of mine here for this chapter
1949000	1951000	I'm not really visualizing too much right now
1951000	1956000	because in part we've already seen it before in other applications for truth
1956000	1960000	so I hope you kind of still understand what the point is I'm making here
1960000	1965000	but also it will certainly be given much more detailing in the chapter on rationality
1965000	1967000	because it will be used by Paul O'Grady
1967000	1970000	and I promise that detailing will be wonderful
1970000	1974000	anyway there is another reason for their occasional inconsistency here
1974000	1978000	in order to deny just being full-blown idealist
1978000	1981000	they do seem to want a brute force say that it just exists
1981000	1985000	and don't get me wrong they are consistent that we can't talk about
1985000	1989000	what this stuff is like that it has any properties or information
1989000	1992000	but at most that it just is
1992000	1996000	hence the cosmic porridge or the visual of grey mush that I used
1996000	2000000	but at the same time and here's a problem that was even for Kant
2000000	2004000	it exists is a property
2004000	2008000	to say something exists is also to talk about it
2008000	2011000	and they actually do seem to need to employ it
2011000	2016000	other than the mind because they don't want to say the world is just the mind
2016000	2020000	but at the same time the world isn't beyond the mind
2020000	2024000	so you can see it seems to lead them in a kind of confused state
2024000	2029000	it definitely isn't the state that they want to say that something is beyond the mind
2029000	2031000	they want to say the world is within the mind
2031000	2037000	and yet they don't want to say that we are actually constructing everything from our own heads
2037000	2041000	or at least deny that it's possible that we could somehow just flippantly decide
2041000	2044000	or on a whim decide what concepts we want to use
2044000	2048000	and change reality as it is actually experienced by us
2048000	2053000	so because they don't want to say there can be any infinite random tandem amount of theories
2053000	2056000	they want to apply some restrictions to it
2056000	2059000	but deny that the restrictions to what the theories can be
2059000	2062000	come from a mind independent reality
2062000	2068000	instead they proclaim that the constraints on what theories can exist about the world
2068000	2070000	come from the mind itself
2070000	2074000	but that means this restraint which comes from the mind
2074000	2077000	could nevertheless be the means by which we criticize another
2077000	2080000	if that is itself universal in some way
2080000	2083000	and what are those constraints?
2083000	2088000	well, Paulo Grady is going to give an account of what those restrictions are
2088000	2091000	in his chapter 5 in rationality
2091000	2094000	now from here on in O Grady's chapter in ontology
2094000	2098000	he does have a kind of outline that mainly focuses on two philosophers
2098000	2101000	that are most well known for ontological relativism
2101000	2103000	both Quine and Putnam
2103000	2107000	and really he does go to some detail explaining their positions
2107000	2110000	because it's not exactly a simple thing to talk about
2110000	2112000	but I'm just going to skip all of it completely
2112000	2114000	after explaining both of their positions
2114000	2118000	he then has seven objections to ontological relativism
2118000	2122000	three of those objections are specifically targeted to Putnam
2122000	2125000	one objection is specifically targeted to Quine
2125000	2129000	and the final three are just general arguments against ontological relativism
2129000	2133000	some of these arguments work but seem to target just the philosopher
2133000	2136000	and not the kind of general position of ontological relativism
2136000	2139000	other arguments just seem to lead to other battlefields
2139000	2142000	like whether or not IBE inference to the best explanation
2142000	2147000	is appropriate to making ontological metaphysical arguments about the nature of reality
2147000	2150000	this is namely the no miracles argument
2150000	2153000	and like I said I don't want to get into all of this stuff
2153000	2156000	ultimately when it comes to these arguments
2156000	2159000	it simply seems that there isn't a kind of final blow
2159000	2164000	there isn't anything fully restricting the possibility of ontological relativism
2164000	2168000	so O Grady allows for ontological relativism here
2168000	2173000	he seems to settle on the idea that relativism does go all the way through to the end
2173000	2176000	and anything beyond that is meaningless to talk about
2176000	2179000	and so in some sense he also perhaps on that basis
2179000	2183000	I'm a little bit unsure but he does accept the kind of differentiation
2183000	2186000	between truth and ontology
2186000	2189000	he feels one can absolutely be an absolutist
2189000	2192000	that is a non-relativist about truth
2192000	2195000	while still being a relativist about ontology
2195000	2199000	and certainly that seems to work within the schema of the ontological relativist
2199000	2203000	since the ontological relativist is denying a mind-independent reality
2203000	2206000	so all you would have to do is discuss capital T truth
2206000	2209000	as if it doesn't have to do with a mind-independent reality
2209000	2212000	and indeed if you do go look back on that chapter
2212000	2216000	where he does absolutely defend a non-relativist truth
2216000	2220000	he isn't relying on appeals to a mind-independent reality
2220000	2222000	which is actually pretty great
2222000	2225000	but anyway here in this chapter
2225000	2228000	is actually where I'm kind of really critical of O Grady
2228000	2231000	well maybe not really critical but kind of critical
2231000	2234000	and in my final video about this book
2234000	2238000	I will take a closer look at the chapter to outline the kind of criticism that I have
2238000	2242000	but to me and I'm just a shadowy character on the internet here
2242000	2247000	still he seems to be tricked by a technique used by the relativist
2247000	2249000	and maybe not exactly tricked
2249000	2252000	because the technique is used in other areas
2252000	2254000	and he combats against that same technique
2254000	2256000	so instead I currently feel like
2256000	2259000	even though he could have actually made a stronger case
2259000	2261000	against the relativist in ontology
2261000	2264000	he really is instead merely allowing for relativism in ontology
2264000	2266000	to a much greater extent
2266000	2269000	both because he feels it's safer than in epistemology
2269000	2271000	where it can cause damage to rationality
2271000	2274000	since rationality actually plays a role in epistemology
2274000	2278000	but also because he feels he can agree to segregating the areas of truth
2278000	2280000	from ontology
2280000	2282000	saving his victory there
2282000	2284000	not only is it safest to allow it here
2284000	2287000	I think in part his technique in this book overall
2287000	2291000	is simply to funnel the relativist away from other areas to this place
2291000	2295000	where they can cause the least amount of damage to the areas he battles against it
2295000	2299000	in any case there are still some good battles in this chapter
2299000	2304000	and he does give much more detail in the dealings with three philosophers in particular
2304000	2306000	David, Quine and Putnam
2306000	2311000	if you, my subscribers, really would like a detailed look at this chapter
2311000	2313000	perhaps I will do it at some point in time
2313000	2315000	but you gotta let me know
2315000	2319000	because these videos, they're super hard to make all by myself
2319000	2323000	I have no editors, no animators, no co-writers
2323000	2327000	and no funding beyond my one Patreon supporter, Slickpockets
2327000	2328000	as yet
2328000	2333000	and like I said, I didn't really come here to the battlefield of metaphysics for this
2333000	2338000	even though, yeah, this is probably the most metaphysical stuff that I'm talking about
2338000	2340000	even in this whole series
2340000	2344000	in other case this issue as I see it and we will see it again
2344000	2346000	is a problem in different areas
2346000	2349000	and can be described and visualized in many ways
2349000	2351000	and this is just one way
2351000	2353000	the question and issue is
2353000	2356000	how is information outside
2356000	2358000	if language can't be
2358000	2360000	how is that outside
2360000	2362000	influencing the inside
2362000	2365000	what of our descriptions of the world
2365000	2367000	what amount, what way
2367000	2370000	what properties is from outside
2370000	2372000	how can we ever know
2372000	2375000	since we cannot know the outside
2375000	2378000	I can go on and on for hours rephrasing that
2378000	2382000	so instead I would try to ask you to phrase the problem yourself
2382000	2383000	in your own mind
2383000	2386000	to get a good grip with what the problem really is
2386000	2389000	because you really do come to grip with the philosophic problem
2389000	2393000	when you realize due to this new post-continent picture
2393000	2396000	simply saying we get the outside
2396000	2400000	by observing, seeing, touching, etc
2400000	2402000	no longer is sufficient
2402000	2404000	as even those acts
2404000	2405000	what we are seeing
2405000	2407000	what information we are getting when we touch
2407000	2410000	it is structured by the kind of creatures we are
2410000	2412000	the kind of interests we have
2412000	2413000	the kind of minds we have
2413000	2417000	the influence of the kind of conceptual scheme we have built for ourselves
2417000	2419000	influenced by our histories
2419000	2421000	like if we are in the medieval ages
2421000	2422000	or after Einstein
2422000	2424000	and many other things
2424000	2426000	so I do have my own opinion
2426000	2430000	and my own kind of answer in some sense about some of these things
2430000	2433000	but it's not my place to say it here
2433000	2434000	as I said
2434000	2436000	I will talk about ontology again
2436000	2438000	after I am done
2438000	2440000	and giving an evaluation of this book
2440000	2444000	but I simply do not think I have any right here
2444000	2445000	at least in this place
2445000	2448000	to start telling you what I think the proper solution is
2448000	2452000	in my kind of formal idea and presentation of it
2452000	2453000	I'm not trying to do that
2453000	2455000	I was just trying to give you
2455000	2458000	an outlay of what's going on in ontological...
2458000	2461000	what's going on in ontological relativism
2461000	2463000	the kind of issues that are in play
2463000	2466000	and the kind of position that Paulo Grady settles on
2466000	2468000	now let's move on to that next area
2468000	2470000	epistemological relativism
2470000	2472000	see you there for the battle
2472000	2474000	oh please subscribe and stuff
2474000	2477000	that would be like super nice because I think
2477000	2481000	I really want to be able to prove that a philosopher can exist out here on the internet
2481000	2483000	and it can provide a place for us
2483000	2485000	anyway
