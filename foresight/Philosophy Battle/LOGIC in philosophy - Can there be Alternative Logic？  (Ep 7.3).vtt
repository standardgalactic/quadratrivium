00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Hey everyone, my name is Ajay and welcome to Philosophy Battle.

00:03.200 --> 00:08.560
Before this video starts I just want to make clear that this video is about logic and whether

00:08.560 --> 00:12.120
or to what extent there can be alternative logics.

00:12.120 --> 00:16.960
Because if there can be alternative logics, then which logic we are using can be considered

00:16.960 --> 00:19.180
relative to some other factors.

00:19.180 --> 00:24.840
And typically logic is taken to be one of the strongholds against claims to relativism.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.040
Logic is often taken to be as proof of something that isn't relative, much like math.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.320
So this video will introduce also some basic logic and the basic concepts of logic and

00:35.320 --> 00:39.800
if you are already familiar with logic, well just be a little bit patient.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.720
The more philosophically gripping stuff will come at the end.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.000
Either way it does get progressively more intense, but stick to it.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.240
Even if you don't get certain parts or know what's going on, it could still be very well

00:52.240 --> 00:57.120
cleared up later on at some point and at the end the main point or main conclusion will

00:57.120 --> 00:59.760
be made pretty clear, at least I think so.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.440
Now the video will be covering a section from a book of a philosopher, a lecturer at Trinity

01:04.440 --> 01:09.720
College in Dublin, philosopher Paul O'Grady, because I think that his book has got a lot

01:09.720 --> 01:13.080
of great and interesting battles in it and a lot for us to learn.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.480
But if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having

01:17.480 --> 01:19.560
here, that's okay.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.640
You don't have to watch anything else other than this if you're just interested in logic,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.040
even if I'm suggesting it.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.880
Just take it more as a kind of signpost if you want more information, if I do suggest

01:29.880 --> 01:32.600
another video at various parts of this one.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.040
Trust me, even if you don't watch any other things, this will still be a great video introducing

01:37.040 --> 01:40.960
the ideas of logic and the possibility of alternatives in philosophy.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.640
Finally, I just want to thank my Patreon supporters.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
Slick Pockets

01:46.640 --> 01:50.940
Now let's start the show and hear a short recap of how we got here first.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.440
Logic vs. Relativism

01:52.440 --> 01:56.760
This video is part of a series covering a few books on relativism before we go back to

01:56.760 --> 02:02.120
the battlefield of the philosophy of science, where we had encountered some extreme relativists.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.940
And trust me, it's going to be awesome when we do go back because of what we learn here

02:05.940 --> 02:08.120
in the battlefield of metaphysics.

02:08.120 --> 02:12.880
In particular, this video is covering a section in this green book simply called Relativism

02:12.880 --> 02:14.320
by Paul O'Grady.

02:14.320 --> 02:20.000
We previously already covered in a video his first chapter that explains the power of relativism

02:20.000 --> 02:22.880
that I visualize as this philosophic weapon.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.240
That video explains how this philosophic weapon came into being in modern philosophic warfare

02:28.240 --> 02:34.120
as empowered by five great philosophers and thus how it's possible that even a reasonable

02:34.120 --> 02:39.960
person may perhaps be led into believing that everything is relative.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.320
Not just what flowers look the best, or what candy tastes the best, or who's the best

02:44.320 --> 02:47.280
philosophy YouTuber, it's me obviously.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.600
But that everything is relative.

02:49.600 --> 02:57.060
They feel truth, knowledge, scientific fact, logic, even reality is relative.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.560
Nothing is objective.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
Nothing.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Absolute.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.280
Now that's an extreme position.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.360
But the powers of this weapon is actually based in philosophic writing and the history

03:06.360 --> 03:07.360
of science.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.800
It's not just some made up contrived stuff here, so please go check out that video if

03:11.800 --> 03:17.560
you'd like to really understand why one can't just offhand dismiss a relativist.

03:17.560 --> 03:22.420
When you really see the reasoning, it can be clearly a difficult enemy to challenge.

03:22.420 --> 03:27.760
But also, this wickedly powerful weapon is an important one for philosophers to use ourselves

03:27.760 --> 03:32.200
in investigation to challenge to question claims of objectivity.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.080
It's just that unlike these extreme relativists, we will gain the understanding to see that

03:37.080 --> 03:39.960
it does still in fact have limits.

03:39.960 --> 03:45.920
And Paulo Grady in his book covers two places where he defends against the charges of relativism,

03:45.920 --> 03:51.520
where those limits of this weapon should be, on truth and rationality.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.840
So these are the two battles that I wanted to cover, one on truth and one on rationality.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.120
And actually we already covered that first battle defending truth, and trust me it was

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
so awesome.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.920
So if you're interested in just trying to figure out how to defeat this enemy in terms

04:05.920 --> 04:11.680
of defending a non-relative truth in particular, then you can check out this video.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.880
But to be honest, the way I presented it was that Ogrady does a kind of setup first, where

04:15.880 --> 04:22.400
he actually uses a logical principle of non-contradiction to then go into battle on these two areas.

04:22.400 --> 04:27.240
So it's understandable that he actually has a section devoted to relativism about logic

04:27.240 --> 04:32.800
in particular right in that first chapter, where he's going to discuss whether or not,

04:32.800 --> 04:38.840
or to what extent, we can have alternative logics, whether logic is relative.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.280
So that's what we're going to be covering right now, and I did promise I'm going to

04:42.280 --> 04:46.240
try and go a little faster in this normal one because it kind of was just an additional

04:46.240 --> 04:48.500
section to that first great battle.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.240
But I thought it might be also nice for me to show you all what formal symbolic logic

04:52.240 --> 04:55.960
actually looks like if you're not familiar with it, it might be kind of cool to actually

04:55.960 --> 04:59.840
visually see, and it will also give you a kind of good mental understanding to sit in

04:59.840 --> 05:03.600
the background of what philosophers really mean when we're talking about logic.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.080
First is just some, you know, I don't know, it's like a political hack on the internet

05:07.080 --> 05:12.560
touting rhetoric about how logic is on their side, we mean something much more than that.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.560
So despite me trying to blast through some stuff, since I am still covering what Ogrady

05:17.560 --> 05:22.200
says, as usual I will cite things down to the line, and when I'm not speaking for or

05:22.200 --> 05:27.400
giving my interpretation a presentation for our purposes of what Ogrady says in the text,

05:27.400 --> 05:30.600
then the citation in the corner of the screen will just disappear.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.440
That way you'll know it's coming from me, and what is coming from my interpretation

05:34.440 --> 05:35.640
of what he's saying.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.640
Cool?

05:36.640 --> 05:37.640
Get it?

05:37.640 --> 05:39.040
Okay, let's go.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.680
Logic is intimately tied into issues of truth because of the notions of coherence and contradiction.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.840
Not everyone feels that way though, some will say it's more noticeably about inferences

05:48.840 --> 05:50.340
than about truth.

05:50.340 --> 05:54.640
But I don't have time to deal with them here, and most do see logic as having something

05:54.640 --> 05:58.880
to do with truth, and I already mentioned a couple of logical laws in the previous battle

05:58.880 --> 06:04.400
against the Alithic Relativist, Alithic being about truth and relativism as in being dependent

06:04.400 --> 06:05.920
on something else.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.380
And namely, I mentioned the laws of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle.

06:11.380 --> 06:14.600
And if you want to see that, you know what to do, hehe.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.800
Anyway, the question is, even if yes, so say the truth isn't relative, even if the truth

06:19.800 --> 06:25.360
is absolute, couldn't there still be legitimate alternative systems of logic?

06:25.360 --> 06:29.320
Or is there just one most basic, one correct one?

06:29.320 --> 06:35.000
Ogrity then tries to explain what logic even is, saying it's fundamental to human reasoning.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.400
It governs the process of inferring beliefs in a truth-preserving way, such that if one

06:40.400 --> 06:46.240
starts with true beliefs and then makes no mistakes in logic, one is guaranteed to have

06:46.240 --> 06:49.080
true beliefs as a conclusion.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.280
This is usually what we call validity, and it's the central notion in logic.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.920
A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.

06:58.920 --> 07:04.360
Now thousands of years ago, Aristotle was the first to codify logical laws and principles,

07:04.360 --> 07:10.000
but they were around even before him, but this codification marks it as a formal discipline.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.680
So I'm gonna try now and explain this as best as I can with some actual visual examples

07:14.680 --> 07:18.240
that might help us for the background for the rest of this video.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.320
Logic is a way of reasoning, and let's look at three examples of mine.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.920
If it's true that if it rains you should put on a coat, and then you find out it is raining,

07:27.920 --> 07:30.800
we can conclude you should put on a coat.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.920
We just kind of reason it out, or for another example, if it's true that if it rains then

07:35.920 --> 07:42.080
the street would be wet, but then you find out the street isn't wet, then you can conclude

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
that it didn't rain.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.280
This is us using logic to figure this out.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.680
But let's do one more.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.000
Let's just for the sake of argument imagine that it's true that either it's raining

07:54.000 --> 07:56.440
or we're eating pizza.

07:56.440 --> 08:03.760
But we find out, hey, we're not eating pizza, we can conclude then it is raining.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.120
So logic is the ability for us to figure out a conclusion that kind of preserves the same

08:08.120 --> 08:12.000
amount of certainty as the stuff that led to the conclusion.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.160
So technically logic isn't about figuring out if those premises are true or not, but

08:17.200 --> 08:20.440
just that if they are the conclusion must be true.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.960
So like in this example logic won't be telling us if it's actually true that it's actually

08:24.960 --> 08:30.280
raining outside for example, unless of course you know it's raining is derived from some

08:30.280 --> 08:32.560
other argument prior.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.400
In any case logic is just what's helping us reason out this conclusion.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.440
And philosophers have codified that like math has been codified.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.280
And just to help us with a comparison to math which actually is going to be a running theme

08:44.280 --> 08:49.720
later on, reasoning in math doesn't need to look like this.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.800
This is kind of a codification and symbolization of math.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.080
Technically one doesn't even need to know any of what these things even mean to reason

08:58.080 --> 08:59.800
out mathematically.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.400
In fact when we first teach this symbolic math to children we actually teach them the

09:04.400 --> 09:09.160
reasoning in other ways first without this symbolic language.

09:09.160 --> 09:14.000
For example we might say hey look at all your fingers put them up, you see there is one

09:14.000 --> 09:17.120
two three four five six seven eight nine ten up.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.040
Now put two fingers down.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.560
Now see how many fingers you have left up.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.760
One two three four five six seven eight.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.080
So there are eight fingers up.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.720
Thus children may be able to figure out how many fingers are up without even being literate

09:30.720 --> 09:34.640
or even ever having to see these particular symbols ever.

09:34.640 --> 09:40.000
But math has been formalized and symbolized and has functions that we slowly begin to teach

09:40.000 --> 09:45.720
children moving away from saying something like I give you five apples but you eat two

09:45.720 --> 09:52.480
apples to just saying you have five apples but take away two apples.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.140
Then we just stop saying take away and start saying minus two instead.

09:57.140 --> 10:02.640
Also we'll just stop saying the apples so we end up saying just five minus two.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.920
Then again perhaps we will teach them a more appropriate way of saying it as five subtract

10:06.920 --> 10:10.760
two while showing these symbols in particular.

10:10.760 --> 10:15.160
Then we fully begin to discuss our numerical or quantified reasoning through this mathematical

10:15.160 --> 10:19.760
symbolic language in ways that don't even have to connect to real world stuff.

10:19.760 --> 10:24.000
We don't have to be talking about apples and oranges or whatever else anymore to do math

10:24.000 --> 10:26.040
like this through symbols.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.520
So now a similar type of thing has happened and from here I'm just going to ask you to

10:29.520 --> 10:34.680
follow along as much as you possibly can but if you get lost don't worry we're going

10:34.680 --> 10:38.640
to go back to O'Grady but I think this will be pretty fun.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.240
So similarly philosophers have made it so that we can symbolize the process of this

10:43.240 --> 10:48.440
stuff but by representing these propositions as letters we'll be using in our calculations

10:48.440 --> 10:52.640
and having certain symbols to represent those relations between propositions kind of like

10:52.640 --> 10:58.480
these symbols in math I guess you could say such as the if then symbol a conditional symbol

10:58.480 --> 11:05.440
so if p then q or this symbol for negation and while we have these symbols we also have

11:05.440 --> 11:09.320
inference rules that allow us to use these symbols and figure things out using these

11:09.320 --> 11:17.840
symbols in different ways for example if p then q well given p therefore q this is called

11:17.840 --> 11:23.080
modus ponens it's super simple and it fits pretty well with our first example but now

11:23.080 --> 11:27.600
let's look at that second example if these propositions are represented by these letters

11:27.600 --> 11:36.880
then we can show it as if p then q and we find out that not q thus we can conclude not

11:36.880 --> 11:43.840
p this is called modus ponens again so like that first one was allowing us to show the

11:43.840 --> 11:50.880
truth of p that led us to the truth of q this one kind of allows us to use the negation

11:50.880 --> 11:59.480
to move backwards the falsehood of q or rather not q allows us to figure out not p backwards

11:59.480 --> 12:03.640
and now for our third example if these are our definitions we can present this with an

12:03.640 --> 12:11.520
or symbol and we can do something called disjunctive syllogism where p or q means either this or

12:11.520 --> 12:18.040
that which means both can't be false if one is false the other has to be true so if we

12:18.040 --> 12:24.640
have not q it means that we can conclude p so that's what these would look like but

12:24.640 --> 12:31.200
again remember logic isn't actually figuring out if not q is really true for this argument

12:31.200 --> 12:36.560
we have to find out other ways to actually verify not q in this case it's just that

12:36.560 --> 12:43.760
if it were not q then we can conclude p must be the case and so this is a valid deduction

12:44.200 --> 12:50.800
is either valid or not if it is valid it can be sound or not and we know if it is sound

12:50.800 --> 12:56.480
by some other means by figuring out if this particular argument still has all its premises

12:56.480 --> 13:01.560
are actually true now that might not seem like an important distinction but actually it's

13:01.560 --> 13:06.440
very important for a philosopher because sometimes your enemy presents an argument and technically

13:06.440 --> 13:12.200
their logic is valid as in these things really do lead to this conclusion logically so the

13:12.240 --> 13:17.640
problem isn't that it isn't valid just that perhaps you question one or more of the premises

13:17.640 --> 13:23.520
as being true so you're not saying the argument isn't valid but that it isn't sound because

13:23.520 --> 13:29.320
say this premise isn't true for example now that may be not super important for what we're

13:29.320 --> 13:33.160
going to be talking about in this video so don't worry about trying to remember all

13:33.160 --> 13:37.400
these things if you don't know about it but it is super important for philosophers just

13:37.400 --> 13:42.040
to be accurate about what we're criticizing in another to ensure our attacks actually

13:42.040 --> 13:47.640
land but getting back to the symbols now let's go and make a big old puzzle but now kind

13:47.640 --> 13:52.480
of like not needing apples anymore we're not even going to need these definitions we're

13:52.480 --> 13:57.160
just going to show these letters because we don't even really care if it's sound we're

13:57.160 --> 14:01.760
just going to be trying to figure out if it's a valid deduction so let me just add a couple

14:01.760 --> 14:06.600
of other things so we can make a bigger one just as an example first of all dn or double

14:06.600 --> 14:13.400
negation it's where there's two knots two knots cancel each other out so not not p through

14:13.400 --> 14:19.440
double negation just makes p and vice versa that one's pretty easy we kind of spoke about

14:19.440 --> 14:24.640
this previously in the previous video but also there's another one where p and q written

14:24.640 --> 14:29.600
maybe with this symbol instead of ampersand could be simplified through the process of

14:29.600 --> 14:36.400
simplification either as p or as q and the other process can happen too where if you

14:36.400 --> 14:40.800
have p and q in different places you could actually just put them together through something

14:40.800 --> 14:46.440
called adjunction and have p and q anyway now let's look at this one for funsies if

14:46.440 --> 14:56.200
q then p q or r if r then not s given t and s prove q it's like a puzzle isn't it let's

14:56.200 --> 15:04.120
solve it now so we're given p and s we can simplify that to just s and with just s we

15:04.120 --> 15:10.080
can make it not not s through double negation right because it's the same thing but with

15:10.080 --> 15:19.160
not not s and if r not s we can do modus tolens and therefore get not r because remember whoop

15:19.160 --> 15:27.000
so that's not r and with not r and q or r we can do disjunctive syllogism therefore getting

15:27.000 --> 15:35.880
us q because remember if it's not r then it has to be q and with q and if q then p we

15:35.880 --> 15:43.840
do our basic modus tonens and therefore conclude p boom done that's the proof we proved p if

15:43.840 --> 15:52.280
these are all true then given this one can prove logically this must be true fun huh

15:52.280 --> 15:56.320
well if you don't think so that's okay it's like a puzzle and if you learn all the rules

15:56.320 --> 16:01.480
intimately and do more puzzles it can be super fun just like doing math or stats puzzles

16:01.480 --> 16:05.960
or playing chess or doing sudoku I don't know they can all be super fun if you play

16:05.960 --> 16:11.960
them and it can really be cool and enjoyable to take the truth of this and run it through

16:11.960 --> 16:18.560
this big ol process and get a result here considered a proof this is really basic stuff though

16:18.560 --> 16:23.360
and actually there are far more advanced logics than this but let me just stop there before

16:23.360 --> 16:28.600
I cut myself off too early when it comes to logic being presented in this way it's called

16:28.600 --> 16:34.000
formal logic and it is a kind of symbolic logic so personally just to be clear when

16:34.000 --> 16:39.920
I find some in the common regular non mathematicians non philosophers non computer scientists

16:39.920 --> 16:45.640
saying logic they kind of just generally mean some kind of reasoning something like I believe

16:45.640 --> 16:51.160
what I believe based on this this is what I think and I think this makes sense that's

16:51.160 --> 16:57.240
my logic well that seems really loose and open and it seems to also sometimes mix or

16:57.240 --> 17:01.800
not even regard the difference between soundness and validity but either way still there's

17:01.800 --> 17:05.960
some understanding that logic has something to do with some kind of reasoning but when

17:05.960 --> 17:11.440
philosophers say logic it pays to mention if you mean formal logic like this like as

17:11.440 --> 17:16.880
in a system created for us to do reasoning in of a certain kind kind of like saying I'm

17:16.880 --> 17:22.320
doing math to a mathematician they will tend to now really think of math in this way in

17:22.320 --> 17:27.400
particular this may just seem like an aside but trust me we'll come into play later formal

17:27.400 --> 17:32.400
logic just systematizes and articulates a kind of inferences we make in our everyday reasoning

17:32.400 --> 17:38.080
processes to help us figure out valid reasoning versus fallacious reasoning fallacious is if

17:38.080 --> 17:43.160
a conclusion doesn't actually follow from the premises well Aristotle's classic formal

17:43.160 --> 17:48.440
logic was so good that a couple of thousand years later Emmanuel Kant was like logic is a

17:48.440 --> 17:53.720
completed science nothing to add but then there was a renewed interest in logic in the 19th century

17:53.720 --> 17:58.600
because of big developments happening in math and as we've been mentioning in like the last four

17:58.600 --> 18:04.560
videos I think German mathematician and philosopher Gottlieb Frege made one of the most significant

18:04.560 --> 18:15.880
contributions with his big big big riff bigger shrift forgive me for not knowing how to say

18:15.880 --> 18:21.480
this properly read it a thousand times just don't have friends to tell me how to say things

18:21.480 --> 18:26.360
and if a bigger shift actually kind of looks like this but it was Frege's writings who actually

18:26.360 --> 18:32.200
brought for a more modern symbolic logic it was even more sophisticated than Aristotle's and

18:32.240 --> 18:38.560
could articulate relations and generalities in such a way that one could even show mathematical

18:38.560 --> 18:45.720
truths derived from logical truths so like I was saying earlier we can do a mental processing that

18:45.720 --> 18:50.280
we call reasoning which makes use of a kind of logic in terms of inferring beliefs from other

18:50.280 --> 18:55.400
beliefs and formal logic systematizes and makes a symbolic language of us doing that kind of

18:55.400 --> 18:59.760
reasoning which actually helps us do that kind of thing but maybe we could say there's another

18:59.880 --> 19:04.800
kind of mental processing perhaps we'll call it calculating which is the use of math and this

19:04.800 --> 19:09.440
math stuff is also systematized and put into a symbolic kind of language which helps us do that

19:09.440 --> 19:15.840
well Frege's articulation was actually so good it made it possible to show that maybe even math

19:15.840 --> 19:21.640
actually is from logical reasoning that it isn't a unique different kind of thought processing

19:21.640 --> 19:27.320
this was called logicism and Russell and Whitehead furthered that position in their famous

19:27.480 --> 19:32.360
Principia Mathematica showing their logical systems and how they can derive mathematical

19:32.360 --> 19:39.040
truths from them what logic was shown to be more fundamental to our mental processing than math

19:39.040 --> 19:48.720
that actually math comes from it wow so cool at least I think that's pretty cool anyway they

19:48.720 --> 19:53.640
only actually used five basic symbols in their logic but later Wittgenstein you know who came

19:53.640 --> 19:59.080
after it goes Frege Russell Wittgenstein anyway Wittgenstein in the TLP the Tractatis logical

19:59.080 --> 20:03.720
philosophicus which is his most famous writing from when he was younger actually suggested

20:03.720 --> 20:08.360
breaking down all of logic to just one symbol actually I think Wittgenstein used the shepherd

20:08.360 --> 20:13.000
stroke to show this and really shepherd was the first to show this I think to show that we can

20:13.000 --> 20:17.880
do all of propositional logic with just one symbol but I'm not sure if he was the first to

20:17.880 --> 20:23.560
actually show it so if you're a logician and you know who is actually the first to show this let

20:23.640 --> 20:28.120
me know in the comments below but also if I remember correctly I think Wittgenstein was trying to

20:28.120 --> 20:32.200
show that even predicate logic can be expressed with it too but anyway if that sounds like nonsense

20:32.200 --> 20:39.080
don't worry about it basically we have these five symbols right the if then conditional the if and

20:39.080 --> 20:46.360
only if by conditional this symbol which is basically and the or symbol which means that one of the

20:46.360 --> 20:53.160
two must be true both can't be false and the negation symbol so there's five symbols right

20:53.160 --> 20:59.400
but actually I can be fine doing it all with just one symbol what really just one symbol

20:59.400 --> 21:04.840
how are you gonna do that well let me show you firstly this by conditional is pretty easy p if

21:04.840 --> 21:12.360
and only q all it means that both if p then q and also if q then p it was just a combination of both

21:12.360 --> 21:17.400
anyway to show that if you have one you can get the other and it goes both ways so scratch that one

21:17.400 --> 21:22.360
since we can actually express it simply by using both of these in separate ways but now what about

21:22.360 --> 21:28.200
this one the conditional if p then q how can I replace that well actually I can replace it with

21:28.200 --> 21:37.000
the or symbol by saying not p or q wait what why well if you remember at least one must be true

21:37.000 --> 21:44.600
so if one is false we know the other is true and so if q is false or not q then we can conclude

21:44.600 --> 21:51.880
not p must be true and that's also basically modus tollens here if p then q but we have

21:51.960 --> 22:00.840
not q then you know we would have not p so it works in both senses but now also if it's not not p

22:01.400 --> 22:08.600
then it has to be q not not p is the same as p remember with double negation so that's the

22:08.600 --> 22:16.280
same thing as saying if p then q so actually these are logically equivalent so I can express an if then

22:16.280 --> 22:23.640
just using or so scratch that one too now what about these last three well check it out you can

22:23.640 --> 22:31.160
take the chefer stroke to mean well it can either mean nand which is to say not and or nor which is

22:31.160 --> 22:36.120
to say not or as far as I can tell I think you just got to be clear on which one you mean when

22:36.120 --> 22:41.720
you're using it and for some reason it seems that people use the arrow down to be nor and is also

22:41.720 --> 22:47.720
associated with pierce and this arrow the arrow up is more associated with nand and I don't really

22:47.720 --> 22:52.280
know why I'm not really a logician or anything I'm just trying to be as honest and truthful as

22:52.280 --> 22:57.640
possible here remember we're actually trying to talk about relativism but anyway I can't tell technically

22:57.640 --> 23:02.360
why it is that way but as far as I can tell I think it just matters what you're actually clear on

23:02.360 --> 23:09.160
when you actually do use it so if this lash means nor this chefer stroke then it means that both

23:09.160 --> 23:18.280
must be false that neither this nor this so to show not p you would show neither p nor p

23:19.240 --> 23:25.400
the only options for p here show that they are false so with this chefer stroke I don't technically

23:25.400 --> 23:35.000
need this not symbol to show and p and q I can show it by saying neither neither p nor p nor

23:35.080 --> 23:42.280
neither q nor q remember this is negating both sides saying both side must be false so to say

23:42.280 --> 23:49.080
not p is to say this and if both of these are therefore not this and not this and both of

23:49.080 --> 23:53.800
those are shown as being negative because they're shown with this and that flips them back to being

23:53.800 --> 24:00.200
both true and thus you are saying p and q pretty cool huh anyway so that means I don't actually

24:00.200 --> 24:08.120
need that symbol either I can show it all with just this stroke and also I can even show p or q

24:08.120 --> 24:14.680
by showing neither neither p nor q nor neither p nor q and you can look at that and figure out how

24:14.680 --> 24:19.160
that one makes sense yourself if you'd like but either way the point is I don't even need this

24:19.160 --> 24:26.120
and so I can show all of these just by using one symbol this chefer stroke just this line and you

24:26.120 --> 24:31.240
know what technically it doesn't even have to be this one symbol in fact I can make it all another

24:31.240 --> 24:37.720
symbol or rather I can just take this line to mean something else the nand the arrow up instead

24:37.720 --> 24:45.240
and they would look like this anyway this is not at all important to remember for us and our sake

24:45.240 --> 24:50.360
so let's just take a deep breath and clear our mind a bit and not feel too bogged down if you

24:50.360 --> 24:55.880
didn't get what I was saying let's just get back to oh grady the point is that we can break it all

24:55.960 --> 25:02.360
down to just one symbol if we wanted or more if we wanted more depending on what suits us best

25:02.360 --> 25:10.200
each would be its own system so we can make a new system with four or one with six but hey the real

25:10.200 --> 25:17.880
question comes if maybe we can make an altogether new system we set up with new symbols that tell us

25:17.880 --> 25:26.440
to do completely different things hmm anyway there's really no limit to how many systems you could

25:26.440 --> 25:32.120
have one just set up a new set of symbols and a new system of rules of inference and a new system

25:32.120 --> 25:38.600
appeared but these would be syntactic systems pure theoretical or formal like not connected to

25:38.600 --> 25:44.200
anything outside of it when it comes to having to connect to things outside of it like those letters

25:44.200 --> 25:49.560
representing real world stuff or true or false representing ones and zeros on a computer then

25:49.560 --> 25:54.680
yeah then it seems like there's limits on what those systems could be and how are they these

25:54.680 --> 26:00.440
new systems even related back to how we normally commonly just do reasoning logically you know

26:00.440 --> 26:06.840
without these formal systems before us there were so many systems that could be very different not

26:06.840 --> 26:12.440
just different from the principia mathematical but from the way we normally do daily common

26:12.440 --> 26:19.480
logical reasoning now there were two fundamental laws in the principia mathematical that actually

26:19.480 --> 26:27.480
go way back all the way as presented to Aristotle in ancient times those were the law of non-contradiction

26:27.480 --> 26:32.600
and the law of the excluded middle the law of non-contradiction holds that a proposition

26:32.600 --> 26:39.080
and its negation cannot be both true together the law of the excluded middle holds that all

26:39.080 --> 26:46.040
propositions are either true or false there is no third value both of these came up before when

26:46.040 --> 26:51.320
we battled against relativizing truth arguing to keep both of these and yo you really gotta

26:51.320 --> 26:56.680
watch that previous video of truth versus relativism because Paulo Grady does some awesome stuff and

26:56.680 --> 27:01.720
some important lessons there that could last forever in philosophy so please do check it out

27:01.720 --> 27:07.480
well even those laws logicians have experimented with getting rid of them in these new various

27:07.480 --> 27:12.680
systems that they can make but is it possible that even they can kind of represent how we in

27:12.680 --> 27:17.560
common day do reasoning well well before we do that let's just be clear about the difference

27:17.560 --> 27:22.600
between a classic logic with just a small change or a small difference and a full blown alternative

27:22.600 --> 27:28.520
logic so philosopher susan hack actually has a very useful way of distinguishing between systems

27:28.520 --> 27:34.920
that are actually rivals versus those that are just slightly added to so a basic logical system

27:34.920 --> 27:39.560
is symbols that have rules on how to set up those symbols and what some of those symbols

27:39.560 --> 27:45.880
mean as in what it says about their relation those are the inference rules or transformation rules

27:45.880 --> 27:50.440
like modus ponens or modus tonens like i showed you earlier these things are also called well

27:50.440 --> 27:56.520
formed formulas by hack but whatever anyway now this is just a syntactic characterization of how

27:56.520 --> 28:03.080
thus a structure is set up a semantic characterization is the idea that truth of the premises that we

28:03.080 --> 28:09.480
put into the system is preserved in the conclusion we get out now if we have two systems that are

28:09.480 --> 28:14.760
set up the same with the same transformation rules but just looking different with different

28:14.760 --> 28:21.480
symbols but they mean the same thing then that's not really a rival system the real differences

28:21.480 --> 28:29.000
start when you get two systems let's call them a and b that share the same basic symbols but b

28:29.000 --> 28:36.360
has more symbols and thus more theorems and greater expression we'll call this extended logic

28:36.360 --> 28:43.160
it doesn't actually clash with the earlier classic system just adds to it ogready gives the example

28:43.160 --> 28:48.280
of modal logic with the distinctions of necessity and possibility which is a kind of logic that i

28:48.280 --> 28:53.560
didn't really do but i can imagine it one that i have done that i think would count here is called

28:54.520 --> 28:59.560
quantified predicate logic is the one where you have the universal and existential symbols

28:59.560 --> 29:04.280
logicians forgive me it's been a long time but anyway another difference here is if the symbols

29:04.280 --> 29:10.440
actually mean something different if there's actually different rules of inference in that case

29:10.440 --> 29:18.440
a would be a classic logic and b would be a deviant logic i assume because of how much it deviates

29:18.440 --> 29:25.400
not because of how naughty it is in the bedroom to do or is it hey girl you down to do some deviant

29:25.400 --> 29:33.160
logic with me back at my place okay sorry back to uh philosophy so an example of a deviant logic

29:33.160 --> 29:38.520
would be a three-valued logic which we discussed three-value logic in the previous video again

29:38.520 --> 29:43.640
please please do go check that one out it's a system where something doesn't have to be either

29:43.640 --> 29:49.800
just true or false it can be even some other thing anyway another example would also be a

29:49.800 --> 29:55.080
quantum logic where certain rules can be dropped in favor of different ones now some of these

29:55.080 --> 30:00.600
deviant systems are actually proposed as a full-on replacement for classical logic like saying this

30:00.600 --> 30:06.680
three-valued system is actually superior and should replace the two-valued one in all cases

30:06.680 --> 30:12.920
to be clear for our question of relativism advocating that one is just right the right one

30:12.920 --> 30:19.320
in all cases that we should always use it even if it is a deviant one therefore isn't relativism

30:19.320 --> 30:24.440
it's still saying that just one is correct so it's not really relativism about logic even if

30:24.440 --> 30:31.080
that one is a deviant one but how can we determine which is the true system of logic relativism

30:31.080 --> 30:36.120
emerges if you say two or more systems are legitimate candidates and we can just choose

30:36.120 --> 30:42.360
between them and even move back and forth even why would we want to be able to move to another system

30:42.360 --> 30:47.480
well hack has four different sorts of reasons why one would want to do that that ogready outlines

30:47.480 --> 30:52.040
and i'm gonna blast through these because i don't want this video to be too long like i said

30:52.040 --> 30:56.840
i don't like how ogready phrase some stuff in here and really it's not all that important for us

30:56.840 --> 31:02.760
to know the details of these only important that there are legitimate reasons to want to use a

31:02.760 --> 31:09.000
deviant logic so this just goes to show that the issue goes well beyond just oh we can create them

31:09.720 --> 31:14.920
firstly there's a general metaphysical reason an example of this is from dutch mathematician

31:14.920 --> 31:21.320
bauer who thought unlike russell that math actually can't be derived from logic and while it can

31:21.320 --> 31:27.320
exist as calculating in the mind in a way without an explicit symbolic language it is its own

31:27.320 --> 31:33.640
fundamental way of thinking he felt the nature of math is that it is constructed by the intellect

31:33.640 --> 31:38.840
so there couldn't be mathematical truths that are unknowable to the mind but this logical

31:38.840 --> 31:45.960
principle of the excluded middle would mean that there are some math truths even things we don't

31:45.960 --> 31:52.440
know that are still nevertheless true or false just we don't know them bauer denied this for

31:52.440 --> 31:58.440
mathematical truth so he wanted to drop the law of the excluded middle so i guess like for bauer

31:58.440 --> 32:04.200
that means math truths can't be unknown i'm not really sure here look this is a section where i

32:04.200 --> 32:09.240
don't think ogrady says things right because clearly there's a difference between unknowable

32:09.240 --> 32:15.880
or unjudgeable by the human mind versus just unknown or unjudged but anyway i guess if we really

32:15.880 --> 32:20.120
wanted to see what's going on here or with any of these things i can just go and check out susan

32:20.120 --> 32:25.960
hack's fuzzy book or maybe for this one in particular perhaps it came from bauer's two-part paper i

32:25.960 --> 32:30.440
don't really know if that's where it came from i'm not sure because i didn't read susan hack's

32:30.440 --> 32:35.880
book but if you want here's the journey for you you can read this and this and let us know anyway

32:35.880 --> 32:40.280
maybe one day i can do hacks book in a series on logic like i'm doing these three books on

32:40.280 --> 32:46.600
relativism right now but anyway the second reason hack presents is a desire to avoid philosophical

32:46.600 --> 32:51.800
problems some philosophical commitments may be considered troublesome an example of that is

32:51.800 --> 32:58.280
that someone wants to avoid fatalism the doctrine that events are predetermined and unmanable to

32:58.280 --> 33:04.360
free will and one version of that comes just from accepting the law of the excluded middle

33:04.360 --> 33:10.680
it is either true or false that i will be knocked down by a car tomorrow even though i have no way

33:10.680 --> 33:17.800
of knowing which it is the case that one of these options is a determinate fact remember with excluded

33:17.800 --> 33:24.840
middle something is either true or false not both not some new thing so facts about the future

33:24.840 --> 33:31.080
must already be set in that way and for those of us who want to believe free will that my choice

33:31.080 --> 33:36.840
which hasn't been made yet should impact what is true or false this could be seen as a problem

33:37.400 --> 33:42.280
now there are different ways to deal with this one can just say that facts about the future can't

33:42.280 --> 33:47.080
be true or false but doing that has a price you wouldn't even be able to say the sun will rise

33:47.080 --> 33:52.680
tomorrow is true then so instead of doing that just denying the excluded middle could be one way of

33:52.680 --> 33:57.880
diffusing the fatalist issue while at the same time allowing some future statements to be true

33:57.880 --> 34:02.600
in any case the third source of reasons that motivates adopting another logic is a desire

34:02.600 --> 34:07.960
to avoid scientific problems whereas the previous ones dealt more with dropping the excluded middle

34:07.960 --> 34:12.520
this one's more closer to dropping the law of non-contradiction the reason being how these

34:12.520 --> 34:18.200
deviant logics work with well-confirmed stuff happening in science namely quantum physics

34:18.200 --> 34:23.960
now i had questioned this but whatever the idea is quantum particles behave in ways not

34:23.960 --> 34:30.280
describable in the standard laws of logic like quantum superpositioning now ogrady uses david

34:30.280 --> 34:36.280
z albert's quote about the path of quantum particles but ultimately says of this quantum

34:37.080 --> 34:42.280
that it drops what are called the classical distribution laws but the distribution laws

34:42.280 --> 34:47.480
isn't the law of non-contradiction i just want to be clear on that but anyway for the next one

34:47.480 --> 34:53.720
the fourth reason is a desire for logical innovation systems can actually be made to

34:53.720 --> 34:59.880
drop the law of non-contradiction why do that is it just useless well you know it's pretty much

34:59.880 --> 35:05.480
just making them for the sake of expanding our minds sort of thing and maybe it can also help

35:05.480 --> 35:11.400
us to understand paradoxes and stuff too so those are the four reasons ogrady outlines that hack

35:11.400 --> 35:16.840
has for why someone would even move to an alternative logic it's not just a trivial or for the fun of

35:16.840 --> 35:22.920
it type of thing that different systems can be made but now let's see some objections against

35:22.920 --> 35:29.240
alternative logics ah the husband wife duo influential historians of logic w neal and

35:29.240 --> 35:34.840
m neal hold that even from a purely formal point of view the ordinary two-valued system

35:34.840 --> 35:40.920
has a unique status among deductive systems which can possibly be called logic since it contains

35:40.920 --> 35:47.240
all others as fragments of itself in short they are not alternatives to classical logic

35:48.200 --> 35:54.600
but this can be challenged truth for multi-valued logics actually may not appear in fact cannot

35:54.600 --> 36:00.760
appear in classic two-valued systems i think that one's kind of obvious i don't know why they even

36:00.760 --> 36:07.880
said that then ogrady says the distinctive position here seems just historical a long-standing tradition

36:07.880 --> 36:14.200
but tradition can hardly stop philosophers and i agree with ogrady on that heavily but i would

36:14.200 --> 36:19.160
like to note that from that quote though there's actually nothing in it to suggest that the neals

36:19.160 --> 36:24.280
were making their claim on the basis of long-standing tradition but it reads like ogrady is saying

36:24.280 --> 36:30.600
that's what it seems like their position also is but didn't cite that part or put a quote for it

36:30.840 --> 36:36.360
not saying ogrady is wrong about them he certainly knows the neals ever more than i ever will but

36:36.360 --> 36:40.680
just pointing it out that that quote actually had nothing to do with long-standing tradition of a

36:40.680 --> 36:45.960
two-valued system anyway ogrady then devotes a few pages particularly to an argument by the

36:45.960 --> 36:52.760
champion philosopher quine who uses the translation argument against deviant logics he gives us the

36:52.760 --> 36:57.880
details of the background and all that and i don't really think that's fully necessary for our purposes

36:57.880 --> 37:03.240
especially to show what ogrady's position ultimately is but i'll blast through it super fast

37:03.240 --> 37:07.960
just so that i'm not depriving y'all of at least mentioning it given how much time ogrady devotes

37:07.960 --> 37:12.440
to talking about it and i think you'll see why he's doing that though so like i said not to confuse

37:12.440 --> 37:16.680
anyone but i'm gonna go kind of fast and be a little bit lax on this see first there was these

37:16.680 --> 37:20.600
folks right and we'll call them rational intuitions who thought that logical truths can actually be

37:20.600 --> 37:24.280
known in a special way prior to having any experience of anything so like you don't have to

37:24.280 --> 37:27.720
make any observations in the world you can just kind of think about it and realize it's true

37:27.720 --> 37:32.040
and so that's you using your kind of rational intuition to grasp its truth and while there are

37:32.040 --> 37:36.200
a lot of logical truths that we know because we infer them from other ones some of them can actually

37:36.200 --> 37:40.440
be known just straight up immediately with rational intuition no other premises required

37:40.440 --> 37:44.920
and even some of those things that the rational intuition can figure out for us can even reveal

37:44.920 --> 37:48.920
the nature of reality like some fundamental truths about how the world works anyway russell

37:48.920 --> 37:52.920
who co-authored the principia of mathematically that book that shows logic more fundamental than

37:52.920 --> 37:57.400
math you know logicism and whatnot well he felt this way too that logical truths are known through

37:57.400 --> 38:01.880
our rational intuition not through any experience like other empirically dependent beliefs while at

38:01.880 --> 38:06.200
first that kind of makes sense for us actually that would seem super spooky and mystical for the

38:06.200 --> 38:11.880
positivists so they were all like yo f that but then to explain or make sense of how we grasp logical

38:11.880 --> 38:16.200
truths then they claim that we know logical truths because they are dependent on the linguistic

38:16.200 --> 38:20.520
framework we make or are using and if you think of it that also kind of makes sense based on what

38:20.520 --> 38:25.880
we're saying remember we can make different syntactic structures if we want to so positivists

38:25.880 --> 38:31.560
advanced a linguistic theory of logical truths holding that logic derives from linguistic rules

38:31.560 --> 38:35.560
and there's different in many complex versions of this but carnap was one of them remember he was

38:35.560 --> 38:39.880
a positivist philosopher who thought that we could make different linguistic frameworks or as we might

38:39.880 --> 38:44.440
want to start calling it different logics for scientists to use so for those with the linguistic

38:44.440 --> 38:48.840
theory of logic all logic really is is just following the rules within a linguistic practice

38:48.840 --> 38:53.000
which if you think of it kind of implies there wasn't particularly anything special or deep about

38:53.000 --> 38:57.160
logic beyond merely which linguistic framework we are using and i guess that's where we kind of are

38:57.160 --> 39:01.160
now and now we're gonna see quine respond to this because quine ain't downwardist you see because

39:01.160 --> 39:06.440
quine likes logic so quine agreed with the criticism against the intuitionist because he too wants to

39:06.440 --> 39:10.520
be empirical in certain ways and we'll get to that in another chapter but he thought there was

39:10.520 --> 39:14.680
actually no need to bother trying to explain logic with something else as if there's something more

39:14.680 --> 39:18.600
fundamental to it quine be like logic is so fundamental to thought you can't explain or

39:18.600 --> 39:24.360
argue for it with something else or gritty says of quine logic is so basic to our thinking that

39:24.360 --> 39:29.080
nothing more fundamental could explain it so quine be like nah you don't need something to explain

39:29.080 --> 39:33.720
it because if you understand the language you will just give a scent to logic anyway it's obvious

39:33.720 --> 39:39.080
and anyone who correctly understands the language in question will just give a scent to a logical

39:39.080 --> 39:46.040
truth as an obvious truth yeah you could have trivially different logical systems and textbooks

39:46.040 --> 39:52.280
and whatnot but when it comes to actual deviant logics well if someone comes up to you and is like

39:52.280 --> 40:00.920
ayo p and not p you will be like no this this isn't a sincere deviant logical person it's better to

40:00.920 --> 40:07.480
just assume that they probably don't understand what and means or what not means or they actually

40:07.480 --> 40:11.960
mean something completely different when they say it because the assumption is if they did know what

40:11.960 --> 40:17.320
those things mean in the way that we do they simply would not be saying it it's just always better

40:17.320 --> 40:22.280
to believe there's actually a mistranslation going on even if we don't know exactly what it is then to

40:22.280 --> 40:28.120
believe someone is actually using a deviant logic he compares it to master david humes move of saying

40:28.120 --> 40:33.320
if you come across some claims to miracles it's better to believe no there must be some explanation

40:33.320 --> 40:38.040
to this than they're actually being a miracle and that it's always better to believe there is some

40:38.040 --> 40:42.520
actual explanation for some event even if you don't know what that explanation is yet

40:42.520 --> 40:48.920
then to believe there is a miracle and quines boy david sin well boy no uh sorry for my colloquialism

40:48.920 --> 40:55.400
anyway that is quines former student david sin took this argument to a whole next level

40:55.400 --> 41:00.680
not just for logic but even against different conceptual schemes now part of the reason of

41:00.680 --> 41:05.320
this book isn't just to survey all the places where relativists can attack and where a gradey

41:05.320 --> 41:13.240
can defend but also actually he wants to battle david sin to the death no i'm just kidding there's

41:13.240 --> 41:18.840
no actual violence here and even what ogready wants to do isn't actually all that confrontational

41:18.840 --> 41:24.600
with david sin i find he just wants to present a softer argument rather than a hard argument david

41:24.600 --> 41:30.040
sin does in his chapter on rationality so maybe that explains why he went to some depth of the

41:30.040 --> 41:35.640
background of this argument from quine 2 talking about it here even mentioning the positivists

41:35.640 --> 41:39.960
and stuff like that which i didn't bother getting into ogready says he will talk about

41:39.960 --> 41:43.880
both of these philosophers anyway in different places though when he gets to them but for

41:43.880 --> 41:48.200
right now he's gonna suggest that quines argument ain't that perfect in part because it's coming

41:48.200 --> 41:54.120
from him nothing personal just pointing out that this argument seems to anticipate or set up a just

41:54.200 --> 42:01.320
offhand rejection of deviant logics a priori but quines whole epistemological thing is that there

42:01.320 --> 42:08.200
are no a priori nothing we know before experiencing it everything can be changed with experience

42:08.200 --> 42:13.880
no beliefs have any kind of special unchangeable place but at the same time it seems he's making

42:13.880 --> 42:19.800
logic special here and remember the translation argument is an argument that a priori rejects

42:19.800 --> 42:26.440
deviant logics so what's going on here quine you all over the place well ogready admits the

42:26.440 --> 42:32.920
precise interpretation of quines position is a delicate and disputed issue so it seems ogready

42:32.920 --> 42:37.800
is open to a quinian philosopher defending quine and clarifying the different positions quine has

42:37.800 --> 42:44.200
taken and evolved over time in which particular ways also my presentation of quine would probably

42:44.200 --> 42:50.200
make a quinian even more frustrated and heck this ain't even my own details covering of ogready

42:50.200 --> 42:56.680
talking about quine it's just my blast through but to be fair again ogready does say he will

42:56.680 --> 43:02.680
look into quine himself in more detail and clarify his position better than he has done here at least

43:02.680 --> 43:08.440
in this chapter at least he will do better when he gets to his chapter in ontology anyway there's

43:08.440 --> 43:15.240
other problems for quine's argument too like it just assumes a classic two-valued logic is what's

43:15.240 --> 43:20.360
obviously deep in the mind fundamental and all so everything outside of it we kind of just translate

43:20.360 --> 43:26.440
to it but there's no argument here in particular for why this obviously correct thing in the mind

43:26.440 --> 43:32.760
can't be for someone else say an intuitionist logician having a three plus valued logic or

43:32.760 --> 43:38.360
something else the argument just states that there is a base logic but there is no argument here

43:38.360 --> 43:44.120
for what that logic has to be that it has to be a classic two-valued system and not a deviant one

43:44.120 --> 43:49.640
also it seems quine is using considerations about translation because of his own commitment to

43:49.640 --> 43:55.080
empiricism and behaviorism but one could argue that empirical evidence isn't appropriate to

43:55.080 --> 44:00.280
determine the nature of logic i mean maybe there's some metaphysical underpinning that can explain

44:00.280 --> 44:05.320
why logic is special in any case ogready seems to hold that there are indeed arguments against

44:05.320 --> 44:10.840
deviant logics but they aren't all that perfect there's flaws in him ogready then goes on to

44:10.840 --> 44:16.840
describe his own position that looks like this he says and we're going to quote this line by

44:16.840 --> 44:25.480
line while i give my own visualization of it even if one accepts a deviant system and believes there

44:25.480 --> 44:32.120
are good philosophical grounds for defending it there seems to be general regulative principles

44:32.760 --> 44:41.240
governing the choice of a logical system these include consistency coherence simplicity efficacy

44:41.240 --> 44:49.480
and so on our choice of a logical system is itself governed by a more general conception of

44:49.480 --> 44:56.600
rationality he says there are notions of logic that operate up here and those are what he argues

44:56.600 --> 45:02.760
for in his chapter on rationality the law of non-contradiction and he says he won't argue for

45:02.760 --> 45:09.080
it but it's possible that for the reasons of simplicity we would also have up here a two valued

45:09.080 --> 45:14.840
system the law of the excluded middle simply because then you don't have to mess around with truth

45:15.480 --> 45:21.400
where does that leave the legitimacy of deviant logic well it's pretty clear that multi-valued

45:21.400 --> 45:28.040
systems are possible and there's no compelling formal argument against having them but also

45:28.040 --> 45:35.880
up here the meta level that governs the adoption of such systems is committed to at least the law

45:35.880 --> 45:43.720
of non-contradiction and probably for reasons of simplicity to the law of the excluded middle lower

45:43.720 --> 45:50.760
level contacts requiring suspension of this to require the existence of such a meta level

45:50.760 --> 45:57.240
is to argue for the core conception of rationality which will be argued for in chapter five

45:57.960 --> 46:04.840
this is an absolute non-relative conception governing degrees of diversity beneath it

46:05.560 --> 46:10.760
so the upshot of this discussion is that there are legitimate alternative logical

46:10.760 --> 46:18.360
calculi useful for various purposes but ultimately governed by a system adhering to the

46:18.360 --> 46:26.280
traditional laws of logic and with that the chapter ends so we see ogredi does allow relativism

46:26.280 --> 46:31.960
on logic in terms of the lower level but argues that there are some principles of logic on the

46:31.960 --> 46:38.280
meta level or above which he defends and he will be calling the core conception of rationality

46:38.280 --> 46:42.760
once again leading us to that second great battle where he defends against relativism

46:42.760 --> 46:48.840
on his chapter on rationality so we gotta go and check that out this means though for some folks

46:48.840 --> 46:54.760
that come up and be like hey this isn't relative it's logical you could say there are actually

46:54.760 --> 46:59.640
different logics back to that but ultimately they may be just saying something about how

46:59.640 --> 47:05.320
basic rationality that governs fundamental way we think is nevertheless beholden to logical

47:05.320 --> 47:11.640
laws if that's what they are saying you could say so you mean rationality isn't relative

47:11.640 --> 47:17.320
which is kind of different but maybe that's just not much criticism behind what they meant to say

47:17.320 --> 47:22.040
only that it's probable that they don't really understand logic in the way philosophers or

47:22.040 --> 47:26.840
logicians or mathematicians do certainly many people don't know there are different kinds of

47:26.840 --> 47:31.720
maths as well different interpretations of what counts as the correct mathematical procedure

47:31.720 --> 47:36.920
that perhaps mathematicians and philosophers are familiar with but the common person isn't so it's

47:36.920 --> 47:42.360
much easier for the common person to say math and mean something about the fundamental ways we

47:42.360 --> 47:49.560
think about things in any case is logic relative it seems like yeah it is but logical principles

47:49.560 --> 47:55.480
kind of are necessary to the way we think certainly there are actual alternatives and you can actually

47:55.480 --> 48:01.400
pick different logics depending on what you need but can we use a different logic at least in terms

48:01.400 --> 48:07.560
of the principle of non-contradiction in the way we actually think in the way our rationality is

48:07.560 --> 48:14.840
well Ogrady will argue nope we cannot so let's go see that awesome battle now against a relativist

48:14.840 --> 48:21.800
that would argue even rationality is relative oh and before you go i just want to say very

48:21.800 --> 48:27.560
quickly unscripted uh if you like my visualization or my videos here please go check out some of

48:27.560 --> 48:33.240
the other ones and please actually do subscribe to my channel if you can please support me on

48:33.240 --> 48:38.200
patreon or send me a direct donation to paypal it's really difficult and it takes hundreds

48:38.200 --> 48:43.720
of hours to make these videos and i don't get much support even socially as you can see my subscriber

48:43.720 --> 48:48.520
count isn't even that high so it's not like even youtube pays me for this so if you can do that that

48:48.520 --> 48:53.480
would be great that could really be nice you know other than that i just want to say let's get to

48:53.480 --> 49:09.400
the next battle of rationality versus relativism and remember philosophers keep battling
