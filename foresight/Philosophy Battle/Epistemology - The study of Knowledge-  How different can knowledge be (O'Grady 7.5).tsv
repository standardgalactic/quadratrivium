0	3600	Epistemological Relativism
3600	6680	Epistemology is one of the main branches in philosophy.
6680	8520	It is the study of knowledge itself.
8520	12880	And epistemological relativism, well, it could mean many different things, but for the most
12880	18280	part is the position that there is not one universal way of assessing a knowledge claim
18280	19880	regardless of context.
19880	26320	It denies one way of justifying or acquiring true beliefs, that there could be many ways
26320	32040	which would result in there being possibly many radically different or alternative knowledge
32040	37400	beliefs, even or at least seemingly contradictory ones.
37400	42360	And there could be different positions under the header of epistemological relativism that
42360	46240	vary in strength as in how much relativism you can have.
46240	50240	While there is much combat about that among different philosophers, at the lowest level
50240	54880	hardly anyone rejects relativity when it comes to perceptual knowledge.
54880	59520	As in knowledge based on your perceptual location, like at any given time say the knowledge
59520	63800	of how this particular side of the face of this rock appears to you is relative to your
63800	65560	position to that rock.
65560	70800	Or maybe how different people know different things because they are in different locations.
70800	75600	Relativism at that level is perfectly fine, even with the absolutist position, which is
75600	77520	the opposite of the relativist.
77520	83200	The real combat comes about when you're talking about relativism on a higher level, like natural
83200	88440	laws of the universe itself or math or geometry or even logic.
88440	93200	Now back in the old days those who used relativism as a weapon at even those higher levels were
93200	94960	called skeptics.
94960	100760	They used it to deny objectivity and by that also claims to knowledge.
100760	105720	Because for them thinking that you could believe another set of beliefs even about these things
105720	108240	means that you don't really know.
108240	113520	Such as the ancient pyrrhonian skeptics, but the modern use of relativism up here includes
113520	121280	philosophers who think that they can actually have relativism while not denying knowledge.
121280	124480	Being a relativist but not a skeptic.
124480	129800	In a sense, saying knowledge doesn't have to be objective.
129800	132800	That it can be relative.
133800	139680	Today we're covering this topic as it is presented in the middle chapter by philosopher
139680	142920	Paul O'Grady and that's the citation in the corner.
142920	147520	So I won't be covering all of epistemology which is virtually impossible to do in one
147520	152160	video, it will be more of a surface covering of this major branch of philosophy which can
152160	156920	still be a great source for someone to understand the kind of things going on in epistemology
156920	158680	in a more general sense.
158680	162720	But the conversation is going to be framed in terms of how different knowledge can be
162720	168800	or how relative things can get in epistemology as discussed by Paul O'Grady, whose book
168800	172640	I've chosen to present here, even though certainly some of these debates have continued
172640	175000	past the time of his book being published.
175000	178720	So you don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to even though I may be
178720	183560	suggesting other videos at times in this one, just take it more of a signpost.
183560	187680	It will still be a great standalone video for someone new to generally grasp the kind
187680	191760	of issues going on here even if you're not interested in relativism or whoever this
191760	192880	philosopher is.
192880	197880	But if you will allow me to give some background first before we start talking about epistemology.
197880	203080	Paul O'Grady is a philosopher who investigated relativism in many different cognitive areas
203080	207760	and I mean cognitive because he doesn't want to talk about merely morals you know like
207760	211840	what's right and wrong or aesthetics like what counts as beautiful.
211840	216200	Those things can be relative to different people or cultures or not, who knows, we're
216200	218120	not talking about that though.
218120	223920	Our concerns here are about if even things like truth or logic or today if knowledge
223920	226080	can be relative to.
226080	232960	And before you think that you have a very clear and obvious answer please go watch this
232960	239960	video I made on his first chapter, it will in some sense convey the power of this weapon.
239960	246120	But O'Grady does then go on to battle in these two areas specifically against relativization
246240	249360	and those are what I call the limits of this weapon.
249360	253040	And that's what I was really interested in, that's what I even came here for.
253040	255720	I didn't want to have to cover everything in his book.
255720	261400	So I already covered his first powerful and awesome battle on the front of truth and also
261400	266880	covered the kind of intricacies of logic since he did utilize the principle of logic in order
266880	270560	to battle against relativization on the front of truth.
270560	274520	But after that I just wanted to go straight to his next battle where he defends against
274520	275840	relativization.
275840	279880	So if you're interested please do go check out these first battles if you'd like.
279880	284040	They are pretty good and certainly if you're less familiar with and want to come to grips
284040	289200	with how there can be relativism even about things like logic this video can help quite
289200	290200	a bit.
290200	294840	To explain how in fact one actually can be a relativist when it comes to logic, that
294840	299720	there are different kinds of logic and what actual philosophers and logicians and maybe
299720	303240	computer scientists I guess mean when we say logic.
303240	310120	In any case O'Grady allows relativism both here and here but here it is limited by rationality
310120	313360	where he will argue against relativization.
313360	317680	So like I said at first I was just gonna skip these chapters but then I realized that one
317680	322120	might not really appreciate what he's gonna be doing in that final battle of his without
322120	326440	knowledge of some of what happens here because he actually does reference it and in part
326440	333200	his strategy is to accommodate the relativist away from here into one of these other areas.
333200	337080	So I decided to try and make a quick short video about both of these chapters to some
337080	342160	degree not my normal in depth line by line citation and standard of production you know
342160	346160	maybe lower quality audio or less visuals I don't know.
346160	350720	So I did one on ontology already which for our sake is pretty much a discussion about
350720	354160	the world and how the world can be relative.
354160	358520	And for that video I just made it very general about the general battles going on in that
358520	363200	field and how O'Grady kind of presents it but not cited perfectly down to the line and
363200	367880	not going over everything O'Grady says just finally saying where O'Grady lands on the
367880	372560	issue like I don't want it to be overly visually produced or anything just wanted it to be
372560	377720	quick but it seems like I may have let it go a little bit out of hand there it got mad
377720	378720	visual.
378720	383440	So for this video actually this is my second time doing it the first time doing it I went
383440	388480	super fast and super quick just sticking to line by line citation of everything that happened
389160	391960	but it seemed like it was too fast.
391960	396040	So I'm going to slow it down technically I already did the work I've already made
396040	400600	a lot of the visualizations although it's still not up to par to my normal standard
400600	405200	and maybe the explanations is not even as in depth or as perfect an explanation as I
405200	411040	normally would do so this video isn't my norm kind of video keep that in mind I want
411040	415760	it to be at least kind of understandable what's basically going on in epistemology at least
415760	420320	in terms of what's happening with relativism and what O'Grady's final position is.
420320	423840	So let's get through this chapter together and if you don't care for this chapter you
423840	428160	can just jump to that final battle if that's all you really wanted to but you know here
428160	432280	we are in epistemology and if you're interested in epistemology this video can definitely
432280	436160	maybe help in some kind of more general sense I don't know.
436160	437320	But let's begin.
437320	442360	So he presents two main positions that believe yes you can have relativism in knowledge but
442360	448080	not be a skeptic a stronger position and a weaker position the stronger position believes
448080	452840	that different cultures and historical epochs have different standards for assessing knowledge
452840	457720	and thus different sets of beliefs there's no shared point from which to judge implying
457720	462960	they are completely cut off from each other which is a problem of incommensurability no
462960	465160	shared point to measure.
465160	470080	Judgment isn't possible from the outside one can only judge from within its own standards
470080	472880	each epoch judges itself.
472880	476640	One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they
476640	482200	seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.
482200	486400	One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared among
486400	491680	all of them that one cannot judge among them but in doing so they are speaking about all
491680	496040	of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common and
496040	500600	so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing what
500600	502680	they claim shouldn't be possible.
502680	507160	And don't mind my commentary if it doesn't help but this is basically self-defeat and
507160	512560	it is a massive running theme when it comes to facing this kind of opponent so they need
512560	517360	to be able to show that they can hold this position without being self-defeating.
517360	521680	Both Richard Rorty and Steven Stitch try to do this and both of these figures will come
521680	525360	back again in the battle on rationality chapter 5.
525360	531400	Now a weaker version of this does admit relativization can happen even in things like logic and math
531400	537040	and geometry or knowledge based on the a priori and they're supported with real world examples
537040	542500	like the change from Euclidean geometry, Aristotelian logic, Newtonian physics which all used to
542500	548640	be taken as absolute non-relative stuff but with developments in the 19th and 20th century
548640	553160	it's pretty clear we can have alternative geometry, different kinds of logical and mathematical
553160	556380	calculi even and even new physics.
556380	560640	And in terms of that logic part again if you would like examples of different logics and
560640	565080	how that could work please check out my video covering his discussion about alternative
565080	566280	logic.
566280	571840	But while this position is open to relativization about even those things there is still a limited
571840	577680	amount of alternatives not an infinite variety of alternatives about those things and also
577680	582800	it's still a limited form of relativism in terms of using one or an alternative system
582960	585880	that there's still a universal way of judging among them.
585880	592000	So both of these are epistemological relativism one is stronger which he calls radical epistemological
592000	597600	relativism where all judgments are relative to cultural and historical epochs no universal
597600	604120	standard at all all beliefs thus relativized to those separate and incommensurable epochs
604120	609840	and the weaker or as it is called by O'Grady the moderate epistemological relativists still
609880	615360	holds that a priori judgments are indeed relative to different systems so there can be alternative
615360	620480	accounts of the a priori knowledge knowledge like math or logic things that we can have
620480	626040	based on pure reasoning without even any experience but on the other hand there's still one universal
626040	629200	way of judging all those alternative systems.
629200	633000	And before making the case for this latter position which Paul O'Grady holds he first
633000	637840	wants to discuss the difference between relativism and skepticism and kind of trace how relativism
637840	642880	kind of came out as a way of responding to skepticism and hey in epistemology talking
642880	646960	about skepticism was pretty good place to start but after we're done talking about
646960	652160	skepticism and the responses to it then we'll talk about the main two big battles in modern
652160	658880	epistemological warfare which is foundationalism versus coherentism and externalism versus
658880	660600	internalism.
660600	664200	After he's done discussing both of these things then we'll go back to his discussion
664200	670040	of the radical versus the moderate epistemological relativists and why he prefers the latter.
670040	672280	So first, skepticism.
672280	676440	Well to be clear the skeptic definitely thinks that if they're all alternatives to what
676440	680520	we think to be true then we don't really have knowledge and should just suspend our
680520	685880	belief but the epistemological relativists hold that you can have alternatives but having
685880	690440	alternatives doesn't necessarily mean that we don't know and that those alternatives
690440	693160	can also actually constitute knowledge.
693160	696480	Now there's been many skeptical positions in history for example the ancients thought
696480	700600	that being skeptical was a kind of ethical position against holding belief solely on
700600	706000	dogma based just in faith which may have been used in religious and political or social
706000	707880	oppression of the people.
707880	713080	Other philosophers use it as a tool to test our knowledge to see what we can even be skeptical
713080	714080	about.
714080	717900	If we can be doubtful about it it meant that we didn't really know it.
717900	722200	So philosophers kind of tried to use doubt to uproot things that we didn't know to see
722200	726640	what we have left things that were indubitable things that couldn't be doubted and tried
726640	731280	to build our knowledge based on those undoubtedly indubitable things.
731280	736040	Now some philosophers are doubtful about having any knowledge at all while others are doubtful
736040	742640	about some specific things like the external world or that other minds exist or the possibility
742640	747600	of moral knowledge or even that there could be knowledge based on pure thought.
747720	759760	Now for this next section we're just gonna take this one as our main example of the skeptic.
759760	764640	So just so you have an idea of why somebody would be skeptical about the external world
764640	769360	I'm gonna give you kind of a more modern example for this a more modern thought experiment
769360	774520	that of the possibility of having been born completely within a computer simulated environment
774520	775880	for example.
775880	780160	Nothing about how things appear to you within the simulated environment may connect to how
780160	782760	things really are in the actual world.
782760	787480	In such a situation all of your sensations are merely a part of the simulation, in fact
787480	790360	even your body would be a part of the simulation.
790360	794040	Maybe in the real world you don't actually have two legs and arms.
794040	798720	As if perhaps you're just a brain with electrodes being plugged in and just being given sensations
798720	800520	of sights and sounds and smells.
800520	805080	I mean technically in that situation you wouldn't really know if there really are trees or birds
805080	809880	if they really exist in that external world but also since all of our science or information
809880	813960	we were told that science has is based on that simulation, we wouldn't even know if
813960	815560	we are brains.
815560	820040	And in this way it seems always possible to be doubtful about the external world.
820040	823720	But that's just a thought experiment, don't worry about it too much, the point is that
823720	826600	you can be skeptical about the external world.
826600	831360	And so O'Grady outlines two strategies to respond to this kind of skepticism, one that
831360	835520	is to meet the challenge of the skeptic, to actually find beliefs that can't be doubted
835520	840160	even in this kind of situation and then build our knowledge off of those as a kind of secure
840160	844760	base and the other one is to show that the skeptical challenge is not something to be
844760	851080	taken seriously at all, it's kind of more of a rejection strategy to deny the skepticism.
851080	855080	Now most philosophic tradition is about that first strategy, so if you're just starting
855160	858840	philosophy you're probably going to learn one of these two things if not both, I mean
858840	860720	you should probably learn about both.
860720	865440	But as he presents them there's the empiricist and the rationalist take on this kind of strategy.
865440	871000	For the empirical strategy the idea is that beliefs immediately deprived from perception
871000	875360	often called the given were proposed as many as immune to doubt.
875360	880120	So if you think of it, simulation or not, the given may be that I'm having the sensation
880120	881880	of red right now.
881880	883880	That's still true no matter what.
883880	887840	Not conceptualizing what that red is about or what it's coming from or if it connects
887840	890720	to anything beyond what I perceive, nothing like that.
890720	894440	It's supposed to be non-conceptualized experience.
894440	898400	That's still something I know directly no matter what situation it is.
898400	901800	But hey that's just my example of what the given might be.
901800	907320	Really the details of what the given is varied a lot among philosophers but they did have
907320	912160	all in common the idea that knowledge began with the data of the senses.
912160	914000	That's what makes it empirical.
914000	919960	These immediately derived perceptions, the given, were taken to be safe from skepticism
919960	923680	and so we can build our secure knowledge strictly off those things.
923680	928000	Now that approach may seem promising to you but the problem that led most to reject this
928000	933880	kind of move was the issue of giving an account of how that stuff can even have data that
933880	935960	we aren't skeptical about.
935960	941760	The whole point was that it was so basic it were below the level of conceptualization.
941760	948720	But once you conceptualize it in order to build off it, it no longer is safe from skepticism.
948720	953320	And we kind of already spoke about this issue a lot in that ontology video so if you're
953320	958120	interested in what's going on here, how is this an accurate criticism, please go check
958120	963840	out that video first or maybe even the power of relativism, the first chapter, to see what's
963960	964960	being said here.
964960	969760	That the idea that we can just build off simply how we see things is actually a kind of naive
969760	973000	position at this point, we've moved way past that.
973000	977440	Anyway, for this reason, Ogrity says the empiricist's attempt at meeting the skeptical challenge
977440	979000	has failed.
979000	984160	Now on the rationalist's attempt to meet this challenge is most notably Rene Descartes
984160	988040	who actually thought there were some kind of special properties of certain beliefs that
988040	993640	made them indudable, that made them the kind of beliefs that can't ever be doubted, namely
993640	996400	that they must be clear and distinct.
996400	1001320	But when pressed to explain these properties, how they allow them to justify other propositions
1001320	1008320	and why they would entail certainty, as Ogrity remarks, that did not prove compelling.
1008480	1010880	So both of these failed.
1010880	1012640	What about strategy 2?
1012640	1016920	In terms of kind of denying or rejecting the kind of philosophic doubts that we have here
1016920	1023320	about the external world, Ogrity covers two philosophers, namely Wittgenstein and Quine.
1023320	1028200	Now I already have done a video on Wittgenstein and if you want a little better understanding
1028200	1033920	if you're unfamiliar with his latter philosophy, please do check it out, it's even less I guess
1033920	1038600	formal than this video, it's more of me kind of talking from the top of my head to kind
1038600	1043280	of compensate for a section where he talked about Wittgenstein earlier in one of his chapters
1043280	1045240	that I just didn't think was really great.
1045240	1049200	Nevertheless, I think in my opinion it's a pretty good video of giving an understanding
1049200	1053560	of Wittgenstein and how he deals with this kind of skepticism, and how he would deal
1053560	1059600	with this kind of skepticism as being ungrounded, and also how Wittgenstein's philosophy loans
1059600	1064240	itself to being used by relativists even though he didn't want that.
1064240	1068400	But Ogrity comments that even if we do take Wittgenstein's approach to show that these
1068400	1074200	doubts are ungrounded, it changes our conception of philosophy, to see it more as therapeutic
1074200	1077160	and as a removing kind of system building.
1077160	1081840	But also he remarks how some philosophers still take some initial lessons from Wittgenstein
1081840	1087080	to do away with the skepticism but still feel they can go on and continue doing philosophy
1087080	1090160	in a more traditional systemic fashion.
1090160	1094880	And it seems to me that this includes using Wittgenstein's philosophy about how they're
1094880	1099360	being different language games and therefore different standards within each language game
1099360	1102840	to then be relativistic about almost anything.
1102920	1107920	This even includes rationality, but Ogrity will address that rationality thing in chapter
1107920	1109800	5 like we've already mentioned.
1109800	1113960	Now Ogrity kind of makes a sort of similar point about Quine then too, which I also made
1113960	1118680	a kind of quick rough video as a starting point about Quine also, which I hope is done
1118680	1123240	by now, but he really does speak about Quine in both of these middle chapters and really
1123240	1128040	didn't want to have to present Ogrity's version of Quine twice, so I just made that
1128040	1132760	video so I can reference it in both of these videos, so you can check that out.
1132760	1138640	And it will explain its relation both to ontology and its relation to epistemology and so here
1138640	1141080	also in regards to skepticism.
1141080	1146280	It will explain how he finds that doubts arising from scientific knowledge can also be answered
1146280	1151200	therefore with scientific knowledge, from where it arises rather than taking those doubts
1151200	1153600	to some extreme unanswerable level.
1153600	1158360	Like I said though, I think Ogrity is making a similar point about Quine as he did Wittgenstein,
1158360	1162440	that even though he accounts for how different they are, he says that Wittgenstein's philosophy
1162440	1167240	led to a change in conception of philosophy as more of a form of therapy to remove a kind
1167240	1170900	of attempt to build a transcendental philosophical structure.
1170900	1174680	And even for Quine, his philosophy changes the conception of philosophy since it's no
1174680	1179160	longer seen as different from science, it's no longer seen as separate, they are both
1179160	1181180	simply a part of the same web.
1181180	1184980	But also like Wittgenstein, there are philosophers that could actually take Quine's position
1184980	1190300	but don't go on to hold science as particularly prized web of belief that Quine did, which
1190300	1194860	was a non-relativist epistemology, and so they use Quine's philosophy to deal with
1194860	1200500	the skepticism but then go on to become epistemological relativist, drawing a parallel to Wittgenstein,
1200500	1204780	how his philosophy is used too to be relativistic about epistemology.
1204780	1209500	In summary for this section about skepticism in terms of our epistemological discussion,
1209500	1214300	it shows that the more promising solutions to skepticism, what we are calling strategy
1214300	1218700	too, which is the rejection of the skeptical challenge, they actually can be used to lead
1218700	1225100	to epistemological relativism, but also it requires a change in our conception of philosophy,
1225100	1226980	and we'll talk more about that later.
1226980	1231980	But that's the point here, about this traditional problem about skepticism in epistemology has
1231980	1237300	in more recent time with more recent and modern strategy led to some taking on epistemological
1237300	1238940	relativist positions.
1238940	1244500	But now let's move on to the main two big battles in modern epistemological warfare,
1244500	1250260	which is foundationalism versus coherentism, and externalism versus internalism.
1250260	1254940	Now these two former things were taken to be absolute, and these two latter things were
1254940	1257420	taken to be more relativistic.
1257420	1261980	But in this section, Paul O'Grady is going to show that this isn't necessarily so, that
1261980	1267020	actually all of these positions can have both elements of relativism and elements of an
1267020	1273580	absolutist position, that even the foundationalists and the externalists can be made relativistic,
1273580	1278860	and that both the coherentist and internalist positions don't have to lead to any kind of
1278860	1284300	extreme radical relativism, that there can be some kind of absolutist constraints on them
1284300	1285300	too.
1285300	1290140	So before we get into these main two big battles, I just want to explain something called inferential
1290140	1292140	justification first.
1292140	1296220	And for those of us who are not familiar with formal logic, let me just kind of loosely
1296220	1300700	explain the idea using an example of basic arithmetic, basic math.
1300700	1304820	So look at this example, 2 plus 2 equals 4.
1304820	1311540	Now the justification of 4 is actually inferred from these earlier premises, and so in this
1311540	1318180	way, the truth of these is being preserved into the conclusion of 4.
1318180	1322660	Now it's kind of weird to talk about math like this for me, so in a more formal logical
1322660	1328900	symbolic language, basically the truth of these premises are preserved in the conclusion,
1328900	1336420	that if p then q, and we have p, we use something called modus ponens to infer q.
1336420	1343220	The truth of q is inferentially justified given that these former premises are true.
1343220	1349820	If it's true that if p then q, and if it's true that p, we can therefore infer and justify
1349820	1351340	q.
1351340	1357380	So justification in this sense is kind of moving from these earlier premises to this latter
1357380	1358380	one.
1358380	1359380	Keep that in mind.
1359380	1364980	In this way, it's usually taken that belief is justified and so inferentially from another
1364980	1369580	belief, and justification is just thereafter passed on.
1369580	1372900	So anyway, let's look firstly at foundationalism.
1372900	1378140	Now we have already in some sense kind of spoken about this earlier with the empirical strategy,
1378140	1383300	but anyway, the foundationalist idea is that all of our beliefs, justification just don't
1383300	1388940	go back forever and ever, though there is some battle about this idea of going back forever,
1388940	1394540	which actually goes past the time of O'Grady's book between Klein and Gannett, or Ginnett?
1394540	1397140	Once again, I don't really have friends to tell me how to say things.
1397140	1398140	So subscribe.
1398140	1402860	Either way, both positions here take the idea of it going back forever as obviously untenable.
1402860	1408460	Anyway, also for the foundationalist, for them it doesn't just cycle back on to itself,
1408460	1414660	instead there must be some basic original first beliefs that aren't inferentially justified
1414660	1421140	from other beliefs, that these basic beliefs are special and in some way self-justifying.
1421140	1427220	And higher level premises are just built upon them in a process called epistemic ascent.
1427220	1432300	So maybe as a kind of quick simple image we might imagine an upside down triangle.
1432300	1436620	While this kind of seems to imply for most foundationalists then that knowledge can only
1436620	1442580	be one structure, as based on these basic beliefs, there is no room for relativism of
1442580	1444060	our beliefs then.
1444060	1450460	But O'Grady shows with Karnap that even these basic beliefs, our so called basic ones, can
1450460	1455700	actually be characterized in different ways, as relative to our theoretical models.
1455700	1460700	The theories that we have actually shape how we interpret what those basic beliefs even
1460700	1465860	are, and we can choose different models for our different aims, different purposes, but
1465860	1472420	in so doing so changing our theories we even end up changing those so called basic beliefs,
1472420	1477820	in ways that show that they can't actually be taken as pre-theoretical I guess.
1477820	1482180	We can't actually take them as just prime and evident in of themselves.
1482180	1487380	But also with Karnap, the whole epistemic ascent itself can actually be relative and
1487380	1490820	different based on which model we are using.
1490820	1495860	And to make that sort of idea clear, once again, I do have a video on logic that makes
1495860	1501020	this kind of idea more clear about how we can have different logics in different models,
1501020	1506580	and how that can entail different inferential rules that allow us to build in different
1506580	1507580	ways.
1507580	1511260	One of these models isn't inherently more right or wrong.
1511260	1516100	We can in fact just select them based on our purposes and for Karnap those purposes were
1516100	1517500	used for scientists.
1517500	1521260	Anyway, so please do go check out that video, okay?
1521260	1526300	The point here anyway was that relativism can still arise when it comes to foundationalism
1526300	1530300	too, even though it's normally thought of as being strictly absolutist.
1530300	1535220	Now the coherentist position, which is the opposition to foundationalism, is much more
1535220	1537100	like a larger web.
1537100	1540380	For them they believe there are no basic beliefs.
1540380	1544380	There can be no beliefs that aren't justified by other beliefs.
1544380	1549740	And to combat the foundationalists that accuse them of just being circular in their reasoning,
1549740	1555980	well they say that justification is non-linear, that justification is more holistic, justification
1555980	1559540	coming from multiple beliefs within the matrix of beliefs.
1559540	1563540	Now Ogrity summons one of the most popular images that kind of give visualization to
1563540	1567220	the coherentist picture, which is the image of Neruth's boat.
1567220	1571020	An image that I'm kind of presenting here in a kind of more simple fashion, but hey
1571020	1572460	I think the point comes across.
1572460	1576300	The idea is that no one plank in this boat is essential.
1576300	1581300	You can actually remove anyone if needed and replace any plank at any one time.
1581300	1585860	But not the whole thing, which means there's no foundational essential plank.
1585860	1589820	When we remove any one plank we can make other adjustments in other places to make sure we
1589820	1593100	still stay afloat while we're replacing it for example.
1593100	1597220	And just to note, this whole idea of Neruth's boat is actually kind of in part based on
1597220	1598700	the Ship of Theseus.
1598700	1603380	In the Ship of Theseus you can replace one plank at a time all the way through the ship
1603380	1606580	so that it ends up being completely different.
1606580	1611580	And when it comes to the Ship of Theseus the question is, is it still the same ship if
1611580	1613940	it's completely different by the end?
1613940	1617620	But there's no clear point at which we count it as being suddenly a new ship.
1617620	1622660	Anyway, this discussion is not about the Ship of Theseus, but just the idea that in fact
1622660	1628660	the entire thing can change because there's no one essential, foundational, or most important
1628660	1633060	belief, or thing that we know a part of our entire ship.
1633060	1637940	Anyway, so the big deal with Coherentism in terms of relativism is that it seems that
1637940	1643780	we can have an endless number of different systems that even contradict with each other.
1643780	1648360	Since all it needs to be justified is be coherent within its own system.
1648360	1653180	And hey, if you think of it, many people suffering from extreme paranoid schizophrenia have large
1653180	1658420	structures of beliefs that they are completely obsessed about trying to make perfectly coherent
1658580	1661140	or take conspiracy theorists for example.
1661140	1665900	They might have huge numbers of beliefs that they think interlock and connect in so many
1665900	1671140	different ways that they are completely obsessed about making perfectly connected and internally
1671140	1672640	coherent too.
1672640	1677160	But what they believe still contradicts what we believe in some ways or many ways even.
1677160	1682900	But if we take every system as being equally justified, then this is taken to be radical
1682900	1683900	relativism.
1683900	1687900	And to deal with this kind of situation of how there can be seemingly contradictory
1687900	1692660	different Coherentist belief, in my phrasing at least I'll say it, that some actually
1692660	1696080	believe well you know you just take these web of beliefs and you mash them together
1696080	1700180	to make one big one, one big web of belief that's for everyone.
1700180	1705060	And some take that to be what's happening with the whole project of unifying science.
1705060	1707140	That's one way to deal with that kind of problem.
1707140	1713020	Others try to mark out some systems as unique or special by appealing to some kind of transcendental
1713020	1715500	arguments about the nature of belief.
1715500	1721340	How some beliefs are specially known in some way, or sort of fusing elements of both foundationalism
1721340	1723060	and Coherentism together.
1723060	1727500	Anyway, because of those it seems to imply that it's possible that there can be one
1727500	1729140	correct system.
1729140	1735580	That even in Coherentism, there can be an absolutist and non-relativist picture.
1735580	1740620	But if there can be many different systems, one falls into extreme relativism.
1740620	1745240	And the moderate position is that while there can be different systems, there's a limitation
1745240	1747800	on how many alternatives there can be.
1747800	1752800	Again, the stronger position is that there can be many globally different systems, systems
1752800	1755460	that are completely different from each other.
1755460	1760760	And the weaker position is the idea that there is actually just distinct local subgroups
1760760	1762860	within a larger system.
1762860	1768780	The radical epistemological relativist uses a Coherentist picture, but with multiple systems
1768780	1771880	and no limits on how many there can be.
1771880	1776820	The moderate epistemological relativist is one where there can be local subgroups within
1776820	1778780	a more global system.
1778780	1784020	So to be clear, relativism can happen both with foundationalism and Coherentism.
1784020	1788020	But later when we talk about both of these positions, they're both going to be using
1788020	1793740	a more Coherentist structure, just a matter of whether or not it's radically relativistic
1793740	1795780	or moderately so.
1795780	1801660	But onward to the next big battle in epistemology, externalism versus internalism.
1801660	1806920	Now most of the epistemological tradition has been internalized till recently.
1806920	1812080	Now traditionally in the philosophic tradition, we used to define knowledge as being justified
1812080	1813720	true belief.
1813720	1819000	That you had a belief, you had good reasons for believing what you do, and it is actually
1819000	1820000	true.
1820000	1822320	Then we would say you have knowledge.
1822320	1827240	But then this guy named Edmund Gettier came along and basically showed that we can make
1827240	1832780	cases where somebody does have good reasons to believe what they do and it happens to
1832780	1837580	turn out to be true but we still wouldn't say they really knew.
1837580	1842860	So it showed that JTB wasn't enough, that there probably had to be something more or
1842860	1847140	maybe even that this whole enterprise of defining knowledge in this way is not a good one but
1847140	1848580	that's my personal opinion.
1848580	1852460	But don't worry about what that special case was or what to do instead.
1852480	1857960	The whole point here is that we still held that knowledge generally had to have an entailed
1857960	1863480	truth but that somebody could be justified in believing something even though it didn't
1863480	1868240	have to be true, that it was possible to be fully justified and have the good reasons
1868240	1872040	to believe something even though it turns out to be false.
1872040	1874520	And in such a case we would say you don't have knowledge.
1874520	1880280	So this question about internalism and externalism isn't about knowledge itself, it's specifically
1880280	1882360	about justification.
1882360	1887260	And the internalists hold that the reasons why somebody should be considered justified
1887260	1893540	in believing what they do should be available to the person who holds the justified belief.
1893540	1896520	It should be internally available to them.
1896520	1901980	But the externalist says that one can be justified for believing what they do for reasons outside
1901980	1907300	of what is consciously known or available to the person who has those true beliefs.
1907300	1912080	The externalist feels we can actually point to certain mechanisms that might be outside
1912100	1917480	of what we are aware of that still nevertheless produce likely true beliefs in us.
1917480	1922240	And because those mechanisms still produce true beliefs in us, that means we should still
1922240	1927960	be considered justified if we used those mechanisms, even if we're not aware of what those mechanisms
1927960	1931600	are or articulate how we got beliefs from those mechanisms.
1931600	1936980	Such as perception, like seeing, maybe seeing and perception actually produces very likely
1936980	1938240	beliefs in us.
1938240	1942840	So we're still justified in believing what we do because we use that mechanism, even
1942840	1947620	if we can't exactly explain why we believe what we do based on them.
1947620	1954780	Now it's important to note, in this way externalists kind of have connected justification to truth.
1954780	1959220	And this is a connection that the internalist doesn't necessitate at all.
1959220	1963820	And so because of that, it might seem like since the externalist is connected to truth
1963840	1969960	and since we've seen that truth is not relative, that's an earlier battle that Paul O'Grady had,
1969960	1974640	we would say that then there's no room for relativism in externalism.
1974640	1978760	Because truth isn't relative and they're supposed to be connected, right?
1978760	1984720	Well, O'Grady shows with Alvin Goldman's Reliabilist account that this isn't necessarily so.
1984720	1989480	That there can be different frameworks that provide systems of rules for judging if a belief
1989480	1992800	is justified or not, called J-Rules.
1992820	1997660	And these rules don't even have to be consciously known, but can be applied from without to
1997660	2001660	give an objective judgment if a belief is justified.
2001660	2006660	But there's a criterion of rightness for when it comes to judging which framework succeeds
2006660	2008780	in capturing justification.
2008780	2014700	So the criterion establishes the correct framework, which establishes if something is justified.
2014700	2019780	And according to Goldman, epistemic terms like justified or not happens within these
2019780	2024560	frameworks, but outside of them they're just descriptive language, so on the level
2024560	2029160	of the criterion, he settles for the term of reliability.
2029160	2034080	And technically there could be different frameworks that meet the same criterion.
2034080	2038560	To be clear, Goldman doesn't say that these are culturally relative or anything like that,
2038560	2042160	but they can be multiple within even an individual.
2042160	2044720	If that seems unclear, don't worry about it.
2044720	2051260	The point here for this video is that even the externalist has some room for relativism.
2051260	2056860	But even in comparison to that, the internalists seem much more obviously open to relativism,
2056860	2061220	as it appears there's no external constraint of their beliefs having to be true.
2061220	2065060	Consider in one person's perspective, they could have all the good reasons to believe
2065060	2066660	they know something.
2066660	2071300	And he gives an example of himself possibly believing that a lecture will happen from
2071320	2076360	an eminent philosopher, because he's seen the ad posters for it, and students have spoken
2076360	2080560	to him about it, and he even sees someone being guided into the lecture hall, so he
2080560	2085800	has many factors, perception, testimony, coherence, and they all come together to make
2085800	2091360	him perfectly justified in believing a lecture is happening or going to happen.
2091360	2096240	But it turns out, it's actually all an elaborate hoax set up by some students playing a trick
2096240	2097400	on him.
2097400	2102340	In this context, he was perfectly justified in believing there was a lecture happening.
2102340	2106340	But in the context of the students who may have set up the hoax, they were completely
2106340	2109660	justified in believing there was no lecture happening.
2109660	2114580	So we had two valid justifications but opposing beliefs.
2114580	2119820	So this led philosophers to think that maybe context matters for justification, context
2119820	2124220	in terms of who's the one describing something as being justified or not.
2124220	2129560	So instead of saying that S is justified in believing P, we now have that S is justified
2129560	2136120	in believing P relative to context C. But what kind of context can we have?
2136120	2140880	Well Ogrity says that contextualism has been investigating this kind of issue.
2140880	2147600	So the point is that internalism kind of leads us into a discussion about contextualism.
2147600	2151120	Differing knowledge standards apply in different contexts.
2151140	2155380	For example, Mary knows her kids are in the yard because she just checked on them and
2155380	2157780	she has no reason to think otherwise.
2157780	2162140	So we might agree that yeah, Mary knows her kids are in the yard, she just checked.
2162140	2167020	But also, we find out there's actually a kidnapper in the neighborhood.
2167020	2173700	So now we think, oh well considering that, maybe she's not justified in knowing.
2173700	2177020	Maybe she doesn't really know.
2177020	2182280	Ogrity uses her own standards in her context to be able to say that she is fully justified
2182280	2184920	to believe she knows where her kids are.
2184920	2191480	But we use our standards given what we know to say that she's not justified.
2191480	2195320	Now what makes us select different standards?
2195320	2200040	Mark Heller says that it depends on our interest and the demands of the conversation we're
2200040	2201040	having.
2201040	2203600	But don't worry about where this goes.
2203620	2209100	Mary tries tying this all up by saying that even if knowledge descriptions are contextually
2209100	2213140	sensitive, it doesn't necessarily lead to extreme relativism.
2213140	2217340	Because relative to a context within those standards, there's still an objective answer
2217340	2222940	to whether or not S knows P, just like indexical sentences that use I or this.
2222940	2225500	For example saying yeah, I am in Paris.
2225500	2229100	Sure, the truth of that is relative to who's saying it.
2229100	2233260	But once we know who's saying it, there's still a way of objectively evaluating if
2233260	2234680	it's true.
2234680	2238920	Meaning given the context, once we figure out what the context is, one can establish
2238920	2240800	an absolute truth claim.
2240800	2245120	But that's not the only contextualist argument that prevents a strong relativist reading
2245120	2246120	of it.
2246120	2249880	It still seems open and possible that there could be general epistemic standards that
2249880	2253240	govern more local contextualized aspects.
2253240	2257040	And that's actually kind of what he will argue for and give details of in his chapter
2257040	2258040	5.
2258040	2262600	But as a summary of this whole section of both these battles, basically despite what's
2262600	2266940	normally assumed of all of these positions, they can both have elements of relativism
2266940	2269340	and absolutism to some degree.
2269340	2274220	And even if we take these normally assumed relativist positions, they don't necessarily
2274220	2276980	have to lead to radical relativism then.
2276980	2280860	We can have actually more moderate versions of relativism with them.
2280860	2285060	So now we're going to deal with that conflict of radical epistemological relativist versus
2285060	2290420	a moderate epistemological relativist position.
2290420	2295800	For the radical epistemological relativist, he gives the examples of Rorty and Stitch.
2295800	2301440	And I'm just going to be like fully, fully honest with you right now, I detest having
2301440	2303480	to get into this mess.
2303480	2306860	Getting into it here will be overly complicated in cumbersome.
2306860	2312520	And ultimately I don't think it's very contributive to what we want to do with Ogrady anyway.
2312520	2316200	Even if Rorty's challenges may be one that's more likely going to be coming from someone
2316220	2321140	who we describe as a relativist, arguments that are going to be made against anyone trying
2321140	2325340	to attempt to establish anything universal in any which way.
2325340	2330100	Still, a lot of the descriptions about the failings of philosophy and the presumptions
2330100	2336260	of objectivity and the denial of trying to assume a kind of transcended structure and
2336260	2343100	all that, you know, which isn't an inaccurate criticism of the old philosophical tradition,
2343120	2349080	but it actually results in a kind of unnecessary wholesale rejection of the role of philosophy
2349080	2350240	itself.
2350240	2354280	But you know what, let me actually read the sort of conclusion Paulo Grady has when it
2354280	2358600	comes to Rorty and Stitch, so we can get a kind of sense of the criticism Ogrady has
2358600	2364360	for both of them, and also the kind of role that is still left for philosophy, even considering
2364360	2368040	the accurate critiques that Rorty and Stitch might have.
2368040	2371000	So first he says of Rorty.
2371000	2373780	Rorty's view is just too extreme.
2373780	2379420	Because one model of ontology, truth, rationality, epistemology, and so on fails, does not mean
2379420	2382820	the whole philosophical enterprise fails.
2382820	2388060	A fallible historically, politically, and scientifically attuned reflection on questions
2388060	2395900	of meaning, truth, reason, and so on is philosophy, and is what people like Habermas, McDowell,
2395900	2400580	Putnam and Quine, to mention just a few, are doing.
2400580	2407320	One may disagree with him, indeed being part of the philosophers club seems to entail disagreeing,
2407320	2413760	but it reflects too much of an all or nothing style of thinking to reject epistemology and
2413760	2420040	metaphysics because certain versions of it haven't worked, and instead plump for social
2420040	2426520	political analyses of truth, rationality, warrant, and so on.
2426520	2431320	As Searle once remarked apropos Wittgenstein, just because his early theories of philosophy
2431320	2435900	failed, he concluded that all philosophy was doomed to fail.
2435900	2443420	In some forms of anti-philosophy, one can find enormous philosophical hubris lurking
2443420	2445540	just beneath the surface.
2445540	2450880	Rorty has done a great service in his criticism of the analytic tradition, forcing it to be
2450880	2452700	more self-aware.
2452700	2460560	However, self-criticism doesn't always mean self-annihilation, as Rorty seems to think
2460560	2461560	in this case.
2461560	2466080	I mean, I find these to be some pretty harsh words for Rorty, but also I very much like
2466080	2471040	this quote because I think it's far more accurate to how and what philosophy is compared
2471040	2473160	to the results of Rorty's conception.
2473160	2477280	But anyway, let's look at what Paulo Grady says in response to both of them together
2477280	2478440	now.
2478440	2484500	What is common to both Stitch and Rorty is a tendency to set up dichotomies, as if they
2484500	2488660	were mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the options.
2488660	2493260	Rorty rejects the traditional conception of philosophy as seeking to find objectivity
2493260	2496300	in the transcendent and non-human.
2496300	2501020	Stitch rejects more recent attempts to do the same in this scientific world.
2501020	2507100	Both have quite compelling cases to make against their opponents, however, they then both leap
2507120	2512160	to a position that this is supposed to be the only alternative to the rejected position.
2512160	2516960	Rorty speaks of intersubjective agreement as the new objectivity and Stitch talks of
2516960	2519800	achieving diverse cognitive goals.
2519800	2524600	The implication in both cases is that while these are meaningful occusions, it is a retreat
2524600	2530720	to the rejected conception of philosophy to seek further explanation as to why certain
2530720	2536320	goals and methods are preferable to others, and for what reasons communities come to agreement
2536340	2537740	over issues.
2537740	2543340	In fact, both are largely right in their rejection of traditional ways of explaining objectivity
2543340	2550340	and cognitive success, but fall foul of explaining how objectivity emerges in the new conversational
2551060	2554860	context other than saying it generally does.
2554860	2559140	An important task for philosophers who are persuaded of the failure of some of these
2559140	2566140	traditional projects, but who are dissatisfied by the skimpiness of explanation of how objectivity
2566280	2572240	as intersubjectivity is supposed to work, is to try and establish how it does.
2572240	2576320	A beginning for such a project is to look at a priori knowledge.
2576320	2578640	So that's what O'Grady does next.
2578640	2581440	Oh man, this video is huge.
2581440	2585200	Okay, so I'm going to hit this last part of the video with some mad crunch time, and
2585200	2588920	I'm kind of sorry for that, but don't worry, I will still explain what O'Grady's position
2588920	2592480	is going to be in terms of epistemological relativism at the end.
2592480	2597500	But this is the section then devoted to moderate epistemological relativism, and pretty much
2597500	2602340	first he's going to explain why we can be relativist about even these things like logic
2602340	2606860	and math and geometry, but then after explaining that he's going to explain why we should
2606860	2611820	still have it be moderate, why there's still some use in there being relative, but also
2611820	2616540	at the same time why we don't have to result in some kind of extreme relativism, what the
2616540	2619260	limits of this relativism is.
2619260	2621020	So anyway, let's talk about it.
2621020	2624360	So he's starting this discussion with a priori knowledge.
2624360	2629720	So basically, a priori knowledge was taken to be the best example of absolute knowledge
2629720	2634240	prior to experience, and it was also thought to be necessarily true.
2634240	2639000	But Kripke challenged this and shown that that relationship isn't actually always holding,
2639000	2640960	that it doesn't have to be necessary.
2640960	2645400	In any case, like I said, keep in mind, the standard candidates for what a priori knowledge
2645400	2650600	is, is things like logic, or math, or so called special sentences, but I don't want to have
2650620	2653260	to explain what those special sentences are right now.
2653260	2657020	The point is, some believe that they can have justification for all of these things based
2657020	2662140	in a kind of rational intuition, and these philosophers are namely Russell and Bonjour,
2662140	2667540	but they thought these things were known immediately, that they were kind of special to human intuition,
2667540	2671660	and they were non-reducible, they couldn't be reduced to other beliefs, and they weren't
2671660	2676740	arbitrary, and also that they were kind of part of the mind-independent world, they weren't
2676740	2679020	just true inside our heads.
2679020	2683200	Now at first these things were taken to be infallible, that they can't be wrong, but
2683200	2689200	that changed, especially when whole systems that were taken to be a priori were challenged,
2689200	2693680	and shown that there were alternatives to them, particularly when it was shown that there
2693680	2696440	could be non-Euclidean geometry.
2696440	2700680	Now if you want to look up what non-Euclidean geometry is, you can do that yourself, it's
2700680	2704760	pretty much the challenge to Euclid's fourth postulate, but more or less as a kind of rudimentary
2704760	2711540	explanation, the old geometry had pretty much assumed a flat 2D surface, but non-Euclidean
2711540	2717300	geometry can be done in 3D, in three dimensions, and it's not always based on the idea that
2717300	2724100	the 2D one was wrong, just that the two dimensional Euclidean geometry was perfectly fine for
2724100	2730020	cases where we were doing work on 2D surfaces, so conventionalism is a position that is meant
2730080	2736000	to deal with there being multiple a priori systems, and we just kind of select one, and
2736000	2740720	in fact we have already seen something like this in that logic video with Carnap, and
2740720	2747080	how we actually make different systems as useful for scientists, different logical systems,
2747080	2752160	but that did mean for Carnap that there were still practical constraints, namely is that
2752160	2755720	system actually useful for the scientist or not?
2755720	2758160	So it wasn't completely relativistic.
2758160	2762340	There were other problems though for the conventionalist, and some of those problems were pointed out
2762340	2763340	by Quine.
2763340	2767860	You see, Quine wanted to defend a logic as being particularly deep in the mind, and he
2767860	2773100	showed that the idea of consequence as used by the conventionalist is actually a part
2773100	2778380	of that logic, and so we kind of have a funny result, that in conventionalism we may have
2778380	2785700	it say that whenever there was a case type T, we apply convention C, and so we have
2785700	2792200	a case T, then using modus ponens, kind of like we did earlier in the video, we can conclude
2792200	2796480	to using convention C. That seems kind of clear, right?
2796480	2801320	But the funny thing is, what if the convention is modus ponens?
2801320	2807080	Then we're using modus ponens to employ modus ponens.
2807080	2809880	That's kind of like a funny cool move, Quine did.
2809880	2814760	So it seems at the upper level there are still some principles of logic which go outside
2814760	2819460	the bounds of conventionalism, and certainly this is Ogrady's kind of point in that logic
2819460	2825260	chapter too that he was trying to argue for, but what's happening at this upper apparatus,
2825260	2830500	he's going to argue for again at chapter 5, hint hint, it's rationality.
2830500	2833780	It's basically the system that's coming up all the time, that's what he's going to
2833780	2834780	talk about.
2834780	2839580	Anyway, Quine's system actually does away with the a priori completely then, and again
2839580	2843860	you can check out this video if you'd like an account of how that's happening, but Ogrady
2843880	2850080	points out problems with Quine as well, because it denies a meaning-belief distinction, and
2850080	2855120	meanings, for even terms where we don't even have experiences of them yet, still seem to
2855120	2857320	be important for philosophers.
2857320	2862200	Even if they're just temporarily set to see what their implications are, meanings can
2862200	2866880	change, but all the more useful to clarify what those meanings we set out are going to
2866880	2867880	be.
2867880	2873040	So Ogrady then presents what he calls a pragmatist a priori position.
2873040	2878900	Where instead of completely denying a priori beliefs, we actually do have or can make a
2878900	2881540	priori frameworks.
2881540	2886380	And they are distinct from what we can call a posteriori beliefs if you want, which is
2886380	2891660	the content within and of which that require this framework as a precondition for talking
2891660	2892980	about the world.
2892980	2896860	And he shows this distinction of what's the framework and what is the content within
2896860	2901540	the framework actually being used by many different philosophers who are widely different
2901540	2906480	in their philosophies such as Lewis, Karnap and Wittgenstein, and in a way appeasing all
2906480	2911680	the changes that happened through this entire lineage, he says that this framework can change,
2911680	2917760	that it's not infallible, but investigating these frameworks is central to philosophy.
2917760	2922440	There's no commitment to a single framework for all contexts, there can be different ones,
2922440	2926720	and even some things within a framework can eventually become a part of it.
2926720	2930240	But we have three questions for philosophers to investigate.
2930240	2934660	One, making sense of the notion of a framework itself.
2934660	2940020	Is it or how much of it is explicit or implicit, natural or artificial?
2940020	2944500	Two, is there a core framework that is universal?
2944500	2948940	And three, how do we judge among those frameworks themselves?
2948940	2951660	How does one judge a framework?
2951660	2955580	So Ogrady gives his answers to these three questions.
2955580	2960280	For that first question, making sense of the notion of a framework itself, he says these
2960280	2965680	frameworks are a tacit set of presupposition, and that the job for philosophers is to be
2965680	2968160	able to address and judge them.
2968160	2973200	Not just what their purposes serve, but the different kind of purposes we can even have
2973200	2974560	for them.
2974560	2978880	Doing these philosophers don't merely just point them out, that we do have such frameworks
2978880	2984240	and such preconceptions that are in play, but then after pointing them out we can actually
2984260	2989500	tinker with them and make adjustments to them, perhaps even make new ones or improve on them
2989500	2991340	for different purposes.
2991340	2995100	So I really enjoy Ogrady's input here, because in the end of this chapter he's making a
2995100	3000060	good case for philosophy itself and the kind of work it can do in a way that isn't within
3000060	3005480	the specter of Rorty's criticism, or those who think that all philosophy is somehow necessarily
3005480	3011260	tied to a kind of universal transcendent objective structure building in order to correspond
3011260	3013580	with mind independent reality.
3013580	3017800	And it also creates a new conception of the role of philosophy in a way that connects
3017800	3022120	to the lessons learned from Wittgenstein and Quine, but he also then goes on to promise
3022120	3027560	that in terms of this second question, if there is a universal framework, he will claim
3027560	3032440	that there is a universal framework always in play, or rather that, and I prefer rather
3032440	3038080	here, that what frameworks are can't be wholly different from each other, that there is something
3038080	3043820	shared among all of them, and he will call that the core rationality, which actually
3043820	3049220	has his principle of non-contradiction, and actually with that core rationality, we will
3049220	3052700	be able to do three, judge among them.
3052700	3057540	So he will cover that core rationality in his next chapter, and that's it for what
3057540	3059980	Ogrady says in Epistemology.
3059980	3066700	So there is relativism in a knowledge relative to a framework, and even those frameworks
3066700	3072400	can change and be different relative to different purposes, but as we shall see with Ogrady
3072400	3077080	in the next chapter, he will argue against it being extreme relativism, because there's
3077080	3082960	a limit on what these frameworks can even be, and what exactly that limit is, is shown
3082960	3085120	in his next chapter.
3085120	3086520	That's the video.
