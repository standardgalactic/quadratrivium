00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Epistemological Relativism

00:03.600 --> 00:06.680
Epistemology is one of the main branches in philosophy.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.520
It is the study of knowledge itself.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.880
And epistemological relativism, well, it could mean many different things, but for the most

00:12.880 --> 00:18.280
part is the position that there is not one universal way of assessing a knowledge claim

00:18.280 --> 00:19.880
regardless of context.

00:19.880 --> 00:26.320
It denies one way of justifying or acquiring true beliefs, that there could be many ways

00:26.320 --> 00:32.040
which would result in there being possibly many radically different or alternative knowledge

00:32.040 --> 00:37.400
beliefs, even or at least seemingly contradictory ones.

00:37.400 --> 00:42.360
And there could be different positions under the header of epistemological relativism that

00:42.360 --> 00:46.240
vary in strength as in how much relativism you can have.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.240
While there is much combat about that among different philosophers, at the lowest level

00:50.240 --> 00:54.880
hardly anyone rejects relativity when it comes to perceptual knowledge.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.520
As in knowledge based on your perceptual location, like at any given time say the knowledge

00:59.520 --> 01:03.800
of how this particular side of the face of this rock appears to you is relative to your

01:03.800 --> 01:05.560
position to that rock.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.800
Or maybe how different people know different things because they are in different locations.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.600
Relativism at that level is perfectly fine, even with the absolutist position, which is

01:15.600 --> 01:17.520
the opposite of the relativist.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.200
The real combat comes about when you're talking about relativism on a higher level, like natural

01:23.200 --> 01:28.440
laws of the universe itself or math or geometry or even logic.

01:28.440 --> 01:33.200
Now back in the old days those who used relativism as a weapon at even those higher levels were

01:33.200 --> 01:34.960
called skeptics.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.760
They used it to deny objectivity and by that also claims to knowledge.

01:40.760 --> 01:45.720
Because for them thinking that you could believe another set of beliefs even about these things

01:45.720 --> 01:48.240
means that you don't really know.

01:48.240 --> 01:53.520
Such as the ancient pyrrhonian skeptics, but the modern use of relativism up here includes

01:53.520 --> 02:01.280
philosophers who think that they can actually have relativism while not denying knowledge.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.480
Being a relativist but not a skeptic.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.800
In a sense, saying knowledge doesn't have to be objective.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.800
That it can be relative.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.680
Today we're covering this topic as it is presented in the middle chapter by philosopher

02:19.680 --> 02:22.920
Paul O'Grady and that's the citation in the corner.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.520
So I won't be covering all of epistemology which is virtually impossible to do in one

02:27.520 --> 02:32.160
video, it will be more of a surface covering of this major branch of philosophy which can

02:32.160 --> 02:36.920
still be a great source for someone to understand the kind of things going on in epistemology

02:36.920 --> 02:38.680
in a more general sense.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.720
But the conversation is going to be framed in terms of how different knowledge can be

02:42.720 --> 02:48.800
or how relative things can get in epistemology as discussed by Paul O'Grady, whose book

02:48.800 --> 02:52.640
I've chosen to present here, even though certainly some of these debates have continued

02:52.640 --> 02:55.000
past the time of his book being published.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.720
So you don't have to watch anything else if you don't want to even though I may be

02:58.720 --> 03:03.560
suggesting other videos at times in this one, just take it more of a signpost.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.680
It will still be a great standalone video for someone new to generally grasp the kind

03:07.680 --> 03:11.760
of issues going on here even if you're not interested in relativism or whoever this

03:11.760 --> 03:12.880
philosopher is.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.880
But if you will allow me to give some background first before we start talking about epistemology.

03:17.880 --> 03:23.080
Paul O'Grady is a philosopher who investigated relativism in many different cognitive areas

03:23.080 --> 03:27.760
and I mean cognitive because he doesn't want to talk about merely morals you know like

03:27.760 --> 03:31.840
what's right and wrong or aesthetics like what counts as beautiful.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.200
Those things can be relative to different people or cultures or not, who knows, we're

03:36.200 --> 03:38.120
not talking about that though.

03:38.120 --> 03:43.920
Our concerns here are about if even things like truth or logic or today if knowledge

03:43.920 --> 03:46.080
can be relative to.

03:46.080 --> 03:52.960
And before you think that you have a very clear and obvious answer please go watch this

03:52.960 --> 03:59.960
video I made on his first chapter, it will in some sense convey the power of this weapon.

03:59.960 --> 04:06.120
But O'Grady does then go on to battle in these two areas specifically against relativization

04:06.240 --> 04:09.360
and those are what I call the limits of this weapon.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.040
And that's what I was really interested in, that's what I even came here for.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.720
I didn't want to have to cover everything in his book.

04:15.720 --> 04:21.400
So I already covered his first powerful and awesome battle on the front of truth and also

04:21.400 --> 04:26.880
covered the kind of intricacies of logic since he did utilize the principle of logic in order

04:26.880 --> 04:30.560
to battle against relativization on the front of truth.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.520
But after that I just wanted to go straight to his next battle where he defends against

04:34.520 --> 04:35.840
relativization.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.880
So if you're interested please do go check out these first battles if you'd like.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.040
They are pretty good and certainly if you're less familiar with and want to come to grips

04:44.040 --> 04:49.200
with how there can be relativism even about things like logic this video can help quite

04:49.200 --> 04:50.200
a bit.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.840
To explain how in fact one actually can be a relativist when it comes to logic, that

04:54.840 --> 04:59.720
there are different kinds of logic and what actual philosophers and logicians and maybe

04:59.720 --> 05:03.240
computer scientists I guess mean when we say logic.

05:03.240 --> 05:10.120
In any case O'Grady allows relativism both here and here but here it is limited by rationality

05:10.120 --> 05:13.360
where he will argue against relativization.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.680
So like I said at first I was just gonna skip these chapters but then I realized that one

05:17.680 --> 05:22.120
might not really appreciate what he's gonna be doing in that final battle of his without

05:22.120 --> 05:26.440
knowledge of some of what happens here because he actually does reference it and in part

05:26.440 --> 05:33.200
his strategy is to accommodate the relativist away from here into one of these other areas.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.080
So I decided to try and make a quick short video about both of these chapters to some

05:37.080 --> 05:42.160
degree not my normal in depth line by line citation and standard of production you know

05:42.160 --> 05:46.160
maybe lower quality audio or less visuals I don't know.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.720
So I did one on ontology already which for our sake is pretty much a discussion about

05:50.720 --> 05:54.160
the world and how the world can be relative.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.520
And for that video I just made it very general about the general battles going on in that

05:58.520 --> 06:03.200
field and how O'Grady kind of presents it but not cited perfectly down to the line and

06:03.200 --> 06:07.880
not going over everything O'Grady says just finally saying where O'Grady lands on the

06:07.880 --> 06:12.560
issue like I don't want it to be overly visually produced or anything just wanted it to be

06:12.560 --> 06:17.720
quick but it seems like I may have let it go a little bit out of hand there it got mad

06:17.720 --> 06:18.720
visual.

06:18.720 --> 06:23.440
So for this video actually this is my second time doing it the first time doing it I went

06:23.440 --> 06:28.480
super fast and super quick just sticking to line by line citation of everything that happened

06:29.160 --> 06:31.960
but it seemed like it was too fast.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.040
So I'm going to slow it down technically I already did the work I've already made

06:36.040 --> 06:40.600
a lot of the visualizations although it's still not up to par to my normal standard

06:40.600 --> 06:45.200
and maybe the explanations is not even as in depth or as perfect an explanation as I

06:45.200 --> 06:51.040
normally would do so this video isn't my norm kind of video keep that in mind I want

06:51.040 --> 06:55.760
it to be at least kind of understandable what's basically going on in epistemology at least

06:55.760 --> 07:00.320
in terms of what's happening with relativism and what O'Grady's final position is.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.840
So let's get through this chapter together and if you don't care for this chapter you

07:03.840 --> 07:08.160
can just jump to that final battle if that's all you really wanted to but you know here

07:08.160 --> 07:12.280
we are in epistemology and if you're interested in epistemology this video can definitely

07:12.280 --> 07:16.160
maybe help in some kind of more general sense I don't know.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.320
But let's begin.

07:17.320 --> 07:22.360
So he presents two main positions that believe yes you can have relativism in knowledge but

07:22.360 --> 07:28.080
not be a skeptic a stronger position and a weaker position the stronger position believes

07:28.080 --> 07:32.840
that different cultures and historical epochs have different standards for assessing knowledge

07:32.840 --> 07:37.720
and thus different sets of beliefs there's no shared point from which to judge implying

07:37.720 --> 07:42.960
they are completely cut off from each other which is a problem of incommensurability no

07:42.960 --> 07:45.160
shared point to measure.

07:45.160 --> 07:50.080
Judgment isn't possible from the outside one can only judge from within its own standards

07:50.080 --> 07:52.880
each epoch judges itself.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.640
One problem for philosophers who hold this position is that in their own practice they

07:56.640 --> 08:02.200
seem to be making claims that transcend particular cultures so it's taken as self-defeating.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.400
One way to say this is that they want to deny that there's necessarily anything shared among

08:06.400 --> 08:11.680
all of them that one cannot judge among them but in doing so they are speaking about all

08:11.680 --> 08:16.040
of them in some general sense as if that is something that they all have in common and

08:16.040 --> 08:20.600
so they are judging them to be in such a way in this general sense so they're doing what

08:20.600 --> 08:22.680
they claim shouldn't be possible.

08:22.680 --> 08:27.160
And don't mind my commentary if it doesn't help but this is basically self-defeat and

08:27.160 --> 08:32.560
it is a massive running theme when it comes to facing this kind of opponent so they need

08:32.560 --> 08:37.360
to be able to show that they can hold this position without being self-defeating.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.680
Both Richard Rorty and Steven Stitch try to do this and both of these figures will come

08:41.680 --> 08:45.360
back again in the battle on rationality chapter 5.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.400
Now a weaker version of this does admit relativization can happen even in things like logic and math

08:51.400 --> 08:57.040
and geometry or knowledge based on the a priori and they're supported with real world examples

08:57.040 --> 09:02.500
like the change from Euclidean geometry, Aristotelian logic, Newtonian physics which all used to

09:02.500 --> 09:08.640
be taken as absolute non-relative stuff but with developments in the 19th and 20th century

09:08.640 --> 09:13.160
it's pretty clear we can have alternative geometry, different kinds of logical and mathematical

09:13.160 --> 09:16.380
calculi even and even new physics.

09:16.380 --> 09:20.640
And in terms of that logic part again if you would like examples of different logics and

09:20.640 --> 09:25.080
how that could work please check out my video covering his discussion about alternative

09:25.080 --> 09:26.280
logic.

09:26.280 --> 09:31.840
But while this position is open to relativization about even those things there is still a limited

09:31.840 --> 09:37.680
amount of alternatives not an infinite variety of alternatives about those things and also

09:37.680 --> 09:42.800
it's still a limited form of relativism in terms of using one or an alternative system

09:42.960 --> 09:45.880
that there's still a universal way of judging among them.

09:45.880 --> 09:52.000
So both of these are epistemological relativism one is stronger which he calls radical epistemological

09:52.000 --> 09:57.600
relativism where all judgments are relative to cultural and historical epochs no universal

09:57.600 --> 10:04.120
standard at all all beliefs thus relativized to those separate and incommensurable epochs

10:04.120 --> 10:09.840
and the weaker or as it is called by O'Grady the moderate epistemological relativists still

10:09.880 --> 10:15.360
holds that a priori judgments are indeed relative to different systems so there can be alternative

10:15.360 --> 10:20.480
accounts of the a priori knowledge knowledge like math or logic things that we can have

10:20.480 --> 10:26.040
based on pure reasoning without even any experience but on the other hand there's still one universal

10:26.040 --> 10:29.200
way of judging all those alternative systems.

10:29.200 --> 10:33.000
And before making the case for this latter position which Paul O'Grady holds he first

10:33.000 --> 10:37.840
wants to discuss the difference between relativism and skepticism and kind of trace how relativism

10:37.840 --> 10:42.880
kind of came out as a way of responding to skepticism and hey in epistemology talking

10:42.880 --> 10:46.960
about skepticism was pretty good place to start but after we're done talking about

10:46.960 --> 10:52.160
skepticism and the responses to it then we'll talk about the main two big battles in modern

10:52.160 --> 10:58.880
epistemological warfare which is foundationalism versus coherentism and externalism versus

10:58.880 --> 11:00.600
internalism.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.200
After he's done discussing both of these things then we'll go back to his discussion

11:04.200 --> 11:10.040
of the radical versus the moderate epistemological relativists and why he prefers the latter.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.280
So first, skepticism.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.440
Well to be clear the skeptic definitely thinks that if they're all alternatives to what

11:16.440 --> 11:20.520
we think to be true then we don't really have knowledge and should just suspend our

11:20.520 --> 11:25.880
belief but the epistemological relativists hold that you can have alternatives but having

11:25.880 --> 11:30.440
alternatives doesn't necessarily mean that we don't know and that those alternatives

11:30.440 --> 11:33.160
can also actually constitute knowledge.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.480
Now there's been many skeptical positions in history for example the ancients thought

11:36.480 --> 11:40.600
that being skeptical was a kind of ethical position against holding belief solely on

11:40.600 --> 11:46.000
dogma based just in faith which may have been used in religious and political or social

11:46.000 --> 11:47.880
oppression of the people.

11:47.880 --> 11:53.080
Other philosophers use it as a tool to test our knowledge to see what we can even be skeptical

11:53.080 --> 11:54.080
about.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.900
If we can be doubtful about it it meant that we didn't really know it.

11:57.900 --> 12:02.200
So philosophers kind of tried to use doubt to uproot things that we didn't know to see

12:02.200 --> 12:06.640
what we have left things that were indubitable things that couldn't be doubted and tried

12:06.640 --> 12:11.280
to build our knowledge based on those undoubtedly indubitable things.

12:11.280 --> 12:16.040
Now some philosophers are doubtful about having any knowledge at all while others are doubtful

12:16.040 --> 12:22.640
about some specific things like the external world or that other minds exist or the possibility

12:22.640 --> 12:27.600
of moral knowledge or even that there could be knowledge based on pure thought.

12:27.720 --> 12:39.760
Now for this next section we're just gonna take this one as our main example of the skeptic.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.640
So just so you have an idea of why somebody would be skeptical about the external world

12:44.640 --> 12:49.360
I'm gonna give you kind of a more modern example for this a more modern thought experiment

12:49.360 --> 12:54.520
that of the possibility of having been born completely within a computer simulated environment

12:54.520 --> 12:55.880
for example.

12:55.880 --> 13:00.160
Nothing about how things appear to you within the simulated environment may connect to how

13:00.160 --> 13:02.760
things really are in the actual world.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.480
In such a situation all of your sensations are merely a part of the simulation, in fact

13:07.480 --> 13:10.360
even your body would be a part of the simulation.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.040
Maybe in the real world you don't actually have two legs and arms.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.720
As if perhaps you're just a brain with electrodes being plugged in and just being given sensations

13:18.720 --> 13:20.520
of sights and sounds and smells.

13:20.520 --> 13:25.080
I mean technically in that situation you wouldn't really know if there really are trees or birds

13:25.080 --> 13:29.880
if they really exist in that external world but also since all of our science or information

13:29.880 --> 13:33.960
we were told that science has is based on that simulation, we wouldn't even know if

13:33.960 --> 13:35.560
we are brains.

13:35.560 --> 13:40.040
And in this way it seems always possible to be doubtful about the external world.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.720
But that's just a thought experiment, don't worry about it too much, the point is that

13:43.720 --> 13:46.600
you can be skeptical about the external world.

13:46.600 --> 13:51.360
And so O'Grady outlines two strategies to respond to this kind of skepticism, one that

13:51.360 --> 13:55.520
is to meet the challenge of the skeptic, to actually find beliefs that can't be doubted

13:55.520 --> 14:00.160
even in this kind of situation and then build our knowledge off of those as a kind of secure

14:00.160 --> 14:04.760
base and the other one is to show that the skeptical challenge is not something to be

14:04.760 --> 14:11.080
taken seriously at all, it's kind of more of a rejection strategy to deny the skepticism.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.080
Now most philosophic tradition is about that first strategy, so if you're just starting

14:15.160 --> 14:18.840
philosophy you're probably going to learn one of these two things if not both, I mean

14:18.840 --> 14:20.720
you should probably learn about both.

14:20.720 --> 14:25.440
But as he presents them there's the empiricist and the rationalist take on this kind of strategy.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.000
For the empirical strategy the idea is that beliefs immediately deprived from perception

14:31.000 --> 14:35.360
often called the given were proposed as many as immune to doubt.

14:35.360 --> 14:40.120
So if you think of it, simulation or not, the given may be that I'm having the sensation

14:40.120 --> 14:41.880
of red right now.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.880
That's still true no matter what.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.840
Not conceptualizing what that red is about or what it's coming from or if it connects

14:47.840 --> 14:50.720
to anything beyond what I perceive, nothing like that.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.440
It's supposed to be non-conceptualized experience.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.400
That's still something I know directly no matter what situation it is.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.800
But hey that's just my example of what the given might be.

15:01.800 --> 15:07.320
Really the details of what the given is varied a lot among philosophers but they did have

15:07.320 --> 15:12.160
all in common the idea that knowledge began with the data of the senses.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.000
That's what makes it empirical.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.960
These immediately derived perceptions, the given, were taken to be safe from skepticism

15:19.960 --> 15:23.680
and so we can build our secure knowledge strictly off those things.

15:23.680 --> 15:28.000
Now that approach may seem promising to you but the problem that led most to reject this

15:28.000 --> 15:33.880
kind of move was the issue of giving an account of how that stuff can even have data that

15:33.880 --> 15:35.960
we aren't skeptical about.

15:35.960 --> 15:41.760
The whole point was that it was so basic it were below the level of conceptualization.

15:41.760 --> 15:48.720
But once you conceptualize it in order to build off it, it no longer is safe from skepticism.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.320
And we kind of already spoke about this issue a lot in that ontology video so if you're

15:53.320 --> 15:58.120
interested in what's going on here, how is this an accurate criticism, please go check

15:58.120 --> 16:03.840
out that video first or maybe even the power of relativism, the first chapter, to see what's

16:03.960 --> 16:04.960
being said here.

16:04.960 --> 16:09.760
That the idea that we can just build off simply how we see things is actually a kind of naive

16:09.760 --> 16:13.000
position at this point, we've moved way past that.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.440
Anyway, for this reason, Ogrity says the empiricist's attempt at meeting the skeptical challenge

16:17.440 --> 16:19.000
has failed.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.160
Now on the rationalist's attempt to meet this challenge is most notably Rene Descartes

16:24.160 --> 16:28.040
who actually thought there were some kind of special properties of certain beliefs that

16:28.040 --> 16:33.640
made them indudable, that made them the kind of beliefs that can't ever be doubted, namely

16:33.640 --> 16:36.400
that they must be clear and distinct.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.320
But when pressed to explain these properties, how they allow them to justify other propositions

16:41.320 --> 16:48.320
and why they would entail certainty, as Ogrity remarks, that did not prove compelling.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.880
So both of these failed.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.640
What about strategy 2?

16:52.640 --> 16:56.920
In terms of kind of denying or rejecting the kind of philosophic doubts that we have here

16:56.920 --> 17:03.320
about the external world, Ogrity covers two philosophers, namely Wittgenstein and Quine.

17:03.320 --> 17:08.200
Now I already have done a video on Wittgenstein and if you want a little better understanding

17:08.200 --> 17:13.920
if you're unfamiliar with his latter philosophy, please do check it out, it's even less I guess

17:13.920 --> 17:18.600
formal than this video, it's more of me kind of talking from the top of my head to kind

17:18.600 --> 17:23.280
of compensate for a section where he talked about Wittgenstein earlier in one of his chapters

17:23.280 --> 17:25.240
that I just didn't think was really great.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.200
Nevertheless, I think in my opinion it's a pretty good video of giving an understanding

17:29.200 --> 17:33.560
of Wittgenstein and how he deals with this kind of skepticism, and how he would deal

17:33.560 --> 17:39.600
with this kind of skepticism as being ungrounded, and also how Wittgenstein's philosophy loans

17:39.600 --> 17:44.240
itself to being used by relativists even though he didn't want that.

17:44.240 --> 17:48.400
But Ogrity comments that even if we do take Wittgenstein's approach to show that these

17:48.400 --> 17:54.200
doubts are ungrounded, it changes our conception of philosophy, to see it more as therapeutic

17:54.200 --> 17:57.160
and as a removing kind of system building.

17:57.160 --> 18:01.840
But also he remarks how some philosophers still take some initial lessons from Wittgenstein

18:01.840 --> 18:07.080
to do away with the skepticism but still feel they can go on and continue doing philosophy

18:07.080 --> 18:10.160
in a more traditional systemic fashion.

18:10.160 --> 18:14.880
And it seems to me that this includes using Wittgenstein's philosophy about how they're

18:14.880 --> 18:19.360
being different language games and therefore different standards within each language game

18:19.360 --> 18:22.840
to then be relativistic about almost anything.

18:22.920 --> 18:27.920
This even includes rationality, but Ogrity will address that rationality thing in chapter

18:27.920 --> 18:29.800
5 like we've already mentioned.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.960
Now Ogrity kind of makes a sort of similar point about Quine then too, which I also made

18:33.960 --> 18:38.680
a kind of quick rough video as a starting point about Quine also, which I hope is done

18:38.680 --> 18:43.240
by now, but he really does speak about Quine in both of these middle chapters and really

18:43.240 --> 18:48.040
didn't want to have to present Ogrity's version of Quine twice, so I just made that

18:48.040 --> 18:52.760
video so I can reference it in both of these videos, so you can check that out.

18:52.760 --> 18:58.640
And it will explain its relation both to ontology and its relation to epistemology and so here

18:58.640 --> 19:01.080
also in regards to skepticism.

19:01.080 --> 19:06.280
It will explain how he finds that doubts arising from scientific knowledge can also be answered

19:06.280 --> 19:11.200
therefore with scientific knowledge, from where it arises rather than taking those doubts

19:11.200 --> 19:13.600
to some extreme unanswerable level.

19:13.600 --> 19:18.360
Like I said though, I think Ogrity is making a similar point about Quine as he did Wittgenstein,

19:18.360 --> 19:22.440
that even though he accounts for how different they are, he says that Wittgenstein's philosophy

19:22.440 --> 19:27.240
led to a change in conception of philosophy as more of a form of therapy to remove a kind

19:27.240 --> 19:30.900
of attempt to build a transcendental philosophical structure.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.680
And even for Quine, his philosophy changes the conception of philosophy since it's no

19:34.680 --> 19:39.160
longer seen as different from science, it's no longer seen as separate, they are both

19:39.160 --> 19:41.180
simply a part of the same web.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.980
But also like Wittgenstein, there are philosophers that could actually take Quine's position

19:44.980 --> 19:50.300
but don't go on to hold science as particularly prized web of belief that Quine did, which

19:50.300 --> 19:54.860
was a non-relativist epistemology, and so they use Quine's philosophy to deal with

19:54.860 --> 20:00.500
the skepticism but then go on to become epistemological relativist, drawing a parallel to Wittgenstein,

20:00.500 --> 20:04.780
how his philosophy is used too to be relativistic about epistemology.

20:04.780 --> 20:09.500
In summary for this section about skepticism in terms of our epistemological discussion,

20:09.500 --> 20:14.300
it shows that the more promising solutions to skepticism, what we are calling strategy

20:14.300 --> 20:18.700
too, which is the rejection of the skeptical challenge, they actually can be used to lead

20:18.700 --> 20:25.100
to epistemological relativism, but also it requires a change in our conception of philosophy,

20:25.100 --> 20:26.980
and we'll talk more about that later.

20:26.980 --> 20:31.980
But that's the point here, about this traditional problem about skepticism in epistemology has

20:31.980 --> 20:37.300
in more recent time with more recent and modern strategy led to some taking on epistemological

20:37.300 --> 20:38.940
relativist positions.

20:38.940 --> 20:44.500
But now let's move on to the main two big battles in modern epistemological warfare,

20:44.500 --> 20:50.260
which is foundationalism versus coherentism, and externalism versus internalism.

20:50.260 --> 20:54.940
Now these two former things were taken to be absolute, and these two latter things were

20:54.940 --> 20:57.420
taken to be more relativistic.

20:57.420 --> 21:01.980
But in this section, Paul O'Grady is going to show that this isn't necessarily so, that

21:01.980 --> 21:07.020
actually all of these positions can have both elements of relativism and elements of an

21:07.020 --> 21:13.580
absolutist position, that even the foundationalists and the externalists can be made relativistic,

21:13.580 --> 21:18.860
and that both the coherentist and internalist positions don't have to lead to any kind of

21:18.860 --> 21:24.300
extreme radical relativism, that there can be some kind of absolutist constraints on them

21:24.300 --> 21:25.300
too.

21:25.300 --> 21:30.140
So before we get into these main two big battles, I just want to explain something called inferential

21:30.140 --> 21:32.140
justification first.

21:32.140 --> 21:36.220
And for those of us who are not familiar with formal logic, let me just kind of loosely

21:36.220 --> 21:40.700
explain the idea using an example of basic arithmetic, basic math.

21:40.700 --> 21:44.820
So look at this example, 2 plus 2 equals 4.

21:44.820 --> 21:51.540
Now the justification of 4 is actually inferred from these earlier premises, and so in this

21:51.540 --> 21:58.180
way, the truth of these is being preserved into the conclusion of 4.

21:58.180 --> 22:02.660
Now it's kind of weird to talk about math like this for me, so in a more formal logical

22:02.660 --> 22:08.900
symbolic language, basically the truth of these premises are preserved in the conclusion,

22:08.900 --> 22:16.420
that if p then q, and we have p, we use something called modus ponens to infer q.

22:16.420 --> 22:23.220
The truth of q is inferentially justified given that these former premises are true.

22:23.220 --> 22:29.820
If it's true that if p then q, and if it's true that p, we can therefore infer and justify

22:29.820 --> 22:31.340
q.

22:31.340 --> 22:37.380
So justification in this sense is kind of moving from these earlier premises to this latter

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
one.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.380
Keep that in mind.

22:39.380 --> 22:44.980
In this way, it's usually taken that belief is justified and so inferentially from another

22:44.980 --> 22:49.580
belief, and justification is just thereafter passed on.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.900
So anyway, let's look firstly at foundationalism.

22:52.900 --> 22:58.140
Now we have already in some sense kind of spoken about this earlier with the empirical strategy,

22:58.140 --> 23:03.300
but anyway, the foundationalist idea is that all of our beliefs, justification just don't

23:03.300 --> 23:08.940
go back forever and ever, though there is some battle about this idea of going back forever,

23:08.940 --> 23:14.540
which actually goes past the time of O'Grady's book between Klein and Gannett, or Ginnett?

23:14.540 --> 23:17.140
Once again, I don't really have friends to tell me how to say things.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.140
So subscribe.

23:18.140 --> 23:22.860
Either way, both positions here take the idea of it going back forever as obviously untenable.

23:22.860 --> 23:28.460
Anyway, also for the foundationalist, for them it doesn't just cycle back on to itself,

23:28.460 --> 23:34.660
instead there must be some basic original first beliefs that aren't inferentially justified

23:34.660 --> 23:41.140
from other beliefs, that these basic beliefs are special and in some way self-justifying.

23:41.140 --> 23:47.220
And higher level premises are just built upon them in a process called epistemic ascent.

23:47.220 --> 23:52.300
So maybe as a kind of quick simple image we might imagine an upside down triangle.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.620
While this kind of seems to imply for most foundationalists then that knowledge can only

23:56.620 --> 24:02.580
be one structure, as based on these basic beliefs, there is no room for relativism of

24:02.580 --> 24:04.060
our beliefs then.

24:04.060 --> 24:10.460
But O'Grady shows with Karnap that even these basic beliefs, our so called basic ones, can

24:10.460 --> 24:15.700
actually be characterized in different ways, as relative to our theoretical models.

24:15.700 --> 24:20.700
The theories that we have actually shape how we interpret what those basic beliefs even

24:20.700 --> 24:25.860
are, and we can choose different models for our different aims, different purposes, but

24:25.860 --> 24:32.420
in so doing so changing our theories we even end up changing those so called basic beliefs,

24:32.420 --> 24:37.820
in ways that show that they can't actually be taken as pre-theoretical I guess.

24:37.820 --> 24:42.180
We can't actually take them as just prime and evident in of themselves.

24:42.180 --> 24:47.380
But also with Karnap, the whole epistemic ascent itself can actually be relative and

24:47.380 --> 24:50.820
different based on which model we are using.

24:50.820 --> 24:55.860
And to make that sort of idea clear, once again, I do have a video on logic that makes

24:55.860 --> 25:01.020
this kind of idea more clear about how we can have different logics in different models,

25:01.020 --> 25:06.580
and how that can entail different inferential rules that allow us to build in different

25:06.580 --> 25:07.580
ways.

25:07.580 --> 25:11.260
One of these models isn't inherently more right or wrong.

25:11.260 --> 25:16.100
We can in fact just select them based on our purposes and for Karnap those purposes were

25:16.100 --> 25:17.500
used for scientists.

25:17.500 --> 25:21.260
Anyway, so please do go check out that video, okay?

25:21.260 --> 25:26.300
The point here anyway was that relativism can still arise when it comes to foundationalism

25:26.300 --> 25:30.300
too, even though it's normally thought of as being strictly absolutist.

25:30.300 --> 25:35.220
Now the coherentist position, which is the opposition to foundationalism, is much more

25:35.220 --> 25:37.100
like a larger web.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.380
For them they believe there are no basic beliefs.

25:40.380 --> 25:44.380
There can be no beliefs that aren't justified by other beliefs.

25:44.380 --> 25:49.740
And to combat the foundationalists that accuse them of just being circular in their reasoning,

25:49.740 --> 25:55.980
well they say that justification is non-linear, that justification is more holistic, justification

25:55.980 --> 25:59.540
coming from multiple beliefs within the matrix of beliefs.

25:59.540 --> 26:03.540
Now Ogrity summons one of the most popular images that kind of give visualization to

26:03.540 --> 26:07.220
the coherentist picture, which is the image of Neruth's boat.

26:07.220 --> 26:11.020
An image that I'm kind of presenting here in a kind of more simple fashion, but hey

26:11.020 --> 26:12.460
I think the point comes across.

26:12.460 --> 26:16.300
The idea is that no one plank in this boat is essential.

26:16.300 --> 26:21.300
You can actually remove anyone if needed and replace any plank at any one time.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.860
But not the whole thing, which means there's no foundational essential plank.

26:25.860 --> 26:29.820
When we remove any one plank we can make other adjustments in other places to make sure we

26:29.820 --> 26:33.100
still stay afloat while we're replacing it for example.

26:33.100 --> 26:37.220
And just to note, this whole idea of Neruth's boat is actually kind of in part based on

26:37.220 --> 26:38.700
the Ship of Theseus.

26:38.700 --> 26:43.380
In the Ship of Theseus you can replace one plank at a time all the way through the ship

26:43.380 --> 26:46.580
so that it ends up being completely different.

26:46.580 --> 26:51.580
And when it comes to the Ship of Theseus the question is, is it still the same ship if

26:51.580 --> 26:53.940
it's completely different by the end?

26:53.940 --> 26:57.620
But there's no clear point at which we count it as being suddenly a new ship.

26:57.620 --> 27:02.660
Anyway, this discussion is not about the Ship of Theseus, but just the idea that in fact

27:02.660 --> 27:08.660
the entire thing can change because there's no one essential, foundational, or most important

27:08.660 --> 27:13.060
belief, or thing that we know a part of our entire ship.

27:13.060 --> 27:17.940
Anyway, so the big deal with Coherentism in terms of relativism is that it seems that

27:17.940 --> 27:23.780
we can have an endless number of different systems that even contradict with each other.

27:23.780 --> 27:28.360
Since all it needs to be justified is be coherent within its own system.

27:28.360 --> 27:33.180
And hey, if you think of it, many people suffering from extreme paranoid schizophrenia have large

27:33.180 --> 27:38.420
structures of beliefs that they are completely obsessed about trying to make perfectly coherent

27:38.580 --> 27:41.140
or take conspiracy theorists for example.

27:41.140 --> 27:45.900
They might have huge numbers of beliefs that they think interlock and connect in so many

27:45.900 --> 27:51.140
different ways that they are completely obsessed about making perfectly connected and internally

27:51.140 --> 27:52.640
coherent too.

27:52.640 --> 27:57.160
But what they believe still contradicts what we believe in some ways or many ways even.

27:57.160 --> 28:02.900
But if we take every system as being equally justified, then this is taken to be radical

28:02.900 --> 28:03.900
relativism.

28:03.900 --> 28:07.900
And to deal with this kind of situation of how there can be seemingly contradictory

28:07.900 --> 28:12.660
different Coherentist belief, in my phrasing at least I'll say it, that some actually

28:12.660 --> 28:16.080
believe well you know you just take these web of beliefs and you mash them together

28:16.080 --> 28:20.180
to make one big one, one big web of belief that's for everyone.

28:20.180 --> 28:25.060
And some take that to be what's happening with the whole project of unifying science.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.140
That's one way to deal with that kind of problem.

28:27.140 --> 28:33.020
Others try to mark out some systems as unique or special by appealing to some kind of transcendental

28:33.020 --> 28:35.500
arguments about the nature of belief.

28:35.500 --> 28:41.340
How some beliefs are specially known in some way, or sort of fusing elements of both foundationalism

28:41.340 --> 28:43.060
and Coherentism together.

28:43.060 --> 28:47.500
Anyway, because of those it seems to imply that it's possible that there can be one

28:47.500 --> 28:49.140
correct system.

28:49.140 --> 28:55.580
That even in Coherentism, there can be an absolutist and non-relativist picture.

28:55.580 --> 29:00.620
But if there can be many different systems, one falls into extreme relativism.

29:00.620 --> 29:05.240
And the moderate position is that while there can be different systems, there's a limitation

29:05.240 --> 29:07.800
on how many alternatives there can be.

29:07.800 --> 29:12.800
Again, the stronger position is that there can be many globally different systems, systems

29:12.800 --> 29:15.460
that are completely different from each other.

29:15.460 --> 29:20.760
And the weaker position is the idea that there is actually just distinct local subgroups

29:20.760 --> 29:22.860
within a larger system.

29:22.860 --> 29:28.780
The radical epistemological relativist uses a Coherentist picture, but with multiple systems

29:28.780 --> 29:31.880
and no limits on how many there can be.

29:31.880 --> 29:36.820
The moderate epistemological relativist is one where there can be local subgroups within

29:36.820 --> 29:38.780
a more global system.

29:38.780 --> 29:44.020
So to be clear, relativism can happen both with foundationalism and Coherentism.

29:44.020 --> 29:48.020
But later when we talk about both of these positions, they're both going to be using

29:48.020 --> 29:53.740
a more Coherentist structure, just a matter of whether or not it's radically relativistic

29:53.740 --> 29:55.780
or moderately so.

29:55.780 --> 30:01.660
But onward to the next big battle in epistemology, externalism versus internalism.

30:01.660 --> 30:06.920
Now most of the epistemological tradition has been internalized till recently.

30:06.920 --> 30:12.080
Now traditionally in the philosophic tradition, we used to define knowledge as being justified

30:12.080 --> 30:13.720
true belief.

30:13.720 --> 30:19.000
That you had a belief, you had good reasons for believing what you do, and it is actually

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
true.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.320
Then we would say you have knowledge.

30:22.320 --> 30:27.240
But then this guy named Edmund Gettier came along and basically showed that we can make

30:27.240 --> 30:32.780
cases where somebody does have good reasons to believe what they do and it happens to

30:32.780 --> 30:37.580
turn out to be true but we still wouldn't say they really knew.

30:37.580 --> 30:42.860
So it showed that JTB wasn't enough, that there probably had to be something more or

30:42.860 --> 30:47.140
maybe even that this whole enterprise of defining knowledge in this way is not a good one but

30:47.140 --> 30:48.580
that's my personal opinion.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.460
But don't worry about what that special case was or what to do instead.

30:52.480 --> 30:57.960
The whole point here is that we still held that knowledge generally had to have an entailed

30:57.960 --> 31:03.480
truth but that somebody could be justified in believing something even though it didn't

31:03.480 --> 31:08.240
have to be true, that it was possible to be fully justified and have the good reasons

31:08.240 --> 31:12.040
to believe something even though it turns out to be false.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.520
And in such a case we would say you don't have knowledge.

31:14.520 --> 31:20.280
So this question about internalism and externalism isn't about knowledge itself, it's specifically

31:20.280 --> 31:22.360
about justification.

31:22.360 --> 31:27.260
And the internalists hold that the reasons why somebody should be considered justified

31:27.260 --> 31:33.540
in believing what they do should be available to the person who holds the justified belief.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.520
It should be internally available to them.

31:36.520 --> 31:41.980
But the externalist says that one can be justified for believing what they do for reasons outside

31:41.980 --> 31:47.300
of what is consciously known or available to the person who has those true beliefs.

31:47.300 --> 31:52.080
The externalist feels we can actually point to certain mechanisms that might be outside

31:52.100 --> 31:57.480
of what we are aware of that still nevertheless produce likely true beliefs in us.

31:57.480 --> 32:02.240
And because those mechanisms still produce true beliefs in us, that means we should still

32:02.240 --> 32:07.960
be considered justified if we used those mechanisms, even if we're not aware of what those mechanisms

32:07.960 --> 32:11.600
are or articulate how we got beliefs from those mechanisms.

32:11.600 --> 32:16.980
Such as perception, like seeing, maybe seeing and perception actually produces very likely

32:16.980 --> 32:18.240
beliefs in us.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.840
So we're still justified in believing what we do because we use that mechanism, even

32:22.840 --> 32:27.620
if we can't exactly explain why we believe what we do based on them.

32:27.620 --> 32:34.780
Now it's important to note, in this way externalists kind of have connected justification to truth.

32:34.780 --> 32:39.220
And this is a connection that the internalist doesn't necessitate at all.

32:39.220 --> 32:43.820
And so because of that, it might seem like since the externalist is connected to truth

32:43.840 --> 32:49.960
and since we've seen that truth is not relative, that's an earlier battle that Paul O'Grady had,

32:49.960 --> 32:54.640
we would say that then there's no room for relativism in externalism.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.760
Because truth isn't relative and they're supposed to be connected, right?

32:58.760 --> 33:04.720
Well, O'Grady shows with Alvin Goldman's Reliabilist account that this isn't necessarily so.

33:04.720 --> 33:09.480
That there can be different frameworks that provide systems of rules for judging if a belief

33:09.480 --> 33:12.800
is justified or not, called J-Rules.

33:12.820 --> 33:17.660
And these rules don't even have to be consciously known, but can be applied from without to

33:17.660 --> 33:21.660
give an objective judgment if a belief is justified.

33:21.660 --> 33:26.660
But there's a criterion of rightness for when it comes to judging which framework succeeds

33:26.660 --> 33:28.780
in capturing justification.

33:28.780 --> 33:34.700
So the criterion establishes the correct framework, which establishes if something is justified.

33:34.700 --> 33:39.780
And according to Goldman, epistemic terms like justified or not happens within these

33:39.780 --> 33:44.560
frameworks, but outside of them they're just descriptive language, so on the level

33:44.560 --> 33:49.160
of the criterion, he settles for the term of reliability.

33:49.160 --> 33:54.080
And technically there could be different frameworks that meet the same criterion.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.560
To be clear, Goldman doesn't say that these are culturally relative or anything like that,

33:58.560 --> 34:02.160
but they can be multiple within even an individual.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.720
If that seems unclear, don't worry about it.

34:04.720 --> 34:11.260
The point here for this video is that even the externalist has some room for relativism.

34:11.260 --> 34:16.860
But even in comparison to that, the internalists seem much more obviously open to relativism,

34:16.860 --> 34:21.220
as it appears there's no external constraint of their beliefs having to be true.

34:21.220 --> 34:25.060
Consider in one person's perspective, they could have all the good reasons to believe

34:25.060 --> 34:26.660
they know something.

34:26.660 --> 34:31.300
And he gives an example of himself possibly believing that a lecture will happen from

34:31.320 --> 34:36.360
an eminent philosopher, because he's seen the ad posters for it, and students have spoken

34:36.360 --> 34:40.560
to him about it, and he even sees someone being guided into the lecture hall, so he

34:40.560 --> 34:45.800
has many factors, perception, testimony, coherence, and they all come together to make

34:45.800 --> 34:51.360
him perfectly justified in believing a lecture is happening or going to happen.

34:51.360 --> 34:56.240
But it turns out, it's actually all an elaborate hoax set up by some students playing a trick

34:56.240 --> 34:57.400
on him.

34:57.400 --> 35:02.340
In this context, he was perfectly justified in believing there was a lecture happening.

35:02.340 --> 35:06.340
But in the context of the students who may have set up the hoax, they were completely

35:06.340 --> 35:09.660
justified in believing there was no lecture happening.

35:09.660 --> 35:14.580
So we had two valid justifications but opposing beliefs.

35:14.580 --> 35:19.820
So this led philosophers to think that maybe context matters for justification, context

35:19.820 --> 35:24.220
in terms of who's the one describing something as being justified or not.

35:24.220 --> 35:29.560
So instead of saying that S is justified in believing P, we now have that S is justified

35:29.560 --> 35:36.120
in believing P relative to context C. But what kind of context can we have?

35:36.120 --> 35:40.880
Well Ogrity says that contextualism has been investigating this kind of issue.

35:40.880 --> 35:47.600
So the point is that internalism kind of leads us into a discussion about contextualism.

35:47.600 --> 35:51.120
Differing knowledge standards apply in different contexts.

35:51.140 --> 35:55.380
For example, Mary knows her kids are in the yard because she just checked on them and

35:55.380 --> 35:57.780
she has no reason to think otherwise.

35:57.780 --> 36:02.140
So we might agree that yeah, Mary knows her kids are in the yard, she just checked.

36:02.140 --> 36:07.020
But also, we find out there's actually a kidnapper in the neighborhood.

36:07.020 --> 36:13.700
So now we think, oh well considering that, maybe she's not justified in knowing.

36:13.700 --> 36:17.020
Maybe she doesn't really know.

36:17.020 --> 36:22.280
Ogrity uses her own standards in her context to be able to say that she is fully justified

36:22.280 --> 36:24.920
to believe she knows where her kids are.

36:24.920 --> 36:31.480
But we use our standards given what we know to say that she's not justified.

36:31.480 --> 36:35.320
Now what makes us select different standards?

36:35.320 --> 36:40.040
Mark Heller says that it depends on our interest and the demands of the conversation we're

36:40.040 --> 36:41.040
having.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.600
But don't worry about where this goes.

36:43.620 --> 36:49.100
Mary tries tying this all up by saying that even if knowledge descriptions are contextually

36:49.100 --> 36:53.140
sensitive, it doesn't necessarily lead to extreme relativism.

36:53.140 --> 36:57.340
Because relative to a context within those standards, there's still an objective answer

36:57.340 --> 37:02.940
to whether or not S knows P, just like indexical sentences that use I or this.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.500
For example saying yeah, I am in Paris.

37:05.500 --> 37:09.100
Sure, the truth of that is relative to who's saying it.

37:09.100 --> 37:13.260
But once we know who's saying it, there's still a way of objectively evaluating if

37:13.260 --> 37:14.680
it's true.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.920
Meaning given the context, once we figure out what the context is, one can establish

37:18.920 --> 37:20.800
an absolute truth claim.

37:20.800 --> 37:25.120
But that's not the only contextualist argument that prevents a strong relativist reading

37:25.120 --> 37:26.120
of it.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.880
It still seems open and possible that there could be general epistemic standards that

37:29.880 --> 37:33.240
govern more local contextualized aspects.

37:33.240 --> 37:37.040
And that's actually kind of what he will argue for and give details of in his chapter

37:37.040 --> 37:38.040
5.

37:38.040 --> 37:42.600
But as a summary of this whole section of both these battles, basically despite what's

37:42.600 --> 37:46.940
normally assumed of all of these positions, they can both have elements of relativism

37:46.940 --> 37:49.340
and absolutism to some degree.

37:49.340 --> 37:54.220
And even if we take these normally assumed relativist positions, they don't necessarily

37:54.220 --> 37:56.980
have to lead to radical relativism then.

37:56.980 --> 38:00.860
We can have actually more moderate versions of relativism with them.

38:00.860 --> 38:05.060
So now we're going to deal with that conflict of radical epistemological relativist versus

38:05.060 --> 38:10.420
a moderate epistemological relativist position.

38:10.420 --> 38:15.800
For the radical epistemological relativist, he gives the examples of Rorty and Stitch.

38:15.800 --> 38:21.440
And I'm just going to be like fully, fully honest with you right now, I detest having

38:21.440 --> 38:23.480
to get into this mess.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.860
Getting into it here will be overly complicated in cumbersome.

38:26.860 --> 38:32.520
And ultimately I don't think it's very contributive to what we want to do with Ogrady anyway.

38:32.520 --> 38:36.200
Even if Rorty's challenges may be one that's more likely going to be coming from someone

38:36.220 --> 38:41.140
who we describe as a relativist, arguments that are going to be made against anyone trying

38:41.140 --> 38:45.340
to attempt to establish anything universal in any which way.

38:45.340 --> 38:50.100
Still, a lot of the descriptions about the failings of philosophy and the presumptions

38:50.100 --> 38:56.260
of objectivity and the denial of trying to assume a kind of transcended structure and

38:56.260 --> 39:03.100
all that, you know, which isn't an inaccurate criticism of the old philosophical tradition,

39:03.120 --> 39:09.080
but it actually results in a kind of unnecessary wholesale rejection of the role of philosophy

39:09.080 --> 39:10.240
itself.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.280
But you know what, let me actually read the sort of conclusion Paulo Grady has when it

39:14.280 --> 39:18.600
comes to Rorty and Stitch, so we can get a kind of sense of the criticism Ogrady has

39:18.600 --> 39:24.360
for both of them, and also the kind of role that is still left for philosophy, even considering

39:24.360 --> 39:28.040
the accurate critiques that Rorty and Stitch might have.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.000
So first he says of Rorty.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.780
Rorty's view is just too extreme.

39:33.780 --> 39:39.420
Because one model of ontology, truth, rationality, epistemology, and so on fails, does not mean

39:39.420 --> 39:42.820
the whole philosophical enterprise fails.

39:42.820 --> 39:48.060
A fallible historically, politically, and scientifically attuned reflection on questions

39:48.060 --> 39:55.900
of meaning, truth, reason, and so on is philosophy, and is what people like Habermas, McDowell,

39:55.900 --> 40:00.580
Putnam and Quine, to mention just a few, are doing.

40:00.580 --> 40:07.320
One may disagree with him, indeed being part of the philosophers club seems to entail disagreeing,

40:07.320 --> 40:13.760
but it reflects too much of an all or nothing style of thinking to reject epistemology and

40:13.760 --> 40:20.040
metaphysics because certain versions of it haven't worked, and instead plump for social

40:20.040 --> 40:26.520
political analyses of truth, rationality, warrant, and so on.

40:26.520 --> 40:31.320
As Searle once remarked apropos Wittgenstein, just because his early theories of philosophy

40:31.320 --> 40:35.900
failed, he concluded that all philosophy was doomed to fail.

40:35.900 --> 40:43.420
In some forms of anti-philosophy, one can find enormous philosophical hubris lurking

40:43.420 --> 40:45.540
just beneath the surface.

40:45.540 --> 40:50.880
Rorty has done a great service in his criticism of the analytic tradition, forcing it to be

40:50.880 --> 40:52.700
more self-aware.

40:52.700 --> 41:00.560
However, self-criticism doesn't always mean self-annihilation, as Rorty seems to think

41:00.560 --> 41:01.560
in this case.

41:01.560 --> 41:06.080
I mean, I find these to be some pretty harsh words for Rorty, but also I very much like

41:06.080 --> 41:11.040
this quote because I think it's far more accurate to how and what philosophy is compared

41:11.040 --> 41:13.160
to the results of Rorty's conception.

41:13.160 --> 41:17.280
But anyway, let's look at what Paulo Grady says in response to both of them together

41:17.280 --> 41:18.440
now.

41:18.440 --> 41:24.500
What is common to both Stitch and Rorty is a tendency to set up dichotomies, as if they

41:24.500 --> 41:28.660
were mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the options.

41:28.660 --> 41:33.260
Rorty rejects the traditional conception of philosophy as seeking to find objectivity

41:33.260 --> 41:36.300
in the transcendent and non-human.

41:36.300 --> 41:41.020
Stitch rejects more recent attempts to do the same in this scientific world.

41:41.020 --> 41:47.100
Both have quite compelling cases to make against their opponents, however, they then both leap

41:47.120 --> 41:52.160
to a position that this is supposed to be the only alternative to the rejected position.

41:52.160 --> 41:56.960
Rorty speaks of intersubjective agreement as the new objectivity and Stitch talks of

41:56.960 --> 41:59.800
achieving diverse cognitive goals.

41:59.800 --> 42:04.600
The implication in both cases is that while these are meaningful occusions, it is a retreat

42:04.600 --> 42:10.720
to the rejected conception of philosophy to seek further explanation as to why certain

42:10.720 --> 42:16.320
goals and methods are preferable to others, and for what reasons communities come to agreement

42:16.340 --> 42:17.740
over issues.

42:17.740 --> 42:23.340
In fact, both are largely right in their rejection of traditional ways of explaining objectivity

42:23.340 --> 42:30.340
and cognitive success, but fall foul of explaining how objectivity emerges in the new conversational

42:31.060 --> 42:34.860
context other than saying it generally does.

42:34.860 --> 42:39.140
An important task for philosophers who are persuaded of the failure of some of these

42:39.140 --> 42:46.140
traditional projects, but who are dissatisfied by the skimpiness of explanation of how objectivity

42:46.280 --> 42:52.240
as intersubjectivity is supposed to work, is to try and establish how it does.

42:52.240 --> 42:56.320
A beginning for such a project is to look at a priori knowledge.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.640
So that's what O'Grady does next.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.440
Oh man, this video is huge.

43:01.440 --> 43:05.200
Okay, so I'm going to hit this last part of the video with some mad crunch time, and

43:05.200 --> 43:08.920
I'm kind of sorry for that, but don't worry, I will still explain what O'Grady's position

43:08.920 --> 43:12.480
is going to be in terms of epistemological relativism at the end.

43:12.480 --> 43:17.500
But this is the section then devoted to moderate epistemological relativism, and pretty much

43:17.500 --> 43:22.340
first he's going to explain why we can be relativist about even these things like logic

43:22.340 --> 43:26.860
and math and geometry, but then after explaining that he's going to explain why we should

43:26.860 --> 43:31.820
still have it be moderate, why there's still some use in there being relative, but also

43:31.820 --> 43:36.540
at the same time why we don't have to result in some kind of extreme relativism, what the

43:36.540 --> 43:39.260
limits of this relativism is.

43:39.260 --> 43:41.020
So anyway, let's talk about it.

43:41.020 --> 43:44.360
So he's starting this discussion with a priori knowledge.

43:44.360 --> 43:49.720
So basically, a priori knowledge was taken to be the best example of absolute knowledge

43:49.720 --> 43:54.240
prior to experience, and it was also thought to be necessarily true.

43:54.240 --> 43:59.000
But Kripke challenged this and shown that that relationship isn't actually always holding,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.960
that it doesn't have to be necessary.

44:00.960 --> 44:05.400
In any case, like I said, keep in mind, the standard candidates for what a priori knowledge

44:05.400 --> 44:10.600
is, is things like logic, or math, or so called special sentences, but I don't want to have

44:10.620 --> 44:13.260
to explain what those special sentences are right now.

44:13.260 --> 44:17.020
The point is, some believe that they can have justification for all of these things based

44:17.020 --> 44:22.140
in a kind of rational intuition, and these philosophers are namely Russell and Bonjour,

44:22.140 --> 44:27.540
but they thought these things were known immediately, that they were kind of special to human intuition,

44:27.540 --> 44:31.660
and they were non-reducible, they couldn't be reduced to other beliefs, and they weren't

44:31.660 --> 44:36.740
arbitrary, and also that they were kind of part of the mind-independent world, they weren't

44:36.740 --> 44:39.020
just true inside our heads.

44:39.020 --> 44:43.200
Now at first these things were taken to be infallible, that they can't be wrong, but

44:43.200 --> 44:49.200
that changed, especially when whole systems that were taken to be a priori were challenged,

44:49.200 --> 44:53.680
and shown that there were alternatives to them, particularly when it was shown that there

44:53.680 --> 44:56.440
could be non-Euclidean geometry.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.680
Now if you want to look up what non-Euclidean geometry is, you can do that yourself, it's

45:00.680 --> 45:04.760
pretty much the challenge to Euclid's fourth postulate, but more or less as a kind of rudimentary

45:04.760 --> 45:11.540
explanation, the old geometry had pretty much assumed a flat 2D surface, but non-Euclidean

45:11.540 --> 45:17.300
geometry can be done in 3D, in three dimensions, and it's not always based on the idea that

45:17.300 --> 45:24.100
the 2D one was wrong, just that the two dimensional Euclidean geometry was perfectly fine for

45:24.100 --> 45:30.020
cases where we were doing work on 2D surfaces, so conventionalism is a position that is meant

45:30.080 --> 45:36.000
to deal with there being multiple a priori systems, and we just kind of select one, and

45:36.000 --> 45:40.720
in fact we have already seen something like this in that logic video with Carnap, and

45:40.720 --> 45:47.080
how we actually make different systems as useful for scientists, different logical systems,

45:47.080 --> 45:52.160
but that did mean for Carnap that there were still practical constraints, namely is that

45:52.160 --> 45:55.720
system actually useful for the scientist or not?

45:55.720 --> 45:58.160
So it wasn't completely relativistic.

45:58.160 --> 46:02.340
There were other problems though for the conventionalist, and some of those problems were pointed out

46:02.340 --> 46:03.340
by Quine.

46:03.340 --> 46:07.860
You see, Quine wanted to defend a logic as being particularly deep in the mind, and he

46:07.860 --> 46:13.100
showed that the idea of consequence as used by the conventionalist is actually a part

46:13.100 --> 46:18.380
of that logic, and so we kind of have a funny result, that in conventionalism we may have

46:18.380 --> 46:25.700
it say that whenever there was a case type T, we apply convention C, and so we have

46:25.700 --> 46:32.200
a case T, then using modus ponens, kind of like we did earlier in the video, we can conclude

46:32.200 --> 46:36.480
to using convention C. That seems kind of clear, right?

46:36.480 --> 46:41.320
But the funny thing is, what if the convention is modus ponens?

46:41.320 --> 46:47.080
Then we're using modus ponens to employ modus ponens.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.880
That's kind of like a funny cool move, Quine did.

46:49.880 --> 46:54.760
So it seems at the upper level there are still some principles of logic which go outside

46:54.760 --> 46:59.460
the bounds of conventionalism, and certainly this is Ogrady's kind of point in that logic

46:59.460 --> 47:05.260
chapter too that he was trying to argue for, but what's happening at this upper apparatus,

47:05.260 --> 47:10.500
he's going to argue for again at chapter 5, hint hint, it's rationality.

47:10.500 --> 47:13.780
It's basically the system that's coming up all the time, that's what he's going to

47:13.780 --> 47:14.780
talk about.

47:14.780 --> 47:19.580
Anyway, Quine's system actually does away with the a priori completely then, and again

47:19.580 --> 47:23.860
you can check out this video if you'd like an account of how that's happening, but Ogrady

47:23.880 --> 47:30.080
points out problems with Quine as well, because it denies a meaning-belief distinction, and

47:30.080 --> 47:35.120
meanings, for even terms where we don't even have experiences of them yet, still seem to

47:35.120 --> 47:37.320
be important for philosophers.

47:37.320 --> 47:42.200
Even if they're just temporarily set to see what their implications are, meanings can

47:42.200 --> 47:46.880
change, but all the more useful to clarify what those meanings we set out are going to

47:46.880 --> 47:47.880
be.

47:47.880 --> 47:53.040
So Ogrady then presents what he calls a pragmatist a priori position.

47:53.040 --> 47:58.900
Where instead of completely denying a priori beliefs, we actually do have or can make a

47:58.900 --> 48:01.540
priori frameworks.

48:01.540 --> 48:06.380
And they are distinct from what we can call a posteriori beliefs if you want, which is

48:06.380 --> 48:11.660
the content within and of which that require this framework as a precondition for talking

48:11.660 --> 48:12.980
about the world.

48:12.980 --> 48:16.860
And he shows this distinction of what's the framework and what is the content within

48:16.860 --> 48:21.540
the framework actually being used by many different philosophers who are widely different

48:21.540 --> 48:26.480
in their philosophies such as Lewis, Karnap and Wittgenstein, and in a way appeasing all

48:26.480 --> 48:31.680
the changes that happened through this entire lineage, he says that this framework can change,

48:31.680 --> 48:37.760
that it's not infallible, but investigating these frameworks is central to philosophy.

48:37.760 --> 48:42.440
There's no commitment to a single framework for all contexts, there can be different ones,

48:42.440 --> 48:46.720
and even some things within a framework can eventually become a part of it.

48:46.720 --> 48:50.240
But we have three questions for philosophers to investigate.

48:50.240 --> 48:54.660
One, making sense of the notion of a framework itself.

48:54.660 --> 49:00.020
Is it or how much of it is explicit or implicit, natural or artificial?

49:00.020 --> 49:04.500
Two, is there a core framework that is universal?

49:04.500 --> 49:08.940
And three, how do we judge among those frameworks themselves?

49:08.940 --> 49:11.660
How does one judge a framework?

49:11.660 --> 49:15.580
So Ogrady gives his answers to these three questions.

49:15.580 --> 49:20.280
For that first question, making sense of the notion of a framework itself, he says these

49:20.280 --> 49:25.680
frameworks are a tacit set of presupposition, and that the job for philosophers is to be

49:25.680 --> 49:28.160
able to address and judge them.

49:28.160 --> 49:33.200
Not just what their purposes serve, but the different kind of purposes we can even have

49:33.200 --> 49:34.560
for them.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.880
Doing these philosophers don't merely just point them out, that we do have such frameworks

49:38.880 --> 49:44.240
and such preconceptions that are in play, but then after pointing them out we can actually

49:44.260 --> 49:49.500
tinker with them and make adjustments to them, perhaps even make new ones or improve on them

49:49.500 --> 49:51.340
for different purposes.

49:51.340 --> 49:55.100
So I really enjoy Ogrady's input here, because in the end of this chapter he's making a

49:55.100 --> 50:00.060
good case for philosophy itself and the kind of work it can do in a way that isn't within

50:00.060 --> 50:05.480
the specter of Rorty's criticism, or those who think that all philosophy is somehow necessarily

50:05.480 --> 50:11.260
tied to a kind of universal transcendent objective structure building in order to correspond

50:11.260 --> 50:13.580
with mind independent reality.

50:13.580 --> 50:17.800
And it also creates a new conception of the role of philosophy in a way that connects

50:17.800 --> 50:22.120
to the lessons learned from Wittgenstein and Quine, but he also then goes on to promise

50:22.120 --> 50:27.560
that in terms of this second question, if there is a universal framework, he will claim

50:27.560 --> 50:32.440
that there is a universal framework always in play, or rather that, and I prefer rather

50:32.440 --> 50:38.080
here, that what frameworks are can't be wholly different from each other, that there is something

50:38.080 --> 50:43.820
shared among all of them, and he will call that the core rationality, which actually

50:43.820 --> 50:49.220
has his principle of non-contradiction, and actually with that core rationality, we will

50:49.220 --> 50:52.700
be able to do three, judge among them.

50:52.700 --> 50:57.540
So he will cover that core rationality in his next chapter, and that's it for what

50:57.540 --> 50:59.980
Ogrady says in Epistemology.

50:59.980 --> 51:06.700
So there is relativism in a knowledge relative to a framework, and even those frameworks

51:06.700 --> 51:12.400
can change and be different relative to different purposes, but as we shall see with Ogrady

51:12.400 --> 51:17.080
in the next chapter, he will argue against it being extreme relativism, because there's

51:17.080 --> 51:22.960
a limit on what these frameworks can even be, and what exactly that limit is, is shown

51:22.960 --> 51:25.120
in his next chapter.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.520
