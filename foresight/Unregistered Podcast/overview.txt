 In this episode of the Unregistered Podcast, Thaddeus Russell hosts a discussion between Ben Shapiro and Curtis Yarkin on the topics of federal jobs guarantee, the role of government, democracy, and the interplay between rights and power.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Federal Jobs Guarantee**: Ben Shapiro acknowledges the good intentions behind Curtis's advocacy for a federal jobs guarantee but prefers other policies that he believes would provide more dignified labor opportunities. He argues that such a program might be too costly and could potentially disincentivize private sector employment.

2. **Role of Government**: Both participants agree that the role of government is to support the health and well-being of its people, but they have different ideas on how to achieve this. Ben emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and free market solutions, while Curtis leans towards more government intervention.

3. **Democracy and Rights**: The conversation shifts to a discussion about democracy and the relationship between rights and power. Ben argues that there's a misunderstanding of power when people seek a power that's above human power, like judicial review, which can lead to non-democratic decisions that don't necessarily reflect public opinion. Curtis suggests that both the US and USSR reflected broad Enlightenment values and that he sees the modern world as a positive development.

4. **Rights vs. Power**: Ben contends that rights are a way of expressing our normative goals and that all systems of governance reflect certain values, even if they label them differently. Curtis emphasizes the importance of considering both facts and values in understanding rights and power.

5. **Ending Remarks**: Thaddeus Russell wraps up the episode by praising both participants for their intellect and the depth of the discussion. He encourages listeners to consider different perspectives and learn from the conversation, emphasizing that they can agree on some points despite their overall differences.

Thaddeus also thanks the audience for their engagement and questions and invites listeners to support the podcast through Patreon for additional content. The episode concludes with a call to action for listeners to reflect on the discussion and to stay tuned for more content from the Unregistered Podcast.
