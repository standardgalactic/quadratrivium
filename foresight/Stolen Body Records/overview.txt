Processing Overview for Stolen Body Records
============================
Checking Stolen Body Records/Earth Tongue - Microscopic God (Official Video).txt
 It appears that you are following a sequence where each "go" is preceded by a set of numbers. The pattern in the sequences provided is as follows:

1. Start with the number '8' and decrement by 1 each iteration until reaching '1'.
2. Then, reset to '6' and increment by 1 each iteration until reaching '7'.
3. After reaching '7', you continue from there, so the sequence would be: 7, 8, 9, 10, etc., if it were to continue.
4. Each set of numbers (followed by "go!") represents one iteration in this pattern.

The sequences provided are:

- '8' down to '1', then 'go!' twice.
- '6' down to '1', followed by 'go!' three times.
- '6' down to '1', followed by 'go!' four times.
- '7' followed by 'go!' twice, and so on, until the next number in the sequence is reached and "go!" is called again.
