00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
It all started on November 30th, 2022, when ChatGPT was released.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.600
And now, not even two months later, Microsoft and Google are battling it out, to get real

00:11.600 --> 00:14.580
conversational AI into search.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.940
But while everyone is focused on who will win this AI battle, it doesn't really matter.

00:19.940 --> 00:24.600
Because whichever way it goes, this AI war is going to completely change the delicate

00:24.600 --> 00:27.640
balance of how the internet itself works.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.040
And this might also end up killing the concept of a website as we know it.

00:32.040 --> 00:36.840
There are three key things that could play out and shape how we use the web in an extent

00:36.840 --> 00:38.000
to 20 years.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.880
But to understand what's gonna happen in the future, we first have to look at how things

00:41.880 --> 00:42.880
are today.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.960
Websites are what started it all.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.280
20 years ago, there were blobs of information and content, mostly in text form, and mostly

00:50.280 --> 00:51.280
independent.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.440
They were not motivated by money, but by passion for a specific topic.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.520
And by people wanting to carve out their own little space in this new thing called the

00:59.520 --> 01:01.240
World Wide Web.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.040
But finding things was the really painful part.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.360
You really had to know the websites you were after, and this is where search engines came

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
in.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.160
First, they tried to organize with mess by categories.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.160
And finally, Google cracked the code of proper search.

01:15.160 --> 01:21.560
Then, in December of 2000, they launched AdWords, and ads started to appear in Google's search

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
results.

01:22.560 --> 01:27.120
And with that, website owners and businesses started to realize that this is not a fun

01:27.120 --> 01:28.680
digital game anymore.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.560
It's very real money with very real economics.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.560
Having traffic coming to your websites was not just bragging rights with your friends

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
anymore.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.280
And as the amount of people that started to explore the web from a search engine grew,

01:41.280 --> 01:46.800
a silent pact, a silent alliance was formed that is the real engine to the internet all

01:46.800 --> 01:49.040
the way to today.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.720
Websites would allow search engines to get their content for free and indecise it.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.040
And search engines would send them users and traffic.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.840
This innocent looking silent agreement is what gave birth to the modern web.

02:01.840 --> 02:06.120
With all the websites, also newspapers and journalists follow suit, maybe reluctantly

02:06.120 --> 02:07.120
sometimes.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.440
But with time, this silent agreement has been taken to the extreme.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.320
Websites realized that they could gain the system by stuffing more keywords into their

02:15.320 --> 02:18.000
articles and blog posts or farming backlinks.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.800
They learned that they could churn out more and more content just to appeal to specific

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
keywords.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.240
And the more they did that, the more Google and search engine would send them more and

02:26.240 --> 02:27.320
more traffic.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.960
And this would rank them higher and make them more money.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.200
And voila, search engine optimization, or SEO, is born.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.520
And while this was happening, search engines were making more money than ever.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.920
In the meantime, independent websites found even another way to monetize their traffic,

02:42.920 --> 02:44.360
affiliate links.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.320
You can now write an article about, say, top 10 TVs to buy right now and get a percentage

02:49.320 --> 02:52.640
where someone buys from an e-commerce store using your link.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.800
And this is basically how the web works today.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.960
But the smartest one of you will already have found out the big problem.

03:00.960 --> 03:06.880
This system fully relies on this one link right here, this silent agreement, traffic

03:06.880 --> 03:09.000
for access to content.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.120
This one agreement represents billions of dollars in revenue, thousands of companies

03:13.120 --> 03:15.680
and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.320
And AI-search chatbots are about to turn this balance upside down.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.720
It doesn't really matter if it's Google or Bing or Yahoo, it's not going to be Yahoo.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.440
Come out with their own disruptive AI.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.120
Things are about to change.

03:30.120 --> 03:35.520
It's clear that conversational AI is not a gimmick, it's not a fad, it's here to stay.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.960
ChatGPT was the fastest piece of tech to reach 100 million users.

03:39.960 --> 03:44.480
And this is a signal that the technology will become a key part of our lives.

03:44.480 --> 03:50.080
But trying to understand something so seemingly complex, like AI, can definitely be overwhelming.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.800
Where do you even start?

03:51.800 --> 03:55.040
And that's why this video is sponsored by Brilliant.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.400
Everyone likes to throw around AI as a buzzword these days.

03:58.400 --> 04:03.440
But the ones that will be able to ride this wave are those who really understand how artificial

04:03.440 --> 04:05.480
intelligence works at its core.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.600
And Brilliant.org is the best way to learn about it.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.160
I've already taken the artificial neural networks and their enforcement learning courses

04:13.160 --> 04:16.880
to really understand what is going on at the heart of this technology.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.640
And since we are talking about search, why not learn how search engines really work with

04:21.640 --> 04:23.440
a search engine course?

04:23.440 --> 04:28.040
What I like most about Brilliant is that I'm finally able to fit learning into my day,

04:28.040 --> 04:31.840
even though I have a full-time job and I manage a YouTube channel, because it is perfect for

04:31.840 --> 04:33.400
people with a busy schedule.

04:33.400 --> 04:37.640
If you follow my channel, you are probably as excited and as optimistic as I am about

04:37.640 --> 04:39.320
technology and science.

04:39.320 --> 04:44.480
If you use my link in the description, the first 200 people to sign up will get 20% of

04:44.480 --> 04:47.000
their annual premium subscription.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.600
And get one month for free.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.280
And now, back to the video.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.280
Now let's be clear.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.560
I don't know what is going to happen right now.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.280
And if I did, I would be probably very rich very soon.

04:56.280 --> 05:01.000
I would buy 42 jet skis and some island demaldives.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.440
But there are three possible things that can change on the horizon.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.240
And the first one is that AI goes all in on websites.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.160
As a new being has been rolled out, it has been blowing people's minds with its ability

05:12.160 --> 05:21.360
to understand complex problems and give a detailed solution on how to solve them.

05:21.360 --> 05:26.480
Now both Google and Bing are planning to integrate these chatbots alongside the traditional

05:26.480 --> 05:28.480
list of blue links.

05:28.480 --> 05:33.080
But it probably won't be long until people start to realize how easy it is to use the

05:33.080 --> 05:37.400
chatbot experience rather than browsing through a bunch of links.

05:37.400 --> 05:42.480
And so with this, traditional search results will start to get less and less clicks.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.960
And as I work in tech, I can assure you that usage data is one of the main things that

05:46.960 --> 05:50.240
tech companies look at when they take product decisions.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.720
If people naturally shift away from the list of blue links, it's only a matter of time

05:54.720 --> 05:59.560
before the big bosses at search engine companies will just decide to get the chatbot front

05:59.560 --> 06:04.480
and center and outright remove the list of links that we all have been used to.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.320
And the way we all explore the internet will change radically.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.480
Websites will go from the place you ended up getting the information you were looking

06:11.480 --> 06:18.520
for to something like the footnotes of Wikipedia, something most people rarely even look at.

06:18.520 --> 06:23.480
And with this, the balance that has been keeping traditional websites alive until now will

06:23.480 --> 06:25.520
simply fall apart.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.720
If the chatbot is giving you all the answers you need, why would you want to visit an ad

06:29.720 --> 06:34.720
written website to get some generic SEO optimized blog post?

06:34.720 --> 06:38.480
Traffic to these kinds of informational websites will drop dramatically, and there will be

06:38.480 --> 06:41.800
no incentives for them to keep publishing content.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.920
The engine of the web will stop, because this is all about basic game theory.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.600
If websites stop giving search engines content, search engines will just not have any relevant

06:51.600 --> 06:54.920
information to show, and they will stop getting advertising revenue.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.520
On the other hand, if search engines stop sending traffic to websites, they don't have

06:58.520 --> 07:03.440
anyone watching ads and clicking affiliate links, and they will also fade into obscurity.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.120
If the balance is broken, everybody loses.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.440
And to keep this balance, search engines like Google or Bing or whoever will first of all

07:11.440 --> 07:14.880
need to find a way to monetize AI chatbots.

07:14.880 --> 07:20.440
And one of the best ways they could do this is by injecting ads contextually into their

07:20.440 --> 07:21.440
response.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.880
The more an ad is integrated into organic search results, the better it will work.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.840
And we know it's gonna work, because that's what Google did 20 years ago.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.280
Before Google, search engines showed random banner ads on the side of results.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.920
Google was the first one to have the idea to introduce contextual advertising in the

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
search results themselves.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.080
Another way to potentially monetize these chatbots would be to make them paid, or with

07:44.080 --> 07:45.160
a subscription.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.760
The search engine Neva is already going into this direction, because having a powerful

07:49.760 --> 07:54.200
AI assistant like ChatGBT for your daily work can really increase your productivity and

07:54.200 --> 07:56.280
actually justify the cost.

07:56.280 --> 08:01.160
And even more for companies that would want to get these AI chatbots for all their employees.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.800
So now that these AI chatbots have found a way to make money, they still need to make

08:04.800 --> 08:08.880
sure they have valuable and up-to-date information to show users.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.160
And since in this new future there will be no real incentives for websites to produce

08:13.160 --> 08:17.800
any content, search engines could start to directly pay the creator of an article or

08:17.800 --> 08:22.480
of a web page based on how much that piece of content has been used by an AI to provide

08:22.480 --> 08:24.000
an answer.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.520
And this is because of a key difference that the new AI search models have with things

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
like ChatGBT.

08:29.520 --> 08:35.800
ChatGBT is a monolithic AI model trained on a large dataset of information from the web.

08:35.800 --> 08:39.800
And training this kind of model takes an enormous amount of computing power.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.440
So it will be basically impossible to keep the model itself up-to-date with the latest

08:43.440 --> 08:48.160
information that happened five minutes ago or the news that broke out an hour ago.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.360
And this is why the big chatbot works differently.

08:51.360 --> 08:57.360
They are using a not super up-to-date but quite smart base model to understand the language.

08:57.360 --> 09:03.120
And then they instruct this AI model to make the needed web searches to answer a question.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.520
Understand what's in the search results and speed out the answer.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.120
So for each search we can clearly identify which websites provided the information to

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
answer the question.

09:12.120 --> 09:16.840
And in this way they could each be compensated a tiny fraction of a cent.

09:16.840 --> 09:21.900
But if this ends up happening it will be most likely the death of traditional SEO.

09:21.900 --> 09:26.460
Why would you go to great lengths to create a whole website when Indiana is gonna be just

09:26.460 --> 09:30.800
read by an AI to produce some answer in a chatbot?

09:30.800 --> 09:35.760
And so new ways of giving information to these AI models to get them compensated will emerge

09:35.760 --> 09:39.000
like marketplaces or even APIs.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.080
Where people would not even bother to build a website.

09:42.080 --> 09:47.680
They can just transfer the information directly to the AI model via an API and then get compensated

09:47.680 --> 09:52.920
based on how many people will end up using that information for the search results.

09:52.920 --> 09:59.200
And this will change search engine optimization into something more like AI feeding optimization.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
AIFO?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.500
I don't know.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.240
But will it really be this extreme?

10:04.240 --> 10:10.440
Because there is also possibility that this old world and this new world will just coexist.

10:10.440 --> 10:15.680
In an interview with the Verge, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was asked this exact same

10:15.680 --> 10:17.180
question.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.880
And this is what he had to say.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.200
You've trained the model on other people's information.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.120
Other people's reporting and very biased in favor of reporting.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.280
How do you make sure that they get the value back?

10:27.280 --> 10:31.480
If you look at whether it's in the answer, whether it's in chat, these are just a different

10:31.480 --> 10:35.400
way to represent the 10 blue links more in the context of what they just want.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.840
And he actually may be right.

10:36.840 --> 10:41.480
The way this new being is designed heavily features links to the source material and

10:41.480 --> 10:46.340
is inviting you to learn more about what the AI is suggesting you by clicking on the links.

10:46.340 --> 10:50.640
They have clickable links inside the response and people would still end up exploring websites

10:50.640 --> 10:53.360
once they complete a search with the AI chatbot.

10:53.360 --> 10:58.240
Don't forget that Google had this box already where they showed a preview of the content

10:58.240 --> 11:00.080
of relevant information.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.960
This is what is called a zero-click search.

11:02.960 --> 11:07.000
So it might actually be that while people start to use these AI chatbots, they might

11:07.000 --> 11:12.240
not completely overhaul the mechanics of the web, but just changing them slightly.

11:12.240 --> 11:17.760
So in one example from Microsoft Keynote, they asked the AI to plan a vacation in Spain.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.960
And it spit out a detailed day-to-day plan of what you should see, where you should go,

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
where you should stay.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.500
Now, would you just take the first plane and just have that exact same trip without doing

11:27.500 --> 11:29.000
any additional research?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.180
No, you will probably take that as a starting point and then go ahead and learn more on

11:33.180 --> 11:35.160
different websites and watch videos.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.880
If I have a complex problem instead of starting from scratch, I can ask ChatGPT to lay out

11:39.880 --> 11:44.640
a basic solution and then I can iterate from there and review what he has done.

11:44.640 --> 11:49.480
And this means that people would probably not just stop going to websites completely,

11:49.480 --> 11:50.520
they would still do it.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.000
But maybe instead of visiting 9 or 10 websites to solve a complex problem, you might end

11:55.000 --> 11:57.240
up needing just one or two.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.520
And also, for the time being, AI in many cases is just completely wrong.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.200
While Google took most of the blow and lost 100 billion in market cap, as one of their

12:06.200 --> 12:12.040
promotional tweets for their model bar showed an error in a sentence, Microsoft is also

12:12.040 --> 12:13.520
suffering from the same problem.

12:13.520 --> 12:18.000
It didn't get the same attention in the media, in the demo they asked Bing to compare the

12:18.000 --> 12:20.840
financials of the Gap company versus another one.

12:20.840 --> 12:25.440
And when people actually checked the numbers, it turns out some of them were completely

12:25.440 --> 12:26.440
made up.

12:26.440 --> 12:31.080
It's still clear that even if websites do not disappear, many would still see the traffic

12:31.080 --> 12:33.840
from search fizzle out of our time.

12:33.840 --> 12:38.960
And while in the beginning, AI search engines might get away with not paying content creators

12:38.960 --> 12:43.360
for the information, eventually they would still have to find a way to compensate the

12:43.360 --> 12:45.440
people that are generating the content.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.160
And so the first thing that could happen is that this is finally the time where we move

12:50.160 --> 12:53.760
away from websites and go all in into platforms.

12:53.760 --> 12:58.480
I don't know about you, but when I have a problem or need any kind of information, if

12:58.480 --> 13:02.600
it's not a Google search, I'll just browse videos on YouTube.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.320
If I need more obscure answers and see what people are discussing, I'll look at Reddit.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.280
Twitter gets me all the rapid fire rants about topics I care about.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.880
And if I want to read some articles, I go on Substack or Medium.

13:13.880 --> 13:18.360
Aside of search, these are the getaways to the internet that most people use.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.160
Because like it or not, online platforms simply work.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.840
They each have their own rules and controversies and pros and cons, but they allow people to

13:26.840 --> 13:28.960
independently create content.

13:28.960 --> 13:33.120
And so what could happen is that all the people and websites that were spending their time

13:33.120 --> 13:38.920
and effort making SEO optimized content for search would end up transitioning to other

13:38.920 --> 13:39.920
platforms.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.960
In my opinion, the SEO model was broken from the start and it just led to piles of bad

13:44.960 --> 13:50.560
information reposted all over again in a competition to rank the highest on Google.

13:50.560 --> 13:56.120
And AI search chatbots could finally be a way to bridge the gap between search and online

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
platforms.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.480
Today, when you search for something on Google or Bing, the integration with platforms like

14:01.480 --> 14:06.280
Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter or any of those is just bad.

14:06.280 --> 14:11.040
And this is because these platforms never had much interest in opening up their content

14:11.040 --> 14:13.720
library completely to search engines.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.320
In the best case, they would get some extra traffic here and there.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.400
But that is up until now.

14:19.520 --> 14:25.280
AI chatbots not only start to interpret just text, but are able to interpret also the content

14:25.280 --> 14:29.800
of a YouTube video in the future and contextualize it with an article from Medium and someone

14:29.800 --> 14:32.080
to follow on Instagram and a Twitter thread.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.000
The platforms will have more incentives to open up older content and make it more available

14:37.000 --> 14:43.040
to search engines to put it out in front of users when they are making AI chatbot searches.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.520
And this can also represent a new renaissance of user generated content.

14:47.520 --> 14:53.080
Slowly but surely, platforms are realizing that to thrive, they need to pass down advertising

14:53.080 --> 14:57.160
revenue to creators, just like YouTube has been doing for years.

14:57.160 --> 15:02.320
TikTok is starting to monetize more heavily and platforms like Substack or Medium allow

15:02.320 --> 15:06.000
you to monetize directly the content that you create.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.720
Because traditional information websites are losing the battle with user generated content.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.840
And AI will accelerate this even more.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.800
So what do I believe will happen exactly?

15:17.800 --> 15:19.400
I don't really know.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.680
But there's someone whose opinion I really wanted to hear, and this is David Imel.

15:23.680 --> 15:29.440
He's one of the writers behind MBKBHD's videos, co-host of the Waveform podcast, and was

15:29.440 --> 15:31.600
also a writer for Android Out40.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.400
So I think it's still pretty early days in the way that AI is going to be affecting

15:35.400 --> 15:39.520
search engines and I'm not sure that anyone has really come up with the greatest version

15:39.520 --> 15:41.440
of how that's gonna work yet anyway, right?

15:41.440 --> 15:45.360
Like Bing is still the first implementation of how this is gonna work.

15:45.360 --> 15:49.880
Whether or not Google integrates it directly into Google search or has a separate option

15:49.880 --> 15:52.840
for Bard, we still don't really know that yet.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.280
I think ultimately there is that feedback loop problem where if websites stop making

15:57.280 --> 16:02.160
content because everyone is using these chatbots to get information, there's gonna be nothing

16:02.160 --> 16:04.400
for these chatbots to scrape from.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.720
But I personally think that there's going to be less of an impact on the way that the

16:07.720 --> 16:11.000
web actually works than we think there is, right?

16:11.040 --> 16:14.880
We already sort of have chatbots based in Google search already.

16:14.880 --> 16:20.200
If you search pretty much anything super basic, it gives you a direct answer at the very top.

16:20.200 --> 16:25.240
We still already use things like Google Assistant, which gives us pretty instantaneous answers

16:25.240 --> 16:30.120
on things or even say based on Wikipedia, XYZ, right?

16:30.120 --> 16:34.320
It's really only the more nuanced questions that these chatbots are starting to give us

16:34.320 --> 16:35.320
answers for.

16:35.320 --> 16:40.440
And I think that most people who want to do their own research and have more of an interest

16:40.480 --> 16:45.160
in a thing that isn't just what's the capital of Japan are probably going to be digging

16:45.160 --> 16:47.800
into those links to do more research anyway.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.120
So while it's useful for these chatbots to be giving us these like broader answers in

16:52.120 --> 16:56.120
paragraph form, I'm not sure about the speed of adoption.

16:56.120 --> 17:00.280
And I think that there's going to be a large period of time where the market matures and

17:00.280 --> 17:04.280
things actually change and people figure out how we're going to use this before we see

17:04.280 --> 17:08.120
some sort of like collapse of the internet or anything like that.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.160
Maybe it also makes incredibly interesting tech videos on a YouTube channel, so make

17:12.160 --> 17:13.400
sure to check him out.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.680
And while all of this unfolds, what you can do is subscribe to my channel.
