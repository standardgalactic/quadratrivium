1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
AI is everywhere, but have you noticed that AI today is also a complete mess?

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,520
So I can generate some text in Notion.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
That's cool, I guess.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,720
Can I give it some data in a file to recap?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Nope.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
For that, I need to use ChudgeBT.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,160
Well, not ChudgeBT, but I need ChudgeBT+.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,920
If I need to search the web, I need a Microsoft Copilot, which is inside Bing, which was formerly

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,360
known as Bing Chat, which in reality is GPT4 Turbo.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,360
Cool.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Can you help me a YouTube video?

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Well, no.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,520
Come on, don't be silly.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,200
For that, you have to use GeminiAdvanced, powered by Gemini 1.5, formerly known as GeminiUltra,

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,600
formerly known as Bard, which integrates with YouTube because it's owned by Google.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,640
AI today is a chaotic mess of annoying pop-ups that ask you to please, please try your latest

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
AI feature.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,560
Random Chatbots and Assistant popping up everywhere, in every app you use.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,440
And most of this is, well, totally useless.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,680
As you see, there are four key issues with the wildest state of AI today.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,120
But not all hope is lost, because there is a solution.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,920
And no, don't worry, it's not another AI gadget.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,480
But first, we have to understand why everything is becoming a chatbot.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,160
It seems like today, if your app doesn't have a chatbot with AI, it's not a part of the

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
cool kids anymore.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,240
Google is adding a chatbot to their search app.

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,560
After being a meme for 10 years, Bing is now back in the search game with, well, a chatbot.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
New ones like perplexed AI are springing up everywhere.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,440
But it's not just search.

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
It's everything.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Your presentation tool now has a chatbot, Photoshop now has a chatbot, Notion has a chatbot,

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,480
Figgem has a chatbot, Shopify has a chatbot, Microsoft even wants to replace the Windows

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,340
key on all new PCs with a co-pilot key that brings up, well, you guessed it, a chatbot.

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,640
But chatbots themselves are not the problem.

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,720
ChatGPT is what started it all, and it now has hundreds of millions of users.

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,520
No, the real problem is that, for most things, a chatbot is not the right way of interacting.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,360
Actually, it makes things worse than they were before.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,640
Let's take one of the main things that all these chatbots tell you they're amazing at,

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
planning a trip.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,160
This is the typical complex activity where you go to different websites and blogs and

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,720
compare prices, and you find the distance between hotels and attractions, and an AI assistant

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,920
seems to be the perfect solution here.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,560
Type what you need and get your perfect trip planned for you, except a chatbot sucks for

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
this.

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,800
It gives you a wall of text with no images, no maps, no directions, no easy way to compare

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
airfares.

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Since I still travel like a broke student, I tried giving it some pricing guidance,

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,360
but it completely ignored it, and I'm not alone here.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
A team of researchers tested chatbots on a thousand queries for travel itineraries.

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
And they counted how many times the chatbot actually proposed something that met all of

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
this criteria.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,880
OpenAI's GPT-4 model performed the best of the bunch, with six successful queries out

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
of a thousand.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,400
And counterintuitively, even for things like search, a chatbot in most cases is not the

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
right tool.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,600
This search question on Google is simply what to watch, and many people use search engines

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,280
just as a way to open their email.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,080
As the Verge puts it, AI is the right idea, but a chatbot is the wrong interface.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,520
But sure, with the chatbot you can ask it to make a rap song about your vacation plans,

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I guess.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,800
So if chatbots are not the right way to interact with AI in most cases, then why are they everywhere?

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Well, because tech people are lazy.

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Sort of.

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,360
When chatbots came out in December 2022, it took the world by storm.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,320
It was the fastest product in history to reach 100 million users, and it started the largest

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,360
FOMO run in tech in the last years, where everyone scrambled.

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
The big companies like Amazon, Meta, Google started building their own large language

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
models, which is basically what today we call AI.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,800
And everyone else now had to have some sort of AI in their product.

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
And was the easiest way to do it?

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,520
Step one, pay open AI to use one of their models like GPT-4, so you don't have to do

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
anything yourself.

73
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Then, well, GPT-4 takes in text and spits out text.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,040
So step two, let's build the simplest thing that takes in text and spits out text, which

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,840
is a chatbot.

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,480
Step three, give it a nice skin, colors, and we're done.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,320
Chatbots are the easiest and quickest way to add AI to your app.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,960
Now, you've seen AI features pop up everywhere in the apps and products you use every day.

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,440
But think about it.

80
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,720
How many of these do you actually really use?

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
My guess?

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Very, very few.

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,200
A recent research shows that 85% of all AI projects fail.

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,840
So why are companies scrambling to add chatbots and useless features?

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,520
Well, they caught a virus that has been around in the tech industry for decades now.

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,640
They caught the frenzy.

87
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,080
This is an ad from 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble, where the internet was the

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
cool new thing.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
And this is a 2024 ad for an AI gaming laptop.

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
What is an AI gaming laptop?

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,320
It's a laptop with a chatbot.

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,320
These are an example of what happens in the frenzy.

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Whenever a new technology becomes mainstream, this is exactly what happens.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Everyone takes this new tech and runs like crazy to add it to their product.

95
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,640
In 2000, just adding dotcom to the name of your company to show that it was on the web

96
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
made the stock price jump.

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
During the last crypto rush, everything needed to be on the blockchain and have NFTs.

98
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,160
This company, Long Island brand beverages, made Ice Tea.

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,040
But they decided to swiftly change their name to Long Blockchain Corp.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
And now it's a turn of AI.

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,400
As soon as Chagabity hit it big, marketing people in tech companies around the world

102
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,760
were like...

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,080
Because now there's the AI toothbrush.

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,040
There's the AI pet football.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,640
There's the AI candle scent.

106
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
And tech giants are not immune to this.

107
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,800
Samsung's whole campaign for this year's Galaxy phones is Galaxy AI.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,880
Despite AI already being in Galaxy phones for years now.

109
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,240
Because yeah, in reality, AI has been here and you've been using it for years.

110
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Facebook has been using AI to serve you ads for the last decade.

111
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,080
Your phone has been using AI to optimize your battery life for years.

112
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,400
In fact, AI doesn't really mean anything.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,800
The word artificial intelligence was born in 1956.

114
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,120
And technically, a GPT model with 100 billion parameters and your email spam filter are both

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
a form of artificial intelligence.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,040
But ever since Chagabity came out, AI basically means large language models.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Because it's easier to say AI than transformer-based deep neural network for natural language

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
processing.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
But this frenzy has created something else.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,560
It has revived a dream that has been around in tech for science fiction for decades.

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Jarvis.

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,080
Or dream of the Omniscient Chatbot.

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
Jarvis is the digital assistant to Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies.

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,880
An all-accompassing, useful and sarcastic companion that solved every problem.

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,520
And that in one movie tried to take over the world.

126
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,080
Science fiction has always dreamed of the ultimate digital assistant.

127
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
It's Jarvis in Iron Man.

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,120
It's Hall in 2001, a space odyssey.

129
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
It stars in Interstellar.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,000
Visits the original vision behind Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,720
And as soon as Chagabity exploded, the tech world got infatuated again with this idea.

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
And I don't blame them.

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,280
A large language model seems like the perfect solution to create a real-life version of Jarvis.

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,760
A chatbot that finally understands complex problems and has memory.

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,280
And many have been so captivated by this dream that they are focusing tons of energy and

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,600
resources on actually building this.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Companies like Humane were their AI pin.

138
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,960
But as these start to be released, we are starting to see why this is all a big illusion.

139
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,480
Look at this and tell me what company it is.

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,720
The company is called Lyft.

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,400
There's a gigantic problem with wanting to create the Omniscient Chatbot.

142
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,600
And that's that in order to be useful, it needs to have access to everything.

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Your WhatsApp messages, your inbox, your embarrassing Spotify playlist, your work documents.

144
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,240
If the Omniscient Chatbot doesn't have access to even a few of these, it loses the whole

145
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
point.

146
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,640
So say that you are a new company and you want to build a universal chatbot.

147
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,760
You have a great large language model, but now you need to make it work with all the

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,840
stuff that people actually use.

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,320
So you go to Mark Zuckerberg and you ask him, hey, can my universal chatbot access WhatsApp,

150
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
you know, for my users?

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
No.

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,240
And not only that, Mark now says, wait a minute, I can build my own universal chatbot.

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,480
And now Mark's chatbot, in order to be useful, needs to access your work documents, which

154
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
are in Notion.

155
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,920
Is Notion going to allow Mark's chatbot in?

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Nope.

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,040
And Notion CEO now has a great idea.

158
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,280
We can build a universal chatbot and so on and so forth.

159
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
You get the point.

160
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,640
All right, so this chapter is done.

161
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,680
Let me allocate some time to write the next one.

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh, you're wondering what this tool is?

163
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,280
Well, this is a sponsor of this video, AkiFlow.

164
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,720
If you follow this channel, well, probably your digital life is a mess.

165
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,000
You have multiple calendars to do apps, productivity apps, Notion, Linear, how do you make sense

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
of all this?

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,080
AkiFlow is the ultimate productivity tool to keep your life organized in one place.

168
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,680
The thing I love the most is that I can take a task and I can block some time for it on

169
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
my calendar.

170
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,600
I have an email here that I need to block some time to reply.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,920
And voila, I can drop it directly into my calendar and so I can just go on and plan my

172
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,480
day in a few minutes.

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
AkiFlow is the final boss of productivity apps because you don't have to choose between

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,640
one app or the other.

175
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just integrates with everything so I can plan my days from one single place.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,760
And if I hit Command K, I can create tasks and do everything with natural language.

177
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,000
You can try AkiFlow today with a link in the description.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,680
And if you want to learn more, you can even book on one-on-one call with the AkiFlow team.

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,080
Again, link in the description.

180
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,520
And now back to the video because even if we don't want to build the omnicent chatbot,

181
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
there is another problem here.

182
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
A problem that we actually already solved more than 40 years ago.

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,720
But that for some weird reason, now we have recreated the command line problem.

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,120
So sometimes I use my journey to generate my videos thumbnails.

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,400
And it's really mind-blowing what it can do.

186
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,120
But when I use it, I need something very specific.

187
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,680
And this is where it starts.

188
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
An endless back and forth of different prompts.

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,640
And oh, this doesn't work, so let me try a different order of words.

190
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,560
Now I also start reading Reddit threads and online guides.

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,160
And oh, here's a mid-journey prompting course.

192
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,400
Wait, wasn't the whole point of AI that it's natural and intuitive to use?

193
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm back to reading manuals.

194
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Well, this is exactly the same problem that we had 40 years ago when computers first arrived.

195
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,280
They were so powerful and so useful.

196
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,440
It was almost nobody could use them because the only way to interact with a computer was with this, the command line.

197
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,640
You need to remember complex commands and flags and options even to create a folder, open a file and any typo results in an error.

198
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,080
And we solve this with a graphical user interface.

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,640
Icons, buttons, windows, the mouse, all of these are basically a substitute for text-based commands.

200
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,480
Today, both on Windows and Mac, you can open the command line and do everything that you do on your computer with it.

201
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,360
But nobody does this, because it's clear that there's a better way to do things.

202
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,040
You don't need to write a complex terminal command to see the latest Instagram story of your friends getting wasted in a club.

203
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,880
And I think you might be getting the point already.

204
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,280
This AI wave has brought back this exact same problem.

205
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,560
Because chat GPT, mid-journey and all these AI chatbots are basically like command lines.

206
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,680
We are back to writing text on our keyboards and getting text back.

207
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,280
We are back to having to learn prompt and having to use guides and manuals.

208
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,160
It's like we are back in the 1980s, but with unaffordable housing now.

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,080
Good design is where you don't need an instructions manual.

210
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,760
Have you ever needed an instructions manual to figure out how to use an iPhone or Google Maps?

211
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,080
No, that's because they are insanely well designed.

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,880
We ran towards chatbots because they are easy to build.

213
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,320
But in doing so, we have thrown everyone back in the days of command lines.

214
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,640
And I know what you're thinking.

215
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
It's so easy, let's just slap some buttons and sliders on the screen to control the chatbot.

216
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, this is Automatic 1111.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,480
A graphical user interface for the image model stable diffusion.

218
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,120
And I don't know about you, but you're seeing it and I can tell you it's even more scary than using a chatbot.

219
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,400
So solving this problem is gonna take a while.

220
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,000
And so, what now?

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,680
We have chatbots everywhere.

222
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,080
We are pursuing this idea of the Omniscient Jarvis Assistant.

223
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,760
And every time I use an app, I have to dismiss seven pop-ups to use their useless AI features.

224
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,040
Is this really it?

225
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,440
Well, no.

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,960
There is a solution on the horizon, but it's a counter-intuitive one.

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,160
Because it's not about more AI.

228
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
Actually, it's about getting rid of AI.

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
Making AI invisible.

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,560
This is a mock-up I made of Skyscanner.

231
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,520
And you can see that instead of using a random chatbot, I created a customized trip option.

232
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,200
So you can use the UI that you're familiar with to search for flights,

233
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,320
but still be able to create the perfect custom flight search for you.

234
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,200
And you know when you get those messages that you forget to reply to?

235
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
Well, another thing we can do is use AI to smartly analyze the messages

236
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,720
and remind you only of the ones that you actually need to reply to.

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,920
These are all examples of invisible AI.

238
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Instead of saying, hey, look, we have a new chatbot.

239
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,440
It's cool new AI, although you're probably never gonna use it.

240
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,400
These take the opposite approach and start from a real problem that people have.

241
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,680
And then apply AI to it because it just can help solve it.

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,600
And if you notice in none of these examples, are we telling users,

243
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,440
hey, there's fancy AI in here because I'm sorry, tech marketing people,

244
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,680
but users don't care if there's AI or if there's umpa-lumpas writing responses to the prompts.

245
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,960
They just care about getting their problems solved.

246
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,640
Today, we have these chatbots everywhere.

247
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,400
But when nobody ends up using them and the AI hype train dies down,

248
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,800
designers, engineers and product managers will roll up their sleeves

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,920
and start to build AI in a way that's truly useful.

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,240
And even though we are still inside the frenzy,

251
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,280
we're starting to see the first three examples of this.

252
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Premiere Pro, the video editing software,

253
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,240
is adding the ability to extend your clips by a couple of seconds

254
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,520
if you need some extra footage you're missing.

255
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
And it generates those with AI.

256
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,160
YouTube is working on adding automated AI dubbing of videos.

257
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:41,320
ARCHER BROWSER automatically renames your tabs to make them more easily readable in less space,

258
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
without you having to do anything.

259
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,720
And this is the AI I'm truly excited about.

260
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
But as it turns out, even without AI,

261
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
the tech we use everyday hides secrets in plain sight.

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,600
Like how the iPhone icons are actually not rounder rectangles,

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,440
or how the Spotify shuffle is not actually random.

264
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,480
And you can learn all about it in this video right here.

265
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm Enrico and I'll see you in the next one.
