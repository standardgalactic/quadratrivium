WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
AI is everywhere, but have you noticed that AI today is also a complete mess?

00:09.680 --> 00:11.520
So I can generate some text in Notion.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
That's cool, I guess.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.720
Can I give it some data in a file to recap?

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
Nope.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.720
For that, I need to use ChudgeBT.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.160
Well, not ChudgeBT, but I need ChudgeBT+.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.920
If I need to search the web, I need a Microsoft Copilot, which is inside Bing, which was formerly

00:24.920 --> 00:28.360
known as Bing Chat, which in reality is GPT4 Turbo.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.360
Cool.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
Can you help me a YouTube video?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
Well, no.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.520
Come on, don't be silly.

00:32.520 --> 00:38.200
For that, you have to use GeminiAdvanced, powered by Gemini 1.5, formerly known as GeminiUltra,

00:38.200 --> 00:41.600
formerly known as Bard, which integrates with YouTube because it's owned by Google.

00:41.600 --> 00:47.640
AI today is a chaotic mess of annoying pop-ups that ask you to please, please try your latest

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
AI feature.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.560
Random Chatbots and Assistant popping up everywhere, in every app you use.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.440
And most of this is, well, totally useless.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.680
As you see, there are four key issues with the wildest state of AI today.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.120
But not all hope is lost, because there is a solution.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.920
And no, don't worry, it's not another AI gadget.

01:06.920 --> 01:11.480
But first, we have to understand why everything is becoming a chatbot.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.160
It seems like today, if your app doesn't have a chatbot with AI, it's not a part of the

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
cool kids anymore.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.240
Google is adding a chatbot to their search app.

01:19.240 --> 01:24.560
After being a meme for 10 years, Bing is now back in the search game with, well, a chatbot.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.280
New ones like perplexed AI are springing up everywhere.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.440
But it's not just search.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
It's everything.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.600
Your presentation tool now has a chatbot, Photoshop now has a chatbot, Notion has a chatbot,

01:33.600 --> 01:37.480
Figgem has a chatbot, Shopify has a chatbot, Microsoft even wants to replace the Windows

01:37.480 --> 01:43.340
key on all new PCs with a co-pilot key that brings up, well, you guessed it, a chatbot.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.640
But chatbots themselves are not the problem.

01:45.640 --> 01:49.720
ChatGPT is what started it all, and it now has hundreds of millions of users.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.520
No, the real problem is that, for most things, a chatbot is not the right way of interacting.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.360
Actually, it makes things worse than they were before.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.640
Let's take one of the main things that all these chatbots tell you they're amazing at,

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
planning a trip.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.160
This is the typical complex activity where you go to different websites and blogs and

02:07.160 --> 02:11.720
compare prices, and you find the distance between hotels and attractions, and an AI assistant

02:11.720 --> 02:13.920
seems to be the perfect solution here.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.560
Type what you need and get your perfect trip planned for you, except a chatbot sucks for

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
this.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.800
It gives you a wall of text with no images, no maps, no directions, no easy way to compare

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
airfares.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.240
Since I still travel like a broke student, I tried giving it some pricing guidance,

02:28.240 --> 02:31.360
but it completely ignored it, and I'm not alone here.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.840
A team of researchers tested chatbots on a thousand queries for travel itineraries.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.760
And they counted how many times the chatbot actually proposed something that met all of

02:39.760 --> 02:40.760
this criteria.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.880
OpenAI's GPT-4 model performed the best of the bunch, with six successful queries out

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
of a thousand.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.400
And counterintuitively, even for things like search, a chatbot in most cases is not the

02:51.400 --> 02:52.400
right tool.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.600
This search question on Google is simply what to watch, and many people use search engines

02:56.600 --> 02:58.280
just as a way to open their email.

02:58.280 --> 03:04.080
As the Verge puts it, AI is the right idea, but a chatbot is the wrong interface.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.520
But sure, with the chatbot you can ask it to make a rap song about your vacation plans,

03:08.520 --> 03:09.520
I guess.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.800
So if chatbots are not the right way to interact with AI in most cases, then why are they everywhere?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.320
Well, because tech people are lazy.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.520
Sort of.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.360
When chatbots came out in December 2022, it took the world by storm.

03:22.360 --> 03:27.320
It was the fastest product in history to reach 100 million users, and it started the largest

03:27.320 --> 03:31.360
FOMO run in tech in the last years, where everyone scrambled.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.040
The big companies like Amazon, Meta, Google started building their own large language

03:35.040 --> 03:38.000
models, which is basically what today we call AI.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.800
And everyone else now had to have some sort of AI in their product.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.600
And was the easiest way to do it?

03:43.600 --> 03:47.520
Step one, pay open AI to use one of their models like GPT-4, so you don't have to do

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
anything yourself.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.320
Then, well, GPT-4 takes in text and spits out text.

03:52.320 --> 03:57.040
So step two, let's build the simplest thing that takes in text and spits out text, which

03:57.040 --> 03:58.840
is a chatbot.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.480
Step three, give it a nice skin, colors, and we're done.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.320
Chatbots are the easiest and quickest way to add AI to your app.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.960
Now, you've seen AI features pop up everywhere in the apps and products you use every day.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.440
But think about it.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.720
How many of these do you actually really use?

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
My guess?

04:16.720 --> 04:17.720
Very, very few.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.200
A recent research shows that 85% of all AI projects fail.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.840
So why are companies scrambling to add chatbots and useless features?

04:25.840 --> 04:30.520
Well, they caught a virus that has been around in the tech industry for decades now.

04:30.520 --> 04:37.640
They caught the frenzy.

04:37.640 --> 04:42.080
This is an ad from 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble, where the internet was the

04:42.080 --> 04:43.840
cool new thing.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.680
And this is a 2024 ad for an AI gaming laptop.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.000
What is an AI gaming laptop?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.320
It's a laptop with a chatbot.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.320
These are an example of what happens in the frenzy.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.720
Whenever a new technology becomes mainstream, this is exactly what happens.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.720
Everyone takes this new tech and runs like crazy to add it to their product.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.640
In 2000, just adding dotcom to the name of your company to show that it was on the web

05:05.640 --> 05:07.240
made the stock price jump.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.240
During the last crypto rush, everything needed to be on the blockchain and have NFTs.

05:11.240 --> 05:15.160
This company, Long Island brand beverages, made Ice Tea.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.040
But they decided to swiftly change their name to Long Blockchain Corp.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.480
And now it's a turn of AI.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.400
As soon as Chagabity hit it big, marketing people in tech companies around the world

05:24.400 --> 05:26.760
were like...

05:26.760 --> 05:29.080
Because now there's the AI toothbrush.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.040
There's the AI pet football.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.640
There's the AI candle scent.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.640
And tech giants are not immune to this.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.800
Samsung's whole campaign for this year's Galaxy phones is Galaxy AI.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.880
Despite AI already being in Galaxy phones for years now.

05:43.880 --> 05:48.240
Because yeah, in reality, AI has been here and you've been using it for years.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.320
Facebook has been using AI to serve you ads for the last decade.

05:51.320 --> 05:55.080
Your phone has been using AI to optimize your battery life for years.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.400
In fact, AI doesn't really mean anything.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.800
The word artificial intelligence was born in 1956.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.120
And technically, a GPT model with 100 billion parameters and your email spam filter are both

06:07.120 --> 06:09.120
a form of artificial intelligence.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.040
But ever since Chagabity came out, AI basically means large language models.

06:14.040 --> 06:19.040
Because it's easier to say AI than transformer-based deep neural network for natural language

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
processing.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
But this frenzy has created something else.

06:22.040 --> 06:26.560
It has revived a dream that has been around in tech for science fiction for decades.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
Jarvis.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.080
Or dream of the Omniscient Chatbot.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.680
Jarvis is the digital assistant to Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.880
An all-accompassing, useful and sarcastic companion that solved every problem.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.520
And that in one movie tried to take over the world.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.080
Science fiction has always dreamed of the ultimate digital assistant.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.680
It's Jarvis in Iron Man.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.120
It's Hall in 2001, a space odyssey.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.480
It stars in Interstellar.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.000
Visits the original vision behind Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.720
And as soon as Chagabity exploded, the tech world got infatuated again with this idea.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.200
And I don't blame them.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.280
A large language model seems like the perfect solution to create a real-life version of Jarvis.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.760
A chatbot that finally understands complex problems and has memory.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.280
And many have been so captivated by this dream that they are focusing tons of energy and

07:13.280 --> 07:15.600
resources on actually building this.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.440
Companies like Humane were their AI pin.

07:17.440 --> 07:22.960
But as these start to be released, we are starting to see why this is all a big illusion.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.480
Look at this and tell me what company it is.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.720
The company is called Lyft.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.400
There's a gigantic problem with wanting to create the Omniscient Chatbot.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.600
And that's that in order to be useful, it needs to have access to everything.

07:34.600 --> 07:39.240
Your WhatsApp messages, your inbox, your embarrassing Spotify playlist, your work documents.

07:39.240 --> 07:43.240
If the Omniscient Chatbot doesn't have access to even a few of these, it loses the whole

07:43.240 --> 07:44.240
point.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.640
So say that you are a new company and you want to build a universal chatbot.

07:47.640 --> 07:51.760
You have a great large language model, but now you need to make it work with all the

07:51.760 --> 07:53.840
stuff that people actually use.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.320
So you go to Mark Zuckerberg and you ask him, hey, can my universal chatbot access WhatsApp,

07:58.320 --> 08:00.000
you know, for my users?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
No.

08:01.120 --> 08:06.240
And not only that, Mark now says, wait a minute, I can build my own universal chatbot.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.480
And now Mark's chatbot, in order to be useful, needs to access your work documents, which

08:10.480 --> 08:11.480
are in Notion.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.920
Is Notion going to allow Mark's chatbot in?

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
Nope.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.040
And Notion CEO now has a great idea.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.280
We can build a universal chatbot and so on and so forth.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.280
You get the point.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.640
All right, so this chapter is done.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.680
Let me allocate some time to write the next one.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.680
Oh, you're wondering what this tool is?

08:26.680 --> 08:29.280
Well, this is a sponsor of this video, AkiFlow.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.720
If you follow this channel, well, probably your digital life is a mess.

08:32.720 --> 08:38.000
You have multiple calendars to do apps, productivity apps, Notion, Linear, how do you make sense

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
of all this?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.080
AkiFlow is the ultimate productivity tool to keep your life organized in one place.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.680
The thing I love the most is that I can take a task and I can block some time for it on

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
my calendar.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.600
I have an email here that I need to block some time to reply.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.920
And voila, I can drop it directly into my calendar and so I can just go on and plan my

08:54.920 --> 08:56.480
day in a few minutes.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.160
AkiFlow is the final boss of productivity apps because you don't have to choose between

09:00.160 --> 09:01.640
one app or the other.

09:01.640 --> 09:06.000
It's just integrates with everything so I can plan my days from one single place.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.760
And if I hit Command K, I can create tasks and do everything with natural language.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.000
You can try AkiFlow today with a link in the description.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.680
And if you want to learn more, you can even book on one-on-one call with the AkiFlow team.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.080
Again, link in the description.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.520
And now back to the video because even if we don't want to build the omnicent chatbot,

09:22.520 --> 09:23.920
there is another problem here.

09:24.160 --> 09:28.080
A problem that we actually already solved more than 40 years ago.

09:28.080 --> 09:33.720
But that for some weird reason, now we have recreated the command line problem.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.120
So sometimes I use my journey to generate my videos thumbnails.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.400
And it's really mind-blowing what it can do.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.120
But when I use it, I need something very specific.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.680
And this is where it starts.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.240
An endless back and forth of different prompts.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.640
And oh, this doesn't work, so let me try a different order of words.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.560
Now I also start reading Reddit threads and online guides.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.160
And oh, here's a mid-journey prompting course.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.400
Wait, wasn't the whole point of AI that it's natural and intuitive to use?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.320
I'm back to reading manuals.

10:01.320 --> 10:06.120
Well, this is exactly the same problem that we had 40 years ago when computers first arrived.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.280
They were so powerful and so useful.

10:08.280 --> 10:14.440
It was almost nobody could use them because the only way to interact with a computer was with this, the command line.

10:14.440 --> 10:21.640
You need to remember complex commands and flags and options even to create a folder, open a file and any typo results in an error.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.080
And we solve this with a graphical user interface.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.640
Icons, buttons, windows, the mouse, all of these are basically a substitute for text-based commands.

10:29.640 --> 10:34.480
Today, both on Windows and Mac, you can open the command line and do everything that you do on your computer with it.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.360
But nobody does this, because it's clear that there's a better way to do things.

10:38.360 --> 10:44.040
You don't need to write a complex terminal command to see the latest Instagram story of your friends getting wasted in a club.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.880
And I think you might be getting the point already.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.280
This AI wave has brought back this exact same problem.

10:50.280 --> 10:55.560
Because chat GPT, mid-journey and all these AI chatbots are basically like command lines.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.680
We are back to writing text on our keyboards and getting text back.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.280
We are back to having to learn prompt and having to use guides and manuals.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.160
It's like we are back in the 1980s, but with unaffordable housing now.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.080
Good design is where you don't need an instructions manual.

11:09.080 --> 11:13.760
Have you ever needed an instructions manual to figure out how to use an iPhone or Google Maps?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.080
No, that's because they are insanely well designed.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.880
We ran towards chatbots because they are easy to build.

11:18.880 --> 11:23.320
But in doing so, we have thrown everyone back in the days of command lines.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.640
And I know what you're thinking.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.640
It's so easy, let's just slap some buttons and sliders on the screen to control the chatbot.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.000
Well, this is Automatic 1111.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.480
A graphical user interface for the image model stable diffusion.

11:34.480 --> 11:39.120
And I don't know about you, but you're seeing it and I can tell you it's even more scary than using a chatbot.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.400
So solving this problem is gonna take a while.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.000
And so, what now?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.680
We have chatbots everywhere.

11:44.680 --> 11:48.080
We are pursuing this idea of the Omniscient Jarvis Assistant.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.760
And every time I use an app, I have to dismiss seven pop-ups to use their useless AI features.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.040
Is this really it?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.440
Well, no.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.960
There is a solution on the horizon, but it's a counter-intuitive one.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.160
Because it's not about more AI.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.680
Actually, it's about getting rid of AI.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.600
Making AI invisible.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.560
This is a mock-up I made of Skyscanner.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.520
And you can see that instead of using a random chatbot, I created a customized trip option.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.200
So you can use the UI that you're familiar with to search for flights,

12:14.200 --> 12:19.320
but still be able to create the perfect custom flight search for you.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.200
And you know when you get those messages that you forget to reply to?

12:22.200 --> 12:25.800
Well, another thing we can do is use AI to smartly analyze the messages

12:25.800 --> 12:28.720
and remind you only of the ones that you actually need to reply to.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.920
These are all examples of invisible AI.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.280
Instead of saying, hey, look, we have a new chatbot.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.440
It's cool new AI, although you're probably never gonna use it.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.400
These take the opposite approach and start from a real problem that people have.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.680
And then apply AI to it because it just can help solve it.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.600
And if you notice in none of these examples, are we telling users,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.440
hey, there's fancy AI in here because I'm sorry, tech marketing people,

12:50.440 --> 12:56.680
but users don't care if there's AI or if there's umpa-lumpas writing responses to the prompts.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.960
They just care about getting their problems solved.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.640
Today, we have these chatbots everywhere.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.400
But when nobody ends up using them and the AI hype train dies down,

13:04.400 --> 13:07.800
designers, engineers and product managers will roll up their sleeves

13:07.800 --> 13:10.920
and start to build AI in a way that's truly useful.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.240
And even though we are still inside the frenzy,

13:13.240 --> 13:16.280
we're starting to see the first three examples of this.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.320
Premiere Pro, the video editing software,

13:18.320 --> 13:21.240
is adding the ability to extend your clips by a couple of seconds

13:21.240 --> 13:23.520
if you need some extra footage you're missing.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.440
And it generates those with AI.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.160
YouTube is working on adding automated AI dubbing of videos.

13:30.080 --> 13:41.320
ARCHER BROWSER automatically renames your tabs to make them more easily readable in less space,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.320
without you having to do anything.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.720
And this is the AI I'm truly excited about.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.800
But as it turns out, even without AI,

13:48.800 --> 13:51.760
the tech we use everyday hides secrets in plain sight.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.600
Like how the iPhone icons are actually not rounder rectangles,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.440
or how the Spotify shuffle is not actually random.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.480
And you can learn all about it in this video right here.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.200
I'm Enrico and I'll see you in the next one.
