0	5680	It all started on November 30th, 2022, when ChatGPT was released.
5680	11600	And now, not even two months later, Microsoft and Google are battling it out, to get real
11600	14580	conversational AI into search.
14580	19940	But while everyone is focused on who will win this AI battle, it doesn't really matter.
19940	24600	Because whichever way it goes, this AI war is going to completely change the delicate
24600	27640	balance of how the internet itself works.
27640	32040	And this might also end up killing the concept of a website as we know it.
32040	36840	There are three key things that could play out and shape how we use the web in an extent
36840	38000	to 20 years.
38000	41880	But to understand what's gonna happen in the future, we first have to look at how things
41880	42880	are today.
42880	44960	Websites are what started it all.
44960	50280	20 years ago, there were blobs of information and content, mostly in text form, and mostly
50280	51280	independent.
51280	55440	They were not motivated by money, but by passion for a specific topic.
55440	59520	And by people wanting to carve out their own little space in this new thing called the
59520	61240	World Wide Web.
61240	64040	But finding things was the really painful part.
64040	68360	You really had to know the websites you were after, and this is where search engines came
68360	69360	in.
69360	72160	First, they tried to organize with mess by categories.
72160	75160	And finally, Google cracked the code of proper search.
75160	81560	Then, in December of 2000, they launched AdWords, and ads started to appear in Google's search
81560	82560	results.
82560	87120	And with that, website owners and businesses started to realize that this is not a fun
87120	88680	digital game anymore.
88680	92560	It's very real money with very real economics.
92560	96560	Having traffic coming to your websites was not just bragging rights with your friends
96560	97560	anymore.
97560	101280	And as the amount of people that started to explore the web from a search engine grew,
101280	106800	a silent pact, a silent alliance was formed that is the real engine to the internet all
106800	109040	the way to today.
109040	113720	Websites would allow search engines to get their content for free and indecise it.
113720	117040	And search engines would send them users and traffic.
117040	121840	This innocent looking silent agreement is what gave birth to the modern web.
121840	126120	With all the websites, also newspapers and journalists follow suit, maybe reluctantly
126120	127120	sometimes.
127120	131440	But with time, this silent agreement has been taken to the extreme.
131440	135320	Websites realized that they could gain the system by stuffing more keywords into their
135320	138000	articles and blog posts or farming backlinks.
138000	141800	They learned that they could churn out more and more content just to appeal to specific
141800	142800	keywords.
142800	146240	And the more they did that, the more Google and search engine would send them more and
146240	147320	more traffic.
147320	149960	And this would rank them higher and make them more money.
149960	154200	And voila, search engine optimization, or SEO, is born.
154200	158520	And while this was happening, search engines were making more money than ever.
158520	162920	In the meantime, independent websites found even another way to monetize their traffic,
162920	164360	affiliate links.
164360	169320	You can now write an article about, say, top 10 TVs to buy right now and get a percentage
169320	172640	where someone buys from an e-commerce store using your link.
172640	175800	And this is basically how the web works today.
175800	180960	But the smartest one of you will already have found out the big problem.
180960	186880	This system fully relies on this one link right here, this silent agreement, traffic
186880	189000	for access to content.
189000	193120	This one agreement represents billions of dollars in revenue, thousands of companies
193120	195680	and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
195680	200320	And AI-search chatbots are about to turn this balance upside down.
200320	205720	It doesn't really matter if it's Google or Bing or Yahoo, it's not going to be Yahoo.
205720	208440	Come out with their own disruptive AI.
208440	210120	Things are about to change.
210120	215520	It's clear that conversational AI is not a gimmick, it's not a fad, it's here to stay.
215520	219960	ChatGPT was the fastest piece of tech to reach 100 million users.
219960	224480	And this is a signal that the technology will become a key part of our lives.
224480	230080	But trying to understand something so seemingly complex, like AI, can definitely be overwhelming.
230080	231800	Where do you even start?
231800	235040	And that's why this video is sponsored by Brilliant.
235040	238400	Everyone likes to throw around AI as a buzzword these days.
238400	243440	But the ones that will be able to ride this wave are those who really understand how artificial
243440	245480	intelligence works at its core.
245480	248600	And Brilliant.org is the best way to learn about it.
248600	253160	I've already taken the artificial neural networks and their enforcement learning courses
253160	256880	to really understand what is going on at the heart of this technology.
256880	261640	And since we are talking about search, why not learn how search engines really work with
261640	263440	a search engine course?
263440	268040	What I like most about Brilliant is that I'm finally able to fit learning into my day,
268040	271840	even though I have a full-time job and I manage a YouTube channel, because it is perfect for
271840	273400	people with a busy schedule.
273400	277640	If you follow my channel, you are probably as excited and as optimistic as I am about
277640	279320	technology and science.
279320	284480	If you use my link in the description, the first 200 people to sign up will get 20% of
284480	287000	their annual premium subscription.
287000	288600	And get one month for free.
288600	290280	And now, back to the video.
290280	291280	Now let's be clear.
291280	293560	I don't know what is going to happen right now.
293560	296280	And if I did, I would be probably very rich very soon.
296280	301000	I would buy 42 jet skis and some island demaldives.
301000	304440	But there are three possible things that can change on the horizon.
304440	308240	And the first one is that AI goes all in on websites.
308240	312160	As a new being has been rolled out, it has been blowing people's minds with its ability
312160	321360	to understand complex problems and give a detailed solution on how to solve them.
321360	326480	Now both Google and Bing are planning to integrate these chatbots alongside the traditional
326480	328480	list of blue links.
328480	333080	But it probably won't be long until people start to realize how easy it is to use the
333080	337400	chatbot experience rather than browsing through a bunch of links.
337400	342480	And so with this, traditional search results will start to get less and less clicks.
342480	346960	And as I work in tech, I can assure you that usage data is one of the main things that
346960	350240	tech companies look at when they take product decisions.
350240	354720	If people naturally shift away from the list of blue links, it's only a matter of time
354720	359560	before the big bosses at search engine companies will just decide to get the chatbot front
359560	364480	and center and outright remove the list of links that we all have been used to.
364480	368320	And the way we all explore the internet will change radically.
368320	371480	Websites will go from the place you ended up getting the information you were looking
371480	378520	for to something like the footnotes of Wikipedia, something most people rarely even look at.
378520	383480	And with this, the balance that has been keeping traditional websites alive until now will
383480	385520	simply fall apart.
385520	389720	If the chatbot is giving you all the answers you need, why would you want to visit an ad
389720	394720	written website to get some generic SEO optimized blog post?
394720	398480	Traffic to these kinds of informational websites will drop dramatically, and there will be
398480	401800	no incentives for them to keep publishing content.
401800	406920	The engine of the web will stop, because this is all about basic game theory.
406920	411600	If websites stop giving search engines content, search engines will just not have any relevant
411600	414920	information to show, and they will stop getting advertising revenue.
414920	418520	On the other hand, if search engines stop sending traffic to websites, they don't have
418520	423440	anyone watching ads and clicking affiliate links, and they will also fade into obscurity.
423440	427120	If the balance is broken, everybody loses.
427120	431440	And to keep this balance, search engines like Google or Bing or whoever will first of all
431440	434880	need to find a way to monetize AI chatbots.
434880	440440	And one of the best ways they could do this is by injecting ads contextually into their
440440	441440	response.
441440	445880	The more an ad is integrated into organic search results, the better it will work.
445880	449840	And we know it's gonna work, because that's what Google did 20 years ago.
449840	454280	Before Google, search engines showed random banner ads on the side of results.
454280	457920	Google was the first one to have the idea to introduce contextual advertising in the
457920	459920	search results themselves.
459920	464080	Another way to potentially monetize these chatbots would be to make them paid, or with
464080	465160	a subscription.
465160	469760	The search engine Neva is already going into this direction, because having a powerful
469760	474200	AI assistant like ChatGBT for your daily work can really increase your productivity and
474200	476280	actually justify the cost.
476280	481160	And even more for companies that would want to get these AI chatbots for all their employees.
481160	484800	So now that these AI chatbots have found a way to make money, they still need to make
484800	488880	sure they have valuable and up-to-date information to show users.
488880	493160	And since in this new future there will be no real incentives for websites to produce
493160	497800	any content, search engines could start to directly pay the creator of an article or
497800	502480	of a web page based on how much that piece of content has been used by an AI to provide
502480	504000	an answer.
504000	508520	And this is because of a key difference that the new AI search models have with things
508520	509520	like ChatGBT.
509520	515800	ChatGBT is a monolithic AI model trained on a large dataset of information from the web.
515800	519800	And training this kind of model takes an enormous amount of computing power.
519800	523440	So it will be basically impossible to keep the model itself up-to-date with the latest
523440	528160	information that happened five minutes ago or the news that broke out an hour ago.
528160	531360	And this is why the big chatbot works differently.
531360	537360	They are using a not super up-to-date but quite smart base model to understand the language.
537360	543120	And then they instruct this AI model to make the needed web searches to answer a question.
543120	546520	Understand what's in the search results and speed out the answer.
546520	551120	So for each search we can clearly identify which websites provided the information to
551120	552120	answer the question.
552120	556840	And in this way they could each be compensated a tiny fraction of a cent.
556840	561900	But if this ends up happening it will be most likely the death of traditional SEO.
561900	566460	Why would you go to great lengths to create a whole website when Indiana is gonna be just
566460	570800	read by an AI to produce some answer in a chatbot?
570800	575760	And so new ways of giving information to these AI models to get them compensated will emerge
575760	579000	like marketplaces or even APIs.
579000	582080	Where people would not even bother to build a website.
582080	587680	They can just transfer the information directly to the AI model via an API and then get compensated
587680	592920	based on how many people will end up using that information for the search results.
592920	599200	And this will change search engine optimization into something more like AI feeding optimization.
599200	600200	AIFO?
600200	601500	I don't know.
601500	604240	But will it really be this extreme?
604240	610440	Because there is also possibility that this old world and this new world will just coexist.
610440	615680	In an interview with the Verge, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was asked this exact same
615680	617180	question.
617180	618880	And this is what he had to say.
618880	622200	You've trained the model on other people's information.
622200	625120	Other people's reporting and very biased in favor of reporting.
625120	627280	How do you make sure that they get the value back?
627280	631480	If you look at whether it's in the answer, whether it's in chat, these are just a different
631480	635400	way to represent the 10 blue links more in the context of what they just want.
635400	636840	And he actually may be right.
636840	641480	The way this new being is designed heavily features links to the source material and
641480	646340	is inviting you to learn more about what the AI is suggesting you by clicking on the links.
646340	650640	They have clickable links inside the response and people would still end up exploring websites
650640	653360	once they complete a search with the AI chatbot.
653360	658240	Don't forget that Google had this box already where they showed a preview of the content
658240	660080	of relevant information.
660080	662960	This is what is called a zero-click search.
662960	667000	So it might actually be that while people start to use these AI chatbots, they might
667000	672240	not completely overhaul the mechanics of the web, but just changing them slightly.
672240	677760	So in one example from Microsoft Keynote, they asked the AI to plan a vacation in Spain.
677760	681960	And it spit out a detailed day-to-day plan of what you should see, where you should go,
681960	682960	where you should stay.
682960	687500	Now, would you just take the first plane and just have that exact same trip without doing
687500	689000	any additional research?
689000	693180	No, you will probably take that as a starting point and then go ahead and learn more on
693180	695160	different websites and watch videos.
695160	699880	If I have a complex problem instead of starting from scratch, I can ask ChatGPT to lay out
699880	704640	a basic solution and then I can iterate from there and review what he has done.
704640	709480	And this means that people would probably not just stop going to websites completely,
709480	710520	they would still do it.
710520	715000	But maybe instead of visiting 9 or 10 websites to solve a complex problem, you might end
715000	717240	up needing just one or two.
717240	721520	And also, for the time being, AI in many cases is just completely wrong.
721520	726200	While Google took most of the blow and lost 100 billion in market cap, as one of their
726200	732040	promotional tweets for their model bar showed an error in a sentence, Microsoft is also
732040	733520	suffering from the same problem.
733520	738000	It didn't get the same attention in the media, in the demo they asked Bing to compare the
738000	740840	financials of the Gap company versus another one.
740840	745440	And when people actually checked the numbers, it turns out some of them were completely
745440	746440	made up.
746440	751080	It's still clear that even if websites do not disappear, many would still see the traffic
751080	753840	from search fizzle out of our time.
753840	758960	And while in the beginning, AI search engines might get away with not paying content creators
758960	763360	for the information, eventually they would still have to find a way to compensate the
763360	765440	people that are generating the content.
765440	770160	And so the first thing that could happen is that this is finally the time where we move
770160	773760	away from websites and go all in into platforms.
773760	778480	I don't know about you, but when I have a problem or need any kind of information, if
778480	782600	it's not a Google search, I'll just browse videos on YouTube.
782600	786320	If I need more obscure answers and see what people are discussing, I'll look at Reddit.
786320	790280	Twitter gets me all the rapid fire rants about topics I care about.
790280	793880	And if I want to read some articles, I go on Substack or Medium.
793880	798360	Aside of search, these are the getaways to the internet that most people use.
798360	802160	Because like it or not, online platforms simply work.
802160	806840	They each have their own rules and controversies and pros and cons, but they allow people to
806840	808960	independently create content.
808960	813120	And so what could happen is that all the people and websites that were spending their time
813120	818920	and effort making SEO optimized content for search would end up transitioning to other
818920	819920	platforms.
819920	824960	In my opinion, the SEO model was broken from the start and it just led to piles of bad
824960	830560	information reposted all over again in a competition to rank the highest on Google.
830560	836120	And AI search chatbots could finally be a way to bridge the gap between search and online
836120	837120	platforms.
837120	841480	Today, when you search for something on Google or Bing, the integration with platforms like
841480	846280	Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter or any of those is just bad.
846280	851040	And this is because these platforms never had much interest in opening up their content
851040	853720	library completely to search engines.
853720	857320	In the best case, they would get some extra traffic here and there.
857320	859400	But that is up until now.
859520	865280	AI chatbots not only start to interpret just text, but are able to interpret also the content
865280	869800	of a YouTube video in the future and contextualize it with an article from Medium and someone
869800	872080	to follow on Instagram and a Twitter thread.
872080	877000	The platforms will have more incentives to open up older content and make it more available
877000	883040	to search engines to put it out in front of users when they are making AI chatbot searches.
883040	887520	And this can also represent a new renaissance of user generated content.
887520	893080	Slowly but surely, platforms are realizing that to thrive, they need to pass down advertising
893080	897160	revenue to creators, just like YouTube has been doing for years.
897160	902320	TikTok is starting to monetize more heavily and platforms like Substack or Medium allow
902320	906000	you to monetize directly the content that you create.
906000	911720	Because traditional information websites are losing the battle with user generated content.
911720	914840	And AI will accelerate this even more.
914840	917800	So what do I believe will happen exactly?
917800	919400	I don't really know.
919400	923680	But there's someone whose opinion I really wanted to hear, and this is David Imel.
923680	929440	He's one of the writers behind MBKBHD's videos, co-host of the Waveform podcast, and was
929440	931600	also a writer for Android Out40.
931600	935400	So I think it's still pretty early days in the way that AI is going to be affecting
935400	939520	search engines and I'm not sure that anyone has really come up with the greatest version
939520	941440	of how that's gonna work yet anyway, right?
941440	945360	Like Bing is still the first implementation of how this is gonna work.
945360	949880	Whether or not Google integrates it directly into Google search or has a separate option
949880	952840	for Bard, we still don't really know that yet.
952840	957280	I think ultimately there is that feedback loop problem where if websites stop making
957280	962160	content because everyone is using these chatbots to get information, there's gonna be nothing
962160	964400	for these chatbots to scrape from.
964400	967720	But I personally think that there's going to be less of an impact on the way that the
967720	971000	web actually works than we think there is, right?
971040	974880	We already sort of have chatbots based in Google search already.
974880	980200	If you search pretty much anything super basic, it gives you a direct answer at the very top.
980200	985240	We still already use things like Google Assistant, which gives us pretty instantaneous answers
985240	990120	on things or even say based on Wikipedia, XYZ, right?
990120	994320	It's really only the more nuanced questions that these chatbots are starting to give us
994320	995320	answers for.
995320	1000440	And I think that most people who want to do their own research and have more of an interest
1000480	1005160	in a thing that isn't just what's the capital of Japan are probably going to be digging
