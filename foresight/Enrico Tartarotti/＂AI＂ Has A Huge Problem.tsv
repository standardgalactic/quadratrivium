0	9680	AI is everywhere, but have you noticed that AI today is also a complete mess?
9680	11520	So I can generate some text in Notion.
11520	12520	That's cool, I guess.
12520	14720	Can I give it some data in a file to recap?
14720	15720	Nope.
15720	16720	For that, I need to use ChudgeBT.
16720	20160	Well, not ChudgeBT, but I need ChudgeBT+.
20160	24920	If I need to search the web, I need a Microsoft Copilot, which is inside Bing, which was formerly
24920	28360	known as Bing Chat, which in reality is GPT4 Turbo.
28360	29360	Cool.
29360	30360	Can you help me a YouTube video?
30360	31360	Well, no.
31360	32520	Come on, don't be silly.
32520	38200	For that, you have to use GeminiAdvanced, powered by Gemini 1.5, formerly known as GeminiUltra,
38200	41600	formerly known as Bard, which integrates with YouTube because it's owned by Google.
41600	47640	AI today is a chaotic mess of annoying pop-ups that ask you to please, please try your latest
47640	48640	AI feature.
48640	52560	Random Chatbots and Assistant popping up everywhere, in every app you use.
52560	56440	And most of this is, well, totally useless.
56440	60680	As you see, there are four key issues with the wildest state of AI today.
60680	64120	But not all hope is lost, because there is a solution.
64120	66920	And no, don't worry, it's not another AI gadget.
66920	71480	But first, we have to understand why everything is becoming a chatbot.
71480	76160	It seems like today, if your app doesn't have a chatbot with AI, it's not a part of the
76160	77160	cool kids anymore.
77160	79240	Google is adding a chatbot to their search app.
79240	84560	After being a meme for 10 years, Bing is now back in the search game with, well, a chatbot.
84560	87280	New ones like perplexed AI are springing up everywhere.
87280	88440	But it's not just search.
88440	89440	It's everything.
89440	93600	Your presentation tool now has a chatbot, Photoshop now has a chatbot, Notion has a chatbot,
93600	97480	Figgem has a chatbot, Shopify has a chatbot, Microsoft even wants to replace the Windows
97480	103340	key on all new PCs with a co-pilot key that brings up, well, you guessed it, a chatbot.
103340	105640	But chatbots themselves are not the problem.
105640	109720	ChatGPT is what started it all, and it now has hundreds of millions of users.
109720	114520	No, the real problem is that, for most things, a chatbot is not the right way of interacting.
115480	118360	Actually, it makes things worse than they were before.
118360	122640	Let's take one of the main things that all these chatbots tell you they're amazing at,
122640	123640	planning a trip.
123640	127160	This is the typical complex activity where you go to different websites and blogs and
127160	131720	compare prices, and you find the distance between hotels and attractions, and an AI assistant
131720	133920	seems to be the perfect solution here.
133920	138560	Type what you need and get your perfect trip planned for you, except a chatbot sucks for
138560	139560	this.
139560	143800	It gives you a wall of text with no images, no maps, no directions, no easy way to compare
143800	144800	airfares.
144800	148240	Since I still travel like a broke student, I tried giving it some pricing guidance,
148240	151360	but it completely ignored it, and I'm not alone here.
151360	155840	A team of researchers tested chatbots on a thousand queries for travel itineraries.
155840	159760	And they counted how many times the chatbot actually proposed something that met all of
159760	160760	this criteria.
160760	165880	OpenAI's GPT-4 model performed the best of the bunch, with six successful queries out
165880	166880	of a thousand.
166880	171400	And counterintuitively, even for things like search, a chatbot in most cases is not the
171400	172400	right tool.
172400	176600	This search question on Google is simply what to watch, and many people use search engines
176600	178280	just as a way to open their email.
178280	184080	As the Verge puts it, AI is the right idea, but a chatbot is the wrong interface.
184080	188520	But sure, with the chatbot you can ask it to make a rap song about your vacation plans,
188520	189520	I guess.
189520	194800	So if chatbots are not the right way to interact with AI in most cases, then why are they everywhere?
194800	197320	Well, because tech people are lazy.
197320	198520	Sort of.
198520	202360	When chatbots came out in December 2022, it took the world by storm.
202360	207320	It was the fastest product in history to reach 100 million users, and it started the largest
207320	211360	FOMO run in tech in the last years, where everyone scrambled.
211360	215040	The big companies like Amazon, Meta, Google started building their own large language
215040	218000	models, which is basically what today we call AI.
218000	221800	And everyone else now had to have some sort of AI in their product.
221800	223600	And was the easiest way to do it?
223600	227520	Step one, pay open AI to use one of their models like GPT-4, so you don't have to do
227520	228520	anything yourself.
228520	232320	Then, well, GPT-4 takes in text and spits out text.
232320	237040	So step two, let's build the simplest thing that takes in text and spits out text, which
237040	238840	is a chatbot.
238840	242480	Step three, give it a nice skin, colors, and we're done.
242480	246320	Chatbots are the easiest and quickest way to add AI to your app.
246320	250960	Now, you've seen AI features pop up everywhere in the apps and products you use every day.
250960	252440	But think about it.
252440	255720	How many of these do you actually really use?
255720	256720	My guess?
256720	257720	Very, very few.
257720	262200	A recent research shows that 85% of all AI projects fail.
262200	265840	So why are companies scrambling to add chatbots and useless features?
265840	270520	Well, they caught a virus that has been around in the tech industry for decades now.
270520	277640	They caught the frenzy.
277640	282080	This is an ad from 2000, at the peak of the dotcom bubble, where the internet was the
282080	283840	cool new thing.
283840	287680	And this is a 2024 ad for an AI gaming laptop.
287680	289000	What is an AI gaming laptop?
289000	291320	It's a laptop with a chatbot.
291320	294320	These are an example of what happens in the frenzy.
294320	298720	Whenever a new technology becomes mainstream, this is exactly what happens.
298720	301720	Everyone takes this new tech and runs like crazy to add it to their product.
301720	305640	In 2000, just adding dotcom to the name of your company to show that it was on the web
305640	307240	made the stock price jump.
307240	311240	During the last crypto rush, everything needed to be on the blockchain and have NFTs.
311240	315160	This company, Long Island brand beverages, made Ice Tea.
315160	319040	But they decided to swiftly change their name to Long Blockchain Corp.
319040	320480	And now it's a turn of AI.
320480	324400	As soon as Chagabity hit it big, marketing people in tech companies around the world
324400	326760	were like...
326760	329080	Because now there's the AI toothbrush.
329080	331040	There's the AI pet football.
331040	333640	There's the AI candle scent.
333640	335640	And tech giants are not immune to this.
335640	339800	Samsung's whole campaign for this year's Galaxy phones is Galaxy AI.
339800	343880	Despite AI already being in Galaxy phones for years now.
343880	348240	Because yeah, in reality, AI has been here and you've been using it for years.
348240	351320	Facebook has been using AI to serve you ads for the last decade.
351320	355080	Your phone has been using AI to optimize your battery life for years.
355080	358400	In fact, AI doesn't really mean anything.
358400	361800	The word artificial intelligence was born in 1956.
361800	367120	And technically, a GPT model with 100 billion parameters and your email spam filter are both
367120	369120	a form of artificial intelligence.
369120	374040	But ever since Chagabity came out, AI basically means large language models.
374040	379040	Because it's easier to say AI than transformer-based deep neural network for natural language
379040	380040	processing.
380040	382040	But this frenzy has created something else.
382040	386560	It has revived a dream that has been around in tech for science fiction for decades.
386560	387560	Jarvis.
387560	390080	Or dream of the Omniscient Chatbot.
390080	393680	Jarvis is the digital assistant to Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies.
393680	397880	An all-accompassing, useful and sarcastic companion that solved every problem.
397880	400520	And that in one movie tried to take over the world.
400520	404080	Science fiction has always dreamed of the ultimate digital assistant.
404080	405680	It's Jarvis in Iron Man.
405680	408120	It's Hall in 2001, a space odyssey.
408120	409480	It stars in Interstellar.
409480	413000	Visits the original vision behind Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.
413000	417720	And as soon as Chagabity exploded, the tech world got infatuated again with this idea.
417720	419200	And I don't blame them.
419200	424280	A large language model seems like the perfect solution to create a real-life version of Jarvis.
424680	428760	A chatbot that finally understands complex problems and has memory.
428760	433280	And many have been so captivated by this dream that they are focusing tons of energy and
433280	435600	resources on actually building this.
435600	437440	Companies like Humane were their AI pin.
437440	442960	But as these start to be released, we are starting to see why this is all a big illusion.
442960	444480	Look at this and tell me what company it is.
444480	447720	The company is called Lyft.
447720	451400	There's a gigantic problem with wanting to create the Omniscient Chatbot.
451400	454600	And that's that in order to be useful, it needs to have access to everything.
454600	459240	Your WhatsApp messages, your inbox, your embarrassing Spotify playlist, your work documents.
459240	463240	If the Omniscient Chatbot doesn't have access to even a few of these, it loses the whole
463240	464240	point.
464240	467640	So say that you are a new company and you want to build a universal chatbot.
467640	471760	You have a great large language model, but now you need to make it work with all the
471760	473840	stuff that people actually use.
473840	478320	So you go to Mark Zuckerberg and you ask him, hey, can my universal chatbot access WhatsApp,
478320	480000	you know, for my users?
480120	481120	No.
481120	486240	And not only that, Mark now says, wait a minute, I can build my own universal chatbot.
486240	490480	And now Mark's chatbot, in order to be useful, needs to access your work documents, which
490480	491480	are in Notion.
491480	493920	Is Notion going to allow Mark's chatbot in?
493920	494920	Nope.
494920	497040	And Notion CEO now has a great idea.
497040	500280	We can build a universal chatbot and so on and so forth.
500280	501280	You get the point.
501280	502640	All right, so this chapter is done.
502640	504680	Let me allocate some time to write the next one.
504680	506680	Oh, you're wondering what this tool is?
506680	509280	Well, this is a sponsor of this video, AkiFlow.
509280	512720	If you follow this channel, well, probably your digital life is a mess.
512720	518000	You have multiple calendars to do apps, productivity apps, Notion, Linear, how do you make sense
518000	519000	of all this?
519000	523080	AkiFlow is the ultimate productivity tool to keep your life organized in one place.
523080	526680	The thing I love the most is that I can take a task and I can block some time for it on
526680	527680	my calendar.
527680	530600	I have an email here that I need to block some time to reply.
530600	534920	And voila, I can drop it directly into my calendar and so I can just go on and plan my
534920	536480	day in a few minutes.
536560	540160	AkiFlow is the final boss of productivity apps because you don't have to choose between
540160	541640	one app or the other.
541640	546000	It's just integrates with everything so I can plan my days from one single place.
546000	550760	And if I hit Command K, I can create tasks and do everything with natural language.
550760	553000	You can try AkiFlow today with a link in the description.
553000	556680	And if you want to learn more, you can even book on one-on-one call with the AkiFlow team.
556680	558080	Again, link in the description.
558080	562520	And now back to the video because even if we don't want to build the omnicent chatbot,
562520	563920	there is another problem here.
564160	568080	A problem that we actually already solved more than 40 years ago.
568080	573720	But that for some weird reason, now we have recreated the command line problem.
573720	577120	So sometimes I use my journey to generate my videos thumbnails.
577120	579400	And it's really mind-blowing what it can do.
579400	582120	But when I use it, I need something very specific.
582120	583680	And this is where it starts.
583680	586240	An endless back and forth of different prompts.
586240	589640	And oh, this doesn't work, so let me try a different order of words.
589640	592560	Now I also start reading Reddit threads and online guides.
592560	595160	And oh, here's a mid-journey prompting course.
595160	599400	Wait, wasn't the whole point of AI that it's natural and intuitive to use?
599400	601320	I'm back to reading manuals.
601320	606120	Well, this is exactly the same problem that we had 40 years ago when computers first arrived.
606120	608280	They were so powerful and so useful.
608280	614440	It was almost nobody could use them because the only way to interact with a computer was with this, the command line.
614440	621640	You need to remember complex commands and flags and options even to create a folder, open a file and any typo results in an error.
621680	624080	And we solve this with a graphical user interface.
624080	629640	Icons, buttons, windows, the mouse, all of these are basically a substitute for text-based commands.
629640	634480	Today, both on Windows and Mac, you can open the command line and do everything that you do on your computer with it.
634480	638360	But nobody does this, because it's clear that there's a better way to do things.
638360	644040	You don't need to write a complex terminal command to see the latest Instagram story of your friends getting wasted in a club.
644040	646880	And I think you might be getting the point already.
646920	650280	This AI wave has brought back this exact same problem.
650280	655560	Because chat GPT, mid-journey and all these AI chatbots are basically like command lines.
655560	658680	We are back to writing text on our keyboards and getting text back.
658680	662280	We are back to having to learn prompt and having to use guides and manuals.
662280	666160	It's like we are back in the 1980s, but with unaffordable housing now.
666160	669080	Good design is where you don't need an instructions manual.
669080	673760	Have you ever needed an instructions manual to figure out how to use an iPhone or Google Maps?
673760	676080	No, that's because they are insanely well designed.
676080	678880	We ran towards chatbots because they are easy to build.
678880	683320	But in doing so, we have thrown everyone back in the days of command lines.
683320	684640	And I know what you're thinking.
684640	688640	It's so easy, let's just slap some buttons and sliders on the screen to control the chatbot.
688640	691000	Well, this is Automatic 1111.
691000	694480	A graphical user interface for the image model stable diffusion.
694480	699120	And I don't know about you, but you're seeing it and I can tell you it's even more scary than using a chatbot.
699120	701400	So solving this problem is gonna take a while.
701400	703000	And so, what now?
703000	704680	We have chatbots everywhere.
704680	708080	We are pursuing this idea of the Omniscient Jarvis Assistant.
708080	712760	And every time I use an app, I have to dismiss seven pop-ups to use their useless AI features.
712760	714040	Is this really it?
714040	715440	Well, no.
715440	718960	There is a solution on the horizon, but it's a counter-intuitive one.
718960	721160	Because it's not about more AI.
721160	723680	Actually, it's about getting rid of AI.
723680	725600	Making AI invisible.
725600	727560	This is a mock-up I made of Skyscanner.
727560	731520	And you can see that instead of using a random chatbot, I created a customized trip option.
731520	734200	So you can use the UI that you're familiar with to search for flights,
734200	739320	but still be able to create the perfect custom flight search for you.
739320	742200	And you know when you get those messages that you forget to reply to?
742200	745800	Well, another thing we can do is use AI to smartly analyze the messages
745800	748720	and remind you only of the ones that you actually need to reply to.
748720	750920	These are all examples of invisible AI.
750920	753280	Instead of saying, hey, look, we have a new chatbot.
753280	756440	It's cool new AI, although you're probably never gonna use it.
756440	760400	These take the opposite approach and start from a real problem that people have.
760400	763680	And then apply AI to it because it just can help solve it.
763680	766600	And if you notice in none of these examples, are we telling users,
766600	770440	hey, there's fancy AI in here because I'm sorry, tech marketing people,
770440	776680	but users don't care if there's AI or if there's umpa-lumpas writing responses to the prompts.
776680	778960	They just care about getting their problems solved.
778960	780640	Today, we have these chatbots everywhere.
780640	784400	But when nobody ends up using them and the AI hype train dies down,
784400	787800	designers, engineers and product managers will roll up their sleeves
787800	790920	and start to build AI in a way that's truly useful.
790920	793240	And even though we are still inside the frenzy,
793240	796280	we're starting to see the first three examples of this.
796280	798320	Premiere Pro, the video editing software,
798320	801240	is adding the ability to extend your clips by a couple of seconds
801240	803520	if you need some extra footage you're missing.
803520	805440	And it generates those with AI.
805440	809160	YouTube is working on adding automated AI dubbing of videos.
810080	821320	ARCHER BROWSER automatically renames your tabs to make them more easily readable in less space,
821320	823320	without you having to do anything.
823320	826720	And this is the AI I'm truly excited about.
826720	828800	But as it turns out, even without AI,
828800	831760	the tech we use everyday hides secrets in plain sight.
831760	835600	Like how the iPhone icons are actually not rounder rectangles,
835600	838440	or how the Spotify shuffle is not actually random.
838440	841480	And you can learn all about it in this video right here.
841480	844200	I'm Enrico and I'll see you in the next one.
