1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
It all started on November 30th, 2022, when ChatGPT was released.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,600
And now, not even two months later, Microsoft and Google are battling it out, to get real

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,580
conversational AI into search.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,940
But while everyone is focused on who will win this AI battle, it doesn't really matter.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,600
Because whichever way it goes, this AI war is going to completely change the delicate

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,640
balance of how the internet itself works.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,040
And this might also end up killing the concept of a website as we know it.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,840
There are three key things that could play out and shape how we use the web in an extent

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,000
to 20 years.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,880
But to understand what's gonna happen in the future, we first have to look at how things

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
are today.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,960
Websites are what started it all.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,280
20 years ago, there were blobs of information and content, mostly in text form, and mostly

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
independent.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,440
They were not motivated by money, but by passion for a specific topic.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
And by people wanting to carve out their own little space in this new thing called the

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,240
World Wide Web.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,040
But finding things was the really painful part.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,360
You really had to know the websites you were after, and this is where search engines came

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
in.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,160
First, they tried to organize with mess by categories.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
And finally, Google cracked the code of proper search.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,560
Then, in December of 2000, they launched AdWords, and ads started to appear in Google's search

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
results.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,120
And with that, website owners and businesses started to realize that this is not a fun

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,680
digital game anymore.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,560
It's very real money with very real economics.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Having traffic coming to your websites was not just bragging rights with your friends

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
anymore.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,280
And as the amount of people that started to explore the web from a search engine grew,

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,800
a silent pact, a silent alliance was formed that is the real engine to the internet all

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,040
the way to today.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,720
Websites would allow search engines to get their content for free and indecise it.

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,040
And search engines would send them users and traffic.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
This innocent looking silent agreement is what gave birth to the modern web.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,120
With all the websites, also newspapers and journalists follow suit, maybe reluctantly

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
sometimes.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,440
But with time, this silent agreement has been taken to the extreme.

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,320
Websites realized that they could gain the system by stuffing more keywords into their

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,000
articles and blog posts or farming backlinks.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,800
They learned that they could churn out more and more content just to appeal to specific

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
keywords.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,240
And the more they did that, the more Google and search engine would send them more and

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
more traffic.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,960
And this would rank them higher and make them more money.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,200
And voila, search engine optimization, or SEO, is born.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,520
And while this was happening, search engines were making more money than ever.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,920
In the meantime, independent websites found even another way to monetize their traffic,

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
affiliate links.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,320
You can now write an article about, say, top 10 TVs to buy right now and get a percentage

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,640
where someone buys from an e-commerce store using your link.

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,800
And this is basically how the web works today.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,960
But the smartest one of you will already have found out the big problem.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,880
This system fully relies on this one link right here, this silent agreement, traffic

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,000
for access to content.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,120
This one agreement represents billions of dollars in revenue, thousands of companies

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,320
And AI-search chatbots are about to turn this balance upside down.

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,720
It doesn't really matter if it's Google or Bing or Yahoo, it's not going to be Yahoo.

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,440
Come out with their own disruptive AI.

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,120
Things are about to change.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,520
It's clear that conversational AI is not a gimmick, it's not a fad, it's here to stay.

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,960
ChatGPT was the fastest piece of tech to reach 100 million users.

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,480
And this is a signal that the technology will become a key part of our lives.

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,080
But trying to understand something so seemingly complex, like AI, can definitely be overwhelming.

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Where do you even start?

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,040
And that's why this video is sponsored by Brilliant.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
Everyone likes to throw around AI as a buzzword these days.

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,440
But the ones that will be able to ride this wave are those who really understand how artificial

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,480
intelligence works at its core.

71
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,600
And Brilliant.org is the best way to learn about it.

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,160
I've already taken the artificial neural networks and their enforcement learning courses

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,880
to really understand what is going on at the heart of this technology.

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,640
And since we are talking about search, why not learn how search engines really work with

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
a search engine course?

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,040
What I like most about Brilliant is that I'm finally able to fit learning into my day,

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,840
even though I have a full-time job and I manage a YouTube channel, because it is perfect for

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
people with a busy schedule.

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,640
If you follow my channel, you are probably as excited and as optimistic as I am about

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,320
technology and science.

81
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,480
If you use my link in the description, the first 200 people to sign up will get 20% of

82
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,000
their annual premium subscription.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
And get one month for free.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,280
And now, back to the video.

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Now let's be clear.

86
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,560
I don't know what is going to happen right now.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,280
And if I did, I would be probably very rich very soon.

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,000
I would buy 42 jet skis and some island demaldives.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,440
But there are three possible things that can change on the horizon.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,240
And the first one is that AI goes all in on websites.

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
As a new being has been rolled out, it has been blowing people's minds with its ability

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:21,360
to understand complex problems and give a detailed solution on how to solve them.

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,480
Now both Google and Bing are planning to integrate these chatbots alongside the traditional

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
list of blue links.

95
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,080
But it probably won't be long until people start to realize how easy it is to use the

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,400
chatbot experience rather than browsing through a bunch of links.

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,480
And so with this, traditional search results will start to get less and less clicks.

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,960
And as I work in tech, I can assure you that usage data is one of the main things that

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
tech companies look at when they take product decisions.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720
If people naturally shift away from the list of blue links, it's only a matter of time

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,560
before the big bosses at search engine companies will just decide to get the chatbot front

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,480
and center and outright remove the list of links that we all have been used to.

103
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,320
And the way we all explore the internet will change radically.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,480
Websites will go from the place you ended up getting the information you were looking

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,520
for to something like the footnotes of Wikipedia, something most people rarely even look at.

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,480
And with this, the balance that has been keeping traditional websites alive until now will

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,520
simply fall apart.

108
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,720
If the chatbot is giving you all the answers you need, why would you want to visit an ad

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,720
written website to get some generic SEO optimized blog post?

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Traffic to these kinds of informational websites will drop dramatically, and there will be

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,800
no incentives for them to keep publishing content.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,920
The engine of the web will stop, because this is all about basic game theory.

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,600
If websites stop giving search engines content, search engines will just not have any relevant

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,920
information to show, and they will stop getting advertising revenue.

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,520
On the other hand, if search engines stop sending traffic to websites, they don't have

116
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,440
anyone watching ads and clicking affiliate links, and they will also fade into obscurity.

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
If the balance is broken, everybody loses.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
And to keep this balance, search engines like Google or Bing or whoever will first of all

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
need to find a way to monetize AI chatbots.

120
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,440
And one of the best ways they could do this is by injecting ads contextually into their

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
response.

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,880
The more an ad is integrated into organic search results, the better it will work.

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,840
And we know it's gonna work, because that's what Google did 20 years ago.

124
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,280
Before Google, search engines showed random banner ads on the side of results.

125
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,920
Google was the first one to have the idea to introduce contextual advertising in the

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
search results themselves.

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,080
Another way to potentially monetize these chatbots would be to make them paid, or with

128
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
a subscription.

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,760
The search engine Neva is already going into this direction, because having a powerful

130
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,200
AI assistant like ChatGBT for your daily work can really increase your productivity and

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,280
actually justify the cost.

132
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,160
And even more for companies that would want to get these AI chatbots for all their employees.

133
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,800
So now that these AI chatbots have found a way to make money, they still need to make

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,880
sure they have valuable and up-to-date information to show users.

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,160
And since in this new future there will be no real incentives for websites to produce

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,800
any content, search engines could start to directly pay the creator of an article or

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,480
of a web page based on how much that piece of content has been used by an AI to provide

138
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
an answer.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,520
And this is because of a key difference that the new AI search models have with things

140
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
like ChatGBT.

141
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,800
ChatGBT is a monolithic AI model trained on a large dataset of information from the web.

142
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,800
And training this kind of model takes an enormous amount of computing power.

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,440
So it will be basically impossible to keep the model itself up-to-date with the latest

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,160
information that happened five minutes ago or the news that broke out an hour ago.

145
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,360
And this is why the big chatbot works differently.

146
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,360
They are using a not super up-to-date but quite smart base model to understand the language.

147
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,120
And then they instruct this AI model to make the needed web searches to answer a question.

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,520
Understand what's in the search results and speed out the answer.

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,120
So for each search we can clearly identify which websites provided the information to

150
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
answer the question.

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,840
And in this way they could each be compensated a tiny fraction of a cent.

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,900
But if this ends up happening it will be most likely the death of traditional SEO.

153
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,460
Why would you go to great lengths to create a whole website when Indiana is gonna be just

154
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,800
read by an AI to produce some answer in a chatbot?

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,760
And so new ways of giving information to these AI models to get them compensated will emerge

156
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,000
like marketplaces or even APIs.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,080
Where people would not even bother to build a website.

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,680
They can just transfer the information directly to the AI model via an API and then get compensated

159
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,920
based on how many people will end up using that information for the search results.

160
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,200
And this will change search engine optimization into something more like AI feeding optimization.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
AIFO?

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,500
I don't know.

163
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,240
But will it really be this extreme?

164
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,440
Because there is also possibility that this old world and this new world will just coexist.

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,680
In an interview with the Verge, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was asked this exact same

166
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,180
question.

167
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,880
And this is what he had to say.

168
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,200
You've trained the model on other people's information.

169
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,120
Other people's reporting and very biased in favor of reporting.

170
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,280
How do you make sure that they get the value back?

171
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,480
If you look at whether it's in the answer, whether it's in chat, these are just a different

172
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,400
way to represent the 10 blue links more in the context of what they just want.

173
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,840
And he actually may be right.

174
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,480
The way this new being is designed heavily features links to the source material and

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,340
is inviting you to learn more about what the AI is suggesting you by clicking on the links.

176
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,640
They have clickable links inside the response and people would still end up exploring websites

177
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
once they complete a search with the AI chatbot.

178
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Don't forget that Google had this box already where they showed a preview of the content

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
of relevant information.

180
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,960
This is what is called a zero-click search.

181
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,000
So it might actually be that while people start to use these AI chatbots, they might

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,240
not completely overhaul the mechanics of the web, but just changing them slightly.

183
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,760
So in one example from Microsoft Keynote, they asked the AI to plan a vacation in Spain.

184
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,960
And it spit out a detailed day-to-day plan of what you should see, where you should go,

185
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
where you should stay.

186
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,500
Now, would you just take the first plane and just have that exact same trip without doing

187
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
any additional research?

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,180
No, you will probably take that as a starting point and then go ahead and learn more on

189
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,160
different websites and watch videos.

190
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,880
If I have a complex problem instead of starting from scratch, I can ask ChatGPT to lay out

191
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,640
a basic solution and then I can iterate from there and review what he has done.

192
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,480
And this means that people would probably not just stop going to websites completely,

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
they would still do it.

194
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,000
But maybe instead of visiting 9 or 10 websites to solve a complex problem, you might end

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
up needing just one or two.

196
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,520
And also, for the time being, AI in many cases is just completely wrong.

197
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,200
While Google took most of the blow and lost 100 billion in market cap, as one of their

198
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,040
promotional tweets for their model bar showed an error in a sentence, Microsoft is also

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,520
suffering from the same problem.

200
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,000
It didn't get the same attention in the media, in the demo they asked Bing to compare the

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,840
financials of the Gap company versus another one.

202
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,440
And when people actually checked the numbers, it turns out some of them were completely

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
made up.

204
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,080
It's still clear that even if websites do not disappear, many would still see the traffic

205
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,840
from search fizzle out of our time.

206
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,960
And while in the beginning, AI search engines might get away with not paying content creators

207
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,360
for the information, eventually they would still have to find a way to compensate the

208
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,440
people that are generating the content.

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
And so the first thing that could happen is that this is finally the time where we move

210
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,760
away from websites and go all in into platforms.

211
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,480
I don't know about you, but when I have a problem or need any kind of information, if

212
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,600
it's not a Google search, I'll just browse videos on YouTube.

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,320
If I need more obscure answers and see what people are discussing, I'll look at Reddit.

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,280
Twitter gets me all the rapid fire rants about topics I care about.

215
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,880
And if I want to read some articles, I go on Substack or Medium.

216
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,360
Aside of search, these are the getaways to the internet that most people use.

217
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Because like it or not, online platforms simply work.

218
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,840
They each have their own rules and controversies and pros and cons, but they allow people to

219
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,960
independently create content.

220
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,120
And so what could happen is that all the people and websites that were spending their time

221
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,920
and effort making SEO optimized content for search would end up transitioning to other

222
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
platforms.

223
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,960
In my opinion, the SEO model was broken from the start and it just led to piles of bad

224
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,560
information reposted all over again in a competition to rank the highest on Google.

225
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,120
And AI search chatbots could finally be a way to bridge the gap between search and online

226
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
platforms.

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,480
Today, when you search for something on Google or Bing, the integration with platforms like

228
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,280
Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter or any of those is just bad.

229
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,040
And this is because these platforms never had much interest in opening up their content

230
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,720
library completely to search engines.

231
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,320
In the best case, they would get some extra traffic here and there.

232
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
But that is up until now.

233
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,280
AI chatbots not only start to interpret just text, but are able to interpret also the content

234
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,800
of a YouTube video in the future and contextualize it with an article from Medium and someone

235
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,080
to follow on Instagram and a Twitter thread.

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,000
The platforms will have more incentives to open up older content and make it more available

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,040
to search engines to put it out in front of users when they are making AI chatbot searches.

238
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,520
And this can also represent a new renaissance of user generated content.

239
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Slowly but surely, platforms are realizing that to thrive, they need to pass down advertising

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,160
revenue to creators, just like YouTube has been doing for years.

241
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,320
TikTok is starting to monetize more heavily and platforms like Substack or Medium allow

242
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
you to monetize directly the content that you create.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,720
Because traditional information websites are losing the battle with user generated content.

244
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,840
And AI will accelerate this even more.

245
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,800
So what do I believe will happen exactly?

246
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
I don't really know.

247
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,680
But there's someone whose opinion I really wanted to hear, and this is David Imel.

248
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,440
He's one of the writers behind MBKBHD's videos, co-host of the Waveform podcast, and was

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,600
also a writer for Android Out40.

250
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,400
So I think it's still pretty early days in the way that AI is going to be affecting

251
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,520
search engines and I'm not sure that anyone has really come up with the greatest version

252
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,440
of how that's gonna work yet anyway, right?

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Like Bing is still the first implementation of how this is gonna work.

254
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,880
Whether or not Google integrates it directly into Google search or has a separate option

255
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,840
for Bard, we still don't really know that yet.

256
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,280
I think ultimately there is that feedback loop problem where if websites stop making

257
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,160
content because everyone is using these chatbots to get information, there's gonna be nothing

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,400
for these chatbots to scrape from.

259
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,720
But I personally think that there's going to be less of an impact on the way that the

260
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,000
web actually works than we think there is, right?

261
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,880
We already sort of have chatbots based in Google search already.

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,200
If you search pretty much anything super basic, it gives you a direct answer at the very top.

263
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,240
We still already use things like Google Assistant, which gives us pretty instantaneous answers

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,120
on things or even say based on Wikipedia, XYZ, right?

265
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,320
It's really only the more nuanced questions that these chatbots are starting to give us

266
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
answers for.

267
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,440
And I think that most people who want to do their own research and have more of an interest

268
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,160
in a thing that isn't just what's the capital of Japan are probably going to be digging

269
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,800
into those links to do more research anyway.

270
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,120
So while it's useful for these chatbots to be giving us these like broader answers in

271
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,120
paragraph form, I'm not sure about the speed of adoption.

272
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,280
And I think that there's going to be a large period of time where the market matures and

273
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
things actually change and people figure out how we're going to use this before we see

274
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,120
some sort of like collapse of the internet or anything like that.

275
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Maybe it also makes incredibly interesting tech videos on a YouTube channel, so make

276
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400
sure to check him out.
