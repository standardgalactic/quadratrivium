0	7340	Why did we learn Python Uni? Because we had to become a senior machine learning engineer before we had the time to learn programming
7960	17280	Before we start make sure, you know, we're talking about Python 3 not Python 2 actually a bit of Python 2.7 is also okay geared towards children and
18440	21480	PhDs children and PhDs Python
21480	27400	I know Python which means I know machine learning AI data science computer vision big data
27440	32640	Cara hands of flow like it learn high toward open CV deep learning NLP
33360	40920	Huge community of kids now. I didn't learn Python in an online course. Actually never really learned it lists
40920	45280	Are arrays tuples are arrays sets have no order dicts are arrays
45720	52600	Comprehensions are arrays numpy arrays are arrays. No more semi-colon errors only white space errors. Where is that error?
53040	58160	Enumerate enumerate zip OS walk tuple unpacking. It's not dynamically typed
58160	62160	It's strongly dynamically typed in Python. We don't do constants
62160	69000	We only do change who put the main function at the bottom of the file equality is not identity is not
69600	72120	Identity I can do in Python in five lines
72120	79240	Which you can do in C in 50 and it will take 10 times the time to execute. Oh, I didn't I didn't say that wrong, right?
79240	85160	Oh, yeah, who needs brackets anyway all these people with their illogical syntax sugar might need brackets
85160	90560	You can return multiple values multiple values multiple values. Are you to me?
90920	93360	No, I learned all of this on medium
93360	98600	How many libraries does it take until I can actually put Python as my status on LinkedIn like three
98800	104320	Numpy met plot lip and us pandas pandas pandas or maybe two, you know, because we start counting from zero
104440	111120	STR minus one double colon zero minus one, huh? It's that's smart engineering
111800	114720	Fast and that's engineer. That's smart
114720	120800	All the compile languages are worse because you get errors before you can even run them. It's like man
120800	124720	It's really, you know holding you back from innovation science
125480	129960	Automation progress not very child friendly if you ask me and I'm not a child
129960	135360	So I'm a PhD. Oh the shirt goes into the jeans in C++. Everything takes so long
135360	142640	You have to write into main declare variables. It's literally just the execution. That's fast. Who cares. It's about the
143280	150360	Scientific revolutionary data science machine learning NLP big data that you're going to do with yourself
150360	158480	Or you can automate your coffee machine, which does the coffee that helps you make the scientific advances in Lua ideas to code
158480	164640	Why can't I just run this in latex latex? Oh, this is a Python interview. All right, Python
164640	171720	Why am I so good at this? I've never written code before to pull open bracket. Oh, this is machine learning
171720	176160	Oh, this is data science a big data NLP computer vision
177280	183560	AI you know what that is. I can give you a quick tutorial. I just learned that are you to me on medium just an hour ago
183560	189120	That's a machine learning generative adversarial networks. Have you heard of them me neither? Let's check it out
189120	194280	Oh, it's really easy to find the documentation is just one page almost there almost there
195080	197080	Where's the async with?
201280	204320	All right, oh you want to learn Python we can do it just right now
204320	210880	You don't really need to learn anything or you need to learn at least three libraries Panas map plot lip and numpy
211280	217840	Fundamental well the good thing in Python is single and double quotes are not differentiated because you don't need to cite properly
217840	224640	It's not latex. Sadly. Are you convinced? Should we do a tutorial? I mean, should we read a medium write a medium block?
224720	229360	Let me show you a graph real quick. Let me introduce you to a graph real quick
229360	236680	this represents the amount of memory used by C for my program and this represents the
236680	241560	Amount of memory Python uses my screen is not big enough
