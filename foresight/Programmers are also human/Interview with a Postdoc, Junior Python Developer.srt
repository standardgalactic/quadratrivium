1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
Why did we learn Python Uni? Because we had to become a senior machine learning engineer before we had the time to learn programming

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:17,280
Before we start make sure, you know, we're talking about Python 3 not Python 2 actually a bit of Python 2.7 is also okay geared towards children and

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,480
PhDs children and PhDs Python

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,400
I know Python which means I know machine learning AI data science computer vision big data

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,640
Cara hands of flow like it learn high toward open CV deep learning NLP

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,920
Huge community of kids now. I didn't learn Python in an online course. Actually never really learned it lists

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,280
Are arrays tuples are arrays sets have no order dicts are arrays

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,600
Comprehensions are arrays numpy arrays are arrays. No more semi-colon errors only white space errors. Where is that error?

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,160
Enumerate enumerate zip OS walk tuple unpacking. It's not dynamically typed

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
It's strongly dynamically typed in Python. We don't do constants

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,000
We only do change who put the main function at the bottom of the file equality is not identity is not

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,120
Identity I can do in Python in five lines

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:19,240
Which you can do in C in 50 and it will take 10 times the time to execute. Oh, I didn't I didn't say that wrong, right?

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,160
Oh, yeah, who needs brackets anyway all these people with their illogical syntax sugar might need brackets

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,560
You can return multiple values multiple values multiple values. Are you to me?

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,360
No, I learned all of this on medium

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,600
How many libraries does it take until I can actually put Python as my status on LinkedIn like three

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Numpy met plot lip and us pandas pandas pandas or maybe two, you know, because we start counting from zero

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,120
STR minus one double colon zero minus one, huh? It's that's smart engineering

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,720
Fast and that's engineer. That's smart

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,800
All the compile languages are worse because you get errors before you can even run them. It's like man

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,720
It's really, you know holding you back from innovation science

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,960
Automation progress not very child friendly if you ask me and I'm not a child

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,360
So I'm a PhD. Oh the shirt goes into the jeans in C++. Everything takes so long

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,640
You have to write into main declare variables. It's literally just the execution. That's fast. Who cares. It's about the

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,360
Scientific revolutionary data science machine learning NLP big data that you're going to do with yourself

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,480
Or you can automate your coffee machine, which does the coffee that helps you make the scientific advances in Lua ideas to code

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,640
Why can't I just run this in latex latex? Oh, this is a Python interview. All right, Python

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,720
Why am I so good at this? I've never written code before to pull open bracket. Oh, this is machine learning

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,160
Oh, this is data science a big data NLP computer vision

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,560
AI you know what that is. I can give you a quick tutorial. I just learned that are you to me on medium just an hour ago

32
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,120
That's a machine learning generative adversarial networks. Have you heard of them me neither? Let's check it out

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh, it's really easy to find the documentation is just one page almost there almost there

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Where's the async with?

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,320
All right, oh you want to learn Python we can do it just right now

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,880
You don't really need to learn anything or you need to learn at least three libraries Panas map plot lip and numpy

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,840
Fundamental well the good thing in Python is single and double quotes are not differentiated because you don't need to cite properly

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640
It's not latex. Sadly. Are you convinced? Should we do a tutorial? I mean, should we read a medium write a medium block?

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,360
Let me show you a graph real quick. Let me introduce you to a graph real quick

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,680
this represents the amount of memory used by C for my program and this represents the

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,560
Amount of memory Python uses my screen is not big enough
