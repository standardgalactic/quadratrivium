00:00.000 --> 00:07.340
Why did we learn Python Uni? Because we had to become a senior machine learning engineer before we had the time to learn programming

00:07.960 --> 00:17.280
Before we start make sure, you know, we're talking about Python 3 not Python 2 actually a bit of Python 2.7 is also okay geared towards children and

00:18.440 --> 00:21.480
PhDs children and PhDs Python

00:21.480 --> 00:27.400
I know Python which means I know machine learning AI data science computer vision big data

00:27.440 --> 00:32.640
Cara hands of flow like it learn high toward open CV deep learning NLP

00:33.360 --> 00:40.920
Huge community of kids now. I didn't learn Python in an online course. Actually never really learned it lists

00:40.920 --> 00:45.280
Are arrays tuples are arrays sets have no order dicts are arrays

00:45.720 --> 00:52.600
Comprehensions are arrays numpy arrays are arrays. No more semi-colon errors only white space errors. Where is that error?

00:53.040 --> 00:58.160
Enumerate enumerate zip OS walk tuple unpacking. It's not dynamically typed

00:58.160 --> 01:02.160
It's strongly dynamically typed in Python. We don't do constants

01:02.160 --> 01:09.000
We only do change who put the main function at the bottom of the file equality is not identity is not

01:09.600 --> 01:12.120
Identity I can do in Python in five lines

01:12.120 --> 01:19.240
Which you can do in C in 50 and it will take 10 times the time to execute. Oh, I didn't I didn't say that wrong, right?

01:19.240 --> 01:25.160
Oh, yeah, who needs brackets anyway all these people with their illogical syntax sugar might need brackets

01:25.160 --> 01:30.560
You can return multiple values multiple values multiple values. Are you to me?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.360
No, I learned all of this on medium

01:33.360 --> 01:38.600
How many libraries does it take until I can actually put Python as my status on LinkedIn like three

01:38.800 --> 01:44.320
Numpy met plot lip and us pandas pandas pandas or maybe two, you know, because we start counting from zero

01:44.440 --> 01:51.120
STR minus one double colon zero minus one, huh? It's that's smart engineering

01:51.800 --> 01:54.720
Fast and that's engineer. That's smart

01:54.720 --> 02:00.800
All the compile languages are worse because you get errors before you can even run them. It's like man

02:00.800 --> 02:04.720
It's really, you know holding you back from innovation science

02:05.480 --> 02:09.960
Automation progress not very child friendly if you ask me and I'm not a child

02:09.960 --> 02:15.360
So I'm a PhD. Oh the shirt goes into the jeans in C++. Everything takes so long

02:15.360 --> 02:22.640
You have to write into main declare variables. It's literally just the execution. That's fast. Who cares. It's about the

02:23.280 --> 02:30.360
Scientific revolutionary data science machine learning NLP big data that you're going to do with yourself

02:30.360 --> 02:38.480
Or you can automate your coffee machine, which does the coffee that helps you make the scientific advances in Lua ideas to code

02:38.480 --> 02:44.640
Why can't I just run this in latex latex? Oh, this is a Python interview. All right, Python

02:44.640 --> 02:51.720
Why am I so good at this? I've never written code before to pull open bracket. Oh, this is machine learning

02:51.720 --> 02:56.160
Oh, this is data science a big data NLP computer vision

02:57.280 --> 03:03.560
AI you know what that is. I can give you a quick tutorial. I just learned that are you to me on medium just an hour ago

03:03.560 --> 03:09.120
That's a machine learning generative adversarial networks. Have you heard of them me neither? Let's check it out

03:09.120 --> 03:14.280
Oh, it's really easy to find the documentation is just one page almost there almost there

03:15.080 --> 03:17.080
Where's the async with?

03:21.280 --> 03:24.320
All right, oh you want to learn Python we can do it just right now

03:24.320 --> 03:30.880
You don't really need to learn anything or you need to learn at least three libraries Panas map plot lip and numpy

03:31.280 --> 03:37.840
Fundamental well the good thing in Python is single and double quotes are not differentiated because you don't need to cite properly

03:37.840 --> 03:44.640
It's not latex. Sadly. Are you convinced? Should we do a tutorial? I mean, should we read a medium write a medium block?

03:44.720 --> 03:49.360
Let me show you a graph real quick. Let me introduce you to a graph real quick

03:49.360 --> 03:56.680
this represents the amount of memory used by C for my program and this represents the

03:56.680 --> 04:01.560
Amount of memory Python uses my screen is not big enough
