0	19800	Stay tuned for the full show!
30000	51600	Hey guys welcome back to Everly's Build a House. So in our last video we had just finished pouring
51600	57760	the walls of our basement and so we'll go over kind of what the guys did next to get ready for
58320	63360	building the floor in our house. So if you remember in our last video there were some
63360	68560	deck ledgers that were just temporarily held on the back of the house just with screws and they
68560	76320	were just screwed into the ICF webbing. Aaron and his dad had then drilled and wet set some bolts so
76320	81680	that later after the concrete had cured they could go back and tighten those. So they did that and
81680	86160	then on the inside of the house if you remember there were all those cutouts in the styrofoam
86160	91120	and then they were covered with plywood. That was so that all the concrete would infill into
91120	98000	those holes and so then Curtis and Aaron stripped off all the plywood and you could see all the
98000	104000	exposed concrete. Then they went ahead and temporarily held up the floor ledgers just with
104000	108800	screws again into the ICF webbing and then they had to take a hammer drill and drill into all
108800	114640	those concrete squares and then set in all of the bolts and tighten them so that the floor
114640	118640	ledgers could be hung. So that was the next step. Check it out.
205200	213280	I showed you these before we poured the concrete. These are those bolts that we had
216080	219760	sitting in the board ready to go for when the concrete is poured and they were wet set in
219760	224960	there so a little later on we're going to go and crank on all these nuts and tighten that up
225760	228240	and that'll suck that to the wall and that's going to hold up our deck.
229200	235680	Yeah so here's all those nuts will get tightened up and that's actually what's what's the strong
235680	240560	part. We screwed those all into the webbing but that's not strong it's just there to hold it until
240560	246240	the concrete and the bolts do. We're doing the same thing inside here we're just Dad and I we're
246240	251840	just screwing this up to the webbing and tomorrow when I get the right tools that I need like a
251840	258560	right hammer drill bit and I'll go and I'll drill those and we'll get those installed and that will
258560	263520	be right now it's just sitting up there with a couple of deck screws so it's not strong if you
263520	268560	put any weight on there it would just pull right off so we'll bolt it in tomorrow and that'll keep
268560	276960	it strong. So we poured our wall this week and here's what those cutouts look like filled up with
276960	290400	concrete. Here we've got our braces and stuff here's those dowels full of concrete too so that's
290400	302320	what'll hold our floor our basement floor and this here will look like that eventually
302880	312400	but we need to bolt through this into those concrete cutouts and that's what'll hold us
312400	320560	into the floor up. Now the other thing here is these beam pockets that we put in there
321360	324880	so the steel beam will sit right inside there right on top of the concrete wall
326000	331120	and that will hold like the whole middle of the floor up basically all the way from here
333040	333840	all the way over there
338640	342960	so we've got these dowels all the way to the inside to hold the floor up
343840	346800	we've got those cutouts up there to hold the upstairs floor
348080	349120	beam pockets here
353600	354400	that's how that works
392880	396880	so
411840	413440	our floor trusses have arrived
417440	422000	here's our big steel beam it's going to go into those beam pockets and then be held up by
422000	424560	three telebos
452000	454560	um
474160	476560	um
482000	489000	So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
512000	519000	I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
542000	549000	I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
572000	579000	So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
602000	609000	Cool, this is going to be our view.
632000	653000	Okay, here's the finished floor.
653000	662000	So, those ledgers bolted on there.
662000	665000	We've got the truss sitting on the ledgers.
665000	672000	The other end of the truss is on the steel beam, which are on the teleposts.
672000	680000	These two are, I believe they're 12,000 pound rated posts and this one is 21,000.
680000	684000	I think that's because of this hole, I'm not sure exactly how all the engineering works,
684000	690000	but there must be more load there because of this hole here or something.
690000	696000	We went with 20 inch web trusses and this lets you keep everything tucked up top there.
696000	700000	All of our ducts are going to be up in the webbing, coming off the top of the main duct,
700000	704000	which will be in the mechanical room on the other side of the beam there.
704000	711000	Then everything will come off the top and shoot up over top.
711000	716000	So over here we've got the ledgers, over here the ledger.
716000	723000	These trusses, they also, as well as supporting the floor this way, they also support the walls.
723000	727000	These walls can't fall in with these trusses built the way they are.
727000	731000	They would basically have to crush all of these trusses.
731000	736000	From that wall to this wall is held up by those trusses.
736000	741000	Now that doesn't provide the same strength this way though.
741000	750000	So for that, the engineer had a detail for us and we've got these braces, I guess they are.
750000	758000	So they, we had to cut out the ICF so that actually bears on the concrete, not on the foam.
758000	761000	Foam is obviously just going to squish.
761000	769000	And then you do some blocking and you've got a gusset there and we glued and screwed the heck out of everything.
769000	774000	And these are every, oh and there's also the boards up on the plywood there.
774000	780000	So between these braces and the plywood being, or the decking being glued and screwed on there,
780000	784000	that will provide that lateral support this way.
784000	792000	So the trusses do it north and south and the braces, oh and the strong backs here too.
792000	795000	Also tie these all together, I forgot to mention these guys.
795000	801000	There's certain locations we had to put in, they're called strong backs.
801000	804000	So this will tie all the trusses together.
804000	808000	So when you're walking upstairs, you know, it's not bouncing around or nothing, nothing moves.
808000	814000	It's six nails or screws per truss on every one of those strong backs.
814000	821000	So I'm glad I've got that pass load nailer because holy cow, that was a lot of nails.
821000	825000	And that is basically our completed floor.
825000	832000	Another thing I should maybe mention here, this hole is where the stairs are going to be.
833000	838000	So those trusses didn't come all the way to the beam here, obviously.
838000	845000	So we had to make our own beam, this is a 2 ply, 2 by 10, just with regular joist hangers.
845000	850000	Nailed the joist hangers to the trusses there and those trusses are doubled up to carry the load.
850000	854000	And there's actually, there's a bracket for those two.
854000	857000	See if I can get a shot of it up there, you see that little bracket.
857000	861000	It connects those trusses together so they can't pull apart.
861000	867000	And then this beam sits in between them and those trusses bear on that beam.
867000	871000	And this is, this will be the hole for our stairs.
871000	876000	It won't be quite this big, we have to build out it's a little bit right up here.
876000	881000	Not quite the fireplace, but kind of in the TV fireplace area there.
881000	884000	Everything went pretty well.
884000	887000	Learned a few things, it was kind of fun to do.
887000	890000	So that's how that works.
