Stay tuned for the full show!

00:30.000 --> 00:51.600
Hey guys welcome back to Everly's Build a House. So in our last video we had just finished pouring

00:51.600 --> 00:57.760
the walls of our basement and so we'll go over kind of what the guys did next to get ready for

00:58.320 --> 01:03.360
building the floor in our house. So if you remember in our last video there were some

01:03.360 --> 01:08.560
deck ledgers that were just temporarily held on the back of the house just with screws and they

01:08.560 --> 01:16.320
were just screwed into the ICF webbing. Aaron and his dad had then drilled and wet set some bolts so

01:16.320 --> 01:21.680
that later after the concrete had cured they could go back and tighten those. So they did that and

01:21.680 --> 01:26.160
then on the inside of the house if you remember there were all those cutouts in the styrofoam

01:26.160 --> 01:31.120
and then they were covered with plywood. That was so that all the concrete would infill into

01:31.120 --> 01:38.000
those holes and so then Curtis and Aaron stripped off all the plywood and you could see all the

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
exposed concrete. Then they went ahead and temporarily held up the floor ledgers just with

01:44.000 --> 01:48.800
screws again into the ICF webbing and then they had to take a hammer drill and drill into all

01:48.800 --> 01:54.640
those concrete squares and then set in all of the bolts and tighten them so that the floor

01:54.640 --> 01:58.640
ledgers could be hung. So that was the next step. Check it out.

03:25.200 --> 03:33.280
I showed you these before we poured the concrete. These are those bolts that we had

03:36.080 --> 03:39.760
sitting in the board ready to go for when the concrete is poured and they were wet set in

03:39.760 --> 03:44.960
there so a little later on we're going to go and crank on all these nuts and tighten that up

03:45.760 --> 03:48.240
and that'll suck that to the wall and that's going to hold up our deck.

03:49.200 --> 03:55.680
Yeah so here's all those nuts will get tightened up and that's actually what's what's the strong

03:55.680 --> 04:00.560
part. We screwed those all into the webbing but that's not strong it's just there to hold it until

04:00.560 --> 04:06.240
the concrete and the bolts do. We're doing the same thing inside here we're just Dad and I we're

04:06.240 --> 04:11.840
just screwing this up to the webbing and tomorrow when I get the right tools that I need like a

04:11.840 --> 04:18.560
right hammer drill bit and I'll go and I'll drill those and we'll get those installed and that will

04:18.560 --> 04:23.520
be right now it's just sitting up there with a couple of deck screws so it's not strong if you

04:23.520 --> 04:28.560
put any weight on there it would just pull right off so we'll bolt it in tomorrow and that'll keep

04:28.560 --> 04:36.960
it strong. So we poured our wall this week and here's what those cutouts look like filled up with

04:36.960 --> 04:50.400
concrete. Here we've got our braces and stuff here's those dowels full of concrete too so that's

04:50.400 --> 05:02.320
what'll hold our floor our basement floor and this here will look like that eventually

05:02.880 --> 05:12.400
but we need to bolt through this into those concrete cutouts and that's what'll hold us

05:12.400 --> 05:20.560
into the floor up. Now the other thing here is these beam pockets that we put in there

05:21.360 --> 05:24.880
so the steel beam will sit right inside there right on top of the concrete wall

05:26.000 --> 05:31.120
and that will hold like the whole middle of the floor up basically all the way from here

05:33.040 --> 05:33.840
all the way over there

05:38.640 --> 05:42.960
so we've got these dowels all the way to the inside to hold the floor up

05:43.840 --> 05:46.800
we've got those cutouts up there to hold the upstairs floor

05:48.080 --> 05:49.120
beam pockets here

05:53.600 --> 05:54.400
that's how that works

06:32.880 --> 06:36.880
so

06:51.840 --> 06:53.440
our floor trusses have arrived

06:57.440 --> 07:02.000
here's our big steel beam it's going to go into those beam pockets and then be held up by

07:02.000 --> 07:04.560
three telebos

07:32.000 --> 07:34.560
um

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
um

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
Cool, this is going to be our view.

10:32.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay, here's the finished floor.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
So, those ledgers bolted on there.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
We've got the truss sitting on the ledgers.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
The other end of the truss is on the steel beam, which are on the teleposts.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
These two are, I believe they're 12,000 pound rated posts and this one is 21,000.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
I think that's because of this hole, I'm not sure exactly how all the engineering works,

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
but there must be more load there because of this hole here or something.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
We went with 20 inch web trusses and this lets you keep everything tucked up top there.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
All of our ducts are going to be up in the webbing, coming off the top of the main duct,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
which will be in the mechanical room on the other side of the beam there.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
Then everything will come off the top and shoot up over top.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
So over here we've got the ledgers, over here the ledger.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
These trusses, they also, as well as supporting the floor this way, they also support the walls.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
These walls can't fall in with these trusses built the way they are.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
They would basically have to crush all of these trusses.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
From that wall to this wall is held up by those trusses.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Now that doesn't provide the same strength this way though.

12:21.000 --> 12:30.000
So for that, the engineer had a detail for us and we've got these braces, I guess they are.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
So they, we had to cut out the ICF so that actually bears on the concrete, not on the foam.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Foam is obviously just going to squish.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
And then you do some blocking and you've got a gusset there and we glued and screwed the heck out of everything.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
And these are every, oh and there's also the boards up on the plywood there.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
So between these braces and the plywood being, or the decking being glued and screwed on there,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
that will provide that lateral support this way.

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
So the trusses do it north and south and the braces, oh and the strong backs here too.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Also tie these all together, I forgot to mention these guys.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
There's certain locations we had to put in, they're called strong backs.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
So this will tie all the trusses together.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
So when you're walking upstairs, you know, it's not bouncing around or nothing, nothing moves.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
It's six nails or screws per truss on every one of those strong backs.

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
So I'm glad I've got that pass load nailer because holy cow, that was a lot of nails.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
And that is basically our completed floor.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
Another thing I should maybe mention here, this hole is where the stairs are going to be.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
So those trusses didn't come all the way to the beam here, obviously.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
So we had to make our own beam, this is a 2 ply, 2 by 10, just with regular joist hangers.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Nailed the joist hangers to the trusses there and those trusses are doubled up to carry the load.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
And there's actually, there's a bracket for those two.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
See if I can get a shot of it up there, you see that little bracket.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
It connects those trusses together so they can't pull apart.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
And then this beam sits in between them and those trusses bear on that beam.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
And this is, this will be the hole for our stairs.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
It won't be quite this big, we have to build out it's a little bit right up here.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
Not quite the fireplace, but kind of in the TV fireplace area there.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Everything went pretty well.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Learned a few things, it was kind of fun to do.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
So that's how that works.
