Stay tuned for the full show!

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Hey guys welcome back to Everly's Build a House. So in our last video we had just finished pouring

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,760
the walls of our basement and so we'll go over kind of what the guys did next to get ready for

4
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,360
building the floor in our house. So if you remember in our last video there were some

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,560
deck ledgers that were just temporarily held on the back of the house just with screws and they

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,320
were just screwed into the ICF webbing. Aaron and his dad had then drilled and wet set some bolts so

7
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,680
that later after the concrete had cured they could go back and tighten those. So they did that and

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,160
then on the inside of the house if you remember there were all those cutouts in the styrofoam

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,120
and then they were covered with plywood. That was so that all the concrete would infill into

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,000
those holes and so then Curtis and Aaron stripped off all the plywood and you could see all the

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
exposed concrete. Then they went ahead and temporarily held up the floor ledgers just with

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,800
screws again into the ICF webbing and then they had to take a hammer drill and drill into all

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,640
those concrete squares and then set in all of the bolts and tighten them so that the floor

14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
ledgers could be hung. So that was the next step. Check it out.

15
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,280
I showed you these before we poured the concrete. These are those bolts that we had

16
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
sitting in the board ready to go for when the concrete is poured and they were wet set in

17
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,960
there so a little later on we're going to go and crank on all these nuts and tighten that up

18
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,240
and that'll suck that to the wall and that's going to hold up our deck.

19
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Yeah so here's all those nuts will get tightened up and that's actually what's what's the strong

20
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,560
part. We screwed those all into the webbing but that's not strong it's just there to hold it until

21
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,240
the concrete and the bolts do. We're doing the same thing inside here we're just Dad and I we're

22
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,840
just screwing this up to the webbing and tomorrow when I get the right tools that I need like a

23
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,560
right hammer drill bit and I'll go and I'll drill those and we'll get those installed and that will

24
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
be right now it's just sitting up there with a couple of deck screws so it's not strong if you

25
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,560
put any weight on there it would just pull right off so we'll bolt it in tomorrow and that'll keep

26
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,960
it strong. So we poured our wall this week and here's what those cutouts look like filled up with

27
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:50,400
concrete. Here we've got our braces and stuff here's those dowels full of concrete too so that's

28
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:02,320
what'll hold our floor our basement floor and this here will look like that eventually

29
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:12,400
but we need to bolt through this into those concrete cutouts and that's what'll hold us

30
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,560
into the floor up. Now the other thing here is these beam pockets that we put in there

31
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
so the steel beam will sit right inside there right on top of the concrete wall

32
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
and that will hold like the whole middle of the floor up basically all the way from here

33
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,840
all the way over there

34
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,960
so we've got these dowels all the way to the inside to hold the floor up

35
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
we've got those cutouts up there to hold the upstairs floor

36
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,120
beam pockets here

37
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
that's how that works

38
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
so

39
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
our floor trusses have arrived

40
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
here's our big steel beam it's going to go into those beam pockets and then be held up by

41
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
three telebos

42
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
um

43
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
um

44
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

45
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

46
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

47
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So, that's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.

48
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Cool, this is going to be our view.

49
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, here's the finished floor.

50
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, those ledgers bolted on there.

51
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We've got the truss sitting on the ledgers.

52
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The other end of the truss is on the steel beam, which are on the teleposts.

53
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
These two are, I believe they're 12,000 pound rated posts and this one is 21,000.

54
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think that's because of this hole, I'm not sure exactly how all the engineering works,

55
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but there must be more load there because of this hole here or something.

56
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We went with 20 inch web trusses and this lets you keep everything tucked up top there.

57
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
All of our ducts are going to be up in the webbing, coming off the top of the main duct,

58
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
which will be in the mechanical room on the other side of the beam there.

59
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then everything will come off the top and shoot up over top.

60
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So over here we've got the ledgers, over here the ledger.

61
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
These trusses, they also, as well as supporting the floor this way, they also support the walls.

62
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
These walls can't fall in with these trusses built the way they are.

63
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They would basically have to crush all of these trusses.

64
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
From that wall to this wall is held up by those trusses.

65
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now that doesn't provide the same strength this way though.

66
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So for that, the engineer had a detail for us and we've got these braces, I guess they are.

67
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So they, we had to cut out the ICF so that actually bears on the concrete, not on the foam.

68
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Foam is obviously just going to squish.

69
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then you do some blocking and you've got a gusset there and we glued and screwed the heck out of everything.

70
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And these are every, oh and there's also the boards up on the plywood there.

71
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So between these braces and the plywood being, or the decking being glued and screwed on there,

72
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that will provide that lateral support this way.

73
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So the trusses do it north and south and the braces, oh and the strong backs here too.

74
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Also tie these all together, I forgot to mention these guys.

75
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's certain locations we had to put in, they're called strong backs.

76
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So this will tie all the trusses together.

77
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So when you're walking upstairs, you know, it's not bouncing around or nothing, nothing moves.

78
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's six nails or screws per truss on every one of those strong backs.

79
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I'm glad I've got that pass load nailer because holy cow, that was a lot of nails.

80
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And that is basically our completed floor.

81
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Another thing I should maybe mention here, this hole is where the stairs are going to be.

82
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So those trusses didn't come all the way to the beam here, obviously.

83
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So we had to make our own beam, this is a 2 ply, 2 by 10, just with regular joist hangers.

84
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Nailed the joist hangers to the trusses there and those trusses are doubled up to carry the load.

85
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And there's actually, there's a bracket for those two.

86
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
See if I can get a shot of it up there, you see that little bracket.

87
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It connects those trusses together so they can't pull apart.

88
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then this beam sits in between them and those trusses bear on that beam.

89
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And this is, this will be the hole for our stairs.

90
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It won't be quite this big, we have to build out it's a little bit right up here.

91
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Not quite the fireplace, but kind of in the TV fireplace area there.

92
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Everything went pretty well.

93
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Learned a few things, it was kind of fun to do.

94
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So that's how that works.
