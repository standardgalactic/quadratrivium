0	1000	Are we good?
1000	3000	One, two, three.
3000	4000	Welcome to the show.
4000	5000	Giannis.
5000	6000	Thank you, Tom.
6000	7000	Very good to be here.
7000	8000	Let's start there, shall we?
8000	11000	What is your wildest prediction for the future?
11000	14000	It's not a prediction, it is a diagnosis.
14000	23000	My name is Tom Goodwin and this is my wildest prediction.
23000	33000	His name is shot to fame in 2015 when he was anointed minister of finance in Greece at the height of the European debt crisis.
33000	41000	This is Giannis Varoufakis, an author, academic, perhaps activist, a politician,
41000	47000	and we're here to discuss the future of capitalism and how technology is changing the world.
47000	53000	I want to talk about his latest book, techno feudalism, the end of capitalism.
53000	56000	This book is not about what will happen in the future.
56000	63000	It is a highly controversial notion of what has already gone down.
63000	74000	I'm not writing about what AI would do to the labour market, what will happen to us with big brother and surveillance and any of that.
75000	85000	It is my estimation, and this is a controversial hypothesis, that capitalism has already entered, which is very strange.
85000	86000	Yes.
86000	89000	I don't remember this feeling like something that happened.
89000	92000	Tom, the way I see it is this.
92000	99000	Suppose this was 1776 and we were in London and we were having a discussion about the state of the world.
99000	103000	Now, everywhere we looked in 1776, we would see feudalism.
103000	112000	We would see feudalism in the House of Lords, in the House of Commons, in government, in every local council, around the world, on the land.
112000	116000	We would see peasants, we would see aristocrats.
116000	119000	And yet, we do know that, don't we?
119000	128000	Already, feudalism had died and was being gradually but fast being replaced by something called capitalism.
128000	138000	The magnificent shift of power from the owners of land to the owners of machinery, of steamships, of electrical grids later on.
138000	144000	And the shift of wealth creation from rent accumulation to profit making.
144000	148000	My view is that we are already experiencing a similar transformation.
148000	151000	Wherever we look, we see capital.
151000	152000	We see markets.
152000	155000	We see capitalists doing extremely well.
155000	165000	And yet, I think that already we have undergone a transformation to something like feudalism, but a very technologically advanced version of it.
165000	168000	Markets have been replaced by platforms.
168000	171000	So Amazon.com is not a market.
171000	182000	It looks like a market, but it's more like a digital fiefdom, a cloud fiefdom, belonging to one man whose accumulation of wealth is based not on profit,
182000	184000	but on a form of rent.
184000	190000	Every time you buy something on Amazon, 30-40% of the price goes to Mr Bezos, not to the maker.
190000	195000	And how are you defining assets in this world of technofedalism?
195000	197000	What is it that they are owning?
197000	198000	What is it that they are renting?
198000	201000	Is it our data, our attention, our relationship?
201000	204000	No, all that is part of the story, but it's not the story.
204000	210000	The story is that a new form of capital began to emerge about 10 years ago.
210000	214000	Capital was always a produced means of production.
214000	223000	So whether you have Robinson Cruser's fishing rod, a steam engine, or an industrial, a very advanced industrial robot today.
223000	227000	It's a produced means of production, something we produced in order to produce other stuff.
227000	234000	But this new mutation of capital, which I call cloud capital, it's what lives in your phone.
234000	238000	And by cloud you mean it's sort of a ethereal asset?
238000	239000	No, I'm talking about cloud capital.
239000	245000	So take Alexa or Siri or Google Assistant.
245000	251000	That sits there either on your phone or on your desk and you order it to do things.
251000	255000	Well, yes, but that's only a tiny part of the story.
255000	265000	What it is, it's an interface between you and the whole agglomeration of capital goods, including optic fiber cables that are laid on the ocean floors.
265000	275000	Huge, gigantic server farms that hum like a factory, like a dark satanic mill to quote Edmund Burke, sell towers.
275000	279000	This is capital, it doesn't live in the cloud, but it's what we call the cloud.
279000	282000	When you upload stuff, you know, photographs on the cloud, right?
282000	285000	Or you save stuff on the cloud.
285000	292000	So you interface with this thing, which is a kind of capital, but it's not exactly produced means of production.
292000	296000	What does Amazon Alexa, what does it do?
296000	301000	You are training it essentially through your commands.
301000	303000	It's just speaking in the house.
303000	307000	It gets from you data, but data on what?
307000	309000	On you, on your preferences.
309000	315000	So you are training it to learn how to give you good recommendations.
315000	320000	So I don't know about you, but when Amazon recommends a book, I always want to read it because it knows me.
320000	328000	When Spotify gives me a recommendation for music, invariably I like it, invariably, because it understands me really very well.
328000	338000	So I'm training it to train me, to train it, to train me, to train it, to train me, so that at some point it can actually make a recommendation and then I can say, OK, I want that.
338000	349000	And the fundamental thing, Tom, here is that this is not like standard advertising, where you see a poster, you buy Mercedes Benz, then you go to Mercedes Benz dealership
349000	358000	and you get one. No. Alexa convinces you to buy something, exercise bike, whatever, a pair of binoculars.
358000	364000	And then sells it to you, bypassing every marketplace in the world.
364000	367000	Now that is a fiefdom, that is a market.
367000	382000	And you see, and most income now that is accumulated is accumulating the form of rents that basis charges capitalists for access to this digital fiefdom.
382000	388000	So we're going back to a system where access to the land, only this time it is digital land.
388000	403000	It's what I call cloud capital, is restricted, crucial, outside the marketplace, outside capitalism, and procure a magnificent rent for the new cloud lords.
403000	404000	That's a new system.
404000	407000	And how are you defining these new cloud lords?
407000	410000	Is it a question of the service space that they own?
410000	412000	Is it how many customers they have?
412000	415000	At what point does Walmart become Amazon?
415000	417000	At what point does a taxi company become Amazon?
417000	420000	Walmart has already become, Walmart is already a cloud fief.
420000	427000	Because Walmart, very smartly, has developed its own competitor to Amazon.
427000	433000	It is using its stores in order to build up its cloud fief.
433000	445000	And now increasingly the profits, the net returns of Walmart come from the cloud, not from the analog buildings that it still has,
445000	449000	which it uses in order to lure people effectively into the cloud.
449000	452000	And you talk about this in a very sort of sinister way, almost.
452000	454000	I mean, your book is quite gloomy.
454000	460000	You know, some people would look at this and they would say they have decided to enter in with the relationship with Amazon.
460000	463000	They have decided to upload their pictures to Instagram.
463000	466000	They have decided to use WhatsApp as a way to...
466000	468000	I don't think my book is at all gloomy.
468000	472000	I try to write my book, you know, in a very jovial way.
472000	474000	You could argue that people have...
474000	476000	By the way, as a letter to my dad.
476000	477000	Yes, yes.
477000	479000	So I constantly have a little tiff with my dad.
479000	484000	Because I try to imagine what he would have said to me and I try to answer to what I imagine he would have said to me.
484000	486000	I think my book is a very pleasant read.
486000	491000	It didn't feel that way to me, but I mean, I'm very optimistic about the future and what technology means.
491000	493000	And I think there's something interesting...
493000	498000	But that takes an incredible degree of naivety to be optimistic about the future.
498000	499000	Doesn't it?
499000	502000	There's no empirical evidence to support that anything good will happen.
502000	504000	But where I agree with you...
504000	506000	We have a lot of evidence that things have got better every year.
506000	508000	Oh, no, no, no, no, we don't.
508000	512000	Everything is getting far, far worse for the majority of the people on this earth, including climate catastrophe.
512000	513000	Come on, Tom.
513000	515000	But I'll tell you, I'll give you this.
515000	519000	I'll give you this and let's see if we can converge.
519000	521000	I'm hopeful.
521000	523000	I'm not optimistic.
523000	530000	I make it a very great distinction between optimism, which is the poor cousin of hope and hope.
530000	532000	Hope we need to have.
532000	534000	I love those technologies.
534000	536000	Don't get me wrong.
536000	537000	I'm not a Luddite.
537000	539000	I mind you, Luddites are very misunderstood.
539000	542000	They didn't, like, completely misunderstood.
542000	545000	I love the Luddites, but you know what I mean.
545000	547000	I'm not against machinery.
547000	552000	I am absolutely enthusiastic, completely addicted to all those apps.
552000	558000	For instance, I think the world of AI, I think AI may very well destroy us, but I love it.
558000	565000	I absolutely adore the idea that there is AI today designing antibiotics that can kill superbugs
565000	569000	that human minds cannot design and antibiotic against.
569000	570000	That's brilliant.
570000	573000	That's a triumph of the human spirit.
573000	584000	But not to see that we have exponential concentrations of incomes
584000	592000	in the hands of people who produce nothing except for the right and the opportunity to extract incomes from others
592000	597000	while the world is going to the rocks in terms of the climate catastrophe.
597000	600000	That we need to recognize if we are going to remain hopeful.
600000	609000	I mean, you are a big study of history and you, in your books, talk a lot about technology,
609000	615000	especially when it comes to capital, and you would look at most forms of technology
615000	618000	and see them as levers to human potential.
618000	625000	The loom obviously had big threatening impacts on the Luddites, hence their fight for fairness.
625000	630000	But generally speaking, technology is a lever to allow us to create more wealth.
630000	638000	Its distribution has not always been fair, but over a long period of time, the trend lines are fairly consistent.
638000	643000	And especially since about 1910, global inequality has remained about the same.
643000	645000	Since 1910.
645000	648000	Since around about 1910, 1930 on a global scale.
648000	649000	They remain the same.
649000	650000	That is not true.
650000	651000	That is not true.
651000	652000	Broadly similar.
652000	655000	It depends on whether you look at the top 0.1%.
655000	656000	It depends on what you measure.
656000	657000	I'm sorry.
657000	663000	But my question is, I'm afflicted by an economic mind that refuses to see things.
663000	666000	It's the 2022 World Inequality Report.
666000	667000	It's roasted glasses.
667000	670000	It's the 2022 World Inequality Report.
670000	672000	And it's looked at things globally.
672000	674000	And obviously no one lives in a global world.
674000	676000	We all live in our own reality.
676000	681000	To some extent, we have to wonder if it's about relative income or whether it's about absolute income.
681000	687000	But at what point in the last few years, do you think we switched over to sort of techno feudalism?
687000	691000	Is there a defining moment where you think we sort of reached this tipping point?
691000	694000	Well, it's between 2008 and today.
694000	699000	It's impossible to, it's like saying, you know, when did you become bald?
699000	705000	Which hair did you lose so that you switched from being a person with hair to a bald person?
705000	708000	There's no such hair that defines your transition.
708000	711000	But I can tell you that it was around the night when I was in my forties.
711000	714000	Similarly, the switch happened after 2008.
714000	717000	And it happened because of 2008 to a very large extent.
717000	724000	Because the way in which the G7 government and central banks responded to the great financial catastrophe
724000	731000	by a combination of socialism for the bankers, you know, trillions pumped out of our central banks
731000	735000	to go to the financial sector with huge austerity for everybody else.
735000	740000	That starved, so you know, you create lots of money.
740000	747000	You have liquidity that we never had in the history of the world, which never went into investment
747000	749000	because of low levels of demand.
749000	755000	So the companies that got this money from the central banks bought back their own shares that created asset price inflation.
755000	762000	The only ones who invested were the cloud elists, the people who owned cloud capital, you know, the techno feudal lords.
762000	765000	And, you know, wonderful machinery and all that.
765000	773000	But that investment went into creating the cloud capital, which then replaced markets with platforms
773000	782000	and shifted a very significant percentage of the circular flow of income from profits to rents.
782000	785000	And that is destabilizing for the global system.
785000	791000	What do you think the relationship between the rise of these tech companies and zero interest rates almost has been?
791000	792000	It's what I said.
792000	793000	Yeah.
793000	800000	I mean, zero interest rates is what happens when you're trying to reflow the financial sector by printing huge amounts of money, right?
800000	804000	I mean, the price of money is related to its supply.
804000	813000	So when you boost supply, as if they do now tomorrow, then the price of money, which is related to interest, will go to zero and below zero, which is what happened.
813000	814000	It's just interesting.
814000	822000	When you try and find the sort of defining feature of what a tech company is versus what a tech company isn't, you can look at many things like network effects.
822000	824000	You can look at the use of data.
824000	830000	But one sort of interesting element, I guess, is to look at capital return and the degree to which they need to make a profit.
830000	831000	That's all irrelevant.
831000	835000	That is just mumbo jumbo, just trying to sound as if you're financially intelligent.
835000	836000	I'm sorry.
836000	838000	I'm intelligent about technology.
838000	839000	Yeah, I'm sure.
839000	840000	I'm sure.
840000	845000	But from a socioeconomic point of view, what really matters is none of that.
845000	847000	I don't care how you define a tech company.
847000	852000	You can have a tech company that makes fantastic industrial robots.
852000	854000	That's not cloud capital.
854000	855000	It's beautiful.
855000	856000	I love it.
856000	859000	I see industrial robot assemble cars and microchips.
859000	860000	Beautiful.
860000	862000	It's like poetry in motion.
862000	863000	A little bit of a body.
863000	864000	Now, that's a tech company.
864000	865000	Yeah.
865000	866000	It's not what I'm talking about.
866000	877000	I'm talking about companies that are investing in the creation of my definition of cloud capital, which is a produced means of behavioral modification.
877000	880000	The difference between an industrial robot.
880000	883000	Fantastic, technologically snazzy and so on.
883000	894000	And Amazon, or for that matter, Facebook, is that the latter is not a produced means of production.
894000	898000	It is a produced means of behavioral modification.
898000	909000	So that cloud capital gives the owner an immense exorbitant power and privilege to alter people's behavior.
909000	924000	In order to create alternatives to markets in which we are all caught up as buyers and sellers, but not within a market in which you can choose a partner and choose.
924000	926000	The algorithms does the choice for us.
926000	931000	And the algorithm chooses in a manner that maximizes cloud rents of the owners of that cloud capital.
931000	946000	And you're sort of concerned that this becomes somewhat monopolistic because of the information they have on us making it hard to leave that ecosystem or because of their market share or because that's impossible for other people to enter the market.
946000	948000	Or this isn't a sort of monopoly concern.
948000	952000	Well, you see, I avoid the word monopoly.
952000	955000	And I avoid it because a monopoly is a market.
955000	957000	It's a monopolized market.
957000	965000	My point about Alibaba, so I was not to talk only about, you know, Amazon, is that it is not a market.
965000	968000	You see, and I tried to explain this in the book.
968000	980000	Imagine you and I are entering a town in the United States of America, you know, back in the 19th century, let's make it a bit, you know, of a western movie, right?
980000	985000	And we discovered that every shop in the town belongs to one man.
985000	987000	You've seen westerns like that, right?
987000	988000	And there's a showdown.
988000	991000	It would be more that one person owns the land.
991000	992000	No, no, no.
992000	1002000	Suppose that this person owns the bar, the saloon, the, you know, the shops, the hotel, everything, everything, the post office, the sheriff.
1002000	1003000	Okay.
1003000	1005000	You've seen these movies with John Wayne and so on.
1005000	1006000	Right.
1006000	1008000	Now that's a monopolized market.
1008000	1009000	A monopolized town.
1009000	1011000	You and I walked down the store.
1011000	1013000	We know it belongs to that one person who owns everything.
1013000	1016000	He has immense monopoly power over everyone in that town.
1016000	1020000	But in Alibaba, for example, 100% their revenues from third parties.
1020000	1022000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1022000	1024000	In Amazon, 45% of their revenues.
1024000	1026000	You're missing the point of my allegory here.
1026000	1028000	I have a western movie allegory.
1028000	1029000	Let's not lose it.
1029000	1030000	Okay.
1030000	1033000	The point I'm trying to make is this is a monopolized market, right?
1033000	1042000	But Alibaba and Amazon are not because in that town, in the western movie, you and I, Tom, we're walking down the street, right?
1042000	1044000	And we look at the shop window.
1044000	1046000	You and I see the same thing.
1046000	1048000	We may not buy it.
1048000	1053000	We may say, you know, let's not give our money to this terrible man who owns everything, right?
1053000	1054000	But we converse.
1054000	1055000	We see the same thing.
1055000	1064000	If you and I had our laptops here and we went to Alibaba or Amazon and we typed extravagant binoculars.
1064000	1067000	You see different things to what I'm going to see.
1067000	1073000	The algorithm knows you, knows me and calibrates what we see and it does not select the same thing.
1073000	1075000	So we don't even see the same things.
1075000	1076000	That's not a marketplace.
1076000	1077000	It's not a monopolized market.
1077000	1079000	It is not a market.
1079000	1095000	It is an algorithm like a Soviet economic system which decides who does what with whom, without any consultation, without any way that you and I can communicate as buyers or you as a seller and me as a buyer.
1095000	1100000	No way that we can communicate unless the algorithm chooses for us to communicate.
1100000	1103000	I mean, some people would call that personalization.
1103000	1104000	That's all rubbish.
1104000	1106000	It is not a market.
1106000	1107000	You can call it whatever.
1107000	1109000	You can call it Snoopy Do.
1109000	1111000	It is not the point I'm making.
1111000	1113000	It's not the market, right?
1113000	1122000	And it is an algorithm which matches the people who are selling with the people who are buying in the interest, not of the seller even.
1122000	1124000	That could be monopoly.
1124000	1130000	But of the rentier or the landlord of that cloud capital.
1130000	1132000	That's the point I'm making.
1132000	1134000	What do you think is the solution to all this?
1134000	1136000	How are things going to progress from here?
1136000	1139000	Can technology be the fix as well as the problem?
1139000	1141000	Technology has never been the fix.
1141000	1145000	To the problems we create with the technology, the problem is political.
1145000	1146000	It's social.
1146000	1156000	So, you know, steam engines were not responsible for the awful conditions of the working class in Manchester when the first dark satanic meals were put together, right?
1156000	1158000	And the solution was not technology.
1158000	1164000	The solution was, you know, social, political interventions.
1164000	1166000	That will always be the case.
1166000	1170000	So, I don't blame the technology and therefore I do not expect the technology to solve the problem.
1170000	1172000	The question is who owns what?
1172000	1178000	You see, some people are very worried about surveillance.
1178000	1181000	That, you know, these companies know so much about us.
1181000	1183000	I'm not that bothered personally.
1183000	1185000	I mean, I understand why people are worried.
1185000	1192000	I'm slightly worried, but I'm far more worried by what they own.
1192000	1207000	They own this capital, which is a capacity to separate us, to fragment us as markets, as communities, as societies, to influence us in ways we don't understand.
1207000	1210000	In ways that the people who wrote the algorithms do not understand.
1210000	1213000	This is even more worrying, right?
1213000	1216000	You hear that from coders, from AI and so on.
1216000	1218000	It becomes ever more true, like AI is a good example.
1218000	1219000	People are surprised.
1219000	1226000	So, for me, as an old lefty, the answer must always be the socialization of the means of production.
1226000	1232000	In some ways, technology has been a force to kind of democratize access to wealth creation.
1232000	1233000	So, now it's...
1233000	1235000	You live in a different universe, right?
1235000	1237000	There are plenty of...
1237000	1238000	Democratization.
1238000	1239000	What democratization?
1239000	1240000	We have exactly the opposite.
1240000	1248000	We live in a world where three companies, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, own 90% of all the companies in the New York Stock Exchange.
1248000	1249000	We're talking about democratization.
1249000	1250000	They don't own 90%.
1250000	1255000	They all have a majority shareholding together in 90%.
1255000	1257000	Again, nitpicking.
1257000	1259000	This is...
1259000	1263000	Adam Smith is the patron saint of the factory market.
1263000	1270000	He would be a gust hearing you talk about the democratization of capitalism.
1270000	1274000	For him, what we now have would be a nightmare.
1274000	1281000	But you could argue that a platform like Shopify makes it easy for people without many means to set up a store.
1281000	1288000	You could argue that YouTube gives an opportunity for anyone in the world to make a world-class documentary and they can make money from advertising.
1288000	1297000	You could argue that Facebook has democratized access to advertising tools that allow people to buy media at the same rate as bigger companies.
1297000	1300000	I got my line with almost all of your thinking.
1300000	1308000	I just think it's a little bit unfair to look at some of the dynamics that provide access to people in a more level way.
1308000	1320000	And to some extent, the data that allows a marketplace to personalize what they offer actually works in favor in some cases of smaller companies that use these...
1320000	1322000	That last sentence is absurd.
1322000	1324000	Everything else you said before was fine.
1324000	1326000	The conclusion was absolutely absurd.
1326000	1328000	You will allow me to say, right?
1328000	1338000	Now, listen, there is no doubt that Amazon gives every day fantastic opportunities to producers to reach customers.
1338000	1340000	There's no doubt about that.
1340000	1342000	Shopify does the same thing.
1342000	1350000	Not this is ancient, but all the paraphernalia of podcasting and so on allows all of us to be broadcasters.
1350000	1353000	That is all perfectly true.
1353000	1355000	And it's great.
1355000	1365000	However, the point I'm making is that the techno feudal forces at work, which are based on the money in which cloud capital operates,
1365000	1376000	are ensuring that all those people who create businesses and sell stuff through Amazon or Shopify and so on in the end become vassals.
1376000	1382000	Because landlords under feudalism did allow people to actually do things.
1382000	1384000	They gave them land, they gave them the opportunity to produce stuff.
1384000	1388000	They were called vassals in the sense that they were complete, dependent on the landlord,
1388000	1395000	who actually grabbed rent out of them until he squeezed the living wits out of them.
1395000	1397000	This is precisely what we're having.
1397000	1403000	We're having machinery and cloud capital that allows us to do a lot of stuff, right?
1403000	1405000	Podcasts and so on.
1405000	1412000	That said, if you look at the concentration of the capacity to influence public opinion,
1412000	1425000	we've never had less of a free press than we have today within the context of each one of us being able to be a small BBC or Euro news or whatever.
1425000	1431000	I guess when I hear a lot of what you say, the sentiment that you have is something that I agree with entirely.
1431000	1441000	I'm personally by no means a fan of Amazon or any of these tech giants and I hate the level of influence they have over our lives.
1441000	1444000	But I think of it more in terms of algorithmic persuasion.
1444000	1455000	I think of it more in terms of slightly sociopathic tendencies to monetize our attention in ways that leads us to be more angry with each other than we should be.
1455000	1463000	So I wonder sometimes if maybe the real brunt of your concern is not more about algorithms and the way that they're used.
1463000	1468000	I love algorithms. The question is who owns the bloody thing, right?
1468000	1475000	If one person owns the algorithm that controls billions of people, then we have something worse than 1984.
1475000	1478000	We're shifting towards Brave New World.
1478000	1480000	There's sort of opening up access to algorithms.
1480000	1483000	You see, 1984 was a problem of surveillance.
1483000	1489000	Brave New World is a problem where we are all happy little slaves who love slavery, right?
1489000	1494000	And that is a problem. If you are a liberal, if you believe in freedom, if you believe...
1494000	1498000	But also there's something else that really worries me.
1498000	1506000	You talked about algorithms that are primed to maximize rage and outrage and intolerance.
1506000	1513000	We all know that, right? You only need to go on ex-formerly Twitter to five minutes of that.
1513000	1517000	Who said that? I think it was Stephen Fry who said something brilliant.
1517000	1519000	He said this quite a long time ago before Musk.
1519000	1527000	It's a bit like taking everything which is written on the walls of mail toilets around the world and posting it online.
1527000	1530000	So yeah, I agree with you. But think of this.
1530000	1534000	If my macroeconomic analysis in the book is right,
1534000	1542000	we have a situation where, as David Ricardo in 1809 wonders,
1542000	1554000	if you have an economic system where increasing percentages of income are siphoned off the cycle of investment by renteers.
1554000	1559000	He was talking about the corn laws back then, due to the Napoleonic Wars.
1559000	1571000	The war in Europe then, the Napoleonic Wars, were a boon to landlords because they didn't have to compete with imported corn.
1571000	1578000	And therefore they managed to charge higher and higher rents on the producers of corn who used their land.
1578000	1585000	But because they just simply got rich in their sleep because it was rent, it was not capitalist profit.
1585000	1591000	It was as if this money, this economic energy was taken out of the circular flow.
1591000	1595000	There was less investment and the whole system was becoming degenerate.
1595000	1597000	So I'm telling a similar story.
1597000	1607000	If increasing quantities of economic energy are being siphoned off as rents by the owners of those cloud thieves, these platforms,
1607000	1613000	then that explains to a very large extent why we have inflation.
1613000	1616000	Central banks continue to print money.
1616000	1617000	Why?
1617000	1619000	Even though you have inflation?
1619000	1629000	Well, because aggregate demand is shrinking as a result of the fact that a lot of wealth is being siphoned off the circular flow of income in the form of cloud rents.
1629000	1638000	So you have inflation, you have bullshit jobs, as David Greber scientifically put it.
1638000	1646000	You have discontent building up with our central banks, with our governments, with markets, with inflation.
1646000	1653000	And then you have those algorithms that make a lot more money out of priming the outrage.
1653000	1659000	And then the more they prime the outrage, the more they extract money from the circular flow of income and the more outrage there is.
1659000	1661000	That spins out of control.
1661000	1663000	And what becomes the endpoint for this?
1663000	1665000	The end of civilization.
1665000	1666000	Okay.
1666000	1669000	This is not going to be good.
1669000	1672000	I don't think anything good is going to come out of it.
1672000	1679000	I'm not one of those left-wing revolutionists who think, like Lenin once said, that the worst things get the better it is.
1679000	1680000	I don't believe that.
1680000	1687000	I've seen, in this country, in Greece, I've seen the deterioration of living standards year after year after year.
1687000	1689000	And that only produces Nazis.
1689000	1690000	Nothing good.
1690000	1700000	And when you look towards a tool like AI, can you see that as being something to bring us out of that spiral?
1700000	1702000	No technology will bring us out.
1702000	1706000	I mean, in a good society, we will be using AI all the time.
1706000	1708000	All the time.
1708000	1713000	We no longer need, for instance, teachers training us to do things.
1713000	1715000	We need teachers to educate us.
1715000	1719000	But the training can be subcontracted to AI beautifully already.
1719000	1721000	So I love it.
1721000	1728000	But it will not solve the problem of the cloudelists, as I call them, exorbitant power of the rest of society.
1728000	1733000	If anything, it will make it worse because AI makes the algorithms faster and better.
1733000	1748000	How do you sort of reconcile in your mind these sort of cloud owners with forces for absolute evil versus companies that have elements to what they do, which is beneficial to society?
1748000	1754000	One could look at YouTube and see how that could educate people across the world who otherwise wouldn't have access to books.
1754000	1760000	Is it possible in your head to sort of reconcile what's a good use of server-based technology and what's bad?
1760000	1761000	Of course, absolutely.
1761000	1769000	There are a lot of fantastic and fully humanist uses of technology today.
1769000	1777000	The question is, where is humanity as a whole being led by the more powerful forces to work within it?
1777000	1779000	That is the question.
1779000	1791000	And we have to constantly be on the lookout for good uses of technology, which are all over us, for ideas of how society should be functioning, designed.
1791000	1794000	What its architecture should be.
1794000	1802000	How do you see these conversations progressing in the context of global climate change and move towards net zero?
1802000	1807000	Do you think of that as being again a sort of catalyst to bring the end closer?
1807000	1815000	Do you think of it as an environment which changes people's motivations away from consumption in a way that helps decelerate this change?
1815000	1816000	No, that's the opposite.
1816000	1828000	Because in the same way that the algorithms are primed to excite intolerance in our souls, they are primed to make us buy things that we neither need nor want,
1828000	1835000	and to forget about difficult things like the climate crisis.
1835000	1841000	Of course, these algorithms are essential in fighting the climate crisis.
1841000	1853000	So if we as a society, as a community, as a League of Nations or societies, if we could agree to stop drilling for oil and, you know,
1853000	1859000	force influence more generally, if we agree to end the wars, that would be very helpful.
1859000	1863000	War doesn't help the climate in the slightest.
1863000	1868000	Then we would design our new green energy grids.
1868000	1878000	And you can only design it if you have very strong use of fantastic algorithms that are necessary in order to ensure that the peak load is always used properly,
1878000	1886000	that, you know, wind, solar and other renewables are combined in the optimal manner.
1886000	1897000	So, like the beginning of time, our technologies are a force for good and for a force of evil.
1897000	1899000	And if evil prevails, it is our fault.
1899000	1904000	I think I want you to leave on some action that we can take.
1904000	1910000	You know, like, I love what you say makes me feel like we're at this sort of liminal point.
1910000	1911000	Okay, I will.
1911000	1915000	If things work out well or badly, what can we do to ensure that we get to a better place together?
1915000	1918000	Well, I think that we should concentrate on two things.
1918000	1924000	Firstly, we must end free services, because you don't need me to explain that.
1924000	1931000	When you have free services affected, if you've got the complete tyranny of the cloud capitalist or the cloudless,
1931000	1936000	it would be fantastic if we had subscript micropayments, a micropayment system.
1936000	1941000	And if some people can't afford it, they should get social security payments in order to make for these micropayments.
1941000	1943000	So you're creating an app, right?
1943000	1949000	You get paid directly by the person who is using the app, not indirectly through advertising,
1949000	1955000	because that way you do not have this complete takeover of our souls.
1955000	1957000	That's one thing.
1957000	1964000	The second thing is fantastic if we started thinking in terms of changing corporate law.
1964000	1966000	Imagine, just imagine.
1966000	1969000	I know it sounds like science fiction, but technically it's really very simple.
1969000	1981000	Imagine that you and I, if we were to form a company or 30 of us, 40 of us, we form a cooperative and we have one share each.
1981000	1992000	Imagine if every company, especially large companies, had a share structure whereby every employee had one share which could not be traded.
1992000	2000000	In the same way as a university student gets a library card or a student union card when they enroll,
2000000	2006000	and then they have to hand it over or it becomes invalid when they leave, when they graduate.
2006000	2011000	They cannot sell it, they cannot buy it, but they can use it to vote, they can use it to take books out,
2011000	2014000	they can use it to use the internet and so on.
2014000	2019000	Imagine if that's how shares were and they gave you one vote in the company and you worked.
2019000	2022000	It didn't mean equality because we could vote.
2022000	2030000	The person who actually creates the really good stuff which allows our company to do well, we should give more money to him or her.
2030000	2032000	Imagine that.
2032000	2035000	That would be a magnificent revolution.
2035000	2038000	It would end share markets and labour markets in one go.
2038000	2040000	And then you would have no state.
2040000	2047000	You had market-based cooperatives owning the algorithm but in a way that is not predatory.
2047000	2055000	And if they had to receive micropayments from those who actually use them, the algorithms,
2055000	2062000	then we would be talking about technology in the interest of a combination of freedom and justice.
2062000	2063000	Okay.
2063000	2069000	So something kind of rooted in philosophy almost as like a DAO or something sort of based on blockchain
2069000	2071000	or does the technology not matter?
2071000	2073000	The technology doesn't matter.
2073000	2076000	So what I described, you could do it with pieces of paper really.
2076000	2080000	It helps to have an algorithm.
2080000	2086000	Blockchain might be useful but the problem with blockchain is that it has become a religion.
2086000	2092000	And you have people who religiously hate it and people who religiously adopt it.
2092000	2095000	And I'm just not a religious person when it comes to these things.
2095000	2097000	I think horses for courses.
2097000	2099000	Blockchain can be very useful.
2099000	2101000	I mean, J.B. Morgan uses it internally.
2101000	2103000	If they use it internally, we should use it internally.
2103000	2107000	But we must not think that blockchain is the answer.
2107000	2108000	Blockchain is a tool.
2108000	2109000	That makes sense.
2109000	2118000	So when it does come to your wildest prediction, in some ways you're thinking that perhaps this could be the start of the downfall of civilization
2118000	2121000	or you're also open-minded to there being other ways.
2121000	2123000	I maintain hope.
2123000	2128000	Hope is my duty and I cling on to it against all empirical evidence.
2128000	2130000	That makes absolutely sense.
2130000	2132000	Janne is very flacky. Thanks very much.
2132000	2133000	Thank you, Tom.
2133000	2134000	Thank you.
2134000	2135000	Very good.
2135000	2137000	Have a good time.
2137000	2138000	That was good.
2138000	2139000	It was fun.
