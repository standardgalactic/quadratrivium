1. **Climate Change and Technology**: The current state of technology, including green energy grids, requires advanced algorithms to optimize the use of renewable resources like wind and solar power to mitigate climate change.

2. **Action Points**: To ensure that technology serves humanity for the better, Janne Korhanen suggests two actionable steps:
   - Implement a micropayment system for free services to avoid the tyranny of the cloud capitalist or the cloudless. This would involve users directly paying for the services they use, possibly with financial support for those who cannot afford it through social security payments.
   - Change corporate law to allow every employee to own one share in the company, which cannot be traded but can be used to vote. This would democratize companies and align incentives with productivity and innovation, potentially phasing out share markets and labor markets.

3. **Philosophy vs. Technology**: While Janne acknowledges that technology can facilitate these changes, he emphasizes that the specific technology (like blockchain) is not as important as the philosophy or concept behind it. Technology should be a tool to achieve the desired outcomes, rather than an end in itself.

4. **Hope and Empirical Evidence**: Janne maintains hope for the future, advocating for a balance of innovation, cooperation, and justice to overcome the challenges faced by civilization.

In essence, Janne Korhanen argues for a reformation of corporate structure and the adoption of micropayment systems to create a more equitable and sustainable digital economy.
