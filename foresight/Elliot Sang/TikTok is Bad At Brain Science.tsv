0	8280	At the age of 25, Phineas P. Gage was fairly accomplished in his profession.
8280	13960	A railroad foreman in 1848, he was in charge of leading construction gangs, blasting away
13960	19160	rock to make way for roads that would be pivotal for expanding US civilization less than a
19160	21680	century after its formation.
21680	27080	Physician John Martin Harlow knew him to be a most efficient and capable foreman, a shrewd,
27080	32920	smart businessman, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation.
32920	41000	He was tall, smart, and driven toward his goals, the very ideal of young American masculinity.
41000	46240	In those times, blasters used tamping irons which were basically like long, smooth crowbars
46240	51160	in order to tamp a hole which you drilled into a rock and filled with explosive material.
51160	56400	When you tamp the hole, you pour sand and ore clay in it, some type of material to contain
56400	61760	the explosion so that it doesn't explode at you, but rather within the rock formation
61760	63200	so you can collapse it.
63200	67800	The iron is used to firmly pat down all the material into the hole.
67800	70400	But one day, a problem occurred.
70400	75440	Phineas' assistant had not put nearly enough sand in the hole before Phineas, looking over
75440	81200	at his men, put his tamping iron into the hole and made direct contact with the explosive
81200	82280	material.
82280	83880	The result?
83880	89360	Phineas' custom-made tamping iron shot directly upward out of the hole, like a cannon, into
89360	94320	his lower jaw, shooting behind his left eye, through the left side of the front of his
94320	98080	brain, and then right out of the top of his skull.
98080	103100	Now, despite the gruesome, life-altering injury, Phineas survived.
103100	108840	He was taken to a hospital and told a physician of his situation, insisting against disbelief
108840	113360	that his 43-inch tamping iron had indeed shot through his head.
113360	117080	He did this, of course, in between throwing up and coughing up blood.
117080	121280	Harlow went to work, cleaning, treating, and closing the injury.
121280	125740	Over the next few days, Phineas' mental condition went up and down.
125740	128420	He was optimistic at first that he'd be back to work.
128420	132560	At points, he was able to recognize family members and communicate.
132560	139680	Two weeks later, comatose and suffering infection, Harlow had to act to save Phineas' life.
139680	140840	So he did.
140840	145760	He cleared out fungi and cerebral abscess, sprouting from Phineas' dome, applying silver
145760	146760	nitrate.
146760	149200	Phineas continued to survive.
149200	153720	After a month, he was able to walk again, and after two and a half, he was back home,
153720	155760	helping out on the family farm.
155760	160440	He was never, however, able to work in his old job again.
160440	164720	As far as we know, this is because he changed as a person after his injury.
164720	170600	Harlow, the main biographer of Phineas' ordeal, as well as his life-saving surgeon, described
170600	173320	him as becoming impulsive and vulgar.
173320	180480	A child in his intellectual capacity and manifestations, he has the animal passions of a strong man.
180480	185920	His mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he
185920	188040	was no longer gage.
188040	192600	The thing is, we don't know exactly how much he was affected by this injury.
192600	196960	Malcolm McMillan chronicles the situation and its impact on the world of neuroscience
196960	201680	in the book An Odd Kind of Fame, wherein he details the types of debates taking place
201680	206560	within the medical community surrounding Phineas' case, as well as the overall science of the
206560	207560	mind.
207560	211180	In it, he writes that the kind of knowledge that we would like to have about the damage
211180	215760	done to Phineas' gage's brain still seems beyond our reach.
215960	220640	John Martin Harlow was the only person with extensive recorded observations of Phineas'
220640	222840	gage, and we can draw a lot from them.
222840	226640	We can see from these recordings that his personality changed and that he went through
226640	231200	a lot of things in his life afterwards to varying reports, but we don't have scans of
231200	232200	his brain.
232200	234240	We don't have full-on data.
234240	237440	We don't even have much record from those close to him.
237440	240840	And the science of the time was so limited that we have to approach it with a degree
240840	241840	of caution.
241920	247320	Mainly, Phineas' case became central in the middle of a debate in the early 1800s about
247320	252000	the localization of the brain, that being whether or not the brain had different compartments
252000	257960	which were allocated different functions and basically, frankly, what the brain even was
257960	259840	capable of doing at all.
259840	266360	Even the understanding that the brain was focal in decision-making and morality and logic
266360	271920	was something that was fairly new in science at that point, as opposed to understandings
271920	276240	from old philosophy about these things coming down to the heart and the soul.
276240	280720	With the case of Phineas, there was debate as to whether or not the injury, the one where
280720	285480	a giant bar rammed through his head and shot through the top of his skull, even affected
285480	286480	him that much.
286480	289160	A common narrative was that he was basically fine.
289160	292960	After the thing flew through his head, he got up, dusted himself off, took himself to
292960	295600	the doctor, got wrapped up, and was good as new.
295720	300640	Phineas' documentation proved that this was false, but because anti-localization narratives
300640	305160	had become popular within the medical community at that time, its narratives spread with much
305160	306600	more popularity.
306600	308080	And that's the thing about science.
308080	313200	There's so much we know and so much we don't, and thus, tons of things that we assume based
313200	314760	on how we see the world.
314760	316040	But why does it matter?
316040	320360	Why should we care about the case of Jack Harlow and Phineas Flynn?
320360	326400	Well, the brain and debates over its functions remain a huge part of our social understanding
326400	327600	to this day.
327600	333480	For example, one of the most trendy terms these days, it seems, on social media, is the
333480	335080	prefrontal cortex.
335080	337000	Okay, so follow me here.
337000	342680	Rumor has it that Sidney Sweeney of Euphoria fame cheated on her fiance with Glenn Powell
342680	348080	of Top Gun fame, who was also cheating on his girlfriend, model Gigi Paris, who basically
348080	351400	announced a breakup with him shadily over Instagram.
351400	356600	This was a story or non-story because nothing is really confirmed that was significant enough
356600	361440	to be a part of online discourse for about a day and a half in late April before everyone
361440	364840	decided to move on to whatever we moved on to.
364840	370720	Now, I'm not particularly interested in taking a side in the case of Glidney.
370720	371720	Cheating is bad.
371720	373120	We don't know if they're cheating.
373120	374120	We don't know them personally.
374120	375120	I don't know.
375120	376120	I don't know.
376120	377200	I don't know what's going on.
377200	381720	What I'm interested in is a particular hit tweet by a prevalent Stan Twitter user, which
381720	384800	had tons of likes that read as follows.
384800	390440	Glenn Powell is a nasty cheater, and Sidney Sweeney is just a 25-year-old teenage girl
390440	393560	trying to navigate this crazy thing we call life.
393560	397800	This tweet is almost certainly satirical, although many of the people in the replies
397800	400160	don't seem to pick up on the hyperbole.
400160	404600	But what it satirizes is an important linkage with our topic.
404600	406520	Powell is a 34-year-old man.
406520	408520	Sidney is a 25-year-old woman.
408520	412680	And I can't account for the amount of people that have serious takes mirroring that of
412680	414720	the satire I just read to you.
414720	419880	But I do know that age gap discourse and discourse surrounding young women's choices and their
419880	425240	situations in general tend to run into the kind of walls that this tweet jokes about.
425240	429920	So there's this commonly held idea that the prefrontal cortex, which is a part of your
429920	434960	brain sort of towards the front that does a lot of things with regards to your attention
434960	439560	and your decision-making, doesn't finish developing fully until you reach the age of
439560	441120	like 25.
441120	447640	Sometimes people make this statement on social media to talk about celebrities or talk about
447640	453360	people they know in a way to defend them or abdicate them of as much responsibility because
453360	458360	since they were before the age of 25, their brain didn't fully develop yet, and they thusly
458360	460960	cannot be held as accountable for those actions.
460960	466160	We can't tell whether or not people are being fully serious about these takes because who
466160	467160	knows?
467160	469160	Everything is dry humor at this point.
469160	472260	We've all memed ourselves out of seriousness.
472260	474920	Everything is ironic and also kind of real.
474920	479680	Some people dryly celebrate their birthday on Twitter by announcing that their prefrontal
479680	481480	cortex has finished cooking.
481480	486200	And then others seem to all out declare that people should not get married before that
486200	489200	age because of that brain thing.
489200	495120	In other words, the prefrontal cortex development is like a new, memed way of saying a coming
495120	500400	of age, a time in which a person becomes fully mature and also simultaneously some people
500400	504640	take that age and that dynamic a lot more seriously than others.
504640	510120	The problem with earnestly saying this idea that the brain finishes developing at 25 and
510120	515920	before then it's not finished cooking, it's still cooking, is that it leads to some troubling,
515920	520920	sleeping assumptions about the differences between people and thus some questionable
520920	522320	social views.
522320	526840	When you say someone's brain isn't fully developed, what image do you conjure other
526840	533040	than that of a person who isn't fully smart, isn't fully mature, is childish, thus cannot
533040	538920	have full agency, has to depend on other people, struggles to know left from wrong, left from
538920	542680	wrong, struggles to know left from right, right from wrong.
542680	547200	When you point to a particular age and say, before you reach this age, your brain is not
547200	549160	finished cooking, it's still kind of raw.
549160	554280	You give a poor reading of science that dismisses human beings as agencies, their capacity for
554280	560280	maturity and intellect before reaching a certain age and you end up a hop and a skip away from
560280	561920	outright ableism.
561920	566680	Although it is important to understand that people's brains are developing at younger
566680	571160	ages, it is far from this simplistic idea.
571160	575520	Someone's brain works a little differently, first of all but generally, brain development
575520	580840	is affected by heredity in an environment, prenatal and postnatal insults, nutritional
580840	586320	status, sleep patterns, pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions during early childhood.
586320	592000	Furthermore, physical, mental, economical and psychological stress, drug abuse, caffeine,
592000	598040	nicotine and alcohol and sex hormones including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone can
598040	602200	influence the development and maturation of the adolescent's brain.
602200	607600	The brain does develop rapidly and somewhat vulnerably in certain ways during adolescence
607600	612040	but it is shaped by the same thing that adult brains, which continue developing basically
612040	618160	until death, do as well, external and internal factors combining in a variety of ways.
618160	623280	And there's no concrete way to determine what a brain will look like or be capable of by
623280	624640	a certain age.
624640	630600	In a Slate article by Jane See-Hoo, neurologists who are seen as titans of the field don't
630600	636200	even know where this idea of the 25 year old timeline even comes from.
636200	642080	Psychologist Larry Sternberg, a giant of the adolescence development field, says I honestly
642080	647200	don't know why people picked 25, it's a nice sounding number, it's divisible by
647200	648200	5.
648200	652840	The article details how brain scanning allowed for numerous significant advancements in studying
652840	657720	the brain but also became a field for toxic generalizations that have become prominent
657720	662760	in culture, assuming an indisputable nature to the field of neuroscience that simply does
662760	664680	not measure up to reality.
664680	668920	There's a huge amount of variability between individual brains, just as you might stop
668920	674800	growing taller at 23 or 17, or if you're like me 12, sick burn on yourself but it's
674800	677340	okay to be short, short people are cool.
677340	682480	The age that corresponds with brain plateaus can differ greatly from person to person.
682480	688040	In one study, participants ranged from 7 to 30 years old and researchers tried to predict
688040	692960	each person's brain age by mapping the connections in each person's brain.
692960	698080	Their age predictions accounted for about 55% of the variance among the participants
698080	700280	but far from all of it.
700280	706280	Some 8 year old brains exhibited a greater maturation index than some 25 year old brains,
706280	708520	Somerville wrote in her neuron review.
708520	713600	But the most disturbing part of these cultural assumptions is not the bad science itself
713600	717680	but the cultural implications and impacts that they have.
717680	721560	Mills told me she's heard from middle and high school students that their teachers often
721560	726120	point to brain science as justification for their bad decisions.
726120	731720	As people continue to cite this factoid, it has the power to create serious societal change.
731720	736720	In some cases the result might literally save lives, for instance keeping dangerous weapons
736720	741120	out of the hands of young people or preventing instances of capital punishment.
741120	744000	In other cases it could cost lives.
744000	748280	Anti-trans activists cite this as evidence that young people should not be allowed to
748280	751760	access life saving, gender-affirming care.
751760	756680	The ultimate trajectory of this growing belief and the profound effect it could have on young
756680	762440	lives is impossible to know but it's clear that neuroscience has and will be deployed
762440	764120	to shape policy.
764120	771240	In other words, making these assumptions that your brain simply is not ready or good enough
771240	777160	to make big decisions before it reaches a certain age has huge impacts on young people
777160	782680	and the amount of agency they can have on sometimes life saving decisions.
782680	786360	Life changing choices that are extremely important to them.
786360	793480	And it shouldn't take some sort of fake neuroscientific explanation to showcase why age gaps can be
793480	799040	very problematic in predatory or to showcase why certain people shouldn't have guns.
799040	804400	We don't need to cite bad facts about the brain in order to make good decisions in society.
804400	810080	Now here's the question, what do we know about the prefrontal cortex and what kind of reasonable
810080	812840	ideas can we draw from that knowledge?
812840	817080	For one, we can identify the prefrontal cortex as the key part of the frontal lobe that is
817080	821920	essential in regulating emotional behaviors, executive function, and fear extinction.
821920	825480	Those are the kinds of things that neurodivergent people often struggle with.
825480	829600	Something like stimulant medication, which ColorMind has done a great video essay on,
829600	834360	has been found to reduce usage of the prefrontal cortex, essentially taxing that part of the
834360	839800	brain less as users report an easier time focusing and maintaining energy.
839800	845400	Your prefrontal cortex is important but we're not sure still how exactly it works to the
845400	847460	detail other than a few basics.
847460	852620	We know that physical trauma to the prefrontal cortex like, I don't know, a giant rod ramming
852620	856540	through it and shooting out of the top of your head can have an impact on your brain
856540	863460	and your livelihood, but the brain is so complicated that any attempts to oversimplify its workings
863460	867340	should be questioned.
867340	870180	Before we conclude, let's talk about studying and learning.
870180	875580	The processes of the brain and stories like Phineas Gages are complicated for me to discuss,
875580	880300	especially since I don't have any real science background training and I have serious attention
880300	881300	issues.
881300	883900	That's why it's helpful for me to use an app like Milanote.
883900	887300	Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.
887300	891340	It allows you to collect notes, images, videos, tasks, and more.
891340	895340	The layout is super clean and cool and the projects are shareable, which was ideal for
895340	899820	my editor Denai and I to put images and notes together.
899820	904140	Serious note taking is hard, so Denai ended up putting a bunch of Monsters Inc and high
904140	914180	school musical stuff together, had a bunch of fun with it.
914180	918260	For me, having cool software to play around with to help with inspiration and keeping
918260	922540	memory of things helped my prefrontal cortex feel warm and fuzzy inside.
922540	926700	And I like how downloading the app on mobile allows me to access my boards on the go as
926700	927700	well.
927700	930900	If you pick up Milanote, you can get started on projects pretty easily.
930900	935260	Over 100 built in templates are available for every type of creative project.
935260	936620	Which ones look coolest to you?
936620	940100	I think the creative brief one looks pretty cool to me because it's going to help me
940100	942940	for some group projects I want to work on in the future.
942940	946780	You can download Milanote with the link in the description to get started for free with
946780	947940	no time limit.
947940	951260	And if you enjoy using Milanote, feel free to share in the comments.
951260	960500	Thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it.
960500	966620	John Martin Harlow's 1868 report on Phineas Gage is probably to this day the most important
966620	968500	text on this case.
968500	973500	It details the behavioral changes and difficulties Phineas experienced and how he ultimately got
973500	979660	his things together, worked some horse carriage jobs, and eventually died of a seizure in 1860.
979660	983620	The rest of his life was as far as we know a mix of success and struggles.
983620	989420	It's true that he recovered his brain to some extraordinary degrees and picked himself
989420	994340	up by his bootstraps, but only to a certain extent before the ailments that he suffered
994340	1000580	at least in great part because of his injuries affected his life and eventually ended it.
1000580	1004460	Now, 1868 is 8 years after his death.
1004460	1010380	Harlow had to wait many years after his initial reporting on Gage and 8 years after his death
1010380	1015220	in order to come out with this report which eventually had a seismic impact on the medical
1015220	1016220	community.
1016220	1020900	This was a huge deal because it revealed the extent of Phineas' behavioral changes from
1020900	1025980	the injury, at least in that moment, which is something that for years had been downplayed.
1025980	1030340	Henry James Bigelow, who was another person who had seen Gage in the earlier times after
1030340	1035720	his injury and became this kind of widely quoted scientific reporter on him, was an
1035720	1040860	anti-localizationist who said the man was still able to walk off and talked with composure
1040860	1043580	and equanimity of the hole in his head.
1043580	1048580	And this became a focal point of anti-localization arguments which trotted this case out as an
1048580	1053460	example of how the brain could be injured in many ways, especially in this particular
1053460	1058260	part of the brain, and human beings could essentially recover from it good is new, which
1058260	1061820	pointed to the fact that certain parts of the brain simply aren't that important and
1061820	1065620	that maybe the brain doesn't have that many roles or functions.
1065620	1069600	On the other side, Harlow's report and his viewpoint argued the opposite, something much
1069600	1075560	more modern, which is the idea that this part of Phineas' brain had certain aspects,
1075560	1080840	it had certain roles, and when it was damaged in such a severe way, it had certain effects
1080840	1082360	on his personality.
1082360	1086000	Ways that we can kind of understand to this day as mirroring what we would think would
1086000	1089800	happen to somebody who injures their prefrontal cortex in such a way.
1089800	1094320	Similar to people who have neural atypical brains that have difficulties in the prefrontal
1094320	1099480	cortex, somebody could injure it and have difficulties with memory retention, like Phineas did,
1100120	1105440	have issues counting and have issues keeping a schedule or keeping their temperament calm.
1105440	1111240	The thing is, Harlow and the localizationists of that time had an understanding that was
1111240	1115040	still pretty far from what we know now.
1115040	1122040	You see, on the other side of Bigelow and the anti-localizationists were the phrenologists.
1123040	1129400	Phrenology was an extremely popular scientific trend of the early 1800s.
1129400	1131840	Today we know it to be pseudoscience.
1131840	1135160	The idea was that different parts of your brain had different functions, which people
1135160	1139520	mapped out with all these different terms, and that this is where it gets especially
1139520	1140520	goofy.
1140520	1145800	The shape of your head could determine which parts of your brain were more pronounced,
1145800	1152000	and thus which personality aspects and brain strengths you had, and which parts were weaker.
1152160	1157400	So if your brain was big on this side, then that meant you had, I don't know, better memory.
1157400	1158400	Stuff like that.
1158400	1162920	Via email, Mark Dingman from the YouTube channel NeuroscientificallyChallenged explained to
1162920	1168240	me that although phrenology was pseudoscientific, Franz Gaul, who developed it, was an accomplished
1168240	1172960	neuroscientist and his ideas that different parts of the brain might be involved in different
1172960	1175000	functions was sound.
1175000	1180320	So although phrenology eventually was dismissed, it helped generate ideas about localization
1180320	1181840	that would persist.
1181840	1186600	Gaul invented phrenology through a curiosity that people may act and think differently
1186600	1188400	based on how they looked.
1188400	1192840	In one of his early experiments, Gaul collected together a number of individuals of the lower
1192840	1198440	classes of society, such as coachmen, servants, etc., and after gaining their confidence in
1198440	1203200	giving them beer, wine, and money, encouraged them to talk about each other's good and
1203200	1206800	bad qualities, in short, their striking characteristics.
1206800	1211320	Their discussions soon narrowed to identifying those who were peaceable and those who provoked
1211320	1212320	quarrels.
1212320	1217000	Gaul then tried to identify the features of the heads that differentiated the two groups.
1217000	1221840	I ranged the quarrel some on one side and the peaceable on the other and examined carefully
1221840	1223360	the heads of both.
1223360	1228440	I found that in all the former, the head, immediately behind and on a level with the
1228440	1232680	top of the ears, was much broader than in the latter.
1232680	1233680	Ah-ha!
1233680	1235520	Cracked the case!
1235520	1241240	John Martin Harlow was, if not a phrenologist himself, a phrenology sympathizer to say the
1241240	1242240	least.
1242240	1246760	The term Nervo Billius, which Harlow used to describe Phineas Gage's new personality
1246760	1250880	post-injury, was lifted directly from a phrenological doctrine.
1250880	1256200	His account of Phineas being unable to value money properly linked with the idea that the
1256200	1260120	injury had pierced his organ of veneration.
1260120	1264720	Phrenology was hugely popular, like I said in the early 1800s, for a time.
1264720	1269240	You could make substantial money as a medical professional or not even, going around to
1269240	1274320	people and giving them advice on what they should do in big situations by looking at
1274320	1278520	the shape of their head and saying, well, you might want to avoid this because your
1278520	1282520	brain is like this and you might want to do this instead or you might want to work on
1282520	1284760	this particular part of your brain.
1284760	1291320	And as all popular sciences go, it was formed through and shaped by political motivations.
1291320	1296640	Most infamously, phrenology was used to describe the inferiority of other races.
1296720	1303040	A shocking twist for a practice based on judging how somebody thinks and acts based on how they look.
1303040	1307640	At the same time, phrenology was actually practiced by people across political lines
1307640	1309520	and across class lines.
1309520	1314280	And it set a foundation for our understanding of the brain today, which I still don't know
1314280	1315760	how to feel about that.
1315760	1320600	It was phrenologists like Harlow who were basically right about how Gage was affected
1320600	1322160	by his injury.
1322160	1326240	Understanding that the prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain, although
1326320	1331120	they didn't have that terminology necessarily and not as the anti-localizationist might
1331120	1336160	have felt some sort of like neutral, non-active part of the brain that you could basically
1336160	1338160	just like chop off if you needed to.
1338160	1341680	We now know that the prefrontal cortex, as Dingman describes, is best known for its
1341680	1344680	role in complex cognition and executive functions.
1344680	1350200	But on both sides of this debate over the brain and on all the sides of these debates
1350200	1354320	these days about our brain, we see a lot of dogma.
1354320	1358960	When we talk about our prefrontal cortex and how they need to reach a certain age in order
1358960	1362960	to finish cooking, we participate in pushing dogma.
1362960	1367160	We resemble the anti-localizationists who think you can chop off a piece of your brain
1367160	1371840	and basically be fine, or the phrenologists who think that the organ of veneration must
1371840	1374880	enlarge in order for you to be better at counting money.
1374880	1381520	And not only does this make us ignorant, it is, by and large, and as such, a process
1381520	1389120	of trying to be determinative and naturalist, declaring the world to be dictated by obvious,
1389120	1395520	simple, natural rules, and basically telling people who oppose us with facts and reason
1395520	1400140	that they should argue with the science, because the science backs us up.
1400140	1401760	But science doesn't work that way.
1401760	1407400	It is hard enough to make scientific discoveries and find new scientific truths, which makes
1407400	1411680	it all the more satisfying when we do find those, and all the more frustrating when our
1411680	1416880	society seems to refuse to open itself up to these new knowledges.
1416880	1419200	But maybe that's the point.
1419200	1423600	Phrenology became popular not because of empirical evidence, but because of how it could offer
1423600	1426600	a simple, compelling roadmap for people.
1426600	1431160	If your head was a certain shape that didn't favor a certain trait, you could train it
1431160	1433480	to make parts of your brain stronger.
1433680	1436000	America Janic writes for The Atlantic that,
1436000	1440640	One reason phrenology attracted so many followers was that it seemed to provide the toolbox
1440640	1442520	for the American dream.
1442520	1446880	All classes of society found much to admire in phrenology.
1446880	1451200	The upper classes liked it because it reassured them, but the social hierarchy that placed
1451200	1453280	them on top was natural.
1453280	1457960	The emerging middle class and working classes liked it because its meritocratic message
1457960	1463920	confirmed their hope of advancement through personal striving and self-improvement.
1463920	1468440	Science has so much to offer us, but we only pay attention to it when it tells us what
1468440	1470080	we want to hear.
1470080	1474080	In today's day and age, we talk about the prefrontal cortex like it's some obvious
1474080	1476480	natural explanation of our issues.
1476480	1480720	If we're under 25 and struggling to get life together, maybe it's just because our brain
1480720	1482160	isn't fully developed.
1482160	1486800	It's easier to say that than to look at all the complicated confluences of culture,
1486920	1491800	biology, politics, earth science and everything else and get a detailed understanding of our
1491800	1492800	lives.
1492800	1498000	What really fascinates me though is why this is so popular in the first place.
1498000	1503160	Wouldn't it be more pleasant to cling to simplistic neuroscience saying that young people are
1503160	1505480	actually really smart?
1505480	1510600	Wouldn't it be more inspiring to cling to stories of people healing their own brains
1510600	1513200	even after injuring them severely?
1513200	1518320	Why do we instead seem excited to call ourselves underdeveloped?
1518320	1525320	Why do we seem so obsessed with the powerlessness of youth to be continued?
