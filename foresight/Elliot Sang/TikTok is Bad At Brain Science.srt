1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
At the age of 25, Phineas P. Gage was fairly accomplished in his profession.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,960
A railroad foreman in 1848, he was in charge of leading construction gangs, blasting away

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,160
rock to make way for roads that would be pivotal for expanding US civilization less than a

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,680
century after its formation.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,080
Physician John Martin Harlow knew him to be a most efficient and capable foreman, a shrewd,

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,920
smart businessman, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:41,000
He was tall, smart, and driven toward his goals, the very ideal of young American masculinity.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,240
In those times, blasters used tamping irons which were basically like long, smooth crowbars

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,160
in order to tamp a hole which you drilled into a rock and filled with explosive material.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,400
When you tamp the hole, you pour sand and ore clay in it, some type of material to contain

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,760
the explosion so that it doesn't explode at you, but rather within the rock formation

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,200
so you can collapse it.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,800
The iron is used to firmly pat down all the material into the hole.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,400
But one day, a problem occurred.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,440
Phineas' assistant had not put nearly enough sand in the hole before Phineas, looking over

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,200
at his men, put his tamping iron into the hole and made direct contact with the explosive

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,280
material.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,880
The result?

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,360
Phineas' custom-made tamping iron shot directly upward out of the hole, like a cannon, into

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
his lower jaw, shooting behind his left eye, through the left side of the front of his

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,080
brain, and then right out of the top of his skull.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,100
Now, despite the gruesome, life-altering injury, Phineas survived.

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,840
He was taken to a hospital and told a physician of his situation, insisting against disbelief

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,360
that his 43-inch tamping iron had indeed shot through his head.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,080
He did this, of course, in between throwing up and coughing up blood.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,280
Harlow went to work, cleaning, treating, and closing the injury.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,740
Over the next few days, Phineas' mental condition went up and down.

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,420
He was optimistic at first that he'd be back to work.

29
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,560
At points, he was able to recognize family members and communicate.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,680
Two weeks later, comatose and suffering infection, Harlow had to act to save Phineas' life.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
So he did.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,760
He cleared out fungi and cerebral abscess, sprouting from Phineas' dome, applying silver

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
nitrate.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
Phineas continued to survive.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,720
After a month, he was able to walk again, and after two and a half, he was back home,

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,760
helping out on the family farm.

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,440
He was never, however, able to work in his old job again.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,720
As far as we know, this is because he changed as a person after his injury.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,600
Harlow, the main biographer of Phineas' ordeal, as well as his life-saving surgeon, described

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,320
him as becoming impulsive and vulgar.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,480
A child in his intellectual capacity and manifestations, he has the animal passions of a strong man.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,920
His mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,040
was no longer gage.

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,600
The thing is, we don't know exactly how much he was affected by this injury.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,960
Malcolm McMillan chronicles the situation and its impact on the world of neuroscience

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,680
in the book An Odd Kind of Fame, wherein he details the types of debates taking place

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
within the medical community surrounding Phineas' case, as well as the overall science of the

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
mind.

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,180
In it, he writes that the kind of knowledge that we would like to have about the damage

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,760
done to Phineas' gage's brain still seems beyond our reach.

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,640
John Martin Harlow was the only person with extensive recorded observations of Phineas'

52
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,840
gage, and we can draw a lot from them.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,640
We can see from these recordings that his personality changed and that he went through

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
a lot of things in his life afterwards to varying reports, but we don't have scans of

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
his brain.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,240
We don't have full-on data.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,440
We don't even have much record from those close to him.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,840
And the science of the time was so limited that we have to approach it with a degree

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
of caution.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Mainly, Phineas' case became central in the middle of a debate in the early 1800s about

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,000
the localization of the brain, that being whether or not the brain had different compartments

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,960
which were allocated different functions and basically, frankly, what the brain even was

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,840
capable of doing at all.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,360
Even the understanding that the brain was focal in decision-making and morality and logic

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,920
was something that was fairly new in science at that point, as opposed to understandings

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,240
from old philosophy about these things coming down to the heart and the soul.

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
With the case of Phineas, there was debate as to whether or not the injury, the one where

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,480
a giant bar rammed through his head and shot through the top of his skull, even affected

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
him that much.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,160
A common narrative was that he was basically fine.

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,960
After the thing flew through his head, he got up, dusted himself off, took himself to

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
the doctor, got wrapped up, and was good as new.

73
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Phineas' documentation proved that this was false, but because anti-localization narratives

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,160
had become popular within the medical community at that time, its narratives spread with much

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,600
more popularity.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,080
And that's the thing about science.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,200
There's so much we know and so much we don't, and thus, tons of things that we assume based

78
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,760
on how we see the world.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
But why does it matter?

80
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,360
Why should we care about the case of Jack Harlow and Phineas Flynn?

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Well, the brain and debates over its functions remain a huge part of our social understanding

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
to this day.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,480
For example, one of the most trendy terms these days, it seems, on social media, is the

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
prefrontal cortex.

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, so follow me here.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,680
Rumor has it that Sidney Sweeney of Euphoria fame cheated on her fiance with Glenn Powell

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,080
of Top Gun fame, who was also cheating on his girlfriend, model Gigi Paris, who basically

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,400
announced a breakup with him shadily over Instagram.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,600
This was a story or non-story because nothing is really confirmed that was significant enough

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,440
to be a part of online discourse for about a day and a half in late April before everyone

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,840
decided to move on to whatever we moved on to.

92
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,720
Now, I'm not particularly interested in taking a side in the case of Glidney.

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Cheating is bad.

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,120
We don't know if they're cheating.

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
We don't know them personally.

96
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I don't know.

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I don't know.

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
I don't know what's going on.

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,720
What I'm interested in is a particular hit tweet by a prevalent Stan Twitter user, which

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,800
had tons of likes that read as follows.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,440
Glenn Powell is a nasty cheater, and Sidney Sweeney is just a 25-year-old teenage girl

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,560
trying to navigate this crazy thing we call life.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,800
This tweet is almost certainly satirical, although many of the people in the replies

104
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,160
don't seem to pick up on the hyperbole.

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,600
But what it satirizes is an important linkage with our topic.

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,520
Powell is a 34-year-old man.

107
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Sidney is a 25-year-old woman.

108
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,680
And I can't account for the amount of people that have serious takes mirroring that of

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,720
the satire I just read to you.

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,880
But I do know that age gap discourse and discourse surrounding young women's choices and their

111
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,240
situations in general tend to run into the kind of walls that this tweet jokes about.

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,920
So there's this commonly held idea that the prefrontal cortex, which is a part of your

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,960
brain sort of towards the front that does a lot of things with regards to your attention

114
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,560
and your decision-making, doesn't finish developing fully until you reach the age of

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
like 25.

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,640
Sometimes people make this statement on social media to talk about celebrities or talk about

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,360
people they know in a way to defend them or abdicate them of as much responsibility because

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
since they were before the age of 25, their brain didn't fully develop yet, and they thusly

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,960
cannot be held as accountable for those actions.

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,160
We can't tell whether or not people are being fully serious about these takes because who

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
knows?

122
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Everything is dry humor at this point.

123
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,260
We've all memed ourselves out of seriousness.

124
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,920
Everything is ironic and also kind of real.

125
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,680
Some people dryly celebrate their birthday on Twitter by announcing that their prefrontal

126
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
cortex has finished cooking.

127
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,200
And then others seem to all out declare that people should not get married before that

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
age because of that brain thing.

129
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,120
In other words, the prefrontal cortex development is like a new, memed way of saying a coming

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,400
of age, a time in which a person becomes fully mature and also simultaneously some people

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,640
take that age and that dynamic a lot more seriously than others.

132
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,120
The problem with earnestly saying this idea that the brain finishes developing at 25 and

133
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,920
before then it's not finished cooking, it's still cooking, is that it leads to some troubling,

134
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,920
sleeping assumptions about the differences between people and thus some questionable

135
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
social views.

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,840
When you say someone's brain isn't fully developed, what image do you conjure other

137
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:53,040
than that of a person who isn't fully smart, isn't fully mature, is childish, thus cannot

138
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,920
have full agency, has to depend on other people, struggles to know left from wrong, left from

139
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,680
wrong, struggles to know left from right, right from wrong.

140
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,200
When you point to a particular age and say, before you reach this age, your brain is not

141
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,160
finished cooking, it's still kind of raw.

142
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,280
You give a poor reading of science that dismisses human beings as agencies, their capacity for

143
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,280
maturity and intellect before reaching a certain age and you end up a hop and a skip away from

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
outright ableism.

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,680
Although it is important to understand that people's brains are developing at younger

146
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,160
ages, it is far from this simplistic idea.

147
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,520
Someone's brain works a little differently, first of all but generally, brain development

148
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,840
is affected by heredity in an environment, prenatal and postnatal insults, nutritional

149
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,320
status, sleep patterns, pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions during early childhood.

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Furthermore, physical, mental, economical and psychological stress, drug abuse, caffeine,

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,040
nicotine and alcohol and sex hormones including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone can

152
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,200
influence the development and maturation of the adolescent's brain.

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,600
The brain does develop rapidly and somewhat vulnerably in certain ways during adolescence

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,040
but it is shaped by the same thing that adult brains, which continue developing basically

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,160
until death, do as well, external and internal factors combining in a variety of ways.

156
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,280
And there's no concrete way to determine what a brain will look like or be capable of by

157
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
a certain age.

158
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,600
In a Slate article by Jane See-Hoo, neurologists who are seen as titans of the field don't

159
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,200
even know where this idea of the 25 year old timeline even comes from.

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Psychologist Larry Sternberg, a giant of the adolescence development field, says I honestly

161
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,200
don't know why people picked 25, it's a nice sounding number, it's divisible by

162
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
5.

163
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,840
The article details how brain scanning allowed for numerous significant advancements in studying

164
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,720
the brain but also became a field for toxic generalizations that have become prominent

165
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,760
in culture, assuming an indisputable nature to the field of neuroscience that simply does

166
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,680
not measure up to reality.

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,920
There's a huge amount of variability between individual brains, just as you might stop

168
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,800
growing taller at 23 or 17, or if you're like me 12, sick burn on yourself but it's

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,340
okay to be short, short people are cool.

170
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,480
The age that corresponds with brain plateaus can differ greatly from person to person.

171
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,040
In one study, participants ranged from 7 to 30 years old and researchers tried to predict

172
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,960
each person's brain age by mapping the connections in each person's brain.

173
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,080
Their age predictions accounted for about 55% of the variance among the participants

174
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,280
but far from all of it.

175
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Some 8 year old brains exhibited a greater maturation index than some 25 year old brains,

176
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,520
Somerville wrote in her neuron review.

177
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,600
But the most disturbing part of these cultural assumptions is not the bad science itself

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
but the cultural implications and impacts that they have.

179
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,560
Mills told me she's heard from middle and high school students that their teachers often

180
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,120
point to brain science as justification for their bad decisions.

181
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,720
As people continue to cite this factoid, it has the power to create serious societal change.

182
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,720
In some cases the result might literally save lives, for instance keeping dangerous weapons

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
out of the hands of young people or preventing instances of capital punishment.

184
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
In other cases it could cost lives.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,280
Anti-trans activists cite this as evidence that young people should not be allowed to

186
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,760
access life saving, gender-affirming care.

187
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,680
The ultimate trajectory of this growing belief and the profound effect it could have on young

188
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,440
lives is impossible to know but it's clear that neuroscience has and will be deployed

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,120
to shape policy.

190
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:51,240
In other words, making these assumptions that your brain simply is not ready or good enough

191
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,160
to make big decisions before it reaches a certain age has huge impacts on young people

192
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,680
and the amount of agency they can have on sometimes life saving decisions.

193
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,360
Life changing choices that are extremely important to them.

194
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,480
And it shouldn't take some sort of fake neuroscientific explanation to showcase why age gaps can be

195
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,040
very problematic in predatory or to showcase why certain people shouldn't have guns.

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,400
We don't need to cite bad facts about the brain in order to make good decisions in society.

197
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,080
Now here's the question, what do we know about the prefrontal cortex and what kind of reasonable

198
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,840
ideas can we draw from that knowledge?

199
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,080
For one, we can identify the prefrontal cortex as the key part of the frontal lobe that is

200
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,920
essential in regulating emotional behaviors, executive function, and fear extinction.

201
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,480
Those are the kinds of things that neurodivergent people often struggle with.

202
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,600
Something like stimulant medication, which ColorMind has done a great video essay on,

203
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,360
has been found to reduce usage of the prefrontal cortex, essentially taxing that part of the

204
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,800
brain less as users report an easier time focusing and maintaining energy.

205
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,400
Your prefrontal cortex is important but we're not sure still how exactly it works to the

206
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,460
detail other than a few basics.

207
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,620
We know that physical trauma to the prefrontal cortex like, I don't know, a giant rod ramming

208
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,540
through it and shooting out of the top of your head can have an impact on your brain

209
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:23,460
and your livelihood, but the brain is so complicated that any attempts to oversimplify its workings

210
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,340
should be questioned.

211
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,180
Before we conclude, let's talk about studying and learning.

212
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,580
The processes of the brain and stories like Phineas Gages are complicated for me to discuss,

213
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,300
especially since I don't have any real science background training and I have serious attention

214
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
issues.

215
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,900
That's why it's helpful for me to use an app like Milanote.

216
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.

217
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,340
It allows you to collect notes, images, videos, tasks, and more.

218
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,340
The layout is super clean and cool and the projects are shareable, which was ideal for

219
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,820
my editor Denai and I to put images and notes together.

220
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,140
Serious note taking is hard, so Denai ended up putting a bunch of Monsters Inc and high

221
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:14,180
school musical stuff together, had a bunch of fun with it.

222
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,260
For me, having cool software to play around with to help with inspiration and keeping

223
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,540
memory of things helped my prefrontal cortex feel warm and fuzzy inside.

224
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,700
And I like how downloading the app on mobile allows me to access my boards on the go as

225
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
well.

226
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,900
If you pick up Milanote, you can get started on projects pretty easily.

227
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,260
Over 100 built in templates are available for every type of creative project.

228
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,620
Which ones look coolest to you?

229
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,100
I think the creative brief one looks pretty cool to me because it's going to help me

230
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,940
for some group projects I want to work on in the future.

231
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,780
You can download Milanote with the link in the description to get started for free with

232
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,940
no time limit.

233
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,260
And if you enjoy using Milanote, feel free to share in the comments.

234
00:15:51,260 --> 00:16:00,500
Thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it.

235
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,620
John Martin Harlow's 1868 report on Phineas Gage is probably to this day the most important

236
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,500
text on this case.

237
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
It details the behavioral changes and difficulties Phineas experienced and how he ultimately got

238
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,660
his things together, worked some horse carriage jobs, and eventually died of a seizure in 1860.

239
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,620
The rest of his life was as far as we know a mix of success and struggles.

240
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,420
It's true that he recovered his brain to some extraordinary degrees and picked himself

241
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,340
up by his bootstraps, but only to a certain extent before the ailments that he suffered

242
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,580
at least in great part because of his injuries affected his life and eventually ended it.

243
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,460
Now, 1868 is 8 years after his death.

244
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,380
Harlow had to wait many years after his initial reporting on Gage and 8 years after his death

245
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,220
in order to come out with this report which eventually had a seismic impact on the medical

246
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
community.

247
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,900
This was a huge deal because it revealed the extent of Phineas' behavioral changes from

248
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,980
the injury, at least in that moment, which is something that for years had been downplayed.

249
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,340
Henry James Bigelow, who was another person who had seen Gage in the earlier times after

250
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,720
his injury and became this kind of widely quoted scientific reporter on him, was an

251
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,860
anti-localizationist who said the man was still able to walk off and talked with composure

252
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,580
and equanimity of the hole in his head.

253
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,580
And this became a focal point of anti-localization arguments which trotted this case out as an

254
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,460
example of how the brain could be injured in many ways, especially in this particular

255
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,260
part of the brain, and human beings could essentially recover from it good is new, which

256
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,820
pointed to the fact that certain parts of the brain simply aren't that important and

257
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,620
that maybe the brain doesn't have that many roles or functions.

258
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,600
On the other side, Harlow's report and his viewpoint argued the opposite, something much

259
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,560
more modern, which is the idea that this part of Phineas' brain had certain aspects,

260
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,840
it had certain roles, and when it was damaged in such a severe way, it had certain effects

261
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,360
on his personality.

262
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Ways that we can kind of understand to this day as mirroring what we would think would

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,800
happen to somebody who injures their prefrontal cortex in such a way.

264
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,320
Similar to people who have neural atypical brains that have difficulties in the prefrontal

265
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
cortex, somebody could injure it and have difficulties with memory retention, like Phineas did,

266
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,440
have issues counting and have issues keeping a schedule or keeping their temperament calm.

267
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,240
The thing is, Harlow and the localizationists of that time had an understanding that was

268
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,040
still pretty far from what we know now.

269
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:42,040
You see, on the other side of Bigelow and the anti-localizationists were the phrenologists.

270
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,400
Phrenology was an extremely popular scientific trend of the early 1800s.

271
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,840
Today we know it to be pseudoscience.

272
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,160
The idea was that different parts of your brain had different functions, which people

273
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,520
mapped out with all these different terms, and that this is where it gets especially

274
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
goofy.

275
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,800
The shape of your head could determine which parts of your brain were more pronounced,

276
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:12,000
and thus which personality aspects and brain strengths you had, and which parts were weaker.

277
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,400
So if your brain was big on this side, then that meant you had, I don't know, better memory.

278
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Stuff like that.

279
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,920
Via email, Mark Dingman from the YouTube channel NeuroscientificallyChallenged explained to

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,240
me that although phrenology was pseudoscientific, Franz Gaul, who developed it, was an accomplished

281
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,960
neuroscientist and his ideas that different parts of the brain might be involved in different

282
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,000
functions was sound.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,320
So although phrenology eventually was dismissed, it helped generate ideas about localization

284
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
that would persist.

285
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,600
Gaul invented phrenology through a curiosity that people may act and think differently

286
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
based on how they looked.

287
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,840
In one of his early experiments, Gaul collected together a number of individuals of the lower

288
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,440
classes of society, such as coachmen, servants, etc., and after gaining their confidence in

289
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,200
giving them beer, wine, and money, encouraged them to talk about each other's good and

290
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,800
bad qualities, in short, their striking characteristics.

291
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,320
Their discussions soon narrowed to identifying those who were peaceable and those who provoked

292
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
quarrels.

293
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,000
Gaul then tried to identify the features of the heads that differentiated the two groups.

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,840
I ranged the quarrel some on one side and the peaceable on the other and examined carefully

295
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,360
the heads of both.

296
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,440
I found that in all the former, the head, immediately behind and on a level with the

297
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,680
top of the ears, was much broader than in the latter.

298
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Ah-ha!

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
Cracked the case!

300
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,240
John Martin Harlow was, if not a phrenologist himself, a phrenology sympathizer to say the

301
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
least.

302
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,760
The term Nervo Billius, which Harlow used to describe Phineas Gage's new personality

303
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,880
post-injury, was lifted directly from a phrenological doctrine.

304
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,200
His account of Phineas being unable to value money properly linked with the idea that the

305
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,120
injury had pierced his organ of veneration.

306
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,720
Phrenology was hugely popular, like I said in the early 1800s, for a time.

307
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,240
You could make substantial money as a medical professional or not even, going around to

308
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,320
people and giving them advice on what they should do in big situations by looking at

309
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,520
the shape of their head and saying, well, you might want to avoid this because your

310
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,520
brain is like this and you might want to do this instead or you might want to work on

311
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,760
this particular part of your brain.

312
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:31,320
And as all popular sciences go, it was formed through and shaped by political motivations.

313
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,640
Most infamously, phrenology was used to describe the inferiority of other races.

314
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,040
A shocking twist for a practice based on judging how somebody thinks and acts based on how they look.

315
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,640
At the same time, phrenology was actually practiced by people across political lines

316
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
and across class lines.

317
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,280
And it set a foundation for our understanding of the brain today, which I still don't know

318
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,760
how to feel about that.

319
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,600
It was phrenologists like Harlow who were basically right about how Gage was affected

320
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,160
by his injury.

321
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Understanding that the prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain, although

322
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
they didn't have that terminology necessarily and not as the anti-localizationist might

323
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,160
have felt some sort of like neutral, non-active part of the brain that you could basically

324
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
just like chop off if you needed to.

325
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,680
We now know that the prefrontal cortex, as Dingman describes, is best known for its

326
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,680
role in complex cognition and executive functions.

327
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,200
But on both sides of this debate over the brain and on all the sides of these debates

328
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,320
these days about our brain, we see a lot of dogma.

329
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,960
When we talk about our prefrontal cortex and how they need to reach a certain age in order

330
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
to finish cooking, we participate in pushing dogma.

331
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,160
We resemble the anti-localizationists who think you can chop off a piece of your brain

332
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,840
and basically be fine, or the phrenologists who think that the organ of veneration must

333
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,880
enlarge in order for you to be better at counting money.

334
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,520
And not only does this make us ignorant, it is, by and large, and as such, a process

335
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,120
of trying to be determinative and naturalist, declaring the world to be dictated by obvious,

336
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,520
simple, natural rules, and basically telling people who oppose us with facts and reason

337
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,140
that they should argue with the science, because the science backs us up.

338
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,760
But science doesn't work that way.

339
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,400
It is hard enough to make scientific discoveries and find new scientific truths, which makes

340
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,680
it all the more satisfying when we do find those, and all the more frustrating when our

341
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,880
society seems to refuse to open itself up to these new knowledges.

342
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,200
But maybe that's the point.

343
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Phrenology became popular not because of empirical evidence, but because of how it could offer

344
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
a simple, compelling roadmap for people.

345
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,160
If your head was a certain shape that didn't favor a certain trait, you could train it

346
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,480
to make parts of your brain stronger.

347
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,000
America Janic writes for The Atlantic that,

348
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,640
One reason phrenology attracted so many followers was that it seemed to provide the toolbox

349
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,520
for the American dream.

350
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,880
All classes of society found much to admire in phrenology.

351
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,200
The upper classes liked it because it reassured them, but the social hierarchy that placed

352
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,280
them on top was natural.

353
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,960
The emerging middle class and working classes liked it because its meritocratic message

354
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,920
confirmed their hope of advancement through personal striving and self-improvement.

355
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,440
Science has so much to offer us, but we only pay attention to it when it tells us what

356
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,080
we want to hear.

357
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,080
In today's day and age, we talk about the prefrontal cortex like it's some obvious

358
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
natural explanation of our issues.

359
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
If we're under 25 and struggling to get life together, maybe it's just because our brain

360
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,160
isn't fully developed.

361
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,800
It's easier to say that than to look at all the complicated confluences of culture,

362
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,800
biology, politics, earth science and everything else and get a detailed understanding of our

363
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
lives.

364
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,000
What really fascinates me though is why this is so popular in the first place.

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,160
Wouldn't it be more pleasant to cling to simplistic neuroscience saying that young people are

366
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,480
actually really smart?

367
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,600
Wouldn't it be more inspiring to cling to stories of people healing their own brains

368
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200
even after injuring them severely?

369
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,320
Why do we instead seem excited to call ourselves underdeveloped?

370
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Why do we seem so obsessed with the powerlessness of youth to be continued?
