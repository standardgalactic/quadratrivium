00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
At the age of 25, Phineas P. Gage was fairly accomplished in his profession.

00:08.280 --> 00:13.960
A railroad foreman in 1848, he was in charge of leading construction gangs, blasting away

00:13.960 --> 00:19.160
rock to make way for roads that would be pivotal for expanding US civilization less than a

00:19.160 --> 00:21.680
century after its formation.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.080
Physician John Martin Harlow knew him to be a most efficient and capable foreman, a shrewd,

00:27.080 --> 00:32.920
smart businessman, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation.

00:32.920 --> 00:41.000
He was tall, smart, and driven toward his goals, the very ideal of young American masculinity.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.240
In those times, blasters used tamping irons which were basically like long, smooth crowbars

00:46.240 --> 00:51.160
in order to tamp a hole which you drilled into a rock and filled with explosive material.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.400
When you tamp the hole, you pour sand and ore clay in it, some type of material to contain

00:56.400 --> 01:01.760
the explosion so that it doesn't explode at you, but rather within the rock formation

01:01.760 --> 01:03.200
so you can collapse it.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.800
The iron is used to firmly pat down all the material into the hole.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.400
But one day, a problem occurred.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.440
Phineas' assistant had not put nearly enough sand in the hole before Phineas, looking over

01:15.440 --> 01:21.200
at his men, put his tamping iron into the hole and made direct contact with the explosive

01:21.200 --> 01:22.280
material.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.880
The result?

01:23.880 --> 01:29.360
Phineas' custom-made tamping iron shot directly upward out of the hole, like a cannon, into

01:29.360 --> 01:34.320
his lower jaw, shooting behind his left eye, through the left side of the front of his

01:34.320 --> 01:38.080
brain, and then right out of the top of his skull.

01:38.080 --> 01:43.100
Now, despite the gruesome, life-altering injury, Phineas survived.

01:43.100 --> 01:48.840
He was taken to a hospital and told a physician of his situation, insisting against disbelief

01:48.840 --> 01:53.360
that his 43-inch tamping iron had indeed shot through his head.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.080
He did this, of course, in between throwing up and coughing up blood.

01:57.080 --> 02:01.280
Harlow went to work, cleaning, treating, and closing the injury.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.740
Over the next few days, Phineas' mental condition went up and down.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.420
He was optimistic at first that he'd be back to work.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.560
At points, he was able to recognize family members and communicate.

02:12.560 --> 02:19.680
Two weeks later, comatose and suffering infection, Harlow had to act to save Phineas' life.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.840
So he did.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.760
He cleared out fungi and cerebral abscess, sprouting from Phineas' dome, applying silver

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
nitrate.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.200
Phineas continued to survive.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.720
After a month, he was able to walk again, and after two and a half, he was back home,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.760
helping out on the family farm.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.440
He was never, however, able to work in his old job again.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.720
As far as we know, this is because he changed as a person after his injury.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.600
Harlow, the main biographer of Phineas' ordeal, as well as his life-saving surgeon, described

02:50.600 --> 02:53.320
him as becoming impulsive and vulgar.

02:53.320 --> 03:00.480
A child in his intellectual capacity and manifestations, he has the animal passions of a strong man.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.920
His mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he

03:05.920 --> 03:08.040
was no longer gage.

03:08.040 --> 03:12.600
The thing is, we don't know exactly how much he was affected by this injury.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.960
Malcolm McMillan chronicles the situation and its impact on the world of neuroscience

03:16.960 --> 03:21.680
in the book An Odd Kind of Fame, wherein he details the types of debates taking place

03:21.680 --> 03:26.560
within the medical community surrounding Phineas' case, as well as the overall science of the

03:26.560 --> 03:27.560
mind.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.180
In it, he writes that the kind of knowledge that we would like to have about the damage

03:31.180 --> 03:35.760
done to Phineas' gage's brain still seems beyond our reach.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.640
John Martin Harlow was the only person with extensive recorded observations of Phineas'

03:40.640 --> 03:42.840
gage, and we can draw a lot from them.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.640
We can see from these recordings that his personality changed and that he went through

03:46.640 --> 03:51.200
a lot of things in his life afterwards to varying reports, but we don't have scans of

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
his brain.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.240
We don't have full-on data.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.440
We don't even have much record from those close to him.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.840
And the science of the time was so limited that we have to approach it with a degree

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
of caution.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.320
Mainly, Phineas' case became central in the middle of a debate in the early 1800s about

04:07.320 --> 04:12.000
the localization of the brain, that being whether or not the brain had different compartments

04:12.000 --> 04:17.960
which were allocated different functions and basically, frankly, what the brain even was

04:17.960 --> 04:19.840
capable of doing at all.

04:19.840 --> 04:26.360
Even the understanding that the brain was focal in decision-making and morality and logic

04:26.360 --> 04:31.920
was something that was fairly new in science at that point, as opposed to understandings

04:31.920 --> 04:36.240
from old philosophy about these things coming down to the heart and the soul.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.720
With the case of Phineas, there was debate as to whether or not the injury, the one where

04:40.720 --> 04:45.480
a giant bar rammed through his head and shot through the top of his skull, even affected

04:45.480 --> 04:46.480
him that much.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.160
A common narrative was that he was basically fine.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.960
After the thing flew through his head, he got up, dusted himself off, took himself to

04:52.960 --> 04:55.600
the doctor, got wrapped up, and was good as new.

04:55.720 --> 05:00.640
Phineas' documentation proved that this was false, but because anti-localization narratives

05:00.640 --> 05:05.160
had become popular within the medical community at that time, its narratives spread with much

05:05.160 --> 05:06.600
more popularity.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.080
And that's the thing about science.

05:08.080 --> 05:13.200
There's so much we know and so much we don't, and thus, tons of things that we assume based

05:13.200 --> 05:14.760
on how we see the world.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.040
But why does it matter?

05:16.040 --> 05:20.360
Why should we care about the case of Jack Harlow and Phineas Flynn?

05:20.360 --> 05:26.400
Well, the brain and debates over its functions remain a huge part of our social understanding

05:26.400 --> 05:27.600
to this day.

05:27.600 --> 05:33.480
For example, one of the most trendy terms these days, it seems, on social media, is the

05:33.480 --> 05:35.080
prefrontal cortex.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.000
Okay, so follow me here.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.680
Rumor has it that Sidney Sweeney of Euphoria fame cheated on her fiance with Glenn Powell

05:42.680 --> 05:48.080
of Top Gun fame, who was also cheating on his girlfriend, model Gigi Paris, who basically

05:48.080 --> 05:51.400
announced a breakup with him shadily over Instagram.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.600
This was a story or non-story because nothing is really confirmed that was significant enough

05:56.600 --> 06:01.440
to be a part of online discourse for about a day and a half in late April before everyone

06:01.440 --> 06:04.840
decided to move on to whatever we moved on to.

06:04.840 --> 06:10.720
Now, I'm not particularly interested in taking a side in the case of Glidney.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
Cheating is bad.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.120
We don't know if they're cheating.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
We don't know them personally.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.120
I don't know.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.120
I don't know.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.200
I don't know what's going on.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.720
What I'm interested in is a particular hit tweet by a prevalent Stan Twitter user, which

06:21.720 --> 06:24.800
had tons of likes that read as follows.

06:24.800 --> 06:30.440
Glenn Powell is a nasty cheater, and Sidney Sweeney is just a 25-year-old teenage girl

06:30.440 --> 06:33.560
trying to navigate this crazy thing we call life.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.800
This tweet is almost certainly satirical, although many of the people in the replies

06:37.800 --> 06:40.160
don't seem to pick up on the hyperbole.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.600
But what it satirizes is an important linkage with our topic.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.520
Powell is a 34-year-old man.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.520
Sidney is a 25-year-old woman.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.680
And I can't account for the amount of people that have serious takes mirroring that of

06:52.680 --> 06:54.720
the satire I just read to you.

06:54.720 --> 06:59.880
But I do know that age gap discourse and discourse surrounding young women's choices and their

06:59.880 --> 07:05.240
situations in general tend to run into the kind of walls that this tweet jokes about.

07:05.240 --> 07:09.920
So there's this commonly held idea that the prefrontal cortex, which is a part of your

07:09.920 --> 07:14.960
brain sort of towards the front that does a lot of things with regards to your attention

07:14.960 --> 07:19.560
and your decision-making, doesn't finish developing fully until you reach the age of

07:19.560 --> 07:21.120
like 25.

07:21.120 --> 07:27.640
Sometimes people make this statement on social media to talk about celebrities or talk about

07:27.640 --> 07:33.360
people they know in a way to defend them or abdicate them of as much responsibility because

07:33.360 --> 07:38.360
since they were before the age of 25, their brain didn't fully develop yet, and they thusly

07:38.360 --> 07:40.960
cannot be held as accountable for those actions.

07:40.960 --> 07:46.160
We can't tell whether or not people are being fully serious about these takes because who

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
knows?

07:47.160 --> 07:49.160
Everything is dry humor at this point.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.260
We've all memed ourselves out of seriousness.

07:52.260 --> 07:54.920
Everything is ironic and also kind of real.

07:54.920 --> 07:59.680
Some people dryly celebrate their birthday on Twitter by announcing that their prefrontal

07:59.680 --> 08:01.480
cortex has finished cooking.

08:01.480 --> 08:06.200
And then others seem to all out declare that people should not get married before that

08:06.200 --> 08:09.200
age because of that brain thing.

08:09.200 --> 08:15.120
In other words, the prefrontal cortex development is like a new, memed way of saying a coming

08:15.120 --> 08:20.400
of age, a time in which a person becomes fully mature and also simultaneously some people

08:20.400 --> 08:24.640
take that age and that dynamic a lot more seriously than others.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.120
The problem with earnestly saying this idea that the brain finishes developing at 25 and

08:30.120 --> 08:35.920
before then it's not finished cooking, it's still cooking, is that it leads to some troubling,

08:35.920 --> 08:40.920
sleeping assumptions about the differences between people and thus some questionable

08:40.920 --> 08:42.320
social views.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.840
When you say someone's brain isn't fully developed, what image do you conjure other

08:46.840 --> 08:53.040
than that of a person who isn't fully smart, isn't fully mature, is childish, thus cannot

08:53.040 --> 08:58.920
have full agency, has to depend on other people, struggles to know left from wrong, left from

08:58.920 --> 09:02.680
wrong, struggles to know left from right, right from wrong.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.200
When you point to a particular age and say, before you reach this age, your brain is not

09:07.200 --> 09:09.160
finished cooking, it's still kind of raw.

09:09.160 --> 09:14.280
You give a poor reading of science that dismisses human beings as agencies, their capacity for

09:14.280 --> 09:20.280
maturity and intellect before reaching a certain age and you end up a hop and a skip away from

09:20.280 --> 09:21.920
outright ableism.

09:21.920 --> 09:26.680
Although it is important to understand that people's brains are developing at younger

09:26.680 --> 09:31.160
ages, it is far from this simplistic idea.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.520
Someone's brain works a little differently, first of all but generally, brain development

09:35.520 --> 09:40.840
is affected by heredity in an environment, prenatal and postnatal insults, nutritional

09:40.840 --> 09:46.320
status, sleep patterns, pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions during early childhood.

09:46.320 --> 09:52.000
Furthermore, physical, mental, economical and psychological stress, drug abuse, caffeine,

09:52.000 --> 09:58.040
nicotine and alcohol and sex hormones including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone can

09:58.040 --> 10:02.200
influence the development and maturation of the adolescent's brain.

10:02.200 --> 10:07.600
The brain does develop rapidly and somewhat vulnerably in certain ways during adolescence

10:07.600 --> 10:12.040
but it is shaped by the same thing that adult brains, which continue developing basically

10:12.040 --> 10:18.160
until death, do as well, external and internal factors combining in a variety of ways.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.280
And there's no concrete way to determine what a brain will look like or be capable of by

10:23.280 --> 10:24.640
a certain age.

10:24.640 --> 10:30.600
In a Slate article by Jane See-Hoo, neurologists who are seen as titans of the field don't

10:30.600 --> 10:36.200
even know where this idea of the 25 year old timeline even comes from.

10:36.200 --> 10:42.080
Psychologist Larry Sternberg, a giant of the adolescence development field, says I honestly

10:42.080 --> 10:47.200
don't know why people picked 25, it's a nice sounding number, it's divisible by

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
5.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.840
The article details how brain scanning allowed for numerous significant advancements in studying

10:52.840 --> 10:57.720
the brain but also became a field for toxic generalizations that have become prominent

10:57.720 --> 11:02.760
in culture, assuming an indisputable nature to the field of neuroscience that simply does

11:02.760 --> 11:04.680
not measure up to reality.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.920
There's a huge amount of variability between individual brains, just as you might stop

11:08.920 --> 11:14.800
growing taller at 23 or 17, or if you're like me 12, sick burn on yourself but it's

11:14.800 --> 11:17.340
okay to be short, short people are cool.

11:17.340 --> 11:22.480
The age that corresponds with brain plateaus can differ greatly from person to person.

11:22.480 --> 11:28.040
In one study, participants ranged from 7 to 30 years old and researchers tried to predict

11:28.040 --> 11:32.960
each person's brain age by mapping the connections in each person's brain.

11:32.960 --> 11:38.080
Their age predictions accounted for about 55% of the variance among the participants

11:38.080 --> 11:40.280
but far from all of it.

11:40.280 --> 11:46.280
Some 8 year old brains exhibited a greater maturation index than some 25 year old brains,

11:46.280 --> 11:48.520
Somerville wrote in her neuron review.

11:48.520 --> 11:53.600
But the most disturbing part of these cultural assumptions is not the bad science itself

11:53.600 --> 11:57.680
but the cultural implications and impacts that they have.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.560
Mills told me she's heard from middle and high school students that their teachers often

12:01.560 --> 12:06.120
point to brain science as justification for their bad decisions.

12:06.120 --> 12:11.720
As people continue to cite this factoid, it has the power to create serious societal change.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.720
In some cases the result might literally save lives, for instance keeping dangerous weapons

12:16.720 --> 12:21.120
out of the hands of young people or preventing instances of capital punishment.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.000
In other cases it could cost lives.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.280
Anti-trans activists cite this as evidence that young people should not be allowed to

12:28.280 --> 12:31.760
access life saving, gender-affirming care.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.680
The ultimate trajectory of this growing belief and the profound effect it could have on young

12:36.680 --> 12:42.440
lives is impossible to know but it's clear that neuroscience has and will be deployed

12:42.440 --> 12:44.120
to shape policy.

12:44.120 --> 12:51.240
In other words, making these assumptions that your brain simply is not ready or good enough

12:51.240 --> 12:57.160
to make big decisions before it reaches a certain age has huge impacts on young people

12:57.160 --> 13:02.680
and the amount of agency they can have on sometimes life saving decisions.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.360
Life changing choices that are extremely important to them.

13:06.360 --> 13:13.480
And it shouldn't take some sort of fake neuroscientific explanation to showcase why age gaps can be

13:13.480 --> 13:19.040
very problematic in predatory or to showcase why certain people shouldn't have guns.

13:19.040 --> 13:24.400
We don't need to cite bad facts about the brain in order to make good decisions in society.

13:24.400 --> 13:30.080
Now here's the question, what do we know about the prefrontal cortex and what kind of reasonable

13:30.080 --> 13:32.840
ideas can we draw from that knowledge?

13:32.840 --> 13:37.080
For one, we can identify the prefrontal cortex as the key part of the frontal lobe that is

13:37.080 --> 13:41.920
essential in regulating emotional behaviors, executive function, and fear extinction.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.480
Those are the kinds of things that neurodivergent people often struggle with.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.600
Something like stimulant medication, which ColorMind has done a great video essay on,

13:49.600 --> 13:54.360
has been found to reduce usage of the prefrontal cortex, essentially taxing that part of the

13:54.360 --> 13:59.800
brain less as users report an easier time focusing and maintaining energy.

13:59.800 --> 14:05.400
Your prefrontal cortex is important but we're not sure still how exactly it works to the

14:05.400 --> 14:07.460
detail other than a few basics.

14:07.460 --> 14:12.620
We know that physical trauma to the prefrontal cortex like, I don't know, a giant rod ramming

14:12.620 --> 14:16.540
through it and shooting out of the top of your head can have an impact on your brain

14:16.540 --> 14:23.460
and your livelihood, but the brain is so complicated that any attempts to oversimplify its workings

14:23.460 --> 14:27.340
should be questioned.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.180
Before we conclude, let's talk about studying and learning.

14:30.180 --> 14:35.580
The processes of the brain and stories like Phineas Gages are complicated for me to discuss,

14:35.580 --> 14:40.300
especially since I don't have any real science background training and I have serious attention

14:40.300 --> 14:41.300
issues.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.900
That's why it's helpful for me to use an app like Milanote.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.300
Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.

14:47.300 --> 14:51.340
It allows you to collect notes, images, videos, tasks, and more.

14:51.340 --> 14:55.340
The layout is super clean and cool and the projects are shareable, which was ideal for

14:55.340 --> 14:59.820
my editor Denai and I to put images and notes together.

14:59.820 --> 15:04.140
Serious note taking is hard, so Denai ended up putting a bunch of Monsters Inc and high

15:04.140 --> 15:14.180
school musical stuff together, had a bunch of fun with it.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.260
For me, having cool software to play around with to help with inspiration and keeping

15:18.260 --> 15:22.540
memory of things helped my prefrontal cortex feel warm and fuzzy inside.

15:22.540 --> 15:26.700
And I like how downloading the app on mobile allows me to access my boards on the go as

15:26.700 --> 15:27.700
well.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.900
If you pick up Milanote, you can get started on projects pretty easily.

15:30.900 --> 15:35.260
Over 100 built in templates are available for every type of creative project.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.620
Which ones look coolest to you?

15:36.620 --> 15:40.100
I think the creative brief one looks pretty cool to me because it's going to help me

15:40.100 --> 15:42.940
for some group projects I want to work on in the future.

15:42.940 --> 15:46.780
You can download Milanote with the link in the description to get started for free with

15:46.780 --> 15:47.940
no time limit.

15:47.940 --> 15:51.260
And if you enjoy using Milanote, feel free to share in the comments.

15:51.260 --> 16:00.500
Thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it.

16:00.500 --> 16:06.620
John Martin Harlow's 1868 report on Phineas Gage is probably to this day the most important

16:06.620 --> 16:08.500
text on this case.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.500
It details the behavioral changes and difficulties Phineas experienced and how he ultimately got

16:13.500 --> 16:19.660
his things together, worked some horse carriage jobs, and eventually died of a seizure in 1860.

16:19.660 --> 16:23.620
The rest of his life was as far as we know a mix of success and struggles.

16:23.620 --> 16:29.420
It's true that he recovered his brain to some extraordinary degrees and picked himself

16:29.420 --> 16:34.340
up by his bootstraps, but only to a certain extent before the ailments that he suffered

16:34.340 --> 16:40.580
at least in great part because of his injuries affected his life and eventually ended it.

16:40.580 --> 16:44.460
Now, 1868 is 8 years after his death.

16:44.460 --> 16:50.380
Harlow had to wait many years after his initial reporting on Gage and 8 years after his death

16:50.380 --> 16:55.220
in order to come out with this report which eventually had a seismic impact on the medical

16:55.220 --> 16:56.220
community.

16:56.220 --> 17:00.900
This was a huge deal because it revealed the extent of Phineas' behavioral changes from

17:00.900 --> 17:05.980
the injury, at least in that moment, which is something that for years had been downplayed.

17:05.980 --> 17:10.340
Henry James Bigelow, who was another person who had seen Gage in the earlier times after

17:10.340 --> 17:15.720
his injury and became this kind of widely quoted scientific reporter on him, was an

17:15.720 --> 17:20.860
anti-localizationist who said the man was still able to walk off and talked with composure

17:20.860 --> 17:23.580
and equanimity of the hole in his head.

17:23.580 --> 17:28.580
And this became a focal point of anti-localization arguments which trotted this case out as an

17:28.580 --> 17:33.460
example of how the brain could be injured in many ways, especially in this particular

17:33.460 --> 17:38.260
part of the brain, and human beings could essentially recover from it good is new, which

17:38.260 --> 17:41.820
pointed to the fact that certain parts of the brain simply aren't that important and

17:41.820 --> 17:45.620
that maybe the brain doesn't have that many roles or functions.

17:45.620 --> 17:49.600
On the other side, Harlow's report and his viewpoint argued the opposite, something much

17:49.600 --> 17:55.560
more modern, which is the idea that this part of Phineas' brain had certain aspects,

17:55.560 --> 18:00.840
it had certain roles, and when it was damaged in such a severe way, it had certain effects

18:00.840 --> 18:02.360
on his personality.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.000
Ways that we can kind of understand to this day as mirroring what we would think would

18:06.000 --> 18:09.800
happen to somebody who injures their prefrontal cortex in such a way.

18:09.800 --> 18:14.320
Similar to people who have neural atypical brains that have difficulties in the prefrontal

18:14.320 --> 18:19.480
cortex, somebody could injure it and have difficulties with memory retention, like Phineas did,

18:20.120 --> 18:25.440
have issues counting and have issues keeping a schedule or keeping their temperament calm.

18:25.440 --> 18:31.240
The thing is, Harlow and the localizationists of that time had an understanding that was

18:31.240 --> 18:35.040
still pretty far from what we know now.

18:35.040 --> 18:42.040
You see, on the other side of Bigelow and the anti-localizationists were the phrenologists.

18:43.040 --> 18:49.400
Phrenology was an extremely popular scientific trend of the early 1800s.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.840
Today we know it to be pseudoscience.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.160
The idea was that different parts of your brain had different functions, which people

18:55.160 --> 18:59.520
mapped out with all these different terms, and that this is where it gets especially

18:59.520 --> 19:00.520
goofy.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.800
The shape of your head could determine which parts of your brain were more pronounced,

19:05.800 --> 19:12.000
and thus which personality aspects and brain strengths you had, and which parts were weaker.

19:12.160 --> 19:17.400
So if your brain was big on this side, then that meant you had, I don't know, better memory.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
Stuff like that.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.920
Via email, Mark Dingman from the YouTube channel NeuroscientificallyChallenged explained to

19:22.920 --> 19:28.240
me that although phrenology was pseudoscientific, Franz Gaul, who developed it, was an accomplished

19:28.240 --> 19:32.960
neuroscientist and his ideas that different parts of the brain might be involved in different

19:32.960 --> 19:35.000
functions was sound.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.320
So although phrenology eventually was dismissed, it helped generate ideas about localization

19:40.320 --> 19:41.840
that would persist.

19:41.840 --> 19:46.600
Gaul invented phrenology through a curiosity that people may act and think differently

19:46.600 --> 19:48.400
based on how they looked.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.840
In one of his early experiments, Gaul collected together a number of individuals of the lower

19:52.840 --> 19:58.440
classes of society, such as coachmen, servants, etc., and after gaining their confidence in

19:58.440 --> 20:03.200
giving them beer, wine, and money, encouraged them to talk about each other's good and

20:03.200 --> 20:06.800
bad qualities, in short, their striking characteristics.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.320
Their discussions soon narrowed to identifying those who were peaceable and those who provoked

20:11.320 --> 20:12.320
quarrels.

20:12.320 --> 20:17.000
Gaul then tried to identify the features of the heads that differentiated the two groups.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.840
I ranged the quarrel some on one side and the peaceable on the other and examined carefully

20:21.840 --> 20:23.360
the heads of both.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.440
I found that in all the former, the head, immediately behind and on a level with the

20:28.440 --> 20:32.680
top of the ears, was much broader than in the latter.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
Ah-ha!

20:33.680 --> 20:35.520
Cracked the case!

20:35.520 --> 20:41.240
John Martin Harlow was, if not a phrenologist himself, a phrenology sympathizer to say the

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
least.

20:42.240 --> 20:46.760
The term Nervo Billius, which Harlow used to describe Phineas Gage's new personality

20:46.760 --> 20:50.880
post-injury, was lifted directly from a phrenological doctrine.

20:50.880 --> 20:56.200
His account of Phineas being unable to value money properly linked with the idea that the

20:56.200 --> 21:00.120
injury had pierced his organ of veneration.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.720
Phrenology was hugely popular, like I said in the early 1800s, for a time.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.240
You could make substantial money as a medical professional or not even, going around to

21:09.240 --> 21:14.320
people and giving them advice on what they should do in big situations by looking at

21:14.320 --> 21:18.520
the shape of their head and saying, well, you might want to avoid this because your

21:18.520 --> 21:22.520
brain is like this and you might want to do this instead or you might want to work on

21:22.520 --> 21:24.760
this particular part of your brain.

21:24.760 --> 21:31.320
And as all popular sciences go, it was formed through and shaped by political motivations.

21:31.320 --> 21:36.640
Most infamously, phrenology was used to describe the inferiority of other races.

21:36.720 --> 21:43.040
A shocking twist for a practice based on judging how somebody thinks and acts based on how they look.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.640
At the same time, phrenology was actually practiced by people across political lines

21:47.640 --> 21:49.520
and across class lines.

21:49.520 --> 21:54.280
And it set a foundation for our understanding of the brain today, which I still don't know

21:54.280 --> 21:55.760
how to feel about that.

21:55.760 --> 22:00.600
It was phrenologists like Harlow who were basically right about how Gage was affected

22:00.600 --> 22:02.160
by his injury.

22:02.160 --> 22:06.240
Understanding that the prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain, although

22:06.320 --> 22:11.120
they didn't have that terminology necessarily and not as the anti-localizationist might

22:11.120 --> 22:16.160
have felt some sort of like neutral, non-active part of the brain that you could basically

22:16.160 --> 22:18.160
just like chop off if you needed to.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.680
We now know that the prefrontal cortex, as Dingman describes, is best known for its

22:21.680 --> 22:24.680
role in complex cognition and executive functions.

22:24.680 --> 22:30.200
But on both sides of this debate over the brain and on all the sides of these debates

22:30.200 --> 22:34.320
these days about our brain, we see a lot of dogma.

22:34.320 --> 22:38.960
When we talk about our prefrontal cortex and how they need to reach a certain age in order

22:38.960 --> 22:42.960
to finish cooking, we participate in pushing dogma.

22:42.960 --> 22:47.160
We resemble the anti-localizationists who think you can chop off a piece of your brain

22:47.160 --> 22:51.840
and basically be fine, or the phrenologists who think that the organ of veneration must

22:51.840 --> 22:54.880
enlarge in order for you to be better at counting money.

22:54.880 --> 23:01.520
And not only does this make us ignorant, it is, by and large, and as such, a process

23:01.520 --> 23:09.120
of trying to be determinative and naturalist, declaring the world to be dictated by obvious,

23:09.120 --> 23:15.520
simple, natural rules, and basically telling people who oppose us with facts and reason

23:15.520 --> 23:20.140
that they should argue with the science, because the science backs us up.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.760
But science doesn't work that way.

23:21.760 --> 23:27.400
It is hard enough to make scientific discoveries and find new scientific truths, which makes

23:27.400 --> 23:31.680
it all the more satisfying when we do find those, and all the more frustrating when our

23:31.680 --> 23:36.880
society seems to refuse to open itself up to these new knowledges.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.200
But maybe that's the point.

23:39.200 --> 23:43.600
Phrenology became popular not because of empirical evidence, but because of how it could offer

23:43.600 --> 23:46.600
a simple, compelling roadmap for people.

23:46.600 --> 23:51.160
If your head was a certain shape that didn't favor a certain trait, you could train it

23:51.160 --> 23:53.480
to make parts of your brain stronger.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.000
America Janic writes for The Atlantic that,

23:56.000 --> 24:00.640
One reason phrenology attracted so many followers was that it seemed to provide the toolbox

24:00.640 --> 24:02.520
for the American dream.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.880
All classes of society found much to admire in phrenology.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.200
The upper classes liked it because it reassured them, but the social hierarchy that placed

24:11.200 --> 24:13.280
them on top was natural.

24:13.280 --> 24:17.960
The emerging middle class and working classes liked it because its meritocratic message

24:17.960 --> 24:23.920
confirmed their hope of advancement through personal striving and self-improvement.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.440
Science has so much to offer us, but we only pay attention to it when it tells us what

24:28.440 --> 24:30.080
we want to hear.

24:30.080 --> 24:34.080
In today's day and age, we talk about the prefrontal cortex like it's some obvious

24:34.080 --> 24:36.480
natural explanation of our issues.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.720
If we're under 25 and struggling to get life together, maybe it's just because our brain

24:40.720 --> 24:42.160
isn't fully developed.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.800
It's easier to say that than to look at all the complicated confluences of culture,

24:46.920 --> 24:51.800
biology, politics, earth science and everything else and get a detailed understanding of our

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
lives.

24:52.800 --> 24:58.000
What really fascinates me though is why this is so popular in the first place.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.160
Wouldn't it be more pleasant to cling to simplistic neuroscience saying that young people are

25:03.160 --> 25:05.480
actually really smart?

25:05.480 --> 25:10.600
Wouldn't it be more inspiring to cling to stories of people healing their own brains

25:10.600 --> 25:13.200
even after injuring them severely?

25:13.200 --> 25:18.320
Why do we instead seem excited to call ourselves underdeveloped?

25:18.320 --> 25:25.320
Why do we seem so obsessed with the powerlessness of youth to be continued?
