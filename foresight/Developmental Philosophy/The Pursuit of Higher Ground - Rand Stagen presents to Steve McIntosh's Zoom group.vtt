WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
So should we just jump in?

00:02.920 --> 00:04.320
Raja, are we ready to go?

00:04.320 --> 00:05.320
Yeah, go for it.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.320
All right.

00:06.320 --> 00:11.840
So we've got an hour and 15 minutes together.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.000
We're going to make this as interactive as possible.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.600
I consider this a relatively small size group,

00:19.600 --> 00:21.480
so I think this is manageable.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.440
Less than 50 people on Zoom.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.080
I can see all your faces on one screen on my big monitor,

00:27.040 --> 00:30.560
and I'm looking forward to doing a couple things.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.080
Number one, I'm going to provide you

00:32.080 --> 00:35.560
a little bit of background upfront

00:35.560 --> 00:37.040
on the Stagan Leadership Academy,

00:37.040 --> 00:39.920
which we found it 25 years ago this year.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.720
And then I'm going to share with you a piece of content

00:45.720 --> 00:49.520
that we call the pursuit of higher ground,

00:49.520 --> 00:54.840
that is our most recent expression

00:54.840 --> 00:58.720
of how to translate developmental theory,

00:58.720 --> 01:03.360
integral theory, spiral dynamics, and complexity theory,

01:03.360 --> 01:05.360
for all intents and purposes, how

01:05.360 --> 01:11.080
to translate that into the listening of a broad audience

01:11.080 --> 01:15.040
from traditionalists to progressives.

01:15.040 --> 01:21.840
So this content can be delivered in as short as a 18-minute

01:21.840 --> 01:24.680
keynote speech in front of 1,000 people.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.840
I do this in large groups all the time.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.320
And the feedback that I have gotten in the last two years

01:32.320 --> 01:34.920
of let's just I'm still in the experimental phase

01:34.920 --> 01:39.280
with this material is incredibly positive across the board.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.800
And so rather than just share the content

01:42.800 --> 01:45.240
and treat you like a normal audience,

01:45.240 --> 01:48.560
I'm going to treat you as you are, your fellow travelers,

01:48.560 --> 01:51.920
where we're all students of integral theory,

01:51.920 --> 01:54.480
developmental theory, and I see this more

01:55.160 --> 01:57.160
as a peer group than anything else.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.200
So I'll present the material.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.920
I just have a handful of slides.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.680
And that'll be a little didactic, little presentation mode.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.800
And then we'll come out of that.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.080
And instead of waiting until the end of the call for Q&A,

02:10.080 --> 02:14.680
we'll actually start with the Q&A right after I clear the slides

02:14.680 --> 02:17.240
so that I can use your questions to continue

02:17.240 --> 02:19.200
sharing and presenting.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.840
I am not an academic.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.240
I am not a theorist.

02:23.240 --> 02:27.000
We've got the big brains on this call.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.720
Salisman is here and others.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.280
And we're practitioners, as Steve knows.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.360
Bert and I, Bert Parley, who was with Ken Wilbur,

02:35.360 --> 02:39.520
who I met through Ken Wilbur almost 22 years ago,

02:39.520 --> 02:44.280
we are in the arena working with leaders

02:44.280 --> 02:48.040
on a daily basis that are running organizations.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.120
We primarily work with privately held businesses

02:52.120 --> 02:55.240
and executives within those enterprises.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.600
And our sweet spot is the mid-market.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.520
And for people, what does that mean?

03:00.520 --> 03:03.520
That means companies with a couple hundred employees

03:03.520 --> 03:06.840
to a couple thousand employees, that sort of range.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.120
The reason that we don't work by design

03:09.120 --> 03:11.320
with large public companies

03:11.320 --> 03:14.600
is we will only work with an organization

03:14.600 --> 03:17.840
if the CEO of that organization

03:17.840 --> 03:21.240
is engaged in their own deep inner work.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.440
If they're not willing to actually look at themselves

03:24.440 --> 03:25.920
and work on themselves,

03:25.920 --> 03:29.080
we will not go into the organization

03:29.080 --> 03:30.400
to work with their people.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.520
So yes, we do work with some public companies.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.480
Many years of working with Whole Foods

03:36.480 --> 03:39.680
and working with John Mackey and his top 300 leaders

03:39.680 --> 03:42.800
were their partner for the sort of executive development there.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.600
But that is one of the few big known companies

03:45.600 --> 03:49.080
we work with because John is someone who's willing

03:49.080 --> 03:52.720
to walk the talk and actually work on himself.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.920
But that unfortunately is really rare

03:54.920 --> 03:59.680
with CEOs of typically large, 41,000 businesses.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.280
So that's a little context on who we are,

04:02.280 --> 04:06.680
what we're about, as Ken referred to us,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.760
had to have been almost maybe 17 or 18 years ago.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.480
They're the little experiment in Dallas,

04:12.480 --> 04:14.520
like what's going on in Dallas.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.920
And people will often say,

04:17.840 --> 04:19.720
you guys work with,

04:19.720 --> 04:23.160
we have a physical brick and mortar facility,

04:23.160 --> 04:24.880
a leadership academy in Dallas.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.320
We have our team,

04:26.320 --> 04:29.160
Bert and I just came out of our annual team retreat.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.400
We had 72, not the whole team, but 72 attendees there

04:32.400 --> 04:35.120
just to give you a sense of our size, our faculty.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.440
And as Rajeal said, we work with several thousand leaders

04:38.440 --> 04:41.080
each year across the country that either come to Dallas

04:41.080 --> 04:43.120
or we go to their organizations.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.120
And we are, people will say, why are you in Dallas?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.040
Like it makes no sense.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.480
You're working with Wilbur,

04:51.480 --> 04:52.880
you're working with Bob Keegan,

04:52.880 --> 04:54.200
you're working with Bill Torberts,

04:54.200 --> 04:56.920
who's on Cochlorida, cutting edge, integral theory.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.120
Like what are you doing in Dallas, Texas?

05:00.120 --> 05:04.640
And the answer is, this is where the work is, right?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.560
This is where the work is, this is where the need is.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.160
So we are in the heartland.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.160
We work extensively in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.680
We work in Oklahoma, Louisiana.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.440
We work really deeply in Kansas.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.800
We work in Ohio, in Illinois.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.360
We go down into Georgia.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.920
We really are in sort of the middle of the country

05:29.920 --> 05:32.440
and a little bit down into the Southeast.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.520
We are not heavily penetrated by design on the coast.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.800
Yes, we have clients in Seattle and New York

05:39.200 --> 05:43.440
and in California, but the mass focus for us

05:43.440 --> 05:45.840
has been heartland and I'll explain that

05:45.840 --> 05:47.520
after I clear the slides.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.480
So that's background context, a segmentation where we focus

05:51.480 --> 05:53.760
and we're not in the entertainment business.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.840
So we don't do any event-based training.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.760
Our shortest program for a new client is a 52 week

06:01.760 --> 06:04.480
practice-based, integrally informed program

06:04.480 --> 06:06.640
where they come to Dallas one day per quarter

06:06.640 --> 06:08.600
in a cohort of 20 liters.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.160
From anywhere in the country

06:10.160 --> 06:14.640
and we will only work with a client if the CEO goes first.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.800
So now let's get to the juicy part, get to the content.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.960
So I have been, along with my team,

06:23.920 --> 06:26.680
trying to figure out how to crack the code

06:26.680 --> 06:31.680
on a skillful means, on a translation of spiral dynamics.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.680
We started teaching our leaders, our clients, the spiral.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.040
And we basically did it as a developmental progression

06:40.040 --> 06:45.040
as it is laid out by Don Beck and by Claire Graves' research.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.880
And what would happen is the world views,

06:50.880 --> 06:54.440
the traditional world view, lower down,

06:54.440 --> 06:58.280
was very threatened by the hierarchical nature of the model.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.800
The achievers, the strive-drive kind of orange world view

07:03.760 --> 07:06.680
would look to figure out how they could

07:06.680 --> 07:08.880
sort of game and climb the ladder.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.840
So they just wanted us to click the slides faster

07:11.840 --> 07:14.400
so they could kind of move through the progression.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.240
The pluralists, the progressives,

07:17.240 --> 07:21.560
were incredibly offended by the hierarchical nature

07:21.560 --> 07:23.440
of what we were laying out.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.800
So after about five or six years,

07:25.800 --> 07:30.080
we moved from a vertical rendering

07:30.080 --> 07:34.720
and we presented picking four of the colors,

07:34.720 --> 07:37.280
red, blue, orange and green.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.800
And for those that don't know spiral dynamics,

07:39.800 --> 07:42.760
this sort of power mindset or power worldview,

07:42.760 --> 07:46.320
red, the more traditional worldview, blue,

07:46.320 --> 07:48.880
the more achiever worldview, orange,

07:48.880 --> 07:52.000
and the more progressive pluralistic worldview, green.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.880
And we basically laid them out

07:53.880 --> 07:57.120
as we're still doing today in our curriculum

07:57.120 --> 08:00.960
as a little bit more of a horizontal

08:00.960 --> 08:05.080
and saying that there's not one that's better than the other

08:05.080 --> 08:08.080
because in reality, one isn't better than the other.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.840
They all are appropriate in the appropriate context.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.360
And so what's the context is what's best?

08:14.360 --> 08:18.320
And so that has been, for some people in the integral community,

08:18.320 --> 08:19.800
that was blasphemy.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.440
Like how could you do that?

08:21.440 --> 08:25.360
How could you make this appear to be almost a type system?

08:25.360 --> 08:28.360
And the answer is we're meeting people where they are.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.480
We're not demanding that they meet us where we are

08:31.480 --> 08:35.480
because we're up in the ivory tower from their perspective.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.680
And so it's been an incredibly powerful

08:37.680 --> 08:41.160
and potent strategy, communication strategy

08:41.160 --> 08:44.160
because it works and it's getting people into the game

08:44.160 --> 08:47.480
of understanding the nuances of development.

08:47.480 --> 08:52.480
And then in 2021 with Steve as really a guide to me,

08:52.480 --> 08:56.480
he introduced in an article, this idea,

08:56.480 --> 08:58.480
it was just a sentence, right Steve?

08:58.480 --> 09:00.480
It was just a simple sentence saying,

09:00.480 --> 09:04.480
I no longer, I'm no longer believing that common ground

09:04.480 --> 09:06.480
is going to be the fullness of what we need.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
We need higher ground.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
We need more than just common ground.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.480
And I grabbed on that term and said,

09:12.480 --> 09:15.480
there's something really magical about this idea

09:15.480 --> 09:19.480
of higher ground and ultimately was able to build

09:19.480 --> 09:22.480
a new expression, which I'm about to share with you

09:22.480 --> 09:26.480
in the form of what is now a keynote presentation.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.480
I'm going to send Rigel the slides.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.480
It's a small, email-able PowerPoint file.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.480
So if you want to send it out to everybody

09:37.480 --> 09:40.480
in the spirit of abundance, everyone could have these slides.

09:40.480 --> 09:46.480
And so the move here was how can we actually

09:47.480 --> 09:52.480
put red to the side and really focus on the traditional,

09:55.480 --> 09:58.480
the achiever and the pluralist,

09:58.480 --> 10:02.480
that sort of blue, orange and green worldviews

10:02.480 --> 10:05.480
and bring in yellow in what I hope you will see

10:05.480 --> 10:10.480
as a very creative way of inviting people

10:10.480 --> 10:13.480
into a more of an integrated orientation.

10:14.480 --> 10:20.480
The title of this content is the pursuit of higher ground.

10:20.480 --> 10:25.480
And the word pursuit is incredibly precise

10:25.480 --> 10:29.480
because we don't want anyone to suggest,

10:29.480 --> 10:33.480
like to suggest themselves or to infer

10:33.480 --> 10:37.480
that we, an integral community, are up on higher ground

10:37.480 --> 10:41.480
and we're putting our hand down to help others come up to us.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.480
That would be unskillful and presumptive

10:45.480 --> 10:47.480
and it could come across as arrogant.

10:47.480 --> 10:52.480
And so the frame here is we are all in a place

10:52.480 --> 10:56.480
where we together can pursue higher ground,

10:56.480 --> 11:00.480
where we can all look at this slide in the pursuit of something

11:00.480 --> 11:04.480
and a dynamic journey towards something aspirational

11:04.480 --> 11:06.480
and something higher.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.480
And then this image here, as many of you know

11:11.480 --> 11:15.480
from Steve's book of developmental politics,

11:15.480 --> 11:19.480
how America can grow into a better version of itself.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.480
Right now, the version so many of us are experiencing

11:23.480 --> 11:27.480
is hyperpolarization, is this culture war,

11:27.480 --> 11:32.480
is this time in which people are experiencing

11:32.480 --> 11:36.480
incredible confusion and conflict and emotion

11:36.480 --> 11:39.480
and if we talk to the average American and ask them

11:39.480 --> 11:43.480
what's going on, they're likely going to say things like,

11:43.480 --> 11:48.480
well, we have issues with racial issues in America.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.480
We have issues with climate in America

11:51.480 --> 11:53.480
in which there are climate deniers

11:53.480 --> 11:57.480
and people who are not sensitive to what's going on.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.480
We have huge income inequality.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.480
We have all these issues.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.480
So pick them, race, climate, income inequality

12:06.480 --> 12:09.480
and what we would say from a developmental standpoint

12:09.480 --> 12:13.480
is that those are actually not the real issue.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.480
Those are the symptoms of the real issue.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.480
So if we were to go upstream of the polarization,

12:21.480 --> 12:24.480
we would assert that there's actually a conflict of world

12:24.480 --> 12:29.480
views that's showing up with those symptoms.

12:29.480 --> 12:34.480
And so the idea is to introduce

12:34.480 --> 12:39.480
that if we were walking down a street in a major city,

12:39.480 --> 12:44.480
we would be interpreting what was going on in the world.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.480
We would be relating with the world through the lens

12:49.480 --> 12:52.480
that we're wearing through our world views.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.480
And we invite, in this case, an audience

12:55.480 --> 12:58.480
to recognize that in many ways,

12:58.480 --> 13:01.480
we don't see the world as it is.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.480
We see the world as we are,

13:03.480 --> 13:06.480
which is a concept I think many of you are familiar with.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.480
We don't see the world as it is objectively.

13:09.480 --> 13:14.480
We are always filtering and we're always interpreting

13:14.480 --> 13:18.480
through the lens at which we're making meaning of the world

13:18.480 --> 13:21.480
and thus the idea of a world view.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.480
And so then we go in and say,

13:23.480 --> 13:24.480
and these are,

13:24.480 --> 13:26.480
I'm bringing you guys behind the curtain a little bit.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
I don't normally, you know,

13:27.480 --> 13:30.480
pause and offer up these nuances here,

13:30.480 --> 13:33.480
but please pay attention to the placement

13:33.480 --> 13:36.480
of where these colors are on the screen.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.480
So we start with introducing the idea

13:39.480 --> 13:44.480
that there are three dominant world views in America today,

13:44.480 --> 13:48.480
and we introduce this idea of an achiever world view.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.480
And we talk about how this would be your capitalist crowd,

13:52.480 --> 13:56.480
your business people, and with the achievers,

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
from this world view,

13:58.480 --> 14:01.480
there are a lot of healthy contributions that achievers

14:01.480 --> 14:05.480
have made and continue to make to America and to the world.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.480
And we talk about that as the light of the achiever world view,

14:09.480 --> 14:12.480
things like modern medicine

14:12.480 --> 14:14.480
and things like economic development.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.480
And yet, even though there are all these wonderful expressions

14:18.480 --> 14:21.480
and contributions from the achiever world view,

14:21.480 --> 14:24.480
where there is light, there is also shadow.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.480
There is pathology.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.480
There are these very destructive forces

14:29.480 --> 14:32.480
that come from the achiever world view.

14:32.480 --> 14:37.480
Things like greed and self-dealing and cronyism

14:37.480 --> 14:42.480
and regulatory capture of environmental destruction.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.480
And so it's this capacity to be able to recognize

14:46.480 --> 14:49.480
the light and the shadow,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.480
to be able to say, look at how long we are living

14:52.480 --> 14:57.480
relative to just 100 years ago thanks to modern medicine.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.480
Look at this incredible economic development

15:00.480 --> 15:03.480
that has allowed so much of humanity to flourish

15:03.480 --> 15:07.480
and coming out of poverty at a continued increasing rate.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.480
And yet, there are these shadows within the achiever world view.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.480
And then we introduce, notice it's on the right here.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.480
I don't normally say that.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.480
We introduce the traditional world view.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.480
And we say those who are operating with a traditional world view

15:26.480 --> 15:30.480
also have light and contributions.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.480
And the traditional world view brings us family values,

15:34.480 --> 15:38.480
brings us law and order, brings us structure,

15:38.480 --> 15:45.480
brings us so many elements of our society that keep order.

15:45.480 --> 15:50.480
And yet, there is a shadow of traditionalism.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.480
And traditionalist shadows can include things like bigotry

15:53.480 --> 15:58.480
or homophobia or racism, not at a systemic level,

15:58.480 --> 16:01.480
but at an individual level, like actual racism.

16:01.480 --> 16:06.480
There is a shadow here and things like anti-science.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.480
Not believing in science, which is in conflict

16:09.480 --> 16:13.480
with the achiever world view, which brings us science.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.480
And then lastly, we introduce this idea of the progressive world view.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.480
And the progressive world view has incredible contributions,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.480
a multicultural orientation,

16:25.480 --> 16:28.480
a recognition of previously marginalized communities,

16:28.480 --> 16:34.480
a ability to be incredibly sensitive to the earth

16:34.480 --> 16:37.480
and to the natural system and to the environment.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.480
And yet, where there is light, there is shadow.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.480
And in the shadow of progressivism,

16:43.480 --> 16:47.480
we see things like corrosive identity politics.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.480
And we also see cancel culture.

16:50.480 --> 16:57.480
And we see a form of DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion,

16:57.480 --> 17:02.480
a form of inclusion that says you are included

17:02.480 --> 17:06.480
as long as you see the world through a progressive lens.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.480
And so when I talk to my progressive friends

17:09.480 --> 17:14.480
and I talk about what's going on with diversity, equity and inclusion in America,

17:14.480 --> 17:18.480
they say we need to heal America, if you remember the prior slide.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.480
And I say, well, where are the people who voted for Donald Trump?

17:22.480 --> 17:27.480
And they're like, well, they're not welcome at this conversation, at this table,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
because they voted for Donald Trump.

17:29.480 --> 17:34.480
And there's such a contradiction there that we stand for inclusion,

17:34.480 --> 17:38.480
but there are conditions with that form of inclusion.

17:38.480 --> 17:46.480
And I want you all to know that I am terrified by the shadow of all three of these world views.

17:46.480 --> 17:55.480
The dark underbelly of all three are horrific in their most extreme expression.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.480
And I adore the healthy expression of all three.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.480
And so when people say, well, Rand, which one's better?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.480
The answer is it depends, right? It depends.

18:08.480 --> 18:15.480
And so now what happens in America, what is happening, and we all know this because we're living it every day,

18:15.480 --> 18:26.480
is we're seeing how the parts of our country that are struggling to make sense of what's happening,

18:26.480 --> 18:34.480
what they start to do is they start to look for a way to manage their own anxiety.

18:34.480 --> 18:43.480
And they start to look to see which of these camps, which of these world views most resonate with me.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.480
And we call this the easy button.

18:45.480 --> 18:53.480
And they punch the easy button and subordinate themselves to the narrative that most resonates with them.

18:53.480 --> 18:57.480
And to make things a little simpler, because we don't have a large amount of time tonight,

18:57.480 --> 19:02.480
I'm going to just go to the traditionalist on the right and the progressives on the left

19:02.480 --> 19:07.480
and say, OK, if I'm on the traditionalist on the right, it's Fox.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.480
And that's my news channel, and that's my echo chamber that I'm going to join.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.480
And I'm going to read magazines, and I'm going to read social media,

19:15.480 --> 19:20.480
and I'm going to subscribe to that channel, that camp.

19:20.480 --> 19:26.480
But if I'm on the progressive side, I'm on MSNBC, I'm on CNN, I'm on The View,

19:26.480 --> 19:35.480
and I'm going to actually start to subscribe to those parts of the world view echo chambers that most resonate with me.

19:35.480 --> 19:44.480
And the problem, and we all know this, is when we actually are in a traditionalist camp criticizing the progressives,

19:44.480 --> 19:52.480
what the traditionalist media is doing is they are amplifying the shadow of the progressives.

19:52.480 --> 19:57.480
And then what the progressive camps are doing in their expressions of media,

19:57.480 --> 20:01.480
and the monetization that comes from all of this with outrage,

20:01.480 --> 20:09.480
is that the progressives are amplifying, when they criticize the traditionalist, the shadows of the traditionalist.

20:09.480 --> 20:17.480
So what's happening is the worst of the other is being amplified and put forth as the other.

20:17.480 --> 20:23.480
And I want to say this again, the worst of the other is being put forth as the totality of the other,

20:23.480 --> 20:32.480
which actually leads Americans to believe that we are more divided than we actually are.

20:32.480 --> 20:41.480
I genuinely believe that we are being told that we're divided at a level that's not,

20:41.480 --> 20:47.480
at least my direct experience on the ground, navigating all three of these camps on a regular basis.

20:47.480 --> 20:53.480
And so what do we do? What is the path forward?

20:53.480 --> 21:00.480
And so I want, for those of you who know the idea of the dialectic, I want to introduce that here,

21:00.480 --> 21:04.480
because it's very useful and it's also very accessible.

21:04.480 --> 21:12.480
So the dialectic would say that there's a thesis and there's an antithesis to that thesis.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.480
So thesis and antithesis.

21:15.480 --> 21:24.480
And then from the thesis and antithesis, we actually have a synthesis that emerges above that, a higher order synthesis.

21:24.480 --> 21:29.480
And so when we take the traditionalists with part of the achiever on the right,

21:29.480 --> 21:35.480
and let's hold them out as the thesis of American exceptionalism, and these are people,

21:35.480 --> 21:43.480
and Steve really gave me this particular language, these are people who want to protect what's right with America.

21:43.480 --> 21:48.480
And then on the left, the progressives and sort of part of the achiever group also,

21:48.480 --> 21:54.480
that is a group that wants to actually fix what's wrong with America.

21:54.480 --> 22:00.480
And so we have this incredible conflict between those who want to protect what's right

22:00.480 --> 22:07.480
and those who want to fix what's wrong with America, and they're banging into each other like tectonic plates.

22:07.480 --> 22:15.480
And when we ask ourselves which one of these groups is, quote, right, the answer is they're both partially right.

22:15.480 --> 22:24.480
And when I'm with an audience, I will literally say, if you feel like there are things that we need to protect about America,

22:24.480 --> 22:28.480
raise your hand, and in almost every room, all the hands go up.

22:28.480 --> 22:35.480
And then I say, if you think that there are things that we need to fix, things that are wrong with America,

22:35.480 --> 22:38.480
raise your hand, almost all the hands go up.

22:38.480 --> 22:43.480
It's not half and half, almost everyone can relate with both of these orientations.

22:43.480 --> 22:53.480
And so then what we say is, if we want to move to a higher order synthesis, we are not going to get there simply by finding common ground.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.480
We need common ground.

22:55.480 --> 23:01.480
We need compromise, which we're not seeing much of these days in our politicians.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.480
So I don't want to marginalize common ground.

23:04.480 --> 23:11.480
But as Wilbur would say, common ground is necessary, but not sufficient.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.480
It's not going to get us where we need to go.

23:14.480 --> 23:20.480
So I want you guys to imagine that we find a common ground among these three world views.

23:20.480 --> 23:30.480
And we were able to use that common ground as a solid ground from which to move upwards so that we can actually move to what we really need,

23:30.480 --> 23:33.480
which is a higher ground synthesis and integration.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.480
And so here we go to finish out the slides and then we can get into Q&A.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
So higher ground.

23:39.480 --> 23:50.480
And now we're going to say at higher ground, we're going to do everything we can to actually leave behind the shadows.

23:50.480 --> 24:08.480
We're not going to be able to leave all of it behind, but we're going to try to limit the shadows of all three and then take the unique contributions, the light of all three and move those into an integrated in synthesized orientation.

24:08.480 --> 24:17.480
And notice, once again, I don't normally say this, bringing the light of the three world views up to higher ground and making yellow,

24:17.480 --> 24:26.480
which most audiences see as a sun happens to coincide with yellow and spiral dynamics as something that just worked out in a beautiful,

24:26.480 --> 24:32.480
almost unintentional way when this was first being created as a body of content.

24:32.480 --> 24:42.480
And so then what we say is what we need to recognize is that people think this is idealistic.

24:42.480 --> 24:49.480
They think that, you know, Rand, you know, what you're trying to bring everyone with you, what about the bad actors?

24:49.480 --> 25:01.480
And what we say is, you know, don't throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater and don't conflate the shadow behaviors of all three of these world views with the human beings.

25:01.480 --> 25:13.480
We want to imagine a circle of compassion, a circle of inclusion, and we want to imagine at higher ground that no one is standing outside that circle.

25:13.480 --> 25:21.480
So we want to be inclusive of the human beings, but we do not want to be inclusive of the pathological behaviors.

25:22.480 --> 25:31.480
And there are a tremendous number of behaviors that are happening right now that we do not want to tolerate.

25:31.480 --> 25:37.480
We want to be intolerant of the pathology, but we don't want to throw out the human being.

25:37.480 --> 25:44.480
And the example I give when people want an illustration, I say, imagine when Pope John Paul was shot,

25:44.480 --> 25:49.480
and we may all remember that experience of watching him almost be killed.

25:49.480 --> 25:57.480
After he healed, he went in and visited with the prisoner who had been captured, his would-be assassin.

25:57.480 --> 26:02.480
And I want you guys to imagine, you might remember in Life Magazine, the cover of Life Magazine,

26:02.480 --> 26:11.480
when the Pope was sitting in the corner with no shackles on the would-be assassin holding his hands forgiving him.

26:11.480 --> 26:20.480
And so after he forgave his assassin and he went outside of the jail, the Pope did not say to the jailers,

26:20.480 --> 26:23.480
now that I've forgiven him, you need to let him out of prison.

26:23.480 --> 26:29.480
He said, I have forgiven him as a child of God, but he needs to stay in prison.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.480
And that is an example of discernment.

26:33.480 --> 26:42.480
So we can be non-judgmental of the spirit, but we can still have discernment for the consequences of the behavior

26:42.480 --> 26:48.480
and for the potential risk that he poses to himself or to society if he weren't in prison.

26:48.480 --> 26:56.480
So this move from the lower level to the higher level is really a move out of being judgmental

26:57.480 --> 27:05.480
and still maintaining our discernment with boundaries as we move to higher ground, which can be a very fierce place.

27:05.480 --> 27:16.480
People think, yes, the Rumi quote, which is beautiful and inspiring, there's a field at higher ground.

27:16.480 --> 27:23.480
And beyond right doing, beyond wrong doing, there is this field, I'll meet you there.

27:23.480 --> 27:29.480
There's a lot of beautiful poetry about the idea of higher ground and there's an end here.

27:29.480 --> 27:35.480
There needs to also be a fierceness and a responsibility of leaders at higher ground

27:35.480 --> 27:41.480
to actually make choices in service of the whole, in service of the system

27:41.480 --> 27:48.480
to recognize that the system is held together, especially with very healthy blue

27:48.480 --> 27:56.480
and when green wants to dismantle and completely eliminate blue, defund the police,

27:56.480 --> 28:05.480
pick your attack on blue from green, that actually is incredibly threatening to the stability for all of us and for all of this.

28:05.480 --> 28:14.480
And so, and by the way, when orange wants to exploit what's going on with the economics of outrage,

28:14.480 --> 28:22.480
that shadow and orange is actually fueling our polarization because the amount of money that Facebook and social media companies are making off of the outrage.

28:22.480 --> 28:30.480
Oh, and let's not forget about blue because blue has all sorts of intolerance that also need to be recognized.

28:30.480 --> 28:40.480
And so this move here is a move to recognizing that in many ways we have always had a rich diversity in America.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.480
And this is the last slide.

28:43.480 --> 28:51.480
And most of you know our motto as a country, e pluribus unum out of many one out of the diversity.

28:51.480 --> 28:55.480
There is a unity out of this incredible complexity.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.480
There is a diversity.

28:57.480 --> 29:12.480
So there is a there is a tremendous wisdom that exists at the base at the foundation of the United States that we actually are going at stake and we're going back to to renew ourselves to revitalize and to reconnect.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.480
And so that's a little peek into some content.

29:16.480 --> 29:35.480
And this isn't being delivered to academics this is being delivered to pedestrians to people who are struggling day in and day out, and our one prescription, when people say, what can I do, what can I do, and what can I do that's actionable.

29:35.480 --> 29:42.480
And my answer is break bread with people who you would normally never break bread with.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
Go and have a dinner.

29:44.480 --> 29:59.480
Go drink some wine and sit for three hours with people who are on the other side of the aisle from you, and actually see that you have much more in common than you than you might imagine.

29:59.480 --> 30:11.480
And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get more and more, not just of our clients, but anyone that we touch to start getting into dialogue and start getting to discussion with a greater diversity.

30:11.480 --> 30:28.480
And I'll tell you, I mean, I am in the green world all the time. I'm in the orange world every day. I'm in the blue world all the time from being at dinner with people in Alabama and places like that on a regular basis to being in Boulder to being in Seattle with progressives.

30:28.480 --> 30:39.480
And so as I learned to navigate these different territories, what I find is people are very open, but they have to actually be met where they are.

30:39.480 --> 30:49.480
And it's a long road ahead. Someone said to me recently, don't worry, Rand, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

30:49.480 --> 31:05.480
And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true. Things are probably in the next decade going to get, maybe next two decades, going to get much worse, which is why we need more people stepping into responsibility to be a part of the solution.

31:05.480 --> 31:18.480
And this is really hard work and diversity, equity and inclusion. Unfortunately, the DEI community is not positioned, in my opinion, just to be provocative. They are not positioned to be helpful.

31:18.480 --> 31:29.480
I talk to CEOs and board members every day. Big companies that are my friends that I don't work with as clients that run Fortune 1000 companies and talking to them all the time.

31:29.480 --> 31:44.480
They are not, the CEOs and the boards are not doing the work that's necessary to create a more inclusive organization, an organization with healthier forms of belonging.

31:44.480 --> 31:53.480
They aren't doing it because they're outsourcing it to the DEI experts. And you can't outsource this. You can outsource a lot of stuff, but not adaptive change.

31:53.480 --> 32:04.480
And until the DEI community actually gets the executive team, the CEO and the board to start to walk the talk on this, it's going to be a bunch of bullshit and a big charade is what it's going to be.

32:04.480 --> 32:18.480
And guess what? What camp is the DEI community in? And we all know the answer, the green camp. It's the progressive camp. I love the camp, the progressive camp.

32:18.480 --> 32:36.480
I love the light of progressivism. And I also love the light of traditionalism and I also love the light of the achiever worldview. And people will say to me, Rand, this comes from Bert, Rand, are you a conservative?

32:36.480 --> 32:55.480
And my answer is not merely, well, Rand, that's confusing. Are you a progressive? Not merely, at least, but not merely. And because I actually identify with the healthy expressions of all three of these worldviews.

32:55.480 --> 33:08.480
But the DEI community, the practitioners, the consultants, they're so well-intentioned. They are coming from a green place and they, I talk to these people also. Some of them are friends.

33:08.480 --> 33:19.480
And they say to me, I cannot, out of my own consciousness, I just cannot work with people who are going to vote for Donald Trump.

33:19.480 --> 33:31.480
Okay. Okay. So you're going to exclude half the country. So you're going to stand for healing America with half the country and the other half the country of the deplorables.

33:31.480 --> 33:42.480
We're just going to leave them out. So how are we supposed to move forward? We will only move forward when we have, dare I say, an integral approach to diversity and inclusion.

33:42.480 --> 34:06.480
We'll have to drop the E, because the E is equity, and equity has become a part of the culture war, and it has been, it's no longer effective. It has to be gone, because the far right and the right have said equity equals a quality of outcomes and socialism.

34:06.480 --> 34:18.480
So we can't be asking the right of America to be stepping into equity when that word has already been defined and there's no going back. But we can save diversity and inclusion, for sure.

34:18.480 --> 34:27.480
And we need diversity and inclusion. But we also have to recognize that the E of equity is radioactive now.

34:28.480 --> 34:42.480
So let's rumble, people. Charlie's here. Let's do it. Let's get into some Q&A and let's get juicy and provocative and let's challenge each other.

34:42.480 --> 34:57.480
And let's actually do what a classical liberal group would want to do. Let's offer up respectfully points of view that actually are challenging to each other so that we're not all just saying the same thing.

34:57.480 --> 35:03.480
So, Mary, you're up first and then we're going to go to Michael and then Trudy.

35:03.480 --> 35:10.480
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, wherever you are.

35:10.480 --> 35:20.480
Rand, thank you. This is a very validating, brilliant introduction and context setting you've given us.

35:20.480 --> 35:37.480
I am personally continuously tortured by this idea that we have to choose sides, jump into a bucket, jump into a very lean and shallow definition of sides, by the way.

35:37.480 --> 35:52.480
So it's like nobody wants to deal with the complexity, the deep, rich, multi-layered facets of these kind of situations, conditions, states of mind, mindsets, etc.

35:52.480 --> 36:16.480
And dealing with nuance, it's like I don't think most people in our society even contemplate that we are skimming on the top of the surface as we default and follow the mobs and the voices and the media.

36:16.480 --> 36:27.480
We lack the ability to absorb and discuss the layers, the nuance and the complexity of what's really going on.

36:27.480 --> 36:36.480
And I continuously hear this term discernment being so important. I completely agree with it.

36:36.480 --> 36:50.480
What struck me as you were talking is that most people have no idea what it means to have discernment and that what's lacking is some sort of instruction.

36:50.480 --> 37:14.480
Awareness piece broadly and scalably available to people about what we mean when we talk about discernment and nuance. And the last thing I'll say is the Rumi quote, which, again, Rumi, that Rumi quote and all Rumi poetry is being spread widely.

37:14.480 --> 37:28.480
But do people really understand, they feel intuitively a sense of that quote that you out beyond all ideas of right doing and wandering there is a space, I will meet you there.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.480
Yep.

37:29.480 --> 37:41.480
I feel the essence of that because it's pure, but do they know what that means on a deeper level and they do they know how to create the conditions that will allow them to play in that space.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.480
I think that's a big missing piece for a lot of people.

37:44.480 --> 37:59.480
Because you hit a lot and I want to appreciate several things that you just shared and offer up a couple of a couple of responses. So, at the highest level complexity has a PR problem.

37:59.480 --> 38:14.480
You guys get that? Okay, like complexity has a PR problem because nuance and the capacity to actually have the kind of discernment that Mary's talking about requires development.

38:14.480 --> 38:26.480
So development in developing our capacity to have a more nuanced and complex way of relating with the world is a really long and hard journey.

38:26.480 --> 38:35.480
And it takes, we work with clients for private businesses where we work with the owners of the businesses for not just a year or two years or three years.

38:35.480 --> 38:43.480
We have many, many, many clients that we worked with for 10, 15, 20 years continuously.

38:43.480 --> 38:49.480
And so we know that development is hard and it takes a long time.

38:49.480 --> 38:55.480
But the problem is that I just got an email from a DEI consultant in New York.

38:55.480 --> 39:02.480
And the headline was 90 minutes to increasing trust in the context of diversity and inclusion.

39:02.480 --> 39:10.480
Because what's happening is that the corporations are demanding these sprints. You got to go faster. You got to teach people quicker.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.480
And once again, I'm sorry, but it's just bullshit.

39:13.480 --> 39:24.480
It's a charade and people are pretending that they're actually doing development when they're not doing much more than provoking some new ideas and entertaining people.

39:24.480 --> 39:30.480
Now, there's nothing wrong with going to the movies and being entertained, but let's not hold that out as development.

39:30.480 --> 39:36.480
How many of you remember James Carville in the Democratic, in the Clinton era?

39:36.480 --> 39:43.480
He said, it's the economy stupid. Raise your physical hands. You remember that? Okay. A lot of people remember that. It's the economy stupid.

39:43.480 --> 39:52.480
Here's what we have to say about the polarization in America, the race topic just being one of them. It's development stupid.

39:52.480 --> 40:01.480
That's it. It's development. We don't have an appetite to actually do the work.

40:01.480 --> 40:07.480
And so we are stagging. We are very unpopular with public companies, which is wonderful.

40:07.480 --> 40:12.480
And I'm so thankful for my team and my clients over decades of doing this work.

40:12.480 --> 40:31.480
We have a very strong reputation in corporate America, in the pockets that we have a presence, and we have to turn away opportunities every week because we will not work with an organization if their CEO is not doing his or her own work.

40:31.480 --> 40:43.480
And I'm not, that's why I say probably a couple more decades of it's going to get worse because there's just the appetite to do what Mary's pointing to is really, really rare.

40:43.480 --> 40:48.480
All right, Michael, and then Trudy, Michael Abramson.

40:49.480 --> 41:01.480
Hi, Rand. I like very much all that you presented, and it resonates with my understanding of this.

41:01.480 --> 41:11.480
But my question to you is that my impression that your academy, you mostly focus on business world, on corporate world.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.480
Correct.

41:12.480 --> 41:21.480
But a lot of controversies around this DEI, they are coming from universities, they are coming from the government.

41:21.480 --> 41:33.480
So are you trying to do something with them? And what is generally your take on this? What is going on at universities?

41:33.480 --> 41:46.480
And also in the media, which in theory, they should be like objective and biased, but in practice, it's very rare.

41:46.480 --> 41:50.480
So I'd like to hear your thoughts about this.

41:50.480 --> 41:58.480
Well, I mean, I think for those of us that are students of integral theory, what's playing out in universities is exactly what we would expect is playing out.

41:58.480 --> 42:05.480
I think Ken Wilber talked about this as the Mean Green meme 20 years ago, and it's just coming on full force.

42:05.480 --> 42:24.480
So so much of this is what we would expect would be happening as more and more of a progressive worldview is coming online as expressed, especially in a younger generation in which they're being indoctrinated into an academic world,

42:25.480 --> 42:37.480
where the especially in the liberal arts side of the Academy, where there is a bias to a progressive worldview.

42:37.480 --> 42:52.480
And we all know the statistics on this, that at 90% or more of faculty within our universities across the entire country, sometimes it's 95, 98% identify as being on the left, politically.

42:52.480 --> 42:56.480
So we don't actually have a good balance in our own faculty.

42:56.480 --> 42:59.480
And so then what would we expect happens to the students.

42:59.480 --> 43:07.480
And so I think, you know, that question of what is going on at universities, I might give Steve a chance when he talks here at a moment to speak to that.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.480
I want to really talk about our direct experience.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.480
And yes, we work mostly with business leaders.

43:13.480 --> 43:21.480
We do work with leaders of institutions, nonprofits, we have had chancellors of universities go through our programs.

43:21.480 --> 43:36.480
We have had many leaders of large religious organizations, mega churches, a variety of different domination denominations, priests, bishops with a Catholic bishops, Episcopal bishops that have large regions.

43:36.480 --> 43:42.480
So we work, we work with the leaders are and where the appetite is to make a difference.

43:42.480 --> 44:00.480
But we do have a bias of working with the money, the power, because the way that we're going to change universities, you know, one way we're going to change universities is by getting pressure from the alumni who are going to make demands of what is going to need to be

44:00.480 --> 44:03.480
changed if they're going to continue to make donations.

44:03.480 --> 44:11.480
And so Stagen, we've just picked one part, which is where, where, where capital is where the money is.

44:11.480 --> 44:15.480
But there's a lot of important work that's going on in all parts of the system.

44:15.480 --> 44:24.480
So Trudy, and that I love you guys to also like try to integrate in a little bit what other people are asking like, Hey, I appreciate it that and I want to integrate that into what I'm saying.

44:24.480 --> 44:31.480
So it gets a little bit more dialogue, which is, you know, which is hard, but we can try. So true to Europe.

44:31.480 --> 44:36.480
Yeah, actually, you kind of answered that question already.

44:36.480 --> 44:51.480
I was going to ask how well this is how well is this received in the organizations that you have taught it. And what's the result when you're following up with them.

44:51.480 --> 45:03.480
Are they using these principles? Has it changed their organization in some way? Have they found better ways of working together?

45:03.480 --> 45:08.480
So if address that a little bit, if you would.

45:08.480 --> 45:10.480
Yeah, yeah, the.

45:10.480 --> 45:19.480
So, I don't want to make this about any one topic, you know, diversity and inclusion is a topic. Climate change is a topic.

45:19.480 --> 45:29.480
What what we find Trudy is when we work with a CEO of an organization or a leader of an organization could be a nonprofit.

45:29.480 --> 45:34.480
And that leader spends a year working on herself.

45:34.480 --> 45:47.480
And as a result of working on herself will more self awareness, a capacity to recognize the wake that is behind all of her decisions.

45:47.480 --> 45:55.480
We help our leaders realize that when we make a choice, that choice is consequential.

45:55.480 --> 46:03.480
I was talking to a leader a few days ago who runs an organization in Georgia, a relatively large family business, thousands of employees.

46:03.480 --> 46:12.480
And we were talking about what he would what he had just communicated to his executive team and to the top, let's say 100 leaders in his business.

46:12.480 --> 46:21.480
He had sent an email and he realized in the conversation with me that the email was unnecessarily critical and harsh in its tone.

46:21.480 --> 46:33.480
And that he likely got the short term result that he wanted at the expense of long term undermining of trust within the top tier of his organization.

46:33.480 --> 46:42.480
And so what we're trying to do with leaders is to help them realize, as we become more aware, we can actually choose differently.

46:42.480 --> 46:57.480
Because with awareness and choice comes a responsibility to recognize that every decision, especially when you're higher up in organizational life, the the consequence of those decisions ripple out like the wake of a boat.

46:57.480 --> 47:09.480
And and what what's so cool about development and consciousness complexity is that as a leader becomes better at that current level.

47:09.480 --> 47:14.480
That's skill development, knowledge acquisition.

47:14.480 --> 47:21.480
It increases the likelihood that they can actually go vertical in their own vertical the elevated development.

47:21.480 --> 47:35.480
However, when they move up, they're going to relate with relationships in a more complex nuanced ways, which means they're going to relate with the topic of diversity, equity inclusion, a more nuanced way.

47:35.480 --> 47:40.480
And so we don't have to be DEI consultants or trainers.

47:40.480 --> 47:47.480
We just have to continue to focus on human development, because as a human develops to higher levels.

47:47.480 --> 47:57.480
They're actually that person is going to relate with and make decisions across a broad spectrum of topics that are going to be informed from a more complex operating system.

47:57.480 --> 48:01.480
And so that's the work is just its development, its development.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.480
How long is this going to take generations.

48:04.480 --> 48:07.480
Brand that's not very inspiring.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.480
Well, it's going to take generations.

48:10.480 --> 48:23.480
It's going to take people thinking not in years anymore, we can't have our leaders continuing to be in this pathological short termism of America, that everything is now now now now now.

48:23.480 --> 48:31.480
What we realize is leaders have to start to recognize what is the progress that we can make in 10 year increments.

48:31.480 --> 48:43.480
Our clients love the Bill Gates quote, and Bill Gates said, most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.

48:43.480 --> 48:47.480
And so we say to our clients, how might you be underestimating yourself?

48:47.480 --> 48:58.480
What could you do if you started expanding your sense of time and started looking at the progress and look at the long arc of progress.

48:58.480 --> 49:07.480
And yes, there's suffering going on in the world, but relative to 100 years ago and 200 years ago, there's a lot less suffering.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.480
So let's put that into context and perspective.

49:10.480 --> 49:18.480
And when we get leaders who are able to just peek into more of an integral view, they're able to hold that.

49:18.480 --> 49:28.480
But when they're in the lower levels, and as we all know, even though I talked about the great diversity between the traditionalist, the achievers and the progressives.

49:28.480 --> 49:36.480
The one thing all three of those worldviews have in common as integral theory teaches us is they think their worldview is the right worldview.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.480
Steve knows that we all know this.

49:38.480 --> 49:43.480
All three of these worldviews think their worldview is the right worldview.

49:43.480 --> 49:47.480
That's their commonality among all the other diversity.

49:47.480 --> 49:59.480
And so this is just more reason that we've got to have more of a commitment to a higher and more elevated development.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.480
Barbara Brown, take yourself off mute.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.480
What do you got?

50:03.480 --> 50:15.480
You know, you mentioned working in my over country where I live to and not so much on the coast.

50:15.480 --> 50:27.480
Do you think a developmental reason or a sociological reason why this works better in middle America than it does on the coast just out of periodicity?

50:27.480 --> 50:29.480
Yeah, it's a great question.

50:29.480 --> 50:36.480
So it's counterintuitive to a lot of people, especially integral students.

50:36.480 --> 50:56.480
What we have found, we've been out there for decades, what we have found is that when we meet a leader from Kansas City, Kansas, who may have grown up there, gone to school somewhere else, and then come back home to raise their family.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.480
And these are people who might have gone to universities on the coast.

50:59.480 --> 51:12.480
They might have gone to a Harvard or they might have gone to a UCLA, but they go back home and they feel a sense of community with Kansas.

51:12.480 --> 51:24.480
And then we show up and we say, we want to work with you through many decades to actually become a more conscious leader, conscious development.

51:24.480 --> 51:32.480
So that we can help you be of service to your stakeholders, to your customers, to your employees and to your community.

51:32.480 --> 51:49.480
They have our clients have almost an inherent blue, like access to healthy blue traditionalism that has them deeply connecting to stakeholder theory and to stakeholder management and to the principles of conscious capitalism.

51:49.480 --> 52:01.480
And I'm being a little, this is a little bit of an exaggeration, but when we meet people in New York and people in, especially in like San Francisco, and we asked them what their relationship is with the community.

52:01.480 --> 52:06.480
It's almost, there's no geographic, they're not tethered.

52:06.480 --> 52:14.480
There's this orange opportunistic, I want to get mine, I want to grow my company, and then we talk about Time Horizon.

52:14.480 --> 52:23.480
And we say, what's your Time Horizon? And so much of what's happening on the coast is about the, I want to get rich in five to seven years.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.480
We don't work with private equity.

52:25.480 --> 52:30.480
We don't, none of the short term capital is works with our model.

52:30.480 --> 52:41.480
And so that would be my answer is that there's this healthy community orientation and it just seems like, why do you call it stakeholder theory?

52:41.480 --> 52:48.480
It just seems like that's the right thing to do. You take care of your employees and your employees will take care of you.

52:48.480 --> 52:52.480
You take care of your customers and your customers will stay loyal.

52:52.480 --> 53:04.480
You take care of your vendors and make sure that they can make enough money, even though you have to, you know, you have to negotiate, but you don't want to, you know, squeeze them so hard that they can't continue to supply you because then that hurts you long term.

53:05.480 --> 53:14.480
These things that seem so sophisticated in their language, the Heartland often says, that just seems like the right way to do business.

53:14.480 --> 53:18.480
If that makes sense to you guys, like this is just once again our experience.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
Okay, David.

53:19.480 --> 53:25.480
The other thing I see there ran is less content for the working class.

53:25.480 --> 53:30.480
I mean, I was on a call a couple weeks ago where somebody studied all seriousness.

53:30.480 --> 53:38.480
How do we stop working class folks from voting because they are so ignorant they can't make good political decisions.

53:38.480 --> 53:41.480
And I mean, I'm just OMG, right?

53:41.480 --> 53:43.480
I don't even know what to say to that.

53:43.480 --> 53:55.480
And even when people disagree, they're still in a lot of that Heartland, there's that sense of civility that's required.

53:55.480 --> 54:02.480
And there's the sense that, you know, you just don't treat people badly.

54:02.480 --> 54:12.480
And I hate to say it about a lot of the progressive left, but, you know, they'll treat anybody badly if they don't agree with them.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.480
And that's pretty pathetic.

54:14.480 --> 54:17.480
Yeah, and Barbara, I want to share something then to let David come in.

54:17.480 --> 54:30.480
And Steve really worked with me and really helped me along with Bert and Jeff because we had several years during the pandemic that we were supporting each other on Zoom and we were sort of locked in our houses.

54:30.480 --> 54:38.480
And what I used to assume is that I held the spiral in my mind.

54:38.480 --> 54:46.480
And I was like, we have to see individuals in our country go to green so they can go to yellow so they can go to integral.

54:46.480 --> 55:06.480
And what Steve helped me to realize is because there is so much progressive pluralistic green at a societal and Wilbur's quadrants lower left space in the culture of America, because we have been shaped and we have been exposed to so much of that,

55:07.480 --> 55:29.480
those means, those value systems, that people who are at an individual level, their interior structure being more orange blue, or maybe even blue orange, if you think primary and secondary, that they have enough exposure to the green to be able to actually make a move up to integral.

55:29.480 --> 55:41.480
And so we're actually saying, you know, the assumption that I had for years was we could the only people we can work with are people who are already progressive who want to go post progressive.

55:41.480 --> 55:53.480
And that's not our experience. Now our experience is we're working with Heartland achievers who are Christians who have strong faith and they're reading Ken Wilbur.

55:53.480 --> 56:11.480
And they're like, we're going to build an integral company, because they also have a multicultural sensibility, because they also are able to feel into the healthy parts of green to a to enough of a degree, but they don't want to live there.

56:12.480 --> 56:28.480
They want to appreciate the parts that are that are healthy for them, and they want to keep their faith if they're faith based, and not all of our clients are faith based, but many of them are, and they also want to be able to maintain their healthy orange their healthy achievement.

56:28.480 --> 56:44.480
And so we're in a we're in an experiment of moving people up the spiral to towards yellow towards an integrated view, even though it doesn't look like a typical, you know, progressive that's ready to pop to yellow.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.480
So David you're up.

56:47.480 --> 56:52.480
All right. Thank you, Rand. This is, this is so stimulating.

56:52.480 --> 57:11.480
So my own sense as kind of an outsider to the business world is that a lot of the di stuff is people using green language, but coming from a sort of blue absolutistic altitude, where you know we have the truth, almost authoritarian.

57:11.480 --> 57:30.480
So I'm curious to hear in your experience, what percentage of it is that, if that's right. And then how do you work with leaders to try and make fine grain distinctions, so that they're not sort of dismissing all of progressivism as just this,

57:30.480 --> 57:40.480
sort of absolutistic because from an orange perspective, they'd be correctly seeing that as, you know, regressive and sort of a drag.

57:40.480 --> 57:49.480
So yeah, I'm curious to hear your thoughts about how you help leaders think through the dynamics, the complicated dynamics between these, these different worldviews.

57:49.480 --> 57:58.480
Well, I mean, there's no easy answer for that. The first thing we do is just help leaders to recognize that these worldviews exist.

57:58.480 --> 58:09.480
Because so many of our clients have never really thought about this. They're, they're, they make these assumptions that, you know, everybody's making meaning the way I'm making meaning.

58:09.480 --> 58:19.480
And so by just starting with the fact that there are distinctions, our clients are like smoke comes out their ears, and then to bring in the light and shadow.

58:19.480 --> 58:34.480
Oh, so I don't have to conflate the shadow with the person or the shadow of that, of that, of everyone in that worldview, that everybody is like the shadow because they're not.

58:34.480 --> 58:45.480
And we get them to take responsibility that there's a shadow where they stand. And we have to have them do a self assessment of where is the shadow of my own worldview.

58:45.480 --> 58:56.480
And so David with that, what that does is that's destabilizing enough just to start to get them to start groping into a more nuanced and complex set of questions.

58:56.480 --> 59:01.480
And we often are, and I'll use a rubber band here.

59:01.480 --> 59:04.480
Our clients and the leaders we work with.

59:04.480 --> 59:09.480
But our problem solvers. So when they experience tension.

59:09.480 --> 59:12.480
Their assumption is that's a problem to be solved.

59:12.480 --> 59:21.480
I got to solve that one of the ways that you actually get rid of tension is the denial or the avoiding of the conflict.

59:21.480 --> 59:29.480
And so we work with our clients to build a new relationship with tension where they can actually be in a creative tension.

59:29.480 --> 59:36.480
And we help them understand that, yes, there's destructive tension if I pulled too hard on this, the rubber band would break.

59:36.480 --> 59:46.480
But if I bring the enough tension where I have energy, there's energy for transformation and change that the generative process of development requires energy.

59:46.480 --> 59:51.480
And we help our clients to realize, maybe I need to build a new relationship with tension itself.

59:51.480 --> 59:57.480
And maybe when I'm in the presence, like I will, I will, I will reveal a couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech.

59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.480
It was a higher ground speech very similar to the slides you just saw.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:07.480
It got a standing ovation, which my ego loves. Okay. And I'm still, I'm still in my own work.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:17.480
The reason I know how far I have to go is that when I get a standing ovation, I actually get a hit of like, like, oh, validation.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.480
And when people are not that enthusiastic after my speech, I actually feel like I want validation.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:32.480
So I know I'm still, I'm still, I'm still far from, you know, being high up on the developmental progression because I get these clues.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:41.480
And, but, but my, my assumption was the speech was well received to women came up to me after the speech because I asked for feedback.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.480
I said, if you have feedback, please come find me.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.480
I'd love feedback and especially, especially feedback that is critical of my presentation.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:57.480
And these were two black women who were so courageous and they were so passionate and they came to me and they gave me exactly what I asked for.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.480
And they helped me to realize that I, they told me they did not like my speech.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.480
They told me they were offended by my speech.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:17.480
They would not introduce themselves by name and it was a conference with with name badges and the one woman who was speaking on behalf of the two of them took her badge off before she came over to speak to me.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.480
When I put my hand out and introduced myself, she wouldn't introduce herself and wouldn't shake my hand.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.480
And they came at me hard guys when I say hard, hard.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.480
It was aggressive.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.480
And this is what I felt.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.480
And what I wanted to do was, was walk away.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480
Okay.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480
Because I felt like it was inappropriate how aggressive they were coming, but I stayed in it.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480
And I took a big deep breath.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:53.480
And I, and I kept coming and I said to them, the feedback you're giving me right now is really hard.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.480
I'm really struggling.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480
I'm super confused.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.480
And I want you to keep coming.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.480
Don't stop.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480
And I just, I just, and they just kept coming.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:12.480
And the more they came at me, the more I surrendered and stayed in this tension and just said to myself, Oh, this is me.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.480
And my growth edge, this is me actually needing to learn and grow.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:29.480
And I actually got so, I got so like relaxed, almost like the idea of surrendering to win that they calmed down.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.480
And the more the softer I got the softer they got was like a 10 minute conversation.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.480
And then I said, tell me more, tell me more, tell me more.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:48.480
And what they were really upset by is I told a story on that speech about when George Floyd was murdered about how disoriented it was, disorienting it was for me.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.480
And I talked about the Tom Peters idea that if you're not confused, you're not paying attention.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:57.480
And I said, I was so confused.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.480
And I went to my neighbors and I was outside a couple of days after George Floyd was killed.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.480
And they said to me, Rand, you don't look good.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.480
And I was like, I hadn't been, I wasn't sleeping.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
I was crying.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.480
I was super disoriented.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.480
And I said, guys, I'm not good.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480
Like, what do you mean?

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480
What's wrong with me?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480
Like, aren't you paying attention like George Floyd?

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.480
And they're like, George who?

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.480
Because look, I live in a neighborhood with a bunch of rich white guys.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.480
And they weren't paying attention.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.480
And I was paying attention.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.480
And because I was paying attention, I was confused and they weren't confused.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.480
So these women said to me, it took me four years.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.480
I got this feedback two weeks ago.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:43.480
They said they were offended that I would suggest that anyone would be confused by that because if you grew up the way they grew up, it wasn't confusing at all to them.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:04:01.480
And so now I actually am more sensitive to the fact that when I'm in front of a group of people and I tell that story, I don't want to tell that story without also recognizing that other people from a different life, different color skin were not confused by that.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.480
But the fact that I didn't have that nuance really upset them.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.480
And I'm very grateful that I got that feedback.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:19.480
But guys, oh, oh, and at the end of the 10 minutes, the woman put her hand out and she introduced herself by name.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:26.480
And so that might, that was my feedback that this worked a part of me wanted to like, like, like attack them.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Okay.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:34.480
A part of me wanted to the fight another part of me wanted to run away because I could have easy said the guys, I don't need this and walk to it.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.480
But this is what we're trying to teach our clients how to do.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.480
How do you stay in the heat?

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.480
This is really hard work.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.480
And most people don't want to do this hard work.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.480
They want to outsource this to their diversity consultant.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:05:00.480
And they're like, they're looking at their consultant and the consultant needs to be saying to their client, you're not going to get stronger watching me do push ups.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Like, you can't, you can outsource almost everything.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:10.480
If you're, if you're successful and you're powerful, but you can't outsource your own development.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.480
And this is what we need people to do is to step into their own work.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.480
I don't know, David, if that's helping at all, but.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.480
The story was all you needed. That was great. Thank you.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.480
Thank you, John.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.480
John dupe dupe dupe dupe dupe.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.480
Yeah. Anyway, I just want to.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:38.480
Thank you for this and such a healthy, powerful expression of our integral thing that you're that you're doing. It's really great.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.480
And I almost want to pass because I don't know if this, how this directly applies to the work you're doing.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.480
But I would value your, your opinion on, on seeking a higher ground.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:55.480
And for the last and how this affects the companies and the populations that you're working with.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.480
For the last 25 years I've watched, I said.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.480
I noted a long time ago that we, if.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.480
There wasn't some way to absorb the, not the immigration, but the migration.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:14.480
In other words, millions of people crossing borders of different languages, different cultures, different developmental levels.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.480
It would lead to the rise of the reactionary right neo fascism.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:29.480
And it would be a great threat to liberal democracies, which you see in Hungary, seen Sweden, we see in our country.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.480
Russia's weaponizing immigration with Finland.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:49.480
I mean, the Brexit without without that, it probably wouldn't have happened. And so, and, and there's, there's different perspectives from each of these, these level the progressive traditionalists and the Chiebers and.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.480
You know, there's.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:03.480
Definite problems and there's definite good things like we, we get this dynamic workforce of millions of people are willing to work hard for, you know, less than we'd have to pay an American I mean there's good stuff.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:13.480
And I've worked with a lot of them they're very hard working and have a lot of integrity for the most part. And then again as bad people as as Donald, you know, likes to tell us all the time.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.480
But is, have you seen that pressure.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.480
Asserting itself in the work that you do.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:37.480
And have you been able to work with these different perspectives at each, each of these different level bring and find a higher level of of an integral thing that could really help us successfully deal with this.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Given fact of the mass migrations all over the world of people and, you know, threatening different cultures and different developmental levels. Is there any light in your work in that particular.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:08:03.480
Finally, because I look at the time we got eight minutes left, I'm going to, you say you were going to pass I'm going to pass on trying to, to try to even answer a really important beautiful complex question.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.480
And I'll give a couple of sort of like just wondering for myself.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:22.480
I wonder what the consequences are of embracing so much immigration and so much diversity that we lose a shared center.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:31.480
And if we don't have a center in which we are able to subordinate ourselves to which, which was at least what I was growing up.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:40.480
The one thing I felt American shared in common, especially during the Cold War was a patriotism that we were Americans.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.480
Yes, I'm a Texan and someone else is from California and someone else from New York, but we're Americans.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:09:07.480
And if we continue to see the loss of the, of the center because of this demand for multiculturalism, and this is counterintuitive again, the multiculturalism that, that, that can exist so in such a healthy way at the periphery of a society can only exist if there's a strong center.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.480
And this is why blue is so important going forward.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:29.480
We must renew and reconnect to what created at a classical liberal Western values Judeo Christian values what created the United States and what created so many European countries was these foundations that that that civilizations are losing touch with.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:43.480
And so the question is, instead of trying to dismantle, how do we renew and revitalize am I handed off to Steve here, which is a great segue because I believe and this is crazy that I say this, but hey, I get to say this.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:52.480
And if clients don't want to work with us, I don't care, because we don't work with big public companies that have to deal with all the politics and all the pressure from social media.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.480
We work with people who are business owners.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.480
And we're like, if you don't want to work with us, don't work with us, but this is spiritual work.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.480
We are we are unapologetic.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.480
The work of higher ground is spiritual work.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:12.480
And we can define spirituality as having a recognition that I am a part of something bigger than myself.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:18.480
And I can be an atheist and still be spiritual, because I feel connected to the cosmos because I feel connected to nature.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.480
But we've got to start to recognize that this is not an intellectual journey.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.480
It is a journey that requires a spiritual orientation.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.480
And Steve, give us give us a few little nuggets of wisdom.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.480
Well, let me just say amen to what you just said.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.480
Our spiritual work.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.480
Yeah, really, really helpful.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.480
So just a comment and then a quick question.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.480
The comment is, I just want everybody to really appreciate how important it is.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.480
And what an excellent job Rand and his organization have done it, simplifying this, right?

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.480
Because it's it's complex.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.480
But in the course of simplifying it, it's been like a learning lab for the theory.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.480
I mean, the theory has been improved.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.480
I mean, so, for example, you know, Rand's got their achiever instead of modernism, right?

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480
Like, well, you got to call it modernity.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480
That's what it is.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.480
And he tried it out.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.480
I tried it.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480
I tried it.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.480
And they just like, we're in tears in the headlight when you mentioned that term.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:21.480
And so I appreciate that, you know, achiever for the audiences that you're speaking to is actually much more digestible.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:28.480
And I think that the simplicity of it is really it's illuminated the way I understand there.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480
You sort of came to that together.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480
You mentioned it.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.480
That is the simple, the simplest truth is what does development mean?

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.480
Right?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:43.480
Everybody, you made it clear that development is this higher ground and that everybody should naturally want to aspire to that.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.480
And what does that mean?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.480
It simply means expanding the scope of what you can value.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:58.480
I mean, you know, there's more to it than that, but in the spirit of let's get down to the brass taxes and say it as distinct, succinctly and as simply as we can.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:10.480
That's what you're offering in this excellent presentation is a way of people thinking about what it could mean practically to increase the scope of their value by valuing the light, you know, of all of these cultural structures.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:19.480
So that we've learned some things from your on the ground, you know, development of all this.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.480
The question is, yeah, we're the we're the we're the arenas.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.480
I told Steve, I said, Steve, I get with Steve, I say, give me some stuff.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480
And he's like, oh, here's some stuff.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480
You know, here's a book.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480
Here's an article.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:36.480
I go into the arena with my team and we work will work with 3000 leaders this year and programs that are 15 weeks to 52 weeks.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.480
I mean, this is deep, deep work with people and we'll just get beat up and we'll be like, that didn't work.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480
That didn't work.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480
That didn't work.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480
This work.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480
Let's keep doing that.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.480
And this is how we iterate rapid prototyping.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.480
And so, yeah, Steve, I know we're going to we only got three minutes, but if you have a question, I'll do my best to probably.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:59.480
Okay, well, just the simple question is when we you mentioned our zoom conversations that we started to have like in April of 2020, right?

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.480
The pandemic had had hit.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.480
And at the time, you know, it was actually before George Floyd's death.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:19.480
And then immediately afterwards, like in the six months between, you know, July and the end of 2020 diversity equity inclusion within the business community had become like a day reger thing.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.480
It's like, like if you didn't have an accounting department, right?

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:28.480
You have to have a DI bureaucracy or you're not, you know, you're, you're a poor business person.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.480
Yeah.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.480
And of course, you know, we've been the gamble.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480
We've seen it.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.480
We see the backlash that is occurring now.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:46.480
And I'm just wondering whether you see it having a long curve or whether it's going to transform into something that's less green or, you know, what do you see the future of DI from what you've gleaned from the business, your business travels?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.480
I am not optimistic, which is very disappointing.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.480
I feel like the pendulum is swinging, is swinging and continues to swing.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.480
I talked to three leaders in the last week that are shutting down their DI initiatives.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:15.480
I talked to a DEI consultant who's changing his business offering because he's because the demand for his consulting services is diminishing so fast that he's now reinventing himself and doing other kind of consulting.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:22.480
I think you're going to see, I think we're going to see a continued rapid decline of DEI.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:31.480
And I think we're going to see an emergence of something that will be, that will be more, this is the irony, more inclusive.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:41.480
I went to, I'll end with this, I went and gave a speech in October to a group and I put up a big tent and I said, we need to have a big tent.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:55.480
And then I said, we need a tent, a community that includes black and white, male and female, LGBTQ ally, LGBTQ critic.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:01.480
We need people who are fossil fuel executives and people who are environmental activists in the same room.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480
And then I said to them and they were really freaked out.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.480
I said, you are in a room because I knew the room pretty well.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480
There are about 300 people, 300 CEOs.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:17.480
I said, you are in a room right now with half the people in this room are going to, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Donald Trump.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.480
And half the people in this room, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Biden.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.480
Look around.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:32.480
You're in the room with people who are way more diverse than you may realize from a diversity of viewpoint and thought.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:39.480
And I think, Steve, that we're going to have to tackle the complexity that we've got to.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.480
Now, I don't think it's going to be under the banner of DEI.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:49.480
I think we're already seeing a shift to DNI, diversity and inclusion.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.480
DNI is what it's being called.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.480
I'm just noticing this, that the E is just dropping off with certain more complex organizations are already leading the way on that.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:06.480
So I do predict that DNI will be the next iteration and we'll see what happens.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.480
And I'm committed to being a part in some small way of the solution.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.480
I wish I could wave a magic wand and there'd just be the solution out there.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.480
But I have very little hope that the progressives are going to solve this.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:32.480
I think we're going to have to solve it by bringing the beauty of green and the progressive approach to diversity and the beauty of orange and the beauty of blue in the conversation.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.480
And so with that, it is 731.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.480
We're already one minute over.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.480
You're going to get the slides.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.480
I'm going to put together, Nigel, I'm going to put together a little care package.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.480
I'm going to include a video link to a Heineken commercial, which is going to blow your mind.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.480
It's five minutes and it's going to blow your mind.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:59.480
It's the best media I have seen on higher ground and of the humanity of coming together.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.480
It's so good.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480
Watch that video.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.480
It's on YouTube.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.480
So it's a YouTube link.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.480
I'm going to put in the follow up.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.480
I'll give you my slides and I will include a couple of links.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.480
Nigel, I'll get this done before midnight tonight and send it to you.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.480
I'll curate a couple of other things that people who got their curiosity peaked.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:33.480
Some additional one other video from Reba Wisdom that took me two years to find this 45 minute interview with a woman who I actually think from London has an incredible point of view on diversity.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:51.480
And another link to a video, it's 11 minutes of a headmistress in London, who's maybe the best example of how conservative values can create a rich multicultural diverse community at a school that she runs.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:18:06.480
And it's mind boggling what she's doing with Christian lower C conservative values, creating the conditions for a thriving diversity, which doesn't seem like those two go together.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:25.480
And, and you guys enjoy your adventures and your journey and I hope to come back as a attendee at another one of these and listen into the wonderful teachers and, and guess that you guys get to hear from regularly and thank you again for the invitation Steve and and everyone for being here.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.480
Thank you.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.480
Thank you.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480
Thanks guys.
