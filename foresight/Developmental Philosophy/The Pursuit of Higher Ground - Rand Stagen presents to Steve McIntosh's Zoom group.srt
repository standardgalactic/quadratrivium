1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
So should we just jump in?

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,320
Raja, are we ready to go?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Yeah, go for it.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
All right.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,840
So we've got an hour and 15 minutes together.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to make this as interactive as possible.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,600
I consider this a relatively small size group,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
so I think this is manageable.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Less than 50 people on Zoom.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,080
I can see all your faces on one screen on my big monitor,

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,560
and I'm looking forward to doing a couple things.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,080
Number one, I'm going to provide you

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,560
a little bit of background upfront

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,040
on the Stagan Leadership Academy,

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
which we found it 25 years ago this year.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,720
And then I'm going to share with you a piece of content

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,520
that we call the pursuit of higher ground,

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,840
that is our most recent expression

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,720
of how to translate developmental theory,

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,360
integral theory, spiral dynamics, and complexity theory,

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
for all intents and purposes, how

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,080
to translate that into the listening of a broad audience

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,040
from traditionalists to progressives.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,840
So this content can be delivered in as short as a 18-minute

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,680
keynote speech in front of 1,000 people.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,840
I do this in large groups all the time.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
And the feedback that I have gotten in the last two years

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,920
of let's just I'm still in the experimental phase

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,280
with this material is incredibly positive across the board.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,800
And so rather than just share the content

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,240
and treat you like a normal audience,

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm going to treat you as you are, your fellow travelers,

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
where we're all students of integral theory,

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,480
developmental theory, and I see this more

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
as a peer group than anything else.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,200
So I'll present the material.

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,920
I just have a handful of slides.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,680
And that'll be a little didactic, little presentation mode.

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,800
And then we'll come out of that.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,080
And instead of waiting until the end of the call for Q&A,

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,680
we'll actually start with the Q&A right after I clear the slides

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,240
so that I can use your questions to continue

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,200
sharing and presenting.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,840
I am not an academic.

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
I am not a theorist.

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,000
We've got the big brains on this call.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,720
Salisman is here and others.

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,280
And we're practitioners, as Steve knows.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,360
Bert and I, Bert Parley, who was with Ken Wilbur,

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,520
who I met through Ken Wilbur almost 22 years ago,

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,280
we are in the arena working with leaders

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,040
on a daily basis that are running organizations.

53
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,120
We primarily work with privately held businesses

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,240
and executives within those enterprises.

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,600
And our sweet spot is the mid-market.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,520
And for people, what does that mean?

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,520
That means companies with a couple hundred employees

58
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,840
to a couple thousand employees, that sort of range.

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
The reason that we don't work by design

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,320
with large public companies

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,600
is we will only work with an organization

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,840
if the CEO of that organization

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,240
is engaged in their own deep inner work.

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,440
If they're not willing to actually look at themselves

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,920
and work on themselves,

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,080
we will not go into the organization

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
to work with their people.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,520
So yes, we do work with some public companies.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,480
Many years of working with Whole Foods

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
and working with John Mackey and his top 300 leaders

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,800
were their partner for the sort of executive development there.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
But that is one of the few big known companies

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,080
we work with because John is someone who's willing

74
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,720
to walk the talk and actually work on himself.

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,920
But that unfortunately is really rare

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,680
with CEOs of typically large, 41,000 businesses.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
So that's a little context on who we are,

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,680
what we're about, as Ken referred to us,

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,760
had to have been almost maybe 17 or 18 years ago.

80
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,480
They're the little experiment in Dallas,

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,520
like what's going on in Dallas.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,920
And people will often say,

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,720
you guys work with,

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,160
we have a physical brick and mortar facility,

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,880
a leadership academy in Dallas.

86
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
We have our team,

87
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Bert and I just came out of our annual team retreat.

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,400
We had 72, not the whole team, but 72 attendees there

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
just to give you a sense of our size, our faculty.

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,440
And as Rajeal said, we work with several thousand leaders

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,080
each year across the country that either come to Dallas

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,120
or we go to their organizations.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,120
And we are, people will say, why are you in Dallas?

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,040
Like it makes no sense.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
You're working with Wilbur,

96
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
you're working with Bob Keegan,

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
you're working with Bill Torberts,

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,920
who's on Cochlorida, cutting edge, integral theory.

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,120
Like what are you doing in Dallas, Texas?

100
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,640
And the answer is, this is where the work is, right?

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,560
This is where the work is, this is where the need is.

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
So we are in the heartland.

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,160
We work extensively in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin.

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,680
We work in Oklahoma, Louisiana.

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,440
We work really deeply in Kansas.

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,800
We work in Ohio, in Illinois.

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
We go down into Georgia.

108
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,920
We really are in sort of the middle of the country

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,440
and a little bit down into the Southeast.

110
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,520
We are not heavily penetrated by design on the coast.

111
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,800
Yes, we have clients in Seattle and New York

112
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,440
and in California, but the mass focus for us

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
has been heartland and I'll explain that

114
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
after I clear the slides.

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,480
So that's background context, a segmentation where we focus

116
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,760
and we're not in the entertainment business.

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,840
So we don't do any event-based training.

118
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,760
Our shortest program for a new client is a 52 week

119
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,480
practice-based, integrally informed program

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
where they come to Dallas one day per quarter

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,600
in a cohort of 20 liters.

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
From anywhere in the country

123
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,640
and we will only work with a client if the CEO goes first.

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,800
So now let's get to the juicy part, get to the content.

125
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
So I have been, along with my team,

126
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,680
trying to figure out how to crack the code

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,680
on a skillful means, on a translation of spiral dynamics.

128
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,680
We started teaching our leaders, our clients, the spiral.

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,040
And we basically did it as a developmental progression

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,040
as it is laid out by Don Beck and by Claire Graves' research.

131
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
And what would happen is the world views,

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,440
the traditional world view, lower down,

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,280
was very threatened by the hierarchical nature of the model.

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,800
The achievers, the strive-drive kind of orange world view

135
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,680
would look to figure out how they could

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,880
sort of game and climb the ladder.

137
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,840
So they just wanted us to click the slides faster

138
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
so they could kind of move through the progression.

139
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,240
The pluralists, the progressives,

140
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,560
were incredibly offended by the hierarchical nature

141
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
of what we were laying out.

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,800
So after about five or six years,

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,080
we moved from a vertical rendering

144
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,720
and we presented picking four of the colors,

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
red, blue, orange and green.

146
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,800
And for those that don't know spiral dynamics,

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,760
this sort of power mindset or power worldview,

148
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,320
red, the more traditional worldview, blue,

149
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,880
the more achiever worldview, orange,

150
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,000
and the more progressive pluralistic worldview, green.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
And we basically laid them out

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
as we're still doing today in our curriculum

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
as a little bit more of a horizontal

154
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,080
and saying that there's not one that's better than the other

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
because in reality, one isn't better than the other.

156
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
They all are appropriate in the appropriate context.

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,360
And so what's the context is what's best?

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,320
And so that has been, for some people in the integral community,

159
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,800
that was blasphemy.

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,440
Like how could you do that?

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
How could you make this appear to be almost a type system?

162
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
And the answer is we're meeting people where they are.

163
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,480
We're not demanding that they meet us where we are

164
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,480
because we're up in the ivory tower from their perspective.

165
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,680
And so it's been an incredibly powerful

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,160
and potent strategy, communication strategy

167
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
because it works and it's getting people into the game

168
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,480
of understanding the nuances of development.

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,480
And then in 2021 with Steve as really a guide to me,

170
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
he introduced in an article, this idea,

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
it was just a sentence, right Steve?

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
It was just a simple sentence saying,

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I no longer, I'm no longer believing that common ground

174
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
is going to be the fullness of what we need.

175
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
We need higher ground.

176
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
We need more than just common ground.

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
And I grabbed on that term and said,

178
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
there's something really magical about this idea

179
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,480
of higher ground and ultimately was able to build

180
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,480
a new expression, which I'm about to share with you

181
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
in the form of what is now a keynote presentation.

182
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I'm going to send Rigel the slides.

183
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,480
It's a small, email-able PowerPoint file.

184
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
So if you want to send it out to everybody

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
in the spirit of abundance, everyone could have these slides.

186
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,480
And so the move here was how can we actually

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,480
put red to the side and really focus on the traditional,

188
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
the achiever and the pluralist,

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
that sort of blue, orange and green worldviews

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,480
and bring in yellow in what I hope you will see

191
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,480
as a very creative way of inviting people

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,480
into a more of an integrated orientation.

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,480
The title of this content is the pursuit of higher ground.

194
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,480
And the word pursuit is incredibly precise

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
because we don't want anyone to suggest,

196
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,480
like to suggest themselves or to infer

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,480
that we, an integral community, are up on higher ground

198
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,480
and we're putting our hand down to help others come up to us.

199
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
That would be unskillful and presumptive

200
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
and it could come across as arrogant.

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,480
And so the frame here is we are all in a place

202
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
where we together can pursue higher ground,

203
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
where we can all look at this slide in the pursuit of something

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
and a dynamic journey towards something aspirational

205
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
and something higher.

206
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,480
And then this image here, as many of you know

207
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,480
from Steve's book of developmental politics,

208
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,480
how America can grow into a better version of itself.

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Right now, the version so many of us are experiencing

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,480
is hyperpolarization, is this culture war,

211
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,480
is this time in which people are experiencing

212
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
incredible confusion and conflict and emotion

213
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,480
and if we talk to the average American and ask them

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,480
what's going on, they're likely going to say things like,

215
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
well, we have issues with racial issues in America.

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
We have issues with climate in America

217
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
in which there are climate deniers

218
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480
and people who are not sensitive to what's going on.

219
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,480
We have huge income inequality.

220
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
We have all these issues.

221
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
So pick them, race, climate, income inequality

222
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,480
and what we would say from a developmental standpoint

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,480
is that those are actually not the real issue.

224
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Those are the symptoms of the real issue.

225
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,480
So if we were to go upstream of the polarization,

226
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,480
we would assert that there's actually a conflict of world

227
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
views that's showing up with those symptoms.

228
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,480
And so the idea is to introduce

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,480
that if we were walking down a street in a major city,

230
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,480
we would be interpreting what was going on in the world.

231
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,480
We would be relating with the world through the lens

232
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
that we're wearing through our world views.

233
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
And we invite, in this case, an audience

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
to recognize that in many ways,

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
we don't see the world as it is.

236
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
We see the world as we are,

237
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
which is a concept I think many of you are familiar with.

238
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
We don't see the world as it is objectively.

239
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,480
We are always filtering and we're always interpreting

240
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
through the lens at which we're making meaning of the world

241
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
and thus the idea of a world view.

242
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
And so then we go in and say,

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
and these are,

244
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm bringing you guys behind the curtain a little bit.

245
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I don't normally, you know,

246
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
pause and offer up these nuances here,

247
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
but please pay attention to the placement

248
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,480
of where these colors are on the screen.

249
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,480
So we start with introducing the idea

250
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,480
that there are three dominant world views in America today,

251
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
and we introduce this idea of an achiever world view.

252
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
And we talk about how this would be your capitalist crowd,

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
your business people, and with the achievers,

254
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
from this world view,

255
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
there are a lot of healthy contributions that achievers

256
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,480
have made and continue to make to America and to the world.

257
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,480
And we talk about that as the light of the achiever world view,

258
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
things like modern medicine

259
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
and things like economic development.

260
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
And yet, even though there are all these wonderful expressions

261
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,480
and contributions from the achiever world view,

262
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,480
where there is light, there is also shadow.

263
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
There is pathology.

264
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
There are these very destructive forces

265
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
that come from the achiever world view.

266
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Things like greed and self-dealing and cronyism

267
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,480
and regulatory capture of environmental destruction.

268
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
And so it's this capacity to be able to recognize

269
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,480
the light and the shadow,

270
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,480
to be able to say, look at how long we are living

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
relative to just 100 years ago thanks to modern medicine.

272
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Look at this incredible economic development

273
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,480
that has allowed so much of humanity to flourish

274
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,480
and coming out of poverty at a continued increasing rate.

275
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,480
And yet, there are these shadows within the achiever world view.

276
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
And then we introduce, notice it's on the right here.

277
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I don't normally say that.

278
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
We introduce the traditional world view.

279
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
And we say those who are operating with a traditional world view

280
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
also have light and contributions.

281
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,480
And the traditional world view brings us family values,

282
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
brings us law and order, brings us structure,

283
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,480
brings us so many elements of our society that keep order.

284
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,480
And yet, there is a shadow of traditionalism.

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
And traditionalist shadows can include things like bigotry

286
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,480
or homophobia or racism, not at a systemic level,

287
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
but at an individual level, like actual racism.

288
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,480
There is a shadow here and things like anti-science.

289
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Not believing in science, which is in conflict

290
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,480
with the achiever world view, which brings us science.

291
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,480
And then lastly, we introduce this idea of the progressive world view.

292
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,480
And the progressive world view has incredible contributions,

293
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
a multicultural orientation,

294
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
a recognition of previously marginalized communities,

295
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,480
a ability to be incredibly sensitive to the earth

296
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,480
and to the natural system and to the environment.

297
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,480
And yet, where there is light, there is shadow.

298
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
And in the shadow of progressivism,

299
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,480
we see things like corrosive identity politics.

300
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
And we also see cancel culture.

301
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,480
And we see a form of DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion,

302
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,480
a form of inclusion that says you are included

303
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
as long as you see the world through a progressive lens.

304
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,480
And so when I talk to my progressive friends

305
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,480
and I talk about what's going on with diversity, equity and inclusion in America,

306
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
they say we need to heal America, if you remember the prior slide.

307
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
And I say, well, where are the people who voted for Donald Trump?

308
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,480
And they're like, well, they're not welcome at this conversation, at this table,

309
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
because they voted for Donald Trump.

310
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,480
And there's such a contradiction there that we stand for inclusion,

311
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
but there are conditions with that form of inclusion.

312
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:46,480
And I want you all to know that I am terrified by the shadow of all three of these world views.

313
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:55,480
The dark underbelly of all three are horrific in their most extreme expression.

314
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,480
And I adore the healthy expression of all three.

315
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,480
And so when people say, well, Rand, which one's better?

316
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,480
The answer is it depends, right? It depends.

317
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,480
And so now what happens in America, what is happening, and we all know this because we're living it every day,

318
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:26,480
is we're seeing how the parts of our country that are struggling to make sense of what's happening,

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,480
what they start to do is they start to look for a way to manage their own anxiety.

320
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:43,480
And they start to look to see which of these camps, which of these world views most resonate with me.

321
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
And we call this the easy button.

322
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:53,480
And they punch the easy button and subordinate themselves to the narrative that most resonates with them.

323
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,480
And to make things a little simpler, because we don't have a large amount of time tonight,

324
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm going to just go to the traditionalist on the right and the progressives on the left

325
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,480
and say, OK, if I'm on the traditionalist on the right, it's Fox.

326
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480
And that's my news channel, and that's my echo chamber that I'm going to join.

327
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
And I'm going to read magazines, and I'm going to read social media,

328
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,480
and I'm going to subscribe to that channel, that camp.

329
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,480
But if I'm on the progressive side, I'm on MSNBC, I'm on CNN, I'm on The View,

330
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:35,480
and I'm going to actually start to subscribe to those parts of the world view echo chambers that most resonate with me.

331
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:44,480
And the problem, and we all know this, is when we actually are in a traditionalist camp criticizing the progressives,

332
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:52,480
what the traditionalist media is doing is they are amplifying the shadow of the progressives.

333
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,480
And then what the progressive camps are doing in their expressions of media,

334
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
and the monetization that comes from all of this with outrage,

335
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:09,480
is that the progressives are amplifying, when they criticize the traditionalist, the shadows of the traditionalist.

336
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,480
So what's happening is the worst of the other is being amplified and put forth as the other.

337
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,480
And I want to say this again, the worst of the other is being put forth as the totality of the other,

338
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:32,480
which actually leads Americans to believe that we are more divided than we actually are.

339
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I genuinely believe that we are being told that we're divided at a level that's not,

340
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,480
at least my direct experience on the ground, navigating all three of these camps on a regular basis.

341
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,480
And so what do we do? What is the path forward?

342
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,480
And so I want, for those of you who know the idea of the dialectic, I want to introduce that here,

343
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
because it's very useful and it's also very accessible.

344
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,480
So the dialectic would say that there's a thesis and there's an antithesis to that thesis.

345
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
So thesis and antithesis.

346
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:24,480
And then from the thesis and antithesis, we actually have a synthesis that emerges above that, a higher order synthesis.

347
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,480
And so when we take the traditionalists with part of the achiever on the right,

348
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,480
and let's hold them out as the thesis of American exceptionalism, and these are people,

349
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:43,480
and Steve really gave me this particular language, these are people who want to protect what's right with America.

350
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,480
And then on the left, the progressives and sort of part of the achiever group also,

351
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,480
that is a group that wants to actually fix what's wrong with America.

352
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,480
And so we have this incredible conflict between those who want to protect what's right

353
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,480
and those who want to fix what's wrong with America, and they're banging into each other like tectonic plates.

354
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,480
And when we ask ourselves which one of these groups is, quote, right, the answer is they're both partially right.

355
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:24,480
And when I'm with an audience, I will literally say, if you feel like there are things that we need to protect about America,

356
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,480
raise your hand, and in almost every room, all the hands go up.

357
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,480
And then I say, if you think that there are things that we need to fix, things that are wrong with America,

358
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
raise your hand, almost all the hands go up.

359
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,480
It's not half and half, almost everyone can relate with both of these orientations.

360
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:53,480
And so then what we say is, if we want to move to a higher order synthesis, we are not going to get there simply by finding common ground.

361
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
We need common ground.

362
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,480
We need compromise, which we're not seeing much of these days in our politicians.

363
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
So I don't want to marginalize common ground.

364
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,480
But as Wilbur would say, common ground is necessary, but not sufficient.

365
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,480
It's not going to get us where we need to go.

366
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,480
So I want you guys to imagine that we find a common ground among these three world views.

367
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:30,480
And we were able to use that common ground as a solid ground from which to move upwards so that we can actually move to what we really need,

368
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
which is a higher ground synthesis and integration.

369
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,480
And so here we go to finish out the slides and then we can get into Q&A.

370
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
So higher ground.

371
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:50,480
And now we're going to say at higher ground, we're going to do everything we can to actually leave behind the shadows.

372
00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:08,480
We're not going to be able to leave all of it behind, but we're going to try to limit the shadows of all three and then take the unique contributions, the light of all three and move those into an integrated in synthesized orientation.

373
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:17,480
And notice, once again, I don't normally say this, bringing the light of the three world views up to higher ground and making yellow,

374
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:26,480
which most audiences see as a sun happens to coincide with yellow and spiral dynamics as something that just worked out in a beautiful,

375
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,480
almost unintentional way when this was first being created as a body of content.

376
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:42,480
And so then what we say is what we need to recognize is that people think this is idealistic.

377
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,480
They think that, you know, Rand, you know, what you're trying to bring everyone with you, what about the bad actors?

378
00:24:49,480 --> 00:25:01,480
And what we say is, you know, don't throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater and don't conflate the shadow behaviors of all three of these world views with the human beings.

379
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:13,480
We want to imagine a circle of compassion, a circle of inclusion, and we want to imagine at higher ground that no one is standing outside that circle.

380
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,480
So we want to be inclusive of the human beings, but we do not want to be inclusive of the pathological behaviors.

381
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:31,480
And there are a tremendous number of behaviors that are happening right now that we do not want to tolerate.

382
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,480
We want to be intolerant of the pathology, but we don't want to throw out the human being.

383
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,480
And the example I give when people want an illustration, I say, imagine when Pope John Paul was shot,

384
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,480
and we may all remember that experience of watching him almost be killed.

385
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:57,480
After he healed, he went in and visited with the prisoner who had been captured, his would-be assassin.

386
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,480
And I want you guys to imagine, you might remember in Life Magazine, the cover of Life Magazine,

387
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:11,480
when the Pope was sitting in the corner with no shackles on the would-be assassin holding his hands forgiving him.

388
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:20,480
And so after he forgave his assassin and he went outside of the jail, the Pope did not say to the jailers,

389
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,480
now that I've forgiven him, you need to let him out of prison.

390
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,480
He said, I have forgiven him as a child of God, but he needs to stay in prison.

391
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,480
And that is an example of discernment.

392
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:42,480
So we can be non-judgmental of the spirit, but we can still have discernment for the consequences of the behavior

393
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,480
and for the potential risk that he poses to himself or to society if he weren't in prison.

394
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,480
So this move from the lower level to the higher level is really a move out of being judgmental

395
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:05,480
and still maintaining our discernment with boundaries as we move to higher ground, which can be a very fierce place.

396
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:16,480
People think, yes, the Rumi quote, which is beautiful and inspiring, there's a field at higher ground.

397
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,480
And beyond right doing, beyond wrong doing, there is this field, I'll meet you there.

398
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,480
There's a lot of beautiful poetry about the idea of higher ground and there's an end here.

399
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,480
There needs to also be a fierceness and a responsibility of leaders at higher ground

400
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,480
to actually make choices in service of the whole, in service of the system

401
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,480
to recognize that the system is held together, especially with very healthy blue

402
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,480
and when green wants to dismantle and completely eliminate blue, defund the police,

403
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:05,480
pick your attack on blue from green, that actually is incredibly threatening to the stability for all of us and for all of this.

404
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:14,480
And so, and by the way, when orange wants to exploit what's going on with the economics of outrage,

405
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,480
that shadow and orange is actually fueling our polarization because the amount of money that Facebook and social media companies are making off of the outrage.

406
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Oh, and let's not forget about blue because blue has all sorts of intolerance that also need to be recognized.

407
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:40,480
And so this move here is a move to recognizing that in many ways we have always had a rich diversity in America.

408
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480
And this is the last slide.

409
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:51,480
And most of you know our motto as a country, e pluribus unum out of many one out of the diversity.

410
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,480
There is a unity out of this incredible complexity.

411
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
There is a diversity.

412
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:12,480
So there is a there is a tremendous wisdom that exists at the base at the foundation of the United States that we actually are going at stake and we're going back to to renew ourselves to revitalize and to reconnect.

413
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
And so that's a little peek into some content.

414
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:35,480
And this isn't being delivered to academics this is being delivered to pedestrians to people who are struggling day in and day out, and our one prescription, when people say, what can I do, what can I do, and what can I do that's actionable.

415
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,480
And my answer is break bread with people who you would normally never break bread with.

416
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Go and have a dinner.

417
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Go drink some wine and sit for three hours with people who are on the other side of the aisle from you, and actually see that you have much more in common than you than you might imagine.

418
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:11,480
And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get more and more, not just of our clients, but anyone that we touch to start getting into dialogue and start getting to discussion with a greater diversity.

419
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:28,480
And I'll tell you, I mean, I am in the green world all the time. I'm in the orange world every day. I'm in the blue world all the time from being at dinner with people in Alabama and places like that on a regular basis to being in Boulder to being in Seattle with progressives.

420
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:39,480
And so as I learned to navigate these different territories, what I find is people are very open, but they have to actually be met where they are.

421
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:49,480
And it's a long road ahead. Someone said to me recently, don't worry, Rand, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

422
00:30:49,480 --> 00:31:05,480
And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true. Things are probably in the next decade going to get, maybe next two decades, going to get much worse, which is why we need more people stepping into responsibility to be a part of the solution.

423
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:18,480
And this is really hard work and diversity, equity and inclusion. Unfortunately, the DEI community is not positioned, in my opinion, just to be provocative. They are not positioned to be helpful.

424
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I talk to CEOs and board members every day. Big companies that are my friends that I don't work with as clients that run Fortune 1000 companies and talking to them all the time.

425
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:44,480
They are not, the CEOs and the boards are not doing the work that's necessary to create a more inclusive organization, an organization with healthier forms of belonging.

426
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:53,480
They aren't doing it because they're outsourcing it to the DEI experts. And you can't outsource this. You can outsource a lot of stuff, but not adaptive change.

427
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:04,480
And until the DEI community actually gets the executive team, the CEO and the board to start to walk the talk on this, it's going to be a bunch of bullshit and a big charade is what it's going to be.

428
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:18,480
And guess what? What camp is the DEI community in? And we all know the answer, the green camp. It's the progressive camp. I love the camp, the progressive camp.

429
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:36,480
I love the light of progressivism. And I also love the light of traditionalism and I also love the light of the achiever worldview. And people will say to me, Rand, this comes from Bert, Rand, are you a conservative?

430
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:55,480
And my answer is not merely, well, Rand, that's confusing. Are you a progressive? Not merely, at least, but not merely. And because I actually identify with the healthy expressions of all three of these worldviews.

431
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:08,480
But the DEI community, the practitioners, the consultants, they're so well-intentioned. They are coming from a green place and they, I talk to these people also. Some of them are friends.

432
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:19,480
And they say to me, I cannot, out of my own consciousness, I just cannot work with people who are going to vote for Donald Trump.

433
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Okay. Okay. So you're going to exclude half the country. So you're going to stand for healing America with half the country and the other half the country of the deplorables.

434
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:42,480
We're just going to leave them out. So how are we supposed to move forward? We will only move forward when we have, dare I say, an integral approach to diversity and inclusion.

435
00:33:42,480 --> 00:34:06,480
We'll have to drop the E, because the E is equity, and equity has become a part of the culture war, and it has been, it's no longer effective. It has to be gone, because the far right and the right have said equity equals a quality of outcomes and socialism.

436
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:18,480
So we can't be asking the right of America to be stepping into equity when that word has already been defined and there's no going back. But we can save diversity and inclusion, for sure.

437
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:27,480
And we need diversity and inclusion. But we also have to recognize that the E of equity is radioactive now.

438
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:42,480
So let's rumble, people. Charlie's here. Let's do it. Let's get into some Q&A and let's get juicy and provocative and let's challenge each other.

439
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:57,480
And let's actually do what a classical liberal group would want to do. Let's offer up respectfully points of view that actually are challenging to each other so that we're not all just saying the same thing.

440
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,480
So, Mary, you're up first and then we're going to go to Michael and then Trudy.

441
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, wherever you are.

442
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Rand, thank you. This is a very validating, brilliant introduction and context setting you've given us.

443
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I am personally continuously tortured by this idea that we have to choose sides, jump into a bucket, jump into a very lean and shallow definition of sides, by the way.

444
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:52,480
So it's like nobody wants to deal with the complexity, the deep, rich, multi-layered facets of these kind of situations, conditions, states of mind, mindsets, etc.

445
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:16,480
And dealing with nuance, it's like I don't think most people in our society even contemplate that we are skimming on the top of the surface as we default and follow the mobs and the voices and the media.

446
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:27,480
We lack the ability to absorb and discuss the layers, the nuance and the complexity of what's really going on.

447
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:36,480
And I continuously hear this term discernment being so important. I completely agree with it.

448
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:50,480
What struck me as you were talking is that most people have no idea what it means to have discernment and that what's lacking is some sort of instruction.

449
00:36:50,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Awareness piece broadly and scalably available to people about what we mean when we talk about discernment and nuance. And the last thing I'll say is the Rumi quote, which, again, Rumi, that Rumi quote and all Rumi poetry is being spread widely.

450
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:28,480
But do people really understand, they feel intuitively a sense of that quote that you out beyond all ideas of right doing and wandering there is a space, I will meet you there.

451
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Yep.

452
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I feel the essence of that because it's pure, but do they know what that means on a deeper level and they do they know how to create the conditions that will allow them to play in that space.

453
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
I think that's a big missing piece for a lot of people.

454
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Because you hit a lot and I want to appreciate several things that you just shared and offer up a couple of a couple of responses. So, at the highest level complexity has a PR problem.

455
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:14,480
You guys get that? Okay, like complexity has a PR problem because nuance and the capacity to actually have the kind of discernment that Mary's talking about requires development.

456
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:26,480
So development in developing our capacity to have a more nuanced and complex way of relating with the world is a really long and hard journey.

457
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:35,480
And it takes, we work with clients for private businesses where we work with the owners of the businesses for not just a year or two years or three years.

458
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:43,480
We have many, many, many clients that we worked with for 10, 15, 20 years continuously.

459
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,480
And so we know that development is hard and it takes a long time.

460
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,480
But the problem is that I just got an email from a DEI consultant in New York.

461
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,480
And the headline was 90 minutes to increasing trust in the context of diversity and inclusion.

462
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Because what's happening is that the corporations are demanding these sprints. You got to go faster. You got to teach people quicker.

463
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
And once again, I'm sorry, but it's just bullshit.

464
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:24,480
It's a charade and people are pretending that they're actually doing development when they're not doing much more than provoking some new ideas and entertaining people.

465
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Now, there's nothing wrong with going to the movies and being entertained, but let's not hold that out as development.

466
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,480
How many of you remember James Carville in the Democratic, in the Clinton era?

467
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,480
He said, it's the economy stupid. Raise your physical hands. You remember that? Okay. A lot of people remember that. It's the economy stupid.

468
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Here's what we have to say about the polarization in America, the race topic just being one of them. It's development stupid.

469
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:01,480
That's it. It's development. We don't have an appetite to actually do the work.

470
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,480
And so we are stagging. We are very unpopular with public companies, which is wonderful.

471
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,480
And I'm so thankful for my team and my clients over decades of doing this work.

472
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:31,480
We have a very strong reputation in corporate America, in the pockets that we have a presence, and we have to turn away opportunities every week because we will not work with an organization if their CEO is not doing his or her own work.

473
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:43,480
And I'm not, that's why I say probably a couple more decades of it's going to get worse because there's just the appetite to do what Mary's pointing to is really, really rare.

474
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
All right, Michael, and then Trudy, Michael Abramson.

475
00:40:49,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Hi, Rand. I like very much all that you presented, and it resonates with my understanding of this.

476
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:11,480
But my question to you is that my impression that your academy, you mostly focus on business world, on corporate world.

477
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Correct.

478
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:21,480
But a lot of controversies around this DEI, they are coming from universities, they are coming from the government.

479
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:33,480
So are you trying to do something with them? And what is generally your take on this? What is going on at universities?

480
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:46,480
And also in the media, which in theory, they should be like objective and biased, but in practice, it's very rare.

481
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,480
So I'd like to hear your thoughts about this.

482
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Well, I mean, I think for those of us that are students of integral theory, what's playing out in universities is exactly what we would expect is playing out.

483
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I think Ken Wilber talked about this as the Mean Green meme 20 years ago, and it's just coming on full force.

484
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:24,480
So so much of this is what we would expect would be happening as more and more of a progressive worldview is coming online as expressed, especially in a younger generation in which they're being indoctrinated into an academic world,

485
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:37,480
where the especially in the liberal arts side of the Academy, where there is a bias to a progressive worldview.

486
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:52,480
And we all know the statistics on this, that at 90% or more of faculty within our universities across the entire country, sometimes it's 95, 98% identify as being on the left, politically.

487
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
So we don't actually have a good balance in our own faculty.

488
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,480
And so then what would we expect happens to the students.

489
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:07,480
And so I think, you know, that question of what is going on at universities, I might give Steve a chance when he talks here at a moment to speak to that.

490
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I want to really talk about our direct experience.

491
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
And yes, we work mostly with business leaders.

492
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:21,480
We do work with leaders of institutions, nonprofits, we have had chancellors of universities go through our programs.

493
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:36,480
We have had many leaders of large religious organizations, mega churches, a variety of different domination denominations, priests, bishops with a Catholic bishops, Episcopal bishops that have large regions.

494
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,480
So we work, we work with the leaders are and where the appetite is to make a difference.

495
00:43:42,480 --> 00:44:00,480
But we do have a bias of working with the money, the power, because the way that we're going to change universities, you know, one way we're going to change universities is by getting pressure from the alumni who are going to make demands of what is going to need to be

496
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
changed if they're going to continue to make donations.

497
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:11,480
And so Stagen, we've just picked one part, which is where, where, where capital is where the money is.

498
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,480
But there's a lot of important work that's going on in all parts of the system.

499
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:24,480
So Trudy, and that I love you guys to also like try to integrate in a little bit what other people are asking like, Hey, I appreciate it that and I want to integrate that into what I'm saying.

500
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,480
So it gets a little bit more dialogue, which is, you know, which is hard, but we can try. So true to Europe.

501
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Yeah, actually, you kind of answered that question already.

502
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I was going to ask how well this is how well is this received in the organizations that you have taught it. And what's the result when you're following up with them.

503
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Are they using these principles? Has it changed their organization in some way? Have they found better ways of working together?

504
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,480
So if address that a little bit, if you would.

505
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Yeah, yeah, the.

506
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:19,480
So, I don't want to make this about any one topic, you know, diversity and inclusion is a topic. Climate change is a topic.

507
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:29,480
What what we find Trudy is when we work with a CEO of an organization or a leader of an organization could be a nonprofit.

508
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,480
And that leader spends a year working on herself.

509
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:47,480
And as a result of working on herself will more self awareness, a capacity to recognize the wake that is behind all of her decisions.

510
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:55,480
We help our leaders realize that when we make a choice, that choice is consequential.

511
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:03,480
I was talking to a leader a few days ago who runs an organization in Georgia, a relatively large family business, thousands of employees.

512
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:12,480
And we were talking about what he would what he had just communicated to his executive team and to the top, let's say 100 leaders in his business.

513
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:21,480
He had sent an email and he realized in the conversation with me that the email was unnecessarily critical and harsh in its tone.

514
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:33,480
And that he likely got the short term result that he wanted at the expense of long term undermining of trust within the top tier of his organization.

515
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:42,480
And so what we're trying to do with leaders is to help them realize, as we become more aware, we can actually choose differently.

516
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Because with awareness and choice comes a responsibility to recognize that every decision, especially when you're higher up in organizational life, the the consequence of those decisions ripple out like the wake of a boat.

517
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:09,480
And and what what's so cool about development and consciousness complexity is that as a leader becomes better at that current level.

518
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
That's skill development, knowledge acquisition.

519
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,480
It increases the likelihood that they can actually go vertical in their own vertical the elevated development.

520
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:35,480
However, when they move up, they're going to relate with relationships in a more complex nuanced ways, which means they're going to relate with the topic of diversity, equity inclusion, a more nuanced way.

521
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,480
And so we don't have to be DEI consultants or trainers.

522
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,480
We just have to continue to focus on human development, because as a human develops to higher levels.

523
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:57,480
They're actually that person is going to relate with and make decisions across a broad spectrum of topics that are going to be informed from a more complex operating system.

524
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,480
And so that's the work is just its development, its development.

525
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,480
How long is this going to take generations.

526
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Brand that's not very inspiring.

527
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Well, it's going to take generations.

528
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:23,480
It's going to take people thinking not in years anymore, we can't have our leaders continuing to be in this pathological short termism of America, that everything is now now now now now.

529
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:31,480
What we realize is leaders have to start to recognize what is the progress that we can make in 10 year increments.

530
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Our clients love the Bill Gates quote, and Bill Gates said, most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.

531
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,480
And so we say to our clients, how might you be underestimating yourself?

532
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:58,480
What could you do if you started expanding your sense of time and started looking at the progress and look at the long arc of progress.

533
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:07,480
And yes, there's suffering going on in the world, but relative to 100 years ago and 200 years ago, there's a lot less suffering.

534
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,480
So let's put that into context and perspective.

535
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:18,480
And when we get leaders who are able to just peek into more of an integral view, they're able to hold that.

536
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:28,480
But when they're in the lower levels, and as we all know, even though I talked about the great diversity between the traditionalist, the achievers and the progressives.

537
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:36,480
The one thing all three of those worldviews have in common as integral theory teaches us is they think their worldview is the right worldview.

538
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
Steve knows that we all know this.

539
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,480
All three of these worldviews think their worldview is the right worldview.

540
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,480
That's their commonality among all the other diversity.

541
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:59,480
And so this is just more reason that we've got to have more of a commitment to a higher and more elevated development.

542
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Barbara Brown, take yourself off mute.

543
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,480
What do you got?

544
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:15,480
You know, you mentioned working in my over country where I live to and not so much on the coast.

545
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:27,480
Do you think a developmental reason or a sociological reason why this works better in middle America than it does on the coast just out of periodicity?

546
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Yeah, it's a great question.

547
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,480
So it's counterintuitive to a lot of people, especially integral students.

548
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:56,480
What we have found, we've been out there for decades, what we have found is that when we meet a leader from Kansas City, Kansas, who may have grown up there, gone to school somewhere else, and then come back home to raise their family.

549
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,480
And these are people who might have gone to universities on the coast.

550
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:12,480
They might have gone to a Harvard or they might have gone to a UCLA, but they go back home and they feel a sense of community with Kansas.

551
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:24,480
And then we show up and we say, we want to work with you through many decades to actually become a more conscious leader, conscious development.

552
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:32,480
So that we can help you be of service to your stakeholders, to your customers, to your employees and to your community.

553
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:49,480
They have our clients have almost an inherent blue, like access to healthy blue traditionalism that has them deeply connecting to stakeholder theory and to stakeholder management and to the principles of conscious capitalism.

554
00:51:49,480 --> 00:52:01,480
And I'm being a little, this is a little bit of an exaggeration, but when we meet people in New York and people in, especially in like San Francisco, and we asked them what their relationship is with the community.

555
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,480
It's almost, there's no geographic, they're not tethered.

556
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:14,480
There's this orange opportunistic, I want to get mine, I want to grow my company, and then we talk about Time Horizon.

557
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:23,480
And we say, what's your Time Horizon? And so much of what's happening on the coast is about the, I want to get rich in five to seven years.

558
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
We don't work with private equity.

559
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,480
We don't, none of the short term capital is works with our model.

560
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:41,480
And so that would be my answer is that there's this healthy community orientation and it just seems like, why do you call it stakeholder theory?

561
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:48,480
It just seems like that's the right thing to do. You take care of your employees and your employees will take care of you.

562
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,480
You take care of your customers and your customers will stay loyal.

563
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:04,480
You take care of your vendors and make sure that they can make enough money, even though you have to, you know, you have to negotiate, but you don't want to, you know, squeeze them so hard that they can't continue to supply you because then that hurts you long term.

564
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:14,480
These things that seem so sophisticated in their language, the Heartland often says, that just seems like the right way to do business.

565
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,480
If that makes sense to you guys, like this is just once again our experience.

566
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Okay, David.

567
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,480
The other thing I see there ran is less content for the working class.

568
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I mean, I was on a call a couple weeks ago where somebody studied all seriousness.

569
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:38,480
How do we stop working class folks from voting because they are so ignorant they can't make good political decisions.

570
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,480
And I mean, I'm just OMG, right?

571
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,480
I don't even know what to say to that.

572
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:55,480
And even when people disagree, they're still in a lot of that Heartland, there's that sense of civility that's required.

573
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,480
And there's the sense that, you know, you just don't treat people badly.

574
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:12,480
And I hate to say it about a lot of the progressive left, but, you know, they'll treat anybody badly if they don't agree with them.

575
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
And that's pretty pathetic.

576
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,480
Yeah, and Barbara, I want to share something then to let David come in.

577
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:30,480
And Steve really worked with me and really helped me along with Bert and Jeff because we had several years during the pandemic that we were supporting each other on Zoom and we were sort of locked in our houses.

578
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:38,480
And what I used to assume is that I held the spiral in my mind.

579
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:46,480
And I was like, we have to see individuals in our country go to green so they can go to yellow so they can go to integral.

580
00:54:46,480 --> 00:55:06,480
And what Steve helped me to realize is because there is so much progressive pluralistic green at a societal and Wilbur's quadrants lower left space in the culture of America, because we have been shaped and we have been exposed to so much of that,

581
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:29,480
those means, those value systems, that people who are at an individual level, their interior structure being more orange blue, or maybe even blue orange, if you think primary and secondary, that they have enough exposure to the green to be able to actually make a move up to integral.

582
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:41,480
And so we're actually saying, you know, the assumption that I had for years was we could the only people we can work with are people who are already progressive who want to go post progressive.

583
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:53,480
And that's not our experience. Now our experience is we're working with Heartland achievers who are Christians who have strong faith and they're reading Ken Wilbur.

584
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:11,480
And they're like, we're going to build an integral company, because they also have a multicultural sensibility, because they also are able to feel into the healthy parts of green to a to enough of a degree, but they don't want to live there.

585
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:28,480
They want to appreciate the parts that are that are healthy for them, and they want to keep their faith if they're faith based, and not all of our clients are faith based, but many of them are, and they also want to be able to maintain their healthy orange their healthy achievement.

586
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:44,480
And so we're in a we're in an experiment of moving people up the spiral to towards yellow towards an integrated view, even though it doesn't look like a typical, you know, progressive that's ready to pop to yellow.

587
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,480
So David you're up.

588
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,480
All right. Thank you, Rand. This is, this is so stimulating.

589
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:11,480
So my own sense as kind of an outsider to the business world is that a lot of the di stuff is people using green language, but coming from a sort of blue absolutistic altitude, where you know we have the truth, almost authoritarian.

590
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:30,480
So I'm curious to hear in your experience, what percentage of it is that, if that's right. And then how do you work with leaders to try and make fine grain distinctions, so that they're not sort of dismissing all of progressivism as just this,

591
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:40,480
sort of absolutistic because from an orange perspective, they'd be correctly seeing that as, you know, regressive and sort of a drag.

592
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:49,480
So yeah, I'm curious to hear your thoughts about how you help leaders think through the dynamics, the complicated dynamics between these, these different worldviews.

593
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:58,480
Well, I mean, there's no easy answer for that. The first thing we do is just help leaders to recognize that these worldviews exist.

594
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Because so many of our clients have never really thought about this. They're, they're, they make these assumptions that, you know, everybody's making meaning the way I'm making meaning.

595
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:19,480
And so by just starting with the fact that there are distinctions, our clients are like smoke comes out their ears, and then to bring in the light and shadow.

596
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Oh, so I don't have to conflate the shadow with the person or the shadow of that, of that, of everyone in that worldview, that everybody is like the shadow because they're not.

597
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:45,480
And we get them to take responsibility that there's a shadow where they stand. And we have to have them do a self assessment of where is the shadow of my own worldview.

598
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:56,480
And so David with that, what that does is that's destabilizing enough just to start to get them to start groping into a more nuanced and complex set of questions.

599
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,480
And we often are, and I'll use a rubber band here.

600
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Our clients and the leaders we work with.

601
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,480
But our problem solvers. So when they experience tension.

602
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Their assumption is that's a problem to be solved.

603
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:21,480
I got to solve that one of the ways that you actually get rid of tension is the denial or the avoiding of the conflict.

604
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:29,480
And so we work with our clients to build a new relationship with tension where they can actually be in a creative tension.

605
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,480
And we help them understand that, yes, there's destructive tension if I pulled too hard on this, the rubber band would break.

606
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:46,480
But if I bring the enough tension where I have energy, there's energy for transformation and change that the generative process of development requires energy.

607
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,480
And we help our clients to realize, maybe I need to build a new relationship with tension itself.

608
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,480
And maybe when I'm in the presence, like I will, I will, I will reveal a couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech.

609
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,480
It was a higher ground speech very similar to the slides you just saw.

610
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:07,480
It got a standing ovation, which my ego loves. Okay. And I'm still, I'm still in my own work.

611
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:17,480
The reason I know how far I have to go is that when I get a standing ovation, I actually get a hit of like, like, oh, validation.

612
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:24,480
And when people are not that enthusiastic after my speech, I actually feel like I want validation.

613
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:32,480
So I know I'm still, I'm still, I'm still far from, you know, being high up on the developmental progression because I get these clues.

614
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:41,480
And, but, but my, my assumption was the speech was well received to women came up to me after the speech because I asked for feedback.

615
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I said, if you have feedback, please come find me.

616
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,480
I'd love feedback and especially, especially feedback that is critical of my presentation.

617
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:57,480
And these were two black women who were so courageous and they were so passionate and they came to me and they gave me exactly what I asked for.

618
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:03,480
And they helped me to realize that I, they told me they did not like my speech.

619
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,480
They told me they were offended by my speech.

620
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:17,480
They would not introduce themselves by name and it was a conference with with name badges and the one woman who was speaking on behalf of the two of them took her badge off before she came over to speak to me.

621
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,480
When I put my hand out and introduced myself, she wouldn't introduce herself and wouldn't shake my hand.

622
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,480
And they came at me hard guys when I say hard, hard.

623
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,480
It was aggressive.

624
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,480
And this is what I felt.

625
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,480
And what I wanted to do was, was walk away.

626
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
Okay.

627
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Because I felt like it was inappropriate how aggressive they were coming, but I stayed in it.

628
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,480
And I took a big deep breath.

629
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:53,480
And I, and I kept coming and I said to them, the feedback you're giving me right now is really hard.

630
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,480
I'm really struggling.

631
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,480
I'm super confused.

632
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,480
And I want you to keep coming.

633
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,480
Don't stop.

634
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,480
And I just, I just, and they just kept coming.

635
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:12,480
And the more they came at me, the more I surrendered and stayed in this tension and just said to myself, Oh, this is me.

636
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,480
And my growth edge, this is me actually needing to learn and grow.

637
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:29,480
And I actually got so, I got so like relaxed, almost like the idea of surrendering to win that they calmed down.

638
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,480
And the more the softer I got the softer they got was like a 10 minute conversation.

639
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,480
And then I said, tell me more, tell me more, tell me more.

640
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:48,480
And what they were really upset by is I told a story on that speech about when George Floyd was murdered about how disoriented it was, disorienting it was for me.

641
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,480
And I talked about the Tom Peters idea that if you're not confused, you're not paying attention.

642
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,480
And I said, I was so confused.

643
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,480
And I went to my neighbors and I was outside a couple of days after George Floyd was killed.

644
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,480
And they said to me, Rand, you don't look good.

645
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,480
And I was like, I hadn't been, I wasn't sleeping.

646
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
I was crying.

647
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,480
I was super disoriented.

648
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,480
And I said, guys, I'm not good.

649
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Like, what do you mean?

650
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,480
What's wrong with me?

651
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
Like, aren't you paying attention like George Floyd?

652
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,480
And they're like, George who?

653
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,480
Because look, I live in a neighborhood with a bunch of rich white guys.

654
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,480
And they weren't paying attention.

655
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,480
And I was paying attention.

656
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,480
And because I was paying attention, I was confused and they weren't confused.

657
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,480
So these women said to me, it took me four years.

658
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,480
I got this feedback two weeks ago.

659
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:43,480
They said they were offended that I would suggest that anyone would be confused by that because if you grew up the way they grew up, it wasn't confusing at all to them.

660
01:03:43,480 --> 01:04:01,480
And so now I actually am more sensitive to the fact that when I'm in front of a group of people and I tell that story, I don't want to tell that story without also recognizing that other people from a different life, different color skin were not confused by that.

661
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,480
But the fact that I didn't have that nuance really upset them.

662
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,480
And I'm very grateful that I got that feedback.

663
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:19,480
But guys, oh, oh, and at the end of the 10 minutes, the woman put her hand out and she introduced herself by name.

664
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:26,480
And so that might, that was my feedback that this worked a part of me wanted to like, like, like attack them.

665
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,480
Okay.

666
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:34,480
A part of me wanted to the fight another part of me wanted to run away because I could have easy said the guys, I don't need this and walk to it.

667
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,480
But this is what we're trying to teach our clients how to do.

668
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,480
How do you stay in the heat?

669
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,480
This is really hard work.

670
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,480
And most people don't want to do this hard work.

671
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,480
They want to outsource this to their diversity consultant.

672
01:04:51,480 --> 01:05:00,480
And they're like, they're looking at their consultant and the consultant needs to be saying to their client, you're not going to get stronger watching me do push ups.

673
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,480
Like, you can't, you can outsource almost everything.

674
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,480
If you're, if you're successful and you're powerful, but you can't outsource your own development.

675
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,480
And this is what we need people to do is to step into their own work.

676
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,480
I don't know, David, if that's helping at all, but.

677
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,480
The story was all you needed. That was great. Thank you.

678
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Thank you, John.

679
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,480
John dupe dupe dupe dupe dupe.

680
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,480
Yeah. Anyway, I just want to.

681
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Thank you for this and such a healthy, powerful expression of our integral thing that you're that you're doing. It's really great.

682
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,480
And I almost want to pass because I don't know if this, how this directly applies to the work you're doing.

683
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,480
But I would value your, your opinion on, on seeking a higher ground.

684
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:55,480
And for the last and how this affects the companies and the populations that you're working with.

685
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,480
For the last 25 years I've watched, I said.

686
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,480
I noted a long time ago that we, if.

687
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,480
There wasn't some way to absorb the, not the immigration, but the migration.

688
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:14,480
In other words, millions of people crossing borders of different languages, different cultures, different developmental levels.

689
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,480
It would lead to the rise of the reactionary right neo fascism.

690
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:29,480
And it would be a great threat to liberal democracies, which you see in Hungary, seen Sweden, we see in our country.

691
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,480
Russia's weaponizing immigration with Finland.

692
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:49,480
I mean, the Brexit without without that, it probably wouldn't have happened. And so, and, and there's, there's different perspectives from each of these, these level the progressive traditionalists and the Chiebers and.

693
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,480
You know, there's.

694
01:06:52,480 --> 01:07:03,480
Definite problems and there's definite good things like we, we get this dynamic workforce of millions of people are willing to work hard for, you know, less than we'd have to pay an American I mean there's good stuff.

695
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:13,480
And I've worked with a lot of them they're very hard working and have a lot of integrity for the most part. And then again as bad people as as Donald, you know, likes to tell us all the time.

696
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,480
But is, have you seen that pressure.

697
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Asserting itself in the work that you do.

698
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:37,480
And have you been able to work with these different perspectives at each, each of these different level bring and find a higher level of of an integral thing that could really help us successfully deal with this.

699
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Given fact of the mass migrations all over the world of people and, you know, threatening different cultures and different developmental levels. Is there any light in your work in that particular.

700
01:07:51,480 --> 01:08:03,480
Finally, because I look at the time we got eight minutes left, I'm going to, you say you were going to pass I'm going to pass on trying to, to try to even answer a really important beautiful complex question.

701
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,480
And I'll give a couple of sort of like just wondering for myself.

702
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:22,480
I wonder what the consequences are of embracing so much immigration and so much diversity that we lose a shared center.

703
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:31,480
And if we don't have a center in which we are able to subordinate ourselves to which, which was at least what I was growing up.

704
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:40,480
The one thing I felt American shared in common, especially during the Cold War was a patriotism that we were Americans.

705
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:45,480
Yes, I'm a Texan and someone else is from California and someone else from New York, but we're Americans.

706
01:08:45,480 --> 01:09:07,480
And if we continue to see the loss of the, of the center because of this demand for multiculturalism, and this is counterintuitive again, the multiculturalism that, that, that can exist so in such a healthy way at the periphery of a society can only exist if there's a strong center.

707
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:11,480
And this is why blue is so important going forward.

708
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:29,480
We must renew and reconnect to what created at a classical liberal Western values Judeo Christian values what created the United States and what created so many European countries was these foundations that that that civilizations are losing touch with.

709
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:43,480
And so the question is, instead of trying to dismantle, how do we renew and revitalize am I handed off to Steve here, which is a great segue because I believe and this is crazy that I say this, but hey, I get to say this.

710
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:52,480
And if clients don't want to work with us, I don't care, because we don't work with big public companies that have to deal with all the politics and all the pressure from social media.

711
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,480
We work with people who are business owners.

712
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,480
And we're like, if you don't want to work with us, don't work with us, but this is spiritual work.

713
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,480
We are we are unapologetic.

714
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,480
The work of higher ground is spiritual work.

715
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:12,480
And we can define spirituality as having a recognition that I am a part of something bigger than myself.

716
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:18,480
And I can be an atheist and still be spiritual, because I feel connected to the cosmos because I feel connected to nature.

717
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,480
But we've got to start to recognize that this is not an intellectual journey.

718
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,480
It is a journey that requires a spiritual orientation.

719
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,480
And Steve, give us give us a few little nuggets of wisdom.

720
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,480
Well, let me just say amen to what you just said.

721
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,480
Our spiritual work.

722
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
Yeah, really, really helpful.

723
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,480
So just a comment and then a quick question.

724
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,480
The comment is, I just want everybody to really appreciate how important it is.

725
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:51,480
And what an excellent job Rand and his organization have done it, simplifying this, right?

726
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,480
Because it's it's complex.

727
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:59,480
But in the course of simplifying it, it's been like a learning lab for the theory.

728
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
I mean, the theory has been improved.

729
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,480
I mean, so, for example, you know, Rand's got their achiever instead of modernism, right?

730
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,480
Like, well, you got to call it modernity.

731
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,480
That's what it is.

732
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,480
And he tried it out.

733
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,480
I tried it.

734
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,480
I tried it.

735
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,480
And they just like, we're in tears in the headlight when you mentioned that term.

736
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:21,480
And so I appreciate that, you know, achiever for the audiences that you're speaking to is actually much more digestible.

737
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,480
And I think that the simplicity of it is really it's illuminated the way I understand there.

738
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,480
You sort of came to that together.

739
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,480
You mentioned it.

740
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,480
That is the simple, the simplest truth is what does development mean?

741
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,480
Right?

742
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:43,480
Everybody, you made it clear that development is this higher ground and that everybody should naturally want to aspire to that.

743
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
And what does that mean?

744
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,480
It simply means expanding the scope of what you can value.

745
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:58,480
I mean, you know, there's more to it than that, but in the spirit of let's get down to the brass taxes and say it as distinct, succinctly and as simply as we can.

746
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:10,480
That's what you're offering in this excellent presentation is a way of people thinking about what it could mean practically to increase the scope of their value by valuing the light, you know, of all of these cultural structures.

747
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:19,480
So that we've learned some things from your on the ground, you know, development of all this.

748
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,480
The question is, yeah, we're the we're the we're the arenas.

749
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,480
I told Steve, I said, Steve, I get with Steve, I say, give me some stuff.

750
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,480
And he's like, oh, here's some stuff.

751
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,480
You know, here's a book.

752
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,480
Here's an article.

753
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:36,480
I go into the arena with my team and we work will work with 3000 leaders this year and programs that are 15 weeks to 52 weeks.

754
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,480
I mean, this is deep, deep work with people and we'll just get beat up and we'll be like, that didn't work.

755
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,480
That didn't work.

756
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,480
That didn't work.

757
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,480
This work.

758
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,480
Let's keep doing that.

759
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,480
And this is how we iterate rapid prototyping.

760
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:52,480
And so, yeah, Steve, I know we're going to we only got three minutes, but if you have a question, I'll do my best to probably.

761
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:59,480
Okay, well, just the simple question is when we you mentioned our zoom conversations that we started to have like in April of 2020, right?

762
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,480
The pandemic had had hit.

763
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,480
And at the time, you know, it was actually before George Floyd's death.

764
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:19,480
And then immediately afterwards, like in the six months between, you know, July and the end of 2020 diversity equity inclusion within the business community had become like a day reger thing.

765
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,480
It's like, like if you didn't have an accounting department, right?

766
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,480
You have to have a DI bureaucracy or you're not, you know, you're, you're a poor business person.

767
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,480
Yeah.

768
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
And of course, you know, we've been the gamble.

769
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
We've seen it.

770
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,480
We see the backlash that is occurring now.

771
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:46,480
And I'm just wondering whether you see it having a long curve or whether it's going to transform into something that's less green or, you know, what do you see the future of DI from what you've gleaned from the business, your business travels?

772
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,480
I am not optimistic, which is very disappointing.

773
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:56,480
I feel like the pendulum is swinging, is swinging and continues to swing.

774
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:01,480
I talked to three leaders in the last week that are shutting down their DI initiatives.

775
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:15,480
I talked to a DEI consultant who's changing his business offering because he's because the demand for his consulting services is diminishing so fast that he's now reinventing himself and doing other kind of consulting.

776
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:22,480
I think you're going to see, I think we're going to see a continued rapid decline of DEI.

777
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:31,480
And I think we're going to see an emergence of something that will be, that will be more, this is the irony, more inclusive.

778
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:41,480
I went to, I'll end with this, I went and gave a speech in October to a group and I put up a big tent and I said, we need to have a big tent.

779
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:55,480
And then I said, we need a tent, a community that includes black and white, male and female, LGBTQ ally, LGBTQ critic.

780
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:01,480
We need people who are fossil fuel executives and people who are environmental activists in the same room.

781
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,480
And then I said to them and they were really freaked out.

782
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,480
I said, you are in a room because I knew the room pretty well.

783
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,480
There are about 300 people, 300 CEOs.

784
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:17,480
I said, you are in a room right now with half the people in this room are going to, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Donald Trump.

785
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,480
And half the people in this room, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Biden.

786
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,480
Look around.

787
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:32,480
You're in the room with people who are way more diverse than you may realize from a diversity of viewpoint and thought.

788
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:39,480
And I think, Steve, that we're going to have to tackle the complexity that we've got to.

789
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,480
Now, I don't think it's going to be under the banner of DEI.

790
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:49,480
I think we're already seeing a shift to DNI, diversity and inclusion.

791
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,480
DNI is what it's being called.

792
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:59,480
I'm just noticing this, that the E is just dropping off with certain more complex organizations are already leading the way on that.

793
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:06,480
So I do predict that DNI will be the next iteration and we'll see what happens.

794
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:12,480
And I'm committed to being a part in some small way of the solution.

795
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,480
I wish I could wave a magic wand and there'd just be the solution out there.

796
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:21,480
But I have very little hope that the progressives are going to solve this.

797
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:32,480
I think we're going to have to solve it by bringing the beauty of green and the progressive approach to diversity and the beauty of orange and the beauty of blue in the conversation.

798
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,480
And so with that, it is 731.

799
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,480
We're already one minute over.

800
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,480
You're going to get the slides.

801
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:44,480
I'm going to put together, Nigel, I'm going to put together a little care package.

802
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,480
I'm going to include a video link to a Heineken commercial, which is going to blow your mind.

803
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,480
It's five minutes and it's going to blow your mind.

804
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,480
It's the best media I have seen on higher ground and of the humanity of coming together.

805
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,480
It's so good.

806
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,480
Watch that video.

807
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,480
It's on YouTube.

808
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,480
So it's a YouTube link.

809
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,480
I'm going to put in the follow up.

810
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,480
I'll give you my slides and I will include a couple of links.

811
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Nigel, I'll get this done before midnight tonight and send it to you.

812
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:19,480
I'll curate a couple of other things that people who got their curiosity peaked.

813
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:33,480
Some additional one other video from Reba Wisdom that took me two years to find this 45 minute interview with a woman who I actually think from London has an incredible point of view on diversity.

814
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:51,480
And another link to a video, it's 11 minutes of a headmistress in London, who's maybe the best example of how conservative values can create a rich multicultural diverse community at a school that she runs.

815
01:17:51,480 --> 01:18:06,480
And it's mind boggling what she's doing with Christian lower C conservative values, creating the conditions for a thriving diversity, which doesn't seem like those two go together.

816
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:25,480
And, and you guys enjoy your adventures and your journey and I hope to come back as a attendee at another one of these and listen into the wonderful teachers and, and guess that you guys get to hear from regularly and thank you again for the invitation Steve and and everyone for being here.

817
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,480
Thank you.

818
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,480
Thank you.

819
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,480
Thanks guys.
