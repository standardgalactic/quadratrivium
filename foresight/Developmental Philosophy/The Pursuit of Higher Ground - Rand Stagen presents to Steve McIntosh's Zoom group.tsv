0	2920	So should we just jump in?
2920	4320	Raja, are we ready to go?
4320	5320	Yeah, go for it.
5320	6320	All right.
6320	11840	So we've got an hour and 15 minutes together.
11840	16000	We're going to make this as interactive as possible.
16000	19600	I consider this a relatively small size group,
19600	21480	so I think this is manageable.
21480	23440	Less than 50 people on Zoom.
23440	26080	I can see all your faces on one screen on my big monitor,
27040	30560	and I'm looking forward to doing a couple things.
30560	32080	Number one, I'm going to provide you
32080	35560	a little bit of background upfront
35560	37040	on the Stagan Leadership Academy,
37040	39920	which we found it 25 years ago this year.
39920	45720	And then I'm going to share with you a piece of content
45720	49520	that we call the pursuit of higher ground,
49520	54840	that is our most recent expression
54840	58720	of how to translate developmental theory,
58720	63360	integral theory, spiral dynamics, and complexity theory,
63360	65360	for all intents and purposes, how
65360	71080	to translate that into the listening of a broad audience
71080	75040	from traditionalists to progressives.
75040	81840	So this content can be delivered in as short as a 18-minute
81840	84680	keynote speech in front of 1,000 people.
85560	87840	I do this in large groups all the time.
87840	92320	And the feedback that I have gotten in the last two years
92320	94920	of let's just I'm still in the experimental phase
94920	99280	with this material is incredibly positive across the board.
99280	102800	And so rather than just share the content
102800	105240	and treat you like a normal audience,
105240	108560	I'm going to treat you as you are, your fellow travelers,
108560	111920	where we're all students of integral theory,
111920	114480	developmental theory, and I see this more
115160	117160	as a peer group than anything else.
117160	120200	So I'll present the material.
120200	121920	I just have a handful of slides.
121920	124680	And that'll be a little didactic, little presentation mode.
124680	126800	And then we'll come out of that.
126800	130080	And instead of waiting until the end of the call for Q&A,
130080	134680	we'll actually start with the Q&A right after I clear the slides
134680	137240	so that I can use your questions to continue
137240	139200	sharing and presenting.
139200	141840	I am not an academic.
141840	143240	I am not a theorist.
143240	147000	We've got the big brains on this call.
147000	148720	Salisman is here and others.
148720	152280	And we're practitioners, as Steve knows.
152280	155360	Bert and I, Bert Parley, who was with Ken Wilbur,
155360	159520	who I met through Ken Wilbur almost 22 years ago,
159520	164280	we are in the arena working with leaders
164280	168040	on a daily basis that are running organizations.
168040	172120	We primarily work with privately held businesses
172120	175240	and executives within those enterprises.
175240	178600	And our sweet spot is the mid-market.
178600	180520	And for people, what does that mean?
180520	183520	That means companies with a couple hundred employees
183520	186840	to a couple thousand employees, that sort of range.
186840	189120	The reason that we don't work by design
189120	191320	with large public companies
191320	194600	is we will only work with an organization
194600	197840	if the CEO of that organization
197840	201240	is engaged in their own deep inner work.
201280	204440	If they're not willing to actually look at themselves
204440	205920	and work on themselves,
205920	209080	we will not go into the organization
209080	210400	to work with their people.
210400	214520	So yes, we do work with some public companies.
214520	216480	Many years of working with Whole Foods
216480	219680	and working with John Mackey and his top 300 leaders
219680	222800	were their partner for the sort of executive development there.
222800	225600	But that is one of the few big known companies
225600	229080	we work with because John is someone who's willing
229080	232720	to walk the talk and actually work on himself.
232720	234920	But that unfortunately is really rare
234920	239680	with CEOs of typically large, 41,000 businesses.
239680	242280	So that's a little context on who we are,
242280	246680	what we're about, as Ken referred to us,
246680	249760	had to have been almost maybe 17 or 18 years ago.
249760	252480	They're the little experiment in Dallas,
252480	254520	like what's going on in Dallas.
254520	256920	And people will often say,
257840	259720	you guys work with,
259720	263160	we have a physical brick and mortar facility,
263160	264880	a leadership academy in Dallas.
264880	266320	We have our team,
266320	269160	Bert and I just came out of our annual team retreat.
269160	272400	We had 72, not the whole team, but 72 attendees there
272400	275120	just to give you a sense of our size, our faculty.
275120	278440	And as Rajeal said, we work with several thousand leaders
278440	281080	each year across the country that either come to Dallas
281080	283120	or we go to their organizations.
283120	288120	And we are, people will say, why are you in Dallas?
288520	290040	Like it makes no sense.
290040	291480	You're working with Wilbur,
291480	292880	you're working with Bob Keegan,
292880	294200	you're working with Bill Torberts,
294200	296920	who's on Cochlorida, cutting edge, integral theory.
296920	300120	Like what are you doing in Dallas, Texas?
300120	304640	And the answer is, this is where the work is, right?
304640	307560	This is where the work is, this is where the need is.
307560	310160	So we are in the heartland.
310160	315160	We work extensively in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin.
316440	319680	We work in Oklahoma, Louisiana.
319680	322440	We work really deeply in Kansas.
322440	324800	We work in Ohio, in Illinois.
324800	326360	We go down into Georgia.
326360	329920	We really are in sort of the middle of the country
329920	332440	and a little bit down into the Southeast.
332440	336520	We are not heavily penetrated by design on the coast.
336520	338800	Yes, we have clients in Seattle and New York
339200	343440	and in California, but the mass focus for us
343440	345840	has been heartland and I'll explain that
345840	347520	after I clear the slides.
347520	351480	So that's background context, a segmentation where we focus
351480	353760	and we're not in the entertainment business.
353760	357840	So we don't do any event-based training.
357840	361760	Our shortest program for a new client is a 52 week
361760	364480	practice-based, integrally informed program
364480	366640	where they come to Dallas one day per quarter
366640	368600	in a cohort of 20 liters.
368600	370160	From anywhere in the country
370160	374640	and we will only work with a client if the CEO goes first.
374640	378800	So now let's get to the juicy part, get to the content.
378800	382960	So I have been, along with my team,
383920	386680	trying to figure out how to crack the code
386680	391680	on a skillful means, on a translation of spiral dynamics.
391680	396680	We started teaching our leaders, our clients, the spiral.
396760	400040	And we basically did it as a developmental progression
400040	405040	as it is laid out by Don Beck and by Claire Graves' research.
406160	410880	And what would happen is the world views,
410880	414440	the traditional world view, lower down,
414440	418280	was very threatened by the hierarchical nature of the model.
418280	422800	The achievers, the strive-drive kind of orange world view
423760	426680	would look to figure out how they could
426680	428880	sort of game and climb the ladder.
428880	431840	So they just wanted us to click the slides faster
431840	434400	so they could kind of move through the progression.
434400	437240	The pluralists, the progressives,
437240	441560	were incredibly offended by the hierarchical nature
441560	443440	of what we were laying out.
443440	445800	So after about five or six years,
445800	450080	we moved from a vertical rendering
450080	454720	and we presented picking four of the colors,
454720	457280	red, blue, orange and green.
457280	459800	And for those that don't know spiral dynamics,
459800	462760	this sort of power mindset or power worldview,
462760	466320	red, the more traditional worldview, blue,
466320	468880	the more achiever worldview, orange,
468880	472000	and the more progressive pluralistic worldview, green.
472000	473880	And we basically laid them out
473880	477120	as we're still doing today in our curriculum
477120	480960	as a little bit more of a horizontal
480960	485080	and saying that there's not one that's better than the other
485080	488080	because in reality, one isn't better than the other.
488080	491840	They all are appropriate in the appropriate context.
491840	494360	And so what's the context is what's best?
494360	498320	And so that has been, for some people in the integral community,
498320	499800	that was blasphemy.
499800	501440	Like how could you do that?
501440	505360	How could you make this appear to be almost a type system?
505360	508360	And the answer is we're meeting people where they are.
508360	511480	We're not demanding that they meet us where we are
511480	515480	because we're up in the ivory tower from their perspective.
515480	517680	And so it's been an incredibly powerful
517680	521160	and potent strategy, communication strategy
521160	524160	because it works and it's getting people into the game
524160	527480	of understanding the nuances of development.
527480	532480	And then in 2021 with Steve as really a guide to me,
532480	536480	he introduced in an article, this idea,
536480	538480	it was just a sentence, right Steve?
538480	540480	It was just a simple sentence saying,
540480	544480	I no longer, I'm no longer believing that common ground
544480	546480	is going to be the fullness of what we need.
546480	547480	We need higher ground.
547480	549480	We need more than just common ground.
549480	552480	And I grabbed on that term and said,
552480	555480	there's something really magical about this idea
555480	559480	of higher ground and ultimately was able to build
559480	562480	a new expression, which I'm about to share with you
562480	566480	in the form of what is now a keynote presentation.
566480	570480	I'm going to send Rigel the slides.
570480	575480	It's a small, email-able PowerPoint file.
575480	577480	So if you want to send it out to everybody
577480	580480	in the spirit of abundance, everyone could have these slides.
580480	586480	And so the move here was how can we actually
587480	592480	put red to the side and really focus on the traditional,
595480	598480	the achiever and the pluralist,
598480	602480	that sort of blue, orange and green worldviews
602480	605480	and bring in yellow in what I hope you will see
605480	610480	as a very creative way of inviting people
610480	613480	into a more of an integrated orientation.
614480	620480	The title of this content is the pursuit of higher ground.
620480	625480	And the word pursuit is incredibly precise
625480	629480	because we don't want anyone to suggest,
629480	633480	like to suggest themselves or to infer
633480	637480	that we, an integral community, are up on higher ground
637480	641480	and we're putting our hand down to help others come up to us.
642480	645480	That would be unskillful and presumptive
645480	647480	and it could come across as arrogant.
647480	652480	And so the frame here is we are all in a place
652480	656480	where we together can pursue higher ground,
656480	660480	where we can all look at this slide in the pursuit of something
660480	664480	and a dynamic journey towards something aspirational
664480	666480	and something higher.
666480	671480	And then this image here, as many of you know
671480	675480	from Steve's book of developmental politics,
675480	679480	how America can grow into a better version of itself.
679480	683480	Right now, the version so many of us are experiencing
683480	687480	is hyperpolarization, is this culture war,
687480	692480	is this time in which people are experiencing
692480	696480	incredible confusion and conflict and emotion
696480	699480	and if we talk to the average American and ask them
699480	703480	what's going on, they're likely going to say things like,
703480	708480	well, we have issues with racial issues in America.
708480	711480	We have issues with climate in America
711480	713480	in which there are climate deniers
713480	717480	and people who are not sensitive to what's going on.
717480	720480	We have huge income inequality.
720480	722480	We have all these issues.
722480	726480	So pick them, race, climate, income inequality
726480	729480	and what we would say from a developmental standpoint
729480	733480	is that those are actually not the real issue.
733480	737480	Those are the symptoms of the real issue.
737480	741480	So if we were to go upstream of the polarization,
741480	744480	we would assert that there's actually a conflict of world
744480	749480	views that's showing up with those symptoms.
749480	754480	And so the idea is to introduce
754480	759480	that if we were walking down a street in a major city,
759480	764480	we would be interpreting what was going on in the world.
764480	769480	We would be relating with the world through the lens
769480	772480	that we're wearing through our world views.
772480	775480	And we invite, in this case, an audience
775480	778480	to recognize that in many ways,
778480	781480	we don't see the world as it is.
781480	783480	We see the world as we are,
783480	786480	which is a concept I think many of you are familiar with.
786480	789480	We don't see the world as it is objectively.
789480	794480	We are always filtering and we're always interpreting
794480	798480	through the lens at which we're making meaning of the world
798480	801480	and thus the idea of a world view.
801480	803480	And so then we go in and say,
803480	804480	and these are,
804480	806480	I'm bringing you guys behind the curtain a little bit.
806480	807480	I don't normally, you know,
807480	810480	pause and offer up these nuances here,
810480	813480	but please pay attention to the placement
813480	816480	of where these colors are on the screen.
816480	819480	So we start with introducing the idea
819480	824480	that there are three dominant world views in America today,
824480	828480	and we introduce this idea of an achiever world view.
828480	832480	And we talk about how this would be your capitalist crowd,
832480	836480	your business people, and with the achievers,
836480	838480	from this world view,
838480	841480	there are a lot of healthy contributions that achievers
841480	845480	have made and continue to make to America and to the world.
845480	849480	And we talk about that as the light of the achiever world view,
849480	852480	things like modern medicine
852480	854480	and things like economic development.
854480	858480	And yet, even though there are all these wonderful expressions
858480	861480	and contributions from the achiever world view,
861480	864480	where there is light, there is also shadow.
864480	866480	There is pathology.
866480	869480	There are these very destructive forces
869480	872480	that come from the achiever world view.
872480	877480	Things like greed and self-dealing and cronyism
877480	882480	and regulatory capture of environmental destruction.
882480	886480	And so it's this capacity to be able to recognize
886480	889480	the light and the shadow,
889480	892480	to be able to say, look at how long we are living
892480	897480	relative to just 100 years ago thanks to modern medicine.
897480	900480	Look at this incredible economic development
900480	903480	that has allowed so much of humanity to flourish
903480	907480	and coming out of poverty at a continued increasing rate.
907480	912480	And yet, there are these shadows within the achiever world view.
912480	916480	And then we introduce, notice it's on the right here.
916480	918480	I don't normally say that.
918480	921480	We introduce the traditional world view.
921480	926480	And we say those who are operating with a traditional world view
926480	930480	also have light and contributions.
930480	934480	And the traditional world view brings us family values,
934480	938480	brings us law and order, brings us structure,
938480	945480	brings us so many elements of our society that keep order.
945480	950480	And yet, there is a shadow of traditionalism.
950480	953480	And traditionalist shadows can include things like bigotry
953480	958480	or homophobia or racism, not at a systemic level,
958480	961480	but at an individual level, like actual racism.
961480	966480	There is a shadow here and things like anti-science.
966480	969480	Not believing in science, which is in conflict
969480	973480	with the achiever world view, which brings us science.
973480	978480	And then lastly, we introduce this idea of the progressive world view.
978480	982480	And the progressive world view has incredible contributions,
982480	985480	a multicultural orientation,
985480	988480	a recognition of previously marginalized communities,
988480	994480	a ability to be incredibly sensitive to the earth
994480	997480	and to the natural system and to the environment.
997480	1001480	And yet, where there is light, there is shadow.
1001480	1003480	And in the shadow of progressivism,
1003480	1007480	we see things like corrosive identity politics.
1007480	1010480	And we also see cancel culture.
1010480	1017480	And we see a form of DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion,
1017480	1022480	a form of inclusion that says you are included
1022480	1026480	as long as you see the world through a progressive lens.
1026480	1029480	And so when I talk to my progressive friends
1029480	1034480	and I talk about what's going on with diversity, equity and inclusion in America,
1034480	1038480	they say we need to heal America, if you remember the prior slide.
1038480	1042480	And I say, well, where are the people who voted for Donald Trump?
1042480	1047480	And they're like, well, they're not welcome at this conversation, at this table,
1047480	1049480	because they voted for Donald Trump.
1049480	1054480	And there's such a contradiction there that we stand for inclusion,
1054480	1058480	but there are conditions with that form of inclusion.
1058480	1066480	And I want you all to know that I am terrified by the shadow of all three of these world views.
1066480	1075480	The dark underbelly of all three are horrific in their most extreme expression.
1075480	1080480	And I adore the healthy expression of all three.
1080480	1085480	And so when people say, well, Rand, which one's better?
1085480	1088480	The answer is it depends, right? It depends.
1088480	1095480	And so now what happens in America, what is happening, and we all know this because we're living it every day,
1095480	1106480	is we're seeing how the parts of our country that are struggling to make sense of what's happening,
1106480	1114480	what they start to do is they start to look for a way to manage their own anxiety.
1114480	1123480	And they start to look to see which of these camps, which of these world views most resonate with me.
1123480	1125480	And we call this the easy button.
1125480	1133480	And they punch the easy button and subordinate themselves to the narrative that most resonates with them.
1133480	1137480	And to make things a little simpler, because we don't have a large amount of time tonight,
1137480	1142480	I'm going to just go to the traditionalist on the right and the progressives on the left
1142480	1147480	and say, OK, if I'm on the traditionalist on the right, it's Fox.
1147480	1151480	And that's my news channel, and that's my echo chamber that I'm going to join.
1151480	1155480	And I'm going to read magazines, and I'm going to read social media,
1155480	1160480	and I'm going to subscribe to that channel, that camp.
1160480	1166480	But if I'm on the progressive side, I'm on MSNBC, I'm on CNN, I'm on The View,
1166480	1175480	and I'm going to actually start to subscribe to those parts of the world view echo chambers that most resonate with me.
1175480	1184480	And the problem, and we all know this, is when we actually are in a traditionalist camp criticizing the progressives,
1184480	1192480	what the traditionalist media is doing is they are amplifying the shadow of the progressives.
1192480	1197480	And then what the progressive camps are doing in their expressions of media,
1197480	1201480	and the monetization that comes from all of this with outrage,
1201480	1209480	is that the progressives are amplifying, when they criticize the traditionalist, the shadows of the traditionalist.
1209480	1217480	So what's happening is the worst of the other is being amplified and put forth as the other.
1217480	1223480	And I want to say this again, the worst of the other is being put forth as the totality of the other,
1223480	1232480	which actually leads Americans to believe that we are more divided than we actually are.
1232480	1241480	I genuinely believe that we are being told that we're divided at a level that's not,
1241480	1247480	at least my direct experience on the ground, navigating all three of these camps on a regular basis.
1247480	1253480	And so what do we do? What is the path forward?
1253480	1260480	And so I want, for those of you who know the idea of the dialectic, I want to introduce that here,
1260480	1264480	because it's very useful and it's also very accessible.
1264480	1272480	So the dialectic would say that there's a thesis and there's an antithesis to that thesis.
1272480	1275480	So thesis and antithesis.
1275480	1284480	And then from the thesis and antithesis, we actually have a synthesis that emerges above that, a higher order synthesis.
1284480	1289480	And so when we take the traditionalists with part of the achiever on the right,
1289480	1295480	and let's hold them out as the thesis of American exceptionalism, and these are people,
1295480	1303480	and Steve really gave me this particular language, these are people who want to protect what's right with America.
1303480	1308480	And then on the left, the progressives and sort of part of the achiever group also,
1308480	1314480	that is a group that wants to actually fix what's wrong with America.
1314480	1320480	And so we have this incredible conflict between those who want to protect what's right
1320480	1327480	and those who want to fix what's wrong with America, and they're banging into each other like tectonic plates.
1327480	1335480	And when we ask ourselves which one of these groups is, quote, right, the answer is they're both partially right.
1335480	1344480	And when I'm with an audience, I will literally say, if you feel like there are things that we need to protect about America,
1344480	1348480	raise your hand, and in almost every room, all the hands go up.
1348480	1355480	And then I say, if you think that there are things that we need to fix, things that are wrong with America,
1355480	1358480	raise your hand, almost all the hands go up.
1358480	1363480	It's not half and half, almost everyone can relate with both of these orientations.
1363480	1373480	And so then what we say is, if we want to move to a higher order synthesis, we are not going to get there simply by finding common ground.
1373480	1375480	We need common ground.
1375480	1381480	We need compromise, which we're not seeing much of these days in our politicians.
1381480	1384480	So I don't want to marginalize common ground.
1384480	1391480	But as Wilbur would say, common ground is necessary, but not sufficient.
1391480	1394480	It's not going to get us where we need to go.
1394480	1400480	So I want you guys to imagine that we find a common ground among these three world views.
1400480	1410480	And we were able to use that common ground as a solid ground from which to move upwards so that we can actually move to what we really need,
1410480	1413480	which is a higher ground synthesis and integration.
1413480	1417480	And so here we go to finish out the slides and then we can get into Q&A.
1417480	1419480	So higher ground.
1419480	1430480	And now we're going to say at higher ground, we're going to do everything we can to actually leave behind the shadows.
1430480	1448480	We're not going to be able to leave all of it behind, but we're going to try to limit the shadows of all three and then take the unique contributions, the light of all three and move those into an integrated in synthesized orientation.
1448480	1457480	And notice, once again, I don't normally say this, bringing the light of the three world views up to higher ground and making yellow,
1457480	1466480	which most audiences see as a sun happens to coincide with yellow and spiral dynamics as something that just worked out in a beautiful,
1466480	1472480	almost unintentional way when this was first being created as a body of content.
1472480	1482480	And so then what we say is what we need to recognize is that people think this is idealistic.
1482480	1489480	They think that, you know, Rand, you know, what you're trying to bring everyone with you, what about the bad actors?
1489480	1501480	And what we say is, you know, don't throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater and don't conflate the shadow behaviors of all three of these world views with the human beings.
1501480	1513480	We want to imagine a circle of compassion, a circle of inclusion, and we want to imagine at higher ground that no one is standing outside that circle.
1513480	1521480	So we want to be inclusive of the human beings, but we do not want to be inclusive of the pathological behaviors.
1522480	1531480	And there are a tremendous number of behaviors that are happening right now that we do not want to tolerate.
1531480	1537480	We want to be intolerant of the pathology, but we don't want to throw out the human being.
1537480	1544480	And the example I give when people want an illustration, I say, imagine when Pope John Paul was shot,
1544480	1549480	and we may all remember that experience of watching him almost be killed.
1549480	1557480	After he healed, he went in and visited with the prisoner who had been captured, his would-be assassin.
1557480	1562480	And I want you guys to imagine, you might remember in Life Magazine, the cover of Life Magazine,
1562480	1571480	when the Pope was sitting in the corner with no shackles on the would-be assassin holding his hands forgiving him.
1571480	1580480	And so after he forgave his assassin and he went outside of the jail, the Pope did not say to the jailers,
1580480	1583480	now that I've forgiven him, you need to let him out of prison.
1583480	1589480	He said, I have forgiven him as a child of God, but he needs to stay in prison.
1589480	1593480	And that is an example of discernment.
1593480	1602480	So we can be non-judgmental of the spirit, but we can still have discernment for the consequences of the behavior
1602480	1608480	and for the potential risk that he poses to himself or to society if he weren't in prison.
1608480	1616480	So this move from the lower level to the higher level is really a move out of being judgmental
1617480	1625480	and still maintaining our discernment with boundaries as we move to higher ground, which can be a very fierce place.
1625480	1636480	People think, yes, the Rumi quote, which is beautiful and inspiring, there's a field at higher ground.
1636480	1643480	And beyond right doing, beyond wrong doing, there is this field, I'll meet you there.
1643480	1649480	There's a lot of beautiful poetry about the idea of higher ground and there's an end here.
1649480	1655480	There needs to also be a fierceness and a responsibility of leaders at higher ground
1655480	1661480	to actually make choices in service of the whole, in service of the system
1661480	1668480	to recognize that the system is held together, especially with very healthy blue
1668480	1676480	and when green wants to dismantle and completely eliminate blue, defund the police,
1676480	1685480	pick your attack on blue from green, that actually is incredibly threatening to the stability for all of us and for all of this.
1685480	1694480	And so, and by the way, when orange wants to exploit what's going on with the economics of outrage,
1694480	1702480	that shadow and orange is actually fueling our polarization because the amount of money that Facebook and social media companies are making off of the outrage.
1702480	1710480	Oh, and let's not forget about blue because blue has all sorts of intolerance that also need to be recognized.
1710480	1720480	And so this move here is a move to recognizing that in many ways we have always had a rich diversity in America.
1720480	1723480	And this is the last slide.
1723480	1731480	And most of you know our motto as a country, e pluribus unum out of many one out of the diversity.
1731480	1735480	There is a unity out of this incredible complexity.
1735480	1737480	There is a diversity.
1737480	1752480	So there is a there is a tremendous wisdom that exists at the base at the foundation of the United States that we actually are going at stake and we're going back to to renew ourselves to revitalize and to reconnect.
1752480	1756480	And so that's a little peek into some content.
1756480	1775480	And this isn't being delivered to academics this is being delivered to pedestrians to people who are struggling day in and day out, and our one prescription, when people say, what can I do, what can I do, and what can I do that's actionable.
1775480	1782480	And my answer is break bread with people who you would normally never break bread with.
1782480	1784480	Go and have a dinner.
1784480	1799480	Go drink some wine and sit for three hours with people who are on the other side of the aisle from you, and actually see that you have much more in common than you than you might imagine.
1799480	1811480	And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get more and more, not just of our clients, but anyone that we touch to start getting into dialogue and start getting to discussion with a greater diversity.
1811480	1828480	And I'll tell you, I mean, I am in the green world all the time. I'm in the orange world every day. I'm in the blue world all the time from being at dinner with people in Alabama and places like that on a regular basis to being in Boulder to being in Seattle with progressives.
1828480	1839480	And so as I learned to navigate these different territories, what I find is people are very open, but they have to actually be met where they are.
1839480	1849480	And it's a long road ahead. Someone said to me recently, don't worry, Rand, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
1849480	1865480	And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true. Things are probably in the next decade going to get, maybe next two decades, going to get much worse, which is why we need more people stepping into responsibility to be a part of the solution.
1865480	1878480	And this is really hard work and diversity, equity and inclusion. Unfortunately, the DEI community is not positioned, in my opinion, just to be provocative. They are not positioned to be helpful.
1878480	1889480	I talk to CEOs and board members every day. Big companies that are my friends that I don't work with as clients that run Fortune 1000 companies and talking to them all the time.
1889480	1904480	They are not, the CEOs and the boards are not doing the work that's necessary to create a more inclusive organization, an organization with healthier forms of belonging.
1904480	1913480	They aren't doing it because they're outsourcing it to the DEI experts. And you can't outsource this. You can outsource a lot of stuff, but not adaptive change.
1913480	1924480	And until the DEI community actually gets the executive team, the CEO and the board to start to walk the talk on this, it's going to be a bunch of bullshit and a big charade is what it's going to be.
1924480	1938480	And guess what? What camp is the DEI community in? And we all know the answer, the green camp. It's the progressive camp. I love the camp, the progressive camp.
1938480	1956480	I love the light of progressivism. And I also love the light of traditionalism and I also love the light of the achiever worldview. And people will say to me, Rand, this comes from Bert, Rand, are you a conservative?
1956480	1975480	And my answer is not merely, well, Rand, that's confusing. Are you a progressive? Not merely, at least, but not merely. And because I actually identify with the healthy expressions of all three of these worldviews.
1975480	1988480	But the DEI community, the practitioners, the consultants, they're so well-intentioned. They are coming from a green place and they, I talk to these people also. Some of them are friends.
1988480	1999480	And they say to me, I cannot, out of my own consciousness, I just cannot work with people who are going to vote for Donald Trump.
1999480	2011480	Okay. Okay. So you're going to exclude half the country. So you're going to stand for healing America with half the country and the other half the country of the deplorables.
2011480	2022480	We're just going to leave them out. So how are we supposed to move forward? We will only move forward when we have, dare I say, an integral approach to diversity and inclusion.
2022480	2046480	We'll have to drop the E, because the E is equity, and equity has become a part of the culture war, and it has been, it's no longer effective. It has to be gone, because the far right and the right have said equity equals a quality of outcomes and socialism.
2046480	2058480	So we can't be asking the right of America to be stepping into equity when that word has already been defined and there's no going back. But we can save diversity and inclusion, for sure.
2058480	2067480	And we need diversity and inclusion. But we also have to recognize that the E of equity is radioactive now.
2068480	2082480	So let's rumble, people. Charlie's here. Let's do it. Let's get into some Q&A and let's get juicy and provocative and let's challenge each other.
2082480	2097480	And let's actually do what a classical liberal group would want to do. Let's offer up respectfully points of view that actually are challenging to each other so that we're not all just saying the same thing.
2097480	2103480	So, Mary, you're up first and then we're going to go to Michael and then Trudy.
2103480	2110480	Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, wherever you are.
2110480	2120480	Rand, thank you. This is a very validating, brilliant introduction and context setting you've given us.
2120480	2137480	I am personally continuously tortured by this idea that we have to choose sides, jump into a bucket, jump into a very lean and shallow definition of sides, by the way.
2137480	2152480	So it's like nobody wants to deal with the complexity, the deep, rich, multi-layered facets of these kind of situations, conditions, states of mind, mindsets, etc.
2152480	2176480	And dealing with nuance, it's like I don't think most people in our society even contemplate that we are skimming on the top of the surface as we default and follow the mobs and the voices and the media.
2176480	2187480	We lack the ability to absorb and discuss the layers, the nuance and the complexity of what's really going on.
2187480	2196480	And I continuously hear this term discernment being so important. I completely agree with it.
2196480	2210480	What struck me as you were talking is that most people have no idea what it means to have discernment and that what's lacking is some sort of instruction.
2210480	2234480	Awareness piece broadly and scalably available to people about what we mean when we talk about discernment and nuance. And the last thing I'll say is the Rumi quote, which, again, Rumi, that Rumi quote and all Rumi poetry is being spread widely.
2234480	2248480	But do people really understand, they feel intuitively a sense of that quote that you out beyond all ideas of right doing and wandering there is a space, I will meet you there.
2248480	2249480	Yep.
2249480	2261480	I feel the essence of that because it's pure, but do they know what that means on a deeper level and they do they know how to create the conditions that will allow them to play in that space.
2261480	2264480	I think that's a big missing piece for a lot of people.
2264480	2279480	Because you hit a lot and I want to appreciate several things that you just shared and offer up a couple of a couple of responses. So, at the highest level complexity has a PR problem.
2279480	2294480	You guys get that? Okay, like complexity has a PR problem because nuance and the capacity to actually have the kind of discernment that Mary's talking about requires development.
2294480	2306480	So development in developing our capacity to have a more nuanced and complex way of relating with the world is a really long and hard journey.
2306480	2315480	And it takes, we work with clients for private businesses where we work with the owners of the businesses for not just a year or two years or three years.
2315480	2323480	We have many, many, many clients that we worked with for 10, 15, 20 years continuously.
2323480	2329480	And so we know that development is hard and it takes a long time.
2329480	2335480	But the problem is that I just got an email from a DEI consultant in New York.
2335480	2342480	And the headline was 90 minutes to increasing trust in the context of diversity and inclusion.
2342480	2350480	Because what's happening is that the corporations are demanding these sprints. You got to go faster. You got to teach people quicker.
2350480	2353480	And once again, I'm sorry, but it's just bullshit.
2353480	2364480	It's a charade and people are pretending that they're actually doing development when they're not doing much more than provoking some new ideas and entertaining people.
2364480	2370480	Now, there's nothing wrong with going to the movies and being entertained, but let's not hold that out as development.
2370480	2376480	How many of you remember James Carville in the Democratic, in the Clinton era?
2376480	2383480	He said, it's the economy stupid. Raise your physical hands. You remember that? Okay. A lot of people remember that. It's the economy stupid.
2383480	2392480	Here's what we have to say about the polarization in America, the race topic just being one of them. It's development stupid.
2392480	2401480	That's it. It's development. We don't have an appetite to actually do the work.
2401480	2407480	And so we are stagging. We are very unpopular with public companies, which is wonderful.
2407480	2412480	And I'm so thankful for my team and my clients over decades of doing this work.
2412480	2431480	We have a very strong reputation in corporate America, in the pockets that we have a presence, and we have to turn away opportunities every week because we will not work with an organization if their CEO is not doing his or her own work.
2431480	2443480	And I'm not, that's why I say probably a couple more decades of it's going to get worse because there's just the appetite to do what Mary's pointing to is really, really rare.
2443480	2448480	All right, Michael, and then Trudy, Michael Abramson.
2449480	2461480	Hi, Rand. I like very much all that you presented, and it resonates with my understanding of this.
2461480	2471480	But my question to you is that my impression that your academy, you mostly focus on business world, on corporate world.
2471480	2472480	Correct.
2472480	2481480	But a lot of controversies around this DEI, they are coming from universities, they are coming from the government.
2481480	2493480	So are you trying to do something with them? And what is generally your take on this? What is going on at universities?
2493480	2506480	And also in the media, which in theory, they should be like objective and biased, but in practice, it's very rare.
2506480	2510480	So I'd like to hear your thoughts about this.
2510480	2518480	Well, I mean, I think for those of us that are students of integral theory, what's playing out in universities is exactly what we would expect is playing out.
2518480	2525480	I think Ken Wilber talked about this as the Mean Green meme 20 years ago, and it's just coming on full force.
2525480	2544480	So so much of this is what we would expect would be happening as more and more of a progressive worldview is coming online as expressed, especially in a younger generation in which they're being indoctrinated into an academic world,
2545480	2557480	where the especially in the liberal arts side of the Academy, where there is a bias to a progressive worldview.
2557480	2572480	And we all know the statistics on this, that at 90% or more of faculty within our universities across the entire country, sometimes it's 95, 98% identify as being on the left, politically.
2572480	2576480	So we don't actually have a good balance in our own faculty.
2576480	2579480	And so then what would we expect happens to the students.
2579480	2587480	And so I think, you know, that question of what is going on at universities, I might give Steve a chance when he talks here at a moment to speak to that.
2587480	2590480	I want to really talk about our direct experience.
2590480	2593480	And yes, we work mostly with business leaders.
2593480	2601480	We do work with leaders of institutions, nonprofits, we have had chancellors of universities go through our programs.
2601480	2616480	We have had many leaders of large religious organizations, mega churches, a variety of different domination denominations, priests, bishops with a Catholic bishops, Episcopal bishops that have large regions.
2616480	2622480	So we work, we work with the leaders are and where the appetite is to make a difference.
2622480	2640480	But we do have a bias of working with the money, the power, because the way that we're going to change universities, you know, one way we're going to change universities is by getting pressure from the alumni who are going to make demands of what is going to need to be
2640480	2643480	changed if they're going to continue to make donations.
2643480	2651480	And so Stagen, we've just picked one part, which is where, where, where capital is where the money is.
2651480	2655480	But there's a lot of important work that's going on in all parts of the system.
2655480	2664480	So Trudy, and that I love you guys to also like try to integrate in a little bit what other people are asking like, Hey, I appreciate it that and I want to integrate that into what I'm saying.
2664480	2671480	So it gets a little bit more dialogue, which is, you know, which is hard, but we can try. So true to Europe.
2671480	2676480	Yeah, actually, you kind of answered that question already.
2676480	2691480	I was going to ask how well this is how well is this received in the organizations that you have taught it. And what's the result when you're following up with them.
2691480	2703480	Are they using these principles? Has it changed their organization in some way? Have they found better ways of working together?
2703480	2708480	So if address that a little bit, if you would.
2708480	2710480	Yeah, yeah, the.
2710480	2719480	So, I don't want to make this about any one topic, you know, diversity and inclusion is a topic. Climate change is a topic.
2719480	2729480	What what we find Trudy is when we work with a CEO of an organization or a leader of an organization could be a nonprofit.
2729480	2734480	And that leader spends a year working on herself.
2734480	2747480	And as a result of working on herself will more self awareness, a capacity to recognize the wake that is behind all of her decisions.
2747480	2755480	We help our leaders realize that when we make a choice, that choice is consequential.
2755480	2763480	I was talking to a leader a few days ago who runs an organization in Georgia, a relatively large family business, thousands of employees.
2763480	2772480	And we were talking about what he would what he had just communicated to his executive team and to the top, let's say 100 leaders in his business.
2772480	2781480	He had sent an email and he realized in the conversation with me that the email was unnecessarily critical and harsh in its tone.
2781480	2793480	And that he likely got the short term result that he wanted at the expense of long term undermining of trust within the top tier of his organization.
2793480	2802480	And so what we're trying to do with leaders is to help them realize, as we become more aware, we can actually choose differently.
2802480	2817480	Because with awareness and choice comes a responsibility to recognize that every decision, especially when you're higher up in organizational life, the the consequence of those decisions ripple out like the wake of a boat.
2817480	2829480	And and what what's so cool about development and consciousness complexity is that as a leader becomes better at that current level.
2829480	2834480	That's skill development, knowledge acquisition.
2834480	2841480	It increases the likelihood that they can actually go vertical in their own vertical the elevated development.
2841480	2855480	However, when they move up, they're going to relate with relationships in a more complex nuanced ways, which means they're going to relate with the topic of diversity, equity inclusion, a more nuanced way.
2855480	2860480	And so we don't have to be DEI consultants or trainers.
2860480	2867480	We just have to continue to focus on human development, because as a human develops to higher levels.
2867480	2877480	They're actually that person is going to relate with and make decisions across a broad spectrum of topics that are going to be informed from a more complex operating system.
2877480	2881480	And so that's the work is just its development, its development.
2881480	2884480	How long is this going to take generations.
2884480	2887480	Brand that's not very inspiring.
2887480	2890480	Well, it's going to take generations.
2890480	2903480	It's going to take people thinking not in years anymore, we can't have our leaders continuing to be in this pathological short termism of America, that everything is now now now now now.
2903480	2911480	What we realize is leaders have to start to recognize what is the progress that we can make in 10 year increments.
2911480	2923480	Our clients love the Bill Gates quote, and Bill Gates said, most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.
2923480	2927480	And so we say to our clients, how might you be underestimating yourself?
2927480	2938480	What could you do if you started expanding your sense of time and started looking at the progress and look at the long arc of progress.
2938480	2947480	And yes, there's suffering going on in the world, but relative to 100 years ago and 200 years ago, there's a lot less suffering.
2947480	2950480	So let's put that into context and perspective.
2950480	2958480	And when we get leaders who are able to just peek into more of an integral view, they're able to hold that.
2958480	2968480	But when they're in the lower levels, and as we all know, even though I talked about the great diversity between the traditionalist, the achievers and the progressives.
2968480	2976480	The one thing all three of those worldviews have in common as integral theory teaches us is they think their worldview is the right worldview.
2976480	2978480	Steve knows that we all know this.
2978480	2983480	All three of these worldviews think their worldview is the right worldview.
2983480	2987480	That's their commonality among all the other diversity.
2987480	2999480	And so this is just more reason that we've got to have more of a commitment to a higher and more elevated development.
2999480	3001480	Barbara Brown, take yourself off mute.
3001480	3003480	What do you got?
3003480	3015480	You know, you mentioned working in my over country where I live to and not so much on the coast.
3015480	3027480	Do you think a developmental reason or a sociological reason why this works better in middle America than it does on the coast just out of periodicity?
3027480	3029480	Yeah, it's a great question.
3029480	3036480	So it's counterintuitive to a lot of people, especially integral students.
3036480	3056480	What we have found, we've been out there for decades, what we have found is that when we meet a leader from Kansas City, Kansas, who may have grown up there, gone to school somewhere else, and then come back home to raise their family.
3056480	3059480	And these are people who might have gone to universities on the coast.
3059480	3072480	They might have gone to a Harvard or they might have gone to a UCLA, but they go back home and they feel a sense of community with Kansas.
3072480	3084480	And then we show up and we say, we want to work with you through many decades to actually become a more conscious leader, conscious development.
3084480	3092480	So that we can help you be of service to your stakeholders, to your customers, to your employees and to your community.
3092480	3109480	They have our clients have almost an inherent blue, like access to healthy blue traditionalism that has them deeply connecting to stakeholder theory and to stakeholder management and to the principles of conscious capitalism.
3109480	3121480	And I'm being a little, this is a little bit of an exaggeration, but when we meet people in New York and people in, especially in like San Francisco, and we asked them what their relationship is with the community.
3121480	3126480	It's almost, there's no geographic, they're not tethered.
3126480	3134480	There's this orange opportunistic, I want to get mine, I want to grow my company, and then we talk about Time Horizon.
3134480	3143480	And we say, what's your Time Horizon? And so much of what's happening on the coast is about the, I want to get rich in five to seven years.
3143480	3145480	We don't work with private equity.
3145480	3150480	We don't, none of the short term capital is works with our model.
3150480	3161480	And so that would be my answer is that there's this healthy community orientation and it just seems like, why do you call it stakeholder theory?
3161480	3168480	It just seems like that's the right thing to do. You take care of your employees and your employees will take care of you.
3168480	3172480	You take care of your customers and your customers will stay loyal.
3172480	3184480	You take care of your vendors and make sure that they can make enough money, even though you have to, you know, you have to negotiate, but you don't want to, you know, squeeze them so hard that they can't continue to supply you because then that hurts you long term.
3185480	3194480	These things that seem so sophisticated in their language, the Heartland often says, that just seems like the right way to do business.
3194480	3198480	If that makes sense to you guys, like this is just once again our experience.
3198480	3199480	Okay, David.
3199480	3205480	The other thing I see there ran is less content for the working class.
3205480	3210480	I mean, I was on a call a couple weeks ago where somebody studied all seriousness.
3210480	3218480	How do we stop working class folks from voting because they are so ignorant they can't make good political decisions.
3218480	3221480	And I mean, I'm just OMG, right?
3221480	3223480	I don't even know what to say to that.
3223480	3235480	And even when people disagree, they're still in a lot of that Heartland, there's that sense of civility that's required.
3235480	3242480	And there's the sense that, you know, you just don't treat people badly.
3242480	3252480	And I hate to say it about a lot of the progressive left, but, you know, they'll treat anybody badly if they don't agree with them.
3252480	3254480	And that's pretty pathetic.
3254480	3257480	Yeah, and Barbara, I want to share something then to let David come in.
3257480	3270480	And Steve really worked with me and really helped me along with Bert and Jeff because we had several years during the pandemic that we were supporting each other on Zoom and we were sort of locked in our houses.
3270480	3278480	And what I used to assume is that I held the spiral in my mind.
3278480	3286480	And I was like, we have to see individuals in our country go to green so they can go to yellow so they can go to integral.
3286480	3306480	And what Steve helped me to realize is because there is so much progressive pluralistic green at a societal and Wilbur's quadrants lower left space in the culture of America, because we have been shaped and we have been exposed to so much of that,
3307480	3329480	those means, those value systems, that people who are at an individual level, their interior structure being more orange blue, or maybe even blue orange, if you think primary and secondary, that they have enough exposure to the green to be able to actually make a move up to integral.
3329480	3341480	And so we're actually saying, you know, the assumption that I had for years was we could the only people we can work with are people who are already progressive who want to go post progressive.
3341480	3353480	And that's not our experience. Now our experience is we're working with Heartland achievers who are Christians who have strong faith and they're reading Ken Wilbur.
3353480	3371480	And they're like, we're going to build an integral company, because they also have a multicultural sensibility, because they also are able to feel into the healthy parts of green to a to enough of a degree, but they don't want to live there.
3372480	3388480	They want to appreciate the parts that are that are healthy for them, and they want to keep their faith if they're faith based, and not all of our clients are faith based, but many of them are, and they also want to be able to maintain their healthy orange their healthy achievement.
3388480	3404480	And so we're in a we're in an experiment of moving people up the spiral to towards yellow towards an integrated view, even though it doesn't look like a typical, you know, progressive that's ready to pop to yellow.
3404480	3406480	So David you're up.
3407480	3412480	All right. Thank you, Rand. This is, this is so stimulating.
3412480	3431480	So my own sense as kind of an outsider to the business world is that a lot of the di stuff is people using green language, but coming from a sort of blue absolutistic altitude, where you know we have the truth, almost authoritarian.
3431480	3450480	So I'm curious to hear in your experience, what percentage of it is that, if that's right. And then how do you work with leaders to try and make fine grain distinctions, so that they're not sort of dismissing all of progressivism as just this,
3450480	3460480	sort of absolutistic because from an orange perspective, they'd be correctly seeing that as, you know, regressive and sort of a drag.
3460480	3469480	So yeah, I'm curious to hear your thoughts about how you help leaders think through the dynamics, the complicated dynamics between these, these different worldviews.
3469480	3478480	Well, I mean, there's no easy answer for that. The first thing we do is just help leaders to recognize that these worldviews exist.
3478480	3489480	Because so many of our clients have never really thought about this. They're, they're, they make these assumptions that, you know, everybody's making meaning the way I'm making meaning.
3489480	3499480	And so by just starting with the fact that there are distinctions, our clients are like smoke comes out their ears, and then to bring in the light and shadow.
3499480	3514480	Oh, so I don't have to conflate the shadow with the person or the shadow of that, of that, of everyone in that worldview, that everybody is like the shadow because they're not.
3514480	3525480	And we get them to take responsibility that there's a shadow where they stand. And we have to have them do a self assessment of where is the shadow of my own worldview.
3525480	3536480	And so David with that, what that does is that's destabilizing enough just to start to get them to start groping into a more nuanced and complex set of questions.
3536480	3541480	And we often are, and I'll use a rubber band here.
3541480	3544480	Our clients and the leaders we work with.
3544480	3549480	But our problem solvers. So when they experience tension.
3549480	3552480	Their assumption is that's a problem to be solved.
3552480	3561480	I got to solve that one of the ways that you actually get rid of tension is the denial or the avoiding of the conflict.
3561480	3569480	And so we work with our clients to build a new relationship with tension where they can actually be in a creative tension.
3569480	3576480	And we help them understand that, yes, there's destructive tension if I pulled too hard on this, the rubber band would break.
3576480	3586480	But if I bring the enough tension where I have energy, there's energy for transformation and change that the generative process of development requires energy.
3586480	3591480	And we help our clients to realize, maybe I need to build a new relationship with tension itself.
3591480	3597480	And maybe when I'm in the presence, like I will, I will, I will reveal a couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech.
3597480	3601480	It was a higher ground speech very similar to the slides you just saw.
3601480	3607480	It got a standing ovation, which my ego loves. Okay. And I'm still, I'm still in my own work.
3607480	3617480	The reason I know how far I have to go is that when I get a standing ovation, I actually get a hit of like, like, oh, validation.
3617480	3624480	And when people are not that enthusiastic after my speech, I actually feel like I want validation.
3624480	3632480	So I know I'm still, I'm still, I'm still far from, you know, being high up on the developmental progression because I get these clues.
3632480	3641480	And, but, but my, my assumption was the speech was well received to women came up to me after the speech because I asked for feedback.
3641480	3643480	I said, if you have feedback, please come find me.
3643480	3648480	I'd love feedback and especially, especially feedback that is critical of my presentation.
3648480	3657480	And these were two black women who were so courageous and they were so passionate and they came to me and they gave me exactly what I asked for.
3657480	3663480	And they helped me to realize that I, they told me they did not like my speech.
3663480	3665480	They told me they were offended by my speech.
3665480	3677480	They would not introduce themselves by name and it was a conference with with name badges and the one woman who was speaking on behalf of the two of them took her badge off before she came over to speak to me.
3677480	3682480	When I put my hand out and introduced myself, she wouldn't introduce herself and wouldn't shake my hand.
3682480	3687480	And they came at me hard guys when I say hard, hard.
3687480	3689480	It was aggressive.
3689480	3691480	And this is what I felt.
3691480	3696480	And what I wanted to do was, was walk away.
3696480	3697480	Okay.
3697480	3701480	Because I felt like it was inappropriate how aggressive they were coming, but I stayed in it.
3701480	3703480	And I took a big deep breath.
3703480	3713480	And I, and I kept coming and I said to them, the feedback you're giving me right now is really hard.
3713480	3715480	I'm really struggling.
3715480	3717480	I'm super confused.
3717480	3720480	And I want you to keep coming.
3720480	3721480	Don't stop.
3721480	3723480	And I just, I just, and they just kept coming.
3723480	3732480	And the more they came at me, the more I surrendered and stayed in this tension and just said to myself, Oh, this is me.
3732480	3736480	And my growth edge, this is me actually needing to learn and grow.
3736480	3749480	And I actually got so, I got so like relaxed, almost like the idea of surrendering to win that they calmed down.
3749480	3753480	And the more the softer I got the softer they got was like a 10 minute conversation.
3753480	3757480	And then I said, tell me more, tell me more, tell me more.
3757480	3768480	And what they were really upset by is I told a story on that speech about when George Floyd was murdered about how disoriented it was, disorienting it was for me.
3768480	3773480	And I talked about the Tom Peters idea that if you're not confused, you're not paying attention.
3773480	3777480	And I said, I was so confused.
3777480	3782480	And I went to my neighbors and I was outside a couple of days after George Floyd was killed.
3782480	3784480	And they said to me, Rand, you don't look good.
3784480	3786480	And I was like, I hadn't been, I wasn't sleeping.
3786480	3787480	I was crying.
3787480	3789480	I was super disoriented.
3789480	3791480	And I said, guys, I'm not good.
3791480	3793480	Like, what do you mean?
3793480	3794480	What's wrong with me?
3794480	3796480	Like, aren't you paying attention like George Floyd?
3796480	3798480	And they're like, George who?
3798480	3801480	Because look, I live in a neighborhood with a bunch of rich white guys.
3801480	3803480	And they weren't paying attention.
3803480	3804480	And I was paying attention.
3804480	3808480	And because I was paying attention, I was confused and they weren't confused.
3808480	3811480	So these women said to me, it took me four years.
3811480	3813480	I got this feedback two weeks ago.
3813480	3823480	They said they were offended that I would suggest that anyone would be confused by that because if you grew up the way they grew up, it wasn't confusing at all to them.
3823480	3841480	And so now I actually am more sensitive to the fact that when I'm in front of a group of people and I tell that story, I don't want to tell that story without also recognizing that other people from a different life, different color skin were not confused by that.
3841480	3846480	But the fact that I didn't have that nuance really upset them.
3846480	3849480	And I'm very grateful that I got that feedback.
3849480	3859480	But guys, oh, oh, and at the end of the 10 minutes, the woman put her hand out and she introduced herself by name.
3859480	3866480	And so that might, that was my feedback that this worked a part of me wanted to like, like, like attack them.
3866480	3867480	Okay.
3867480	3874480	A part of me wanted to the fight another part of me wanted to run away because I could have easy said the guys, I don't need this and walk to it.
3874480	3877480	But this is what we're trying to teach our clients how to do.
3877480	3880480	How do you stay in the heat?
3880480	3882480	This is really hard work.
3882480	3886480	And most people don't want to do this hard work.
3886480	3891480	They want to outsource this to their diversity consultant.
3891480	3900480	And they're like, they're looking at their consultant and the consultant needs to be saying to their client, you're not going to get stronger watching me do push ups.
3900480	3904480	Like, you can't, you can outsource almost everything.
3904480	3910480	If you're, if you're successful and you're powerful, but you can't outsource your own development.
3910480	3913480	And this is what we need people to do is to step into their own work.
3913480	3917480	I don't know, David, if that's helping at all, but.
3917480	3922480	The story was all you needed. That was great. Thank you.
3922480	3924480	Thank you, John.
3924480	3929480	John dupe dupe dupe dupe dupe.
3929480	3931480	Yeah. Anyway, I just want to.
3931480	3938480	Thank you for this and such a healthy, powerful expression of our integral thing that you're that you're doing. It's really great.
3938480	3944480	And I almost want to pass because I don't know if this, how this directly applies to the work you're doing.
3944480	3948480	But I would value your, your opinion on, on seeking a higher ground.
3948480	3955480	And for the last and how this affects the companies and the populations that you're working with.
3955480	3958480	For the last 25 years I've watched, I said.
3958480	3962480	I noted a long time ago that we, if.
3962480	3967480	There wasn't some way to absorb the, not the immigration, but the migration.
3967480	3974480	In other words, millions of people crossing borders of different languages, different cultures, different developmental levels.
3974480	3980480	It would lead to the rise of the reactionary right neo fascism.
3980480	3989480	And it would be a great threat to liberal democracies, which you see in Hungary, seen Sweden, we see in our country.
3989480	3992480	Russia's weaponizing immigration with Finland.
3992480	4009480	I mean, the Brexit without without that, it probably wouldn't have happened. And so, and, and there's, there's different perspectives from each of these, these level the progressive traditionalists and the Chiebers and.
4009480	4012480	You know, there's.
4012480	4023480	Definite problems and there's definite good things like we, we get this dynamic workforce of millions of people are willing to work hard for, you know, less than we'd have to pay an American I mean there's good stuff.
4023480	4033480	And I've worked with a lot of them they're very hard working and have a lot of integrity for the most part. And then again as bad people as as Donald, you know, likes to tell us all the time.
4033480	4038480	But is, have you seen that pressure.
4038480	4042480	Asserting itself in the work that you do.
4042480	4057480	And have you been able to work with these different perspectives at each, each of these different level bring and find a higher level of of an integral thing that could really help us successfully deal with this.
4058480	4071480	Given fact of the mass migrations all over the world of people and, you know, threatening different cultures and different developmental levels. Is there any light in your work in that particular.
4071480	4083480	Finally, because I look at the time we got eight minutes left, I'm going to, you say you were going to pass I'm going to pass on trying to, to try to even answer a really important beautiful complex question.
4083480	4087480	And I'll give a couple of sort of like just wondering for myself.
4087480	4102480	I wonder what the consequences are of embracing so much immigration and so much diversity that we lose a shared center.
4102480	4111480	And if we don't have a center in which we are able to subordinate ourselves to which, which was at least what I was growing up.
4111480	4120480	The one thing I felt American shared in common, especially during the Cold War was a patriotism that we were Americans.
4120480	4125480	Yes, I'm a Texan and someone else is from California and someone else from New York, but we're Americans.
4125480	4147480	And if we continue to see the loss of the, of the center because of this demand for multiculturalism, and this is counterintuitive again, the multiculturalism that, that, that can exist so in such a healthy way at the periphery of a society can only exist if there's a strong center.
4147480	4151480	And this is why blue is so important going forward.
4151480	4169480	We must renew and reconnect to what created at a classical liberal Western values Judeo Christian values what created the United States and what created so many European countries was these foundations that that that civilizations are losing touch with.
4169480	4183480	And so the question is, instead of trying to dismantle, how do we renew and revitalize am I handed off to Steve here, which is a great segue because I believe and this is crazy that I say this, but hey, I get to say this.
4183480	4192480	And if clients don't want to work with us, I don't care, because we don't work with big public companies that have to deal with all the politics and all the pressure from social media.
4192480	4194480	We work with people who are business owners.
4194480	4198480	And we're like, if you don't want to work with us, don't work with us, but this is spiritual work.
4198480	4200480	We are we are unapologetic.
4200480	4204480	The work of higher ground is spiritual work.
4204480	4212480	And we can define spirituality as having a recognition that I am a part of something bigger than myself.
4212480	4218480	And I can be an atheist and still be spiritual, because I feel connected to the cosmos because I feel connected to nature.
4218480	4223480	But we've got to start to recognize that this is not an intellectual journey.
4223480	4227480	It is a journey that requires a spiritual orientation.
4227480	4231480	And Steve, give us give us a few little nuggets of wisdom.
4231480	4234480	Well, let me just say amen to what you just said.
4234480	4236480	Our spiritual work.
4236480	4238480	Yeah, really, really helpful.
4238480	4240480	So just a comment and then a quick question.
4240480	4245480	The comment is, I just want everybody to really appreciate how important it is.
4245480	4251480	And what an excellent job Rand and his organization have done it, simplifying this, right?
4251480	4253480	Because it's it's complex.
4253480	4259480	But in the course of simplifying it, it's been like a learning lab for the theory.
4259480	4261480	I mean, the theory has been improved.
4261480	4265480	I mean, so, for example, you know, Rand's got their achiever instead of modernism, right?
4265480	4266480	Like, well, you got to call it modernity.
4266480	4267480	That's what it is.
4267480	4269480	And he tried it out.
4269480	4270480	I tried it.
4270480	4271480	I tried it.
4271480	4274480	And they just like, we're in tears in the headlight when you mentioned that term.
4274480	4281480	And so I appreciate that, you know, achiever for the audiences that you're speaking to is actually much more digestible.
4281480	4288480	And I think that the simplicity of it is really it's illuminated the way I understand there.
4288480	4289480	You sort of came to that together.
4289480	4290480	You mentioned it.
4290480	4296480	That is the simple, the simplest truth is what does development mean?
4296480	4297480	Right?
4297480	4303480	Everybody, you made it clear that development is this higher ground and that everybody should naturally want to aspire to that.
4303480	4304480	And what does that mean?
4304480	4307480	It simply means expanding the scope of what you can value.
4307480	4318480	I mean, you know, there's more to it than that, but in the spirit of let's get down to the brass taxes and say it as distinct, succinctly and as simply as we can.
4318480	4330480	That's what you're offering in this excellent presentation is a way of people thinking about what it could mean practically to increase the scope of their value by valuing the light, you know, of all of these cultural structures.
4331480	4339480	So that we've learned some things from your on the ground, you know, development of all this.
4339480	4342480	The question is, yeah, we're the we're the we're the arenas.
4342480	4345480	I told Steve, I said, Steve, I get with Steve, I say, give me some stuff.
4345480	4347480	And he's like, oh, here's some stuff.
4347480	4348480	You know, here's a book.
4348480	4349480	Here's an article.
4349480	4356480	I go into the arena with my team and we work will work with 3000 leaders this year and programs that are 15 weeks to 52 weeks.
4356480	4361480	I mean, this is deep, deep work with people and we'll just get beat up and we'll be like, that didn't work.
4361480	4362480	That didn't work.
4362480	4363480	That didn't work.
4363480	4364480	This work.
4364480	4365480	Let's keep doing that.
4365480	4367480	And this is how we iterate rapid prototyping.
4367480	4372480	And so, yeah, Steve, I know we're going to we only got three minutes, but if you have a question, I'll do my best to probably.
4372480	4379480	Okay, well, just the simple question is when we you mentioned our zoom conversations that we started to have like in April of 2020, right?
4379480	4382480	The pandemic had had hit.
4382480	4387480	And at the time, you know, it was actually before George Floyd's death.
4387480	4399480	And then immediately afterwards, like in the six months between, you know, July and the end of 2020 diversity equity inclusion within the business community had become like a day reger thing.
4399480	4402480	It's like, like if you didn't have an accounting department, right?
4402480	4408480	You have to have a DI bureaucracy or you're not, you know, you're, you're a poor business person.
4408480	4409480	Yeah.
4409480	4410480	And of course, you know, we've been the gamble.
4410480	4411480	We've seen it.
4411480	4413480	We see the backlash that is occurring now.
4413480	4426480	And I'm just wondering whether you see it having a long curve or whether it's going to transform into something that's less green or, you know, what do you see the future of DI from what you've gleaned from the business, your business travels?
4426480	4430480	I am not optimistic, which is very disappointing.
4430480	4436480	I feel like the pendulum is swinging, is swinging and continues to swing.
4436480	4441480	I talked to three leaders in the last week that are shutting down their DI initiatives.
4441480	4455480	I talked to a DEI consultant who's changing his business offering because he's because the demand for his consulting services is diminishing so fast that he's now reinventing himself and doing other kind of consulting.
4455480	4462480	I think you're going to see, I think we're going to see a continued rapid decline of DEI.
4462480	4471480	And I think we're going to see an emergence of something that will be, that will be more, this is the irony, more inclusive.
4471480	4481480	I went to, I'll end with this, I went and gave a speech in October to a group and I put up a big tent and I said, we need to have a big tent.
4481480	4495480	And then I said, we need a tent, a community that includes black and white, male and female, LGBTQ ally, LGBTQ critic.
4495480	4501480	We need people who are fossil fuel executives and people who are environmental activists in the same room.
4501480	4503480	And then I said to them and they were really freaked out.
4503480	4507480	I said, you are in a room because I knew the room pretty well.
4507480	4509480	There are about 300 people, 300 CEOs.
4509480	4517480	I said, you are in a room right now with half the people in this room are going to, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Donald Trump.
4517480	4520480	And half the people in this room, given the opportunity, are going to vote for Biden.
4520480	4522480	Look around.
4522480	4532480	You're in the room with people who are way more diverse than you may realize from a diversity of viewpoint and thought.
4532480	4539480	And I think, Steve, that we're going to have to tackle the complexity that we've got to.
4539480	4542480	Now, I don't think it's going to be under the banner of DEI.
4542480	4549480	I think we're already seeing a shift to DNI, diversity and inclusion.
4549480	4551480	DNI is what it's being called.
4552480	4559480	I'm just noticing this, that the E is just dropping off with certain more complex organizations are already leading the way on that.
4559480	4566480	So I do predict that DNI will be the next iteration and we'll see what happens.
4566480	4572480	And I'm committed to being a part in some small way of the solution.
4572480	4577480	I wish I could wave a magic wand and there'd just be the solution out there.
4577480	4581480	But I have very little hope that the progressives are going to solve this.
4581480	4592480	I think we're going to have to solve it by bringing the beauty of green and the progressive approach to diversity and the beauty of orange and the beauty of blue in the conversation.
4592480	4595480	And so with that, it is 731.
4595480	4596480	We're already one minute over.
4596480	4598480	You're going to get the slides.
4598480	4604480	I'm going to put together, Nigel, I'm going to put together a little care package.
4604480	4609480	I'm going to include a video link to a Heineken commercial, which is going to blow your mind.
4609480	4612480	It's five minutes and it's going to blow your mind.
4612480	4619480	It's the best media I have seen on higher ground and of the humanity of coming together.
4619480	4621480	It's so good.
4621480	4622480	Watch that video.
4622480	4623480	It's on YouTube.
4623480	4624480	So it's a YouTube link.
4624480	4627480	I'm going to put in the follow up.
4627480	4631480	I'll give you my slides and I will include a couple of links.
4631480	4633480	Nigel, I'll get this done before midnight tonight and send it to you.
4633480	4639480	I'll curate a couple of other things that people who got their curiosity peaked.
4639480	4653480	Some additional one other video from Reba Wisdom that took me two years to find this 45 minute interview with a woman who I actually think from London has an incredible point of view on diversity.
4653480	4671480	And another link to a video, it's 11 minutes of a headmistress in London, who's maybe the best example of how conservative values can create a rich multicultural diverse community at a school that she runs.
4671480	4686480	And it's mind boggling what she's doing with Christian lower C conservative values, creating the conditions for a thriving diversity, which doesn't seem like those two go together.
4686480	4705480	And, and you guys enjoy your adventures and your journey and I hope to come back as a attendee at another one of these and listen into the wonderful teachers and, and guess that you guys get to hear from regularly and thank you again for the invitation Steve and and everyone for being here.
4705480	4706480	Thank you.
4707480	4708480	Thank you.
4709480	4710480	Thanks guys.
