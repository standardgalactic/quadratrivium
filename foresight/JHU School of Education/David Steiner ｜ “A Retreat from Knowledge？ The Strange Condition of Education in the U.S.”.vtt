Thank you so much, Francesca, and Nicole, University of Bergamo, for your warm hospitality and good morning to you all.

02:12.720 --> 02:20.220
In her essay The Crisis in Education, Hannah Arendt asks the most important possible question,

02:20.220 --> 02:27.220
is education any longer possible? And her answer, essentially, is no.

02:27.220 --> 02:35.220
The problem she writes of education in the modern world lies in the fact that by its very nature we cannot forego,

02:35.220 --> 02:45.220
cannot be without either authority or tradition, and yet we must proceed in a world that is neither structured by authority,

02:45.220 --> 02:55.220
nor held together by tradition. Why are authority and tradition so important to the act of educating?

02:55.220 --> 03:04.220
Arendt argues that child-centered or progressivist models of education devalu authority in ways that undermine

03:04.220 --> 03:12.220
the very possibility of education. All the rules of sound human reasoning, she writes, are cast aside.

03:12.220 --> 03:22.220
Her criticism of progressivism has three parts. First, child-centered education in trust's authority in education

03:22.220 --> 03:28.220
to those who by nature cannot exercise it, namely children.

03:28.220 --> 03:37.220
She stresses the helplessness of every child that instinctively seeks authority to guide her or him into the world

03:37.220 --> 03:46.220
in which he or she is still a stranger, in which she cannot orient herself by her own judgment.

03:46.220 --> 03:56.220
Second, we adults in choosing to give power to children to shape their own education have devalued our own knowledge.

03:56.220 --> 04:07.220
If teachers abandon the teaching of their knowledge, then teachers remove, they sacrifice the one source of authority that should be theirs.

04:07.220 --> 04:17.220
Finally, constructivism rests on the belief that a child can only understand what they have, quote, discovered by themselves, close quote.

04:17.220 --> 04:26.220
But that's not true. It's simply not true. Think about learning to read. It's not a natural process. It must be taught.

04:26.220 --> 04:38.220
But Arendt says the incorrect belief that children can only learn by self-discovery leads to a substitution of doing for learning,

04:38.220 --> 04:45.220
a damaging replacement, she writes, of thoughtful work by labor without direction.

04:45.220 --> 04:54.220
Our progressivist impulse to make sacred, to make autonomous, the world of the child is, in Hannah Arendt's view,

04:54.220 --> 04:58.220
a symptom of something more serious, more fundamental.

04:58.220 --> 05:10.220
Adults give up authority because we refuse, she writes, to assume responsibility for the world into which we have brought our children.

05:11.220 --> 05:16.220
What does Arendt mean by giving up responsibility for our world?

05:16.220 --> 05:22.220
And why does she believe that doing so destroys our capacity to educate children?

05:22.220 --> 05:31.220
Her answer, to simplify if I may, is that when we educate, we must take responsibility for which stories,

05:31.220 --> 05:39.220
which information, which picture about our world we are going to pass on to our children.

05:39.220 --> 05:46.220
But today, Arendt argues, we are estranged, alienated from our own histories.

05:46.220 --> 05:55.220
There is no coherent narrative, no shared set of stories about our world, of which we are willing to say this story,

05:55.220 --> 06:00.220
these stories are worthy of teaching to our children.

06:00.220 --> 06:08.220
We live in a culture, Arendt argues, in which there is a crisis in our attitude towards the realm of the past.

06:08.220 --> 06:15.220
We are no longer prepared to introduce children into the unfolding stories of which they are a part,

06:15.220 --> 06:22.220
and in the context of which children can, one day, remake their world.

06:22.220 --> 06:30.220
Without a shared, valued narrative about the world, children will remain ignorant of how to act.

06:31.220 --> 06:41.220
They will be like bats without a cave, they will have no way in which to find and then judge the limits of their world.

06:41.220 --> 06:49.220
Arendt insists, quote, that exactly for the sake of what is new and revolutionary in every child,

06:49.220 --> 06:59.220
education must be conservative, it must preserve the newness and introduce the world as a new thing to the child.

07:00.220 --> 07:07.220
Paradoxically, Arendt reminds us, that in its most creative, revolutionary period,

07:07.220 --> 07:11.220
American education was most conservative.

07:11.220 --> 07:18.220
Today, she writes, educational experiments have struck a very revolutionary pose,

07:18.220 --> 07:25.220
but that pose, she says, will leave children without the ability to act radically.

07:26.220 --> 07:33.220
Today, an insistence on selecting and teaching a particular cultural content to our children

07:33.220 --> 07:38.220
is under deep suspicion, especially from the political left.

07:38.220 --> 07:47.220
Thus, Arendt's argument that choosing a particular content, a curriculum for our children's education,

07:47.220 --> 07:54.220
her argument that doing so is not conservative, requires support.

07:54.720 --> 08:02.220
To juz America as our example, I would remind us that the most important figures of protest

08:02.220 --> 08:09.220
in the struggle for civil rights, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X,

08:09.220 --> 08:18.220
each affirmed the centrality of classical learning in their resistance, in their voice of resistance.

08:18.220 --> 08:23.220
You may remember that Malcolm X dropped out of school when he was 13,

08:23.220 --> 08:32.220
but when imprisoned for robbery, he taught himself to read Tolstoy, Dostoevski, and Nietzsche, among many others.

08:32.220 --> 08:38.220
To the American list, I would add one more powerful example, that of Nelson Mandela.

08:38.220 --> 08:42.220
When he was imprisoned in South Africa in Robin Island,

08:42.220 --> 08:49.220
he chose to play both the role of Creon and Antigone in Sophocles' play of that name.

08:49.220 --> 08:54.220
He recalled later that he found the experience of studying that play,

08:54.220 --> 09:01.220
and indeed classical literature more generally as, quote, enormously elevating, close quote.

09:01.220 --> 09:10.220
Sophocles, he said, had much to teach him about power, despotism, politics, courage, and faith.

09:11.220 --> 09:20.220
To repeat her central claim, the authority of the teacher then rests on the assumption of responsibility for our world.

09:20.220 --> 09:28.220
Our intellectual irresponsibility when it comes to education lies in our unwillingness to select

09:28.220 --> 09:32.220
to be responsible for content worth teaching.

09:33.220 --> 09:43.220
We betray ourselves as parents and educators in pretending that children can be made the authors of their world.

09:43.220 --> 09:49.220
In what our rent bluntly calls our disgust for our world, we wash our hands of our authority,

09:49.220 --> 09:55.220
our responsibility, and our love both for our children and for our world.

09:56.220 --> 10:01.220
Our rent ties the surrender of the core responsibility of the teacher,

10:01.220 --> 10:06.220
our unwillingness to be responsible for choosing the content of education,

10:06.220 --> 10:12.220
to our unwillingness to judge what is of value in human experience.

10:12.220 --> 10:19.220
I now want to stress that the unwillingness to say this content is worth teaching

10:19.220 --> 10:23.220
is not a theoretical issue alone.

10:23.220 --> 10:31.220
In the United States, at least, the flight from responsibility is powerfully and destructively evident

10:31.220 --> 10:36.220
in our preference for skills over curricular content.

10:36.220 --> 10:46.220
We do not have in our nation as a whole or in any one of our 50 states a single shared curriculum in any subject.

10:46.220 --> 10:53.220
No defined content in literature, or history, or science, or even mathematics.

10:53.220 --> 11:00.220
Because there is no set curriculum, because we do not require students to read a list of books,

11:00.220 --> 11:10.220
our state tests, our state tests of reading, for example, cannot test knowledge of any specific text.

11:10.220 --> 11:16.220
We cannot ask questions about Moby Dick, or the Great Gatsby, or the Bluest Eye, for example.

11:16.220 --> 11:25.220
Instead, our tests present students with a paragraph or two from a very obscure source

11:25.220 --> 11:30.220
that no student has ever read before, so no student has an advantage.

11:30.220 --> 11:37.220
We then ask students to, quote, find the main idea in the paragraph.

11:37.220 --> 11:43.220
Of course, this ability depends on understanding what the text is about.

11:43.220 --> 11:51.220
And it turns out that wealthy or richer students do much better in finding the main idea

11:51.220 --> 11:55.220
because they have more knowledge about the world.

11:55.220 --> 12:02.220
So the reading test in America becomes a test of family wealth.

12:02.220 --> 12:09.220
We can predict quite well a student's results on a test if we know their parents' wealth.

12:09.220 --> 12:16.220
Because poor students do badly, we try to train them on finding the main idea

12:16.220 --> 12:24.220
instead of teaching them content, and as a result, every year they do worse and worse.

12:24.220 --> 12:29.220
You know, a shift over the last hundred years from content to skill,

12:29.220 --> 12:32.220
America is following, unfortunately.

12:32.220 --> 12:37.220
The example said in France when it passed the loge au span,

12:37.220 --> 12:45.220
when it abandoned gave up the national curriculum for a shift to child-centered progressive pedagogy.

12:45.220 --> 12:51.220
Here is what happened to the performance of children in reading in France.

12:52.220 --> 12:58.220
These lines represent the reading skills of children from different economic groups,

12:58.220 --> 13:02.220
the wealthiest children at the top, the poorest children at the bottom,

13:02.220 --> 13:10.220
from the time the law was passed in 1987 to 20 years later in 2007.

13:10.220 --> 13:15.220
What you can see is that the shift to child-centered education

13:15.220 --> 13:19.220
damaged the reading of every group of students,

13:19.220 --> 13:25.220
but what is most tragic is that it damaged the reading of poorer students the most.

13:25.220 --> 13:28.220
That is the bottom line.

13:28.220 --> 13:34.220
Sadly, it has become fashionable to follow Jo Span's example.

13:34.220 --> 13:39.220
For example, Finland, where excellent educational achievements were built

13:39.220 --> 13:45.220
on a strong content-rich national curriculum, this was given up.

13:45.220 --> 13:49.220
As a result, just like in France, there has in the last few years

13:49.220 --> 13:53.220
been a steady decline in educational results.

13:53.220 --> 13:59.220
England went through the same thing before it went back to a content-rich curriculum.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.220
The United States has done the same thing,

14:02.220 --> 14:06.220
but in the United States we have gone further.

14:06.220 --> 14:11.220
Not only have we embraced empty skills instead of content,

14:11.220 --> 14:15.220
we have in the last ten years become enchanted with the idea

14:15.220 --> 14:21.220
that even teaching academic skills may be very old-fashioned.

14:21.220 --> 14:29.220
Instead, an ever-increasing number of teachers supported by a very thin research base

14:29.220 --> 14:33.220
have been embracing a very different agenda.

14:33.220 --> 14:38.220
The following slide summarizes the new pedagogy in America.

14:41.220 --> 14:48.220
I'll give you a moment to look at these wonderful examples.

14:48.220 --> 14:54.220
As I lay out in my recent book, there is very little serious research

14:54.220 --> 14:57.220
to support any of these ideas.

14:57.220 --> 15:03.220
To take one example, it should be obvious, but apparently it is not,

15:03.220 --> 15:08.220
that one cannot think critically about nothing in particular.

15:08.220 --> 15:13.220
We need to have some knowledge to think critically about,

15:13.220 --> 15:16.220
or take the 21st century skills.

15:16.220 --> 15:20.220
It sounds very relevant, very sexy.

15:20.220 --> 15:25.220
Well, it turns out that 21st century skills are a long, long list

15:25.220 --> 15:29.220
of everything that you want in a human being.

15:29.220 --> 15:34.220
Reliability, capacity to motivate, capacity to work in teams,

15:34.220 --> 15:38.220
information literacy, communication skills, cross-cultural sensitivity,

15:38.220 --> 15:42.220
flexibility, accountability, maybe clean socks.

15:42.220 --> 15:45.220
It is an endless list.

15:45.220 --> 15:50.220
The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars,

15:50.220 --> 15:54.220
hundreds of millions of dollars, in the collective search

15:54.220 --> 16:01.220
to do something, anything other than teach core academic content.

16:01.220 --> 16:05.220
But the impact has been deeply negative.

16:05.220 --> 16:11.220
After some real progress in the 1980s and the 1990s,

16:11.220 --> 16:16.220
progress especially for the poorest students has stopped.

16:16.220 --> 16:21.220
Here are the math results for our high school students.

16:21.220 --> 16:28.220
As you can see, the United States has made exactly zero progress

16:28.220 --> 16:32.220
since 1992, zero.

16:32.220 --> 16:36.220
This is despite the fact that we have spent more dollars

16:36.220 --> 16:42.220
in real dollars after inflation, far more than we did in 1992.

16:42.220 --> 16:46.220
But the situation, while it's bad in mathematics,

16:46.220 --> 16:53.220
is much worse when it comes to students' knowledge of history and civics.

16:53.220 --> 16:57.220
In this, as you see on the slide, in 2018,

16:57.220 --> 17:04.220
just 25% of 13-year-olds in America passed the civics test.

17:04.220 --> 17:10.220
This is the lowest result in the United States of any subject matter test.

17:10.220 --> 17:14.220
It's worse than reading, worse than math, worse than science.

17:14.220 --> 17:20.220
In other words, the result is bad across the country.

17:20.220 --> 17:24.220
The result is bad across the board.

17:24.220 --> 17:30.220
But for African-American and Hispanic students, it's a disaster.

17:30.220 --> 17:35.220
The pass rate is 10% and 13% for those two groups.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.220
Now, this is, again, not just a theoretical problem.

17:40.220 --> 17:43.220
As you can see in the second paragraph,

17:43.220 --> 17:47.220
the Center for Civic Education found in a major survey

17:47.220 --> 17:51.220
that just 30% of Americans born since 1980s,

17:51.220 --> 17:56.220
so the younger generation, believe it's essential to live in a democracy.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.220
I just want that to sink in for a moment.

17:59.220 --> 18:06.220
So 70% of our younger Americans do not think it's particularly important

18:06.220 --> 18:09.220
to live in a democracy.

18:09.220 --> 18:14.220
We may see the results in the next presidential election.

18:14.220 --> 18:18.220
One might think that confronted by these results,

18:18.220 --> 18:25.220
there would be widespread distress over our educational outcomes in the United States.

18:25.220 --> 18:31.220
After all, in math and science, America's international results are very embarrassing.

18:31.220 --> 18:38.220
We do worse, for example, in mathematics than Vietnam, a country we left in ruins.

18:38.220 --> 18:44.220
But instead, America has discovered a deeply and deeply sophisticated way

18:44.220 --> 18:47.220
to handle bad news.

18:47.220 --> 18:51.220
It simply reports bad news as good news.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.220
What do I mean?

18:53.220 --> 18:57.220
Remember that the exam results of American high school students

18:57.220 --> 19:01.220
has been flat since 1990 or so.

19:02.220 --> 19:06.220
Now, if you have flat results,

19:06.220 --> 19:10.220
you would assume that the grades we give to American students,

19:10.220 --> 19:14.220
A, B, C, D, would be flat, right?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.220
Flat results, flat grades.

19:16.220 --> 19:18.220
Oh, no.

19:18.220 --> 19:22.220
No, in America, while the results have been flat,

19:22.220 --> 19:26.220
we have given ever higher grades to our American students.

19:26.220 --> 19:29.220
That's those lines going upwards.

19:29.220 --> 19:32.220
There's a very strange thing, if you think about it.

19:32.220 --> 19:37.220
Why should we give higher and higher grades to the same result?

19:37.220 --> 19:40.220
Not only have we done this in high school,

19:40.220 --> 19:43.220
we've also done it in university.

19:43.220 --> 19:47.220
We have grade inflation in the United States.

19:47.220 --> 19:51.220
What does grade inflation actually mean?

19:51.220 --> 19:57.220
Grade inflation means simply that we call today success

19:57.220 --> 20:01.220
what 20 years ago we called failure.

20:01.220 --> 20:05.220
We have gone up a complete grade in the United States.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.220
It's a fiction. It's a complete myth.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.220
It's a mythology.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.220
It's as if we can't take bad news,

20:13.220 --> 20:16.220
so we simply call it good.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.220
It's beyond embarrassing.

20:18.220 --> 20:21.220
It's a lie that damages children

20:21.220 --> 20:24.220
because much later in life they find out

20:24.220 --> 20:29.220
that they don't have the knowledge they need.

20:29.220 --> 20:32.220
To summarize our argument so far,

20:32.220 --> 20:36.220
America's decision to embrace skills over content

20:36.220 --> 20:39.220
has damaged student learning.

20:39.220 --> 20:42.220
Sympathetic to our rent's argument,

20:42.220 --> 20:46.220
I have been for some time a critic of this flight,

20:46.220 --> 20:48.220
this retreat from content,

20:48.220 --> 20:51.220
this refusal to make judgments about

20:51.220 --> 20:53.220
what is worth learning.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.220
But where does this flight from educational responsibility,

20:57.220 --> 21:02.220
this unwillingness to make judgments about content come from?

21:04.220 --> 21:08.220
Our rent locates this inability to judge,

21:08.220 --> 21:11.220
this refusal to act in judgment,

21:11.220 --> 21:15.220
in thinking itself, in the retreat from thinking.

21:15.220 --> 21:19.220
She writes, the precondition for judgment

21:19.220 --> 21:22.220
is the disposition, the habit,

21:22.220 --> 21:28.220
to live explicitly or consciously with oneself,

21:28.220 --> 21:31.220
to have dialogue with oneself,

21:31.220 --> 21:35.220
to be engaged in that silent dialogue

21:35.220 --> 21:37.220
between me and myself,

21:37.220 --> 21:38.220
which she says,

21:38.220 --> 21:43.220
since Socrates and Plato we call thinking.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.220
To illustrate this silent dialogue

21:46.220 --> 21:49.220
when Socrates says his deepest fear is,

21:49.220 --> 21:50.220
quote,

21:50.220 --> 21:55.220
that I, being one, should be out of tune with myself

21:55.220 --> 21:58.220
and contradict myself.

21:58.220 --> 21:59.220
Close quote.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.220
The meaning is clear.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.220
Even though I am one person,

22:03.220 --> 22:06.220
I am not simply one person.

22:06.220 --> 22:10.220
I have a self and I am related to myself.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.220
I am not simply one person.

22:13.220 --> 22:16.220
I am self and I am related to myself.

22:16.220 --> 22:18.220
This self is not an illusion.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.220
It makes itself heard by talking.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.220
I talk to myself.

22:23.220 --> 22:25.220
That is what thinking is.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.220
If I do wrong,

22:28.220 --> 22:31.220
this is Arendt and Plato,

22:31.220 --> 22:35.220
the key point is not that somebody else will find me guilty,

22:35.220 --> 22:38.220
that somebody else will scold me.

22:38.220 --> 22:42.220
The point is I have to live with that wrongdoer.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.220
I have to be in this,

22:44.220 --> 22:47.220
and this is Arendt's phrase, unbearable intimacy.

22:47.220 --> 22:51.220
I can never get rid of myself.

22:51.220 --> 22:56.220
Invited by thought into a lifelong dialogue with myself,

22:56.220 --> 22:59.220
thinking is done in solitude.

22:59.220 --> 23:01.220
This is not loneliness.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.220
This is solitude.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.220
It is the responsibility of the educator to judge

23:06.220 --> 23:09.220
which content to teach a child

23:09.220 --> 23:13.220
so that the child's developing internal dialogue

23:13.220 --> 23:18.220
of self with self is not empty, random,

23:18.220 --> 23:20.220
or filled with noise,

23:20.220 --> 23:23.220
but is supplied with what is worth.

23:23.220 --> 23:26.220
Worth something, the content of thought.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.220
But please note too that we have slipped

23:29.220 --> 23:33.220
almost without noticing into the realm of ethics.

23:33.220 --> 23:36.220
If the content of my thought is unworthy,

23:36.220 --> 23:41.220
if it is trash, my habits of thought are thus debased.

23:41.220 --> 23:46.220
I am condemned to be in that unbearable intimacy

23:46.220 --> 23:50.220
with my own emptiness, my own worthlessness.

23:50.220 --> 23:54.220
Once again, the United States offers us a vivid

23:54.220 --> 23:56.220
and disturbing model.

23:56.220 --> 24:00.220
The average teenager in the United States today

24:00.220 --> 24:05.220
is on social media for almost eight hours every day.

24:05.220 --> 24:08.220
That's the most recent data.

24:08.220 --> 24:11.220
That's longer than they are in a school setting.

24:11.220 --> 24:14.220
It means they're coming home and they're right on the machine

24:14.220 --> 24:16.220
and they stay on the machine.

24:16.220 --> 24:20.220
While school is focused in America on offering

24:20.220 --> 24:23.220
often content-empty skills,

24:23.220 --> 24:27.220
it is social media that supplies the content of thought

24:27.220 --> 24:29.220
unsupervised by adults.

24:29.220 --> 24:32.220
There are no boundaries for the content

24:32.220 --> 24:36.220
that floods the smartphone or the computer.

24:36.220 --> 24:40.220
Once upon a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in the Emile

24:40.220 --> 24:43.220
that children needed to experience limits,

24:43.220 --> 24:46.220
he called them walls of bronze, close quote,

24:46.220 --> 24:49.220
today those walls have collapsed

24:49.220 --> 24:52.220
and the child is flooded by the chaos,

24:52.220 --> 24:56.220
the cacophony, the noise of the world.

24:56.220 --> 25:01.220
The internal space, the dialogue of the child with herself,

25:01.220 --> 25:05.220
collapses under this avalanč.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.220
The result, unsurprisingly,

25:09.220 --> 25:12.220
is the rapid growth in the United States

25:12.220 --> 25:14.220
of childhood depression

25:14.220 --> 25:19.220
and an increasing unwillingness made worse by COVID

25:19.220 --> 25:22.220
to attend school at all.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.220
Today in Baltimore, where I live,

25:25.220 --> 25:30.220
some 65% of high school students

25:30.220 --> 25:33.220
are chronically absent from school,

25:33.220 --> 25:38.220
meaning they miss more than 10% of school days.

25:38.220 --> 25:42.220
Competing with the content of the internet,

25:42.220 --> 25:48.220
the skills-based education cannot compete.

25:48.220 --> 25:53.220
It is too boring, too fragmented, too empty.

25:53.220 --> 25:57.220
It does not create ideas that are worth holding in mind.

25:58.220 --> 26:01.220
Above all, with some exceptions,

26:01.220 --> 26:03.220
especially if students are lucky enough

26:03.220 --> 26:05.220
to have strong science teachers,

26:05.220 --> 26:10.220
it does not provide material for serious thinking.

26:10.220 --> 26:15.220
Other animals reproduce, hunt, build homes,

26:15.220 --> 26:19.220
communicate, remember, experience emotions as we do,

26:19.220 --> 26:23.220
but human beings alone can evaluate in language

26:23.220 --> 26:26.220
our own actions and those of others,

26:26.220 --> 26:29.220
appreciate beauty, acquire facilities

26:29.220 --> 26:31.220
in different fields of knowledge,

26:31.220 --> 26:34.220
be they literate, mathematical, historical,

26:34.220 --> 26:37.220
scientific, or those expressed in musical

26:37.220 --> 26:40.220
or other artistic or physical forms.

26:40.220 --> 26:43.220
Only human beings can think reflectively

26:43.220 --> 26:47.220
about the direction, the unfolding trajectory

26:47.220 --> 26:51.220
of our lives without a well-developed capacity

26:51.220 --> 26:57.220
in which thoughtfulness life becomes a matter of chance.

26:57.220 --> 27:00.220
A life lived at the mercy of instinct,

27:00.220 --> 27:05.220
of unfiltered emotion is the life of a human puppet

27:05.220 --> 27:09.220
directed by forces of chance and circumstance

27:09.220 --> 27:12.220
in his work Plato famously compares

27:12.220 --> 27:14.220
such human beings to puppets,

27:14.220 --> 27:17.220
whose strings are pulled by the gods.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.220
The most fundamental purpose of education

27:20.220 --> 27:24.220
is thus to nurture our capacity to think.

27:24.220 --> 27:26.220
Education is the means by which

27:26.220 --> 27:30.220
our most human capabilities are transformed

27:30.220 --> 27:33.220
from just potential to a life in which

27:33.220 --> 27:36.220
we can interrogate our experience

27:36.220 --> 27:39.220
so as to learn and integrate our experience

27:39.220 --> 27:41.220
into future action.

27:41.220 --> 27:44.220
Michael Oakshot, philosopher and political theorist

27:44.220 --> 27:47.220
put it this way, I quote,

27:47.220 --> 27:50.220
the price of the intelligent activity

27:50.220 --> 27:54.220
which constitutes being human is learning.

27:54.220 --> 27:58.220
When the human condition is said to be burdensome, heavy,

27:58.220 --> 28:01.220
what is being pointed out is not the mere necessity

28:01.220 --> 28:05.220
of having to think, to speak, and to act

28:05.220 --> 28:08.220
instead of merely being like a stone

28:08.220 --> 28:10.220
or growing like a tree,

28:10.220 --> 28:13.220
but the impossibility of thinking or feeling

28:13.220 --> 28:17.220
without having slowly and often painfully

28:17.220 --> 28:21.220
learned to think something.

28:21.220 --> 28:24.220
While the need for a good education

28:24.220 --> 28:27.220
can be defended for many reasons,

28:27.220 --> 28:30.220
including both economic and civic,

28:30.220 --> 28:33.220
our most essential responsibility as educators

28:33.220 --> 28:36.220
involves the guiding, the careful nurturing

28:36.220 --> 28:40.220
of children's learning to think.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.220
The argument of my recent book is that there are

28:43.220 --> 28:46.220
three crucial elements in the education of thought.

28:46.220 --> 28:50.220
Learning academic content, we've talked about this

28:50.220 --> 28:53.220
in literature, history, math and science at least,

28:53.220 --> 28:57.220
and education in ethics and in education in aesthetics.

28:57.220 --> 29:00.220
Our schools need to nurture the capacity

29:00.220 --> 29:03.220
for academic learning, ethical reflection

29:03.220 --> 29:06.220
and aesthetic sensibility because they are crucial

29:06.220 --> 29:09.220
to forging a fulfilling life.

29:09.220 --> 29:13.220
I can only sketch that argument today.

29:13.220 --> 29:17.220
We've already discussed our refusal to take responsibility

29:17.220 --> 29:20.220
for the rich content of education,

29:20.220 --> 29:23.220
the core of academic learning.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.220
We now briefly will consider ethics

29:26.220 --> 29:30.220
and then turn to aesthetics.

29:30.220 --> 29:34.220
The founding American hope now exported to the world

29:34.220 --> 29:38.220
is that our lives might enable the pursuit of happiness,

29:38.220 --> 29:40.220
what exactly does that mean?

29:40.220 --> 29:44.220
Surely not that we do anything at all without thought.

29:44.220 --> 29:48.220
24 centuries ago Aristotle coined the term eudaimonio,

29:48.220 --> 29:53.220
human flourishing to describe the concept of happiness.

29:53.220 --> 29:56.220
Eudaimonio, Aristotle argued, is the highest,

29:56.220 --> 29:58.220
the most important of human ends,

29:58.220 --> 30:01.220
the purpose of our existence.

30:01.220 --> 30:04.220
A well-lived life is one in which the aim of happiness

30:04.220 --> 30:07.220
or human flourishing is our north star,

30:07.220 --> 30:12.220
guiding our choice, our values, our hopes, our dreams.

30:15.220 --> 30:18.220
A well-lived life, an ethical life,

30:18.220 --> 30:22.220
Aristotle insists, is about making wise choices.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.220
If they are well educated in ethics,

30:24.220 --> 30:27.220
human beings will have learned to weigh the consequences

30:27.220 --> 30:30.220
of their choices in terms of how the outcomes

30:30.220 --> 30:35.220
will affect the pathway, the life of their life story,

30:35.220 --> 30:38.220
the values that they will embrace.

30:38.220 --> 30:41.220
Aristotle argues that in making choices

30:41.220 --> 30:44.220
that will shape the future direction of our life,

30:44.220 --> 30:48.220
well-educated humans will seek out opportunities

30:48.220 --> 30:51.220
to be involved in actions that are courageous,

30:51.220 --> 30:53.220
generous, and aren't honorable.

30:53.220 --> 30:57.220
As you know, Aristotle calls the act of choosing

30:57.220 --> 31:00.220
or reasoning about one's actions fronasis,

31:00.220 --> 31:04.220
usually translated as intellectual virtue

31:04.220 --> 31:07.220
of exercising practical wisdom.

31:07.220 --> 31:11.220
When we exercise it, we combine the careful consideration

31:11.220 --> 31:14.220
of the pathway of our life and a commitment

31:14.220 --> 31:17.220
to understanding the virtuous course of actions

31:17.220 --> 31:20.220
in reaching our goals.

31:20.220 --> 31:24.220
Education worthy of the name is crucial to fronasis

31:24.220 --> 31:27.220
because it is through education that children,

31:27.220 --> 31:30.220
through repetition that becomes habit,

31:30.220 --> 31:33.220
come to enjoy virtuous actions.

31:33.220 --> 31:36.220
They will want to forge paths of living

31:36.220 --> 31:40.220
in which they can enjoy what a virtuous life can offer.

31:40.220 --> 31:43.220
In other words, they will have learned to desire

31:43.220 --> 31:49.220
and thus seek to make the opportunities for a good life.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.220
Aristotle's key point is this.

31:51.220 --> 31:55.220
If adults are one day to successfully deliberate,

31:55.220 --> 31:57.220
think about what is good,

31:57.220 --> 32:00.220
they must already have come to enjoy doing

32:00.220 --> 32:04.220
what is just, courageous, honest as children.

32:04.220 --> 32:07.220
In šort, they will have developed a moral compass.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.220
In Aristotle's words,

32:09.220 --> 32:13.220
a good upbringing makes the noble a part,

32:13.220 --> 32:17.220
perhaps the chief part of what is good in us.

32:17.220 --> 32:22.220
How do we acquire this enjoyment of ethical choicemaking?

32:22.220 --> 32:24.220
First through lived experience.

32:24.220 --> 32:27.220
This is why, to cite him once again,

32:27.220 --> 32:30.220
in Rousseau's Émile,

32:30.220 --> 32:34.220
the tutor of the boy organizes the experience of the child

32:34.220 --> 32:37.220
so that Émile experiences the connection

32:37.220 --> 32:41.220
between wise actions and their positive consequences.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.220
But secondly, ethical choicemaking

32:44.220 --> 32:47.220
is developed through more formal education,

32:47.220 --> 32:51.220
through stories, myths, history

32:51.220 --> 32:55.220
that enable children to inhabit multiple worlds

32:55.220 --> 32:57.220
beyond their own horizons,

32:57.220 --> 33:01.220
to derive thoughtful lessons from those stories

33:01.220 --> 33:04.220
which will serve their own developing capacities

33:04.220 --> 33:07.220
for phronasis as they mature.

33:07.220 --> 33:10.220
The curriculum we devise for our young children,

33:10.220 --> 33:12.220
the tales we tell them,

33:12.220 --> 33:16.220
or we read to them before they think for themselves,

33:16.220 --> 33:19.220
are not simply devices to enable them

33:19.220 --> 33:21.220
to master the mechanics of reading,

33:21.220 --> 33:23.220
important though that is.

33:23.220 --> 33:28.220
But a key reference point for an education in ethics.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.220
Through their capacity to imagine,

33:30.220 --> 33:33.220
children place themselves in previously unimagined

33:33.220 --> 33:35.220
and unexpected worlds.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.220
They associate with characters in the stories they read

33:38.220 --> 33:41.220
and they take their experiences to heart.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.220
The resulting lessons are ethically crucial.

33:44.220 --> 33:47.220
Children in that imaginative space

33:47.220 --> 33:50.220
rehearse the consequences of fictional

33:50.220 --> 33:53.220
historical characters that they read about,

33:53.220 --> 33:56.220
learning about the consequences of decisions

33:56.220 --> 33:58.220
made with too little thought

33:58.220 --> 34:02.220
or wise choices that lead to well-lived lives.

34:02.220 --> 34:05.220
That is what phronasis consists in,

34:05.220 --> 34:08.220
a conscious effort to slow down,

34:08.220 --> 34:10.220
to rehearse various pathways,

34:10.220 --> 34:13.220
to ask tough questions of oneself,

34:13.220 --> 34:17.220
to enable the imagination to draw on multiple possibilities,

34:18.220 --> 34:21.220
to deepen one's awareness in short,

34:21.220 --> 34:23.220
to be thoughtful.

34:23.220 --> 34:25.220
Today, particularly in the United States,

34:25.220 --> 34:28.220
we've given up on ethical education.

34:28.220 --> 34:31.220
We tried something called character education

34:31.220 --> 34:33.220
in the 1980s, early 90s,

34:33.220 --> 34:35.220
we've let that go,

34:35.220 --> 34:37.220
we've simply turned our back

34:37.220 --> 34:40.220
on one of the most essential tasks of education

34:40.220 --> 34:44.220
to provide an ethical compass.

34:44.220 --> 34:46.220
And now aesthetics.

34:46.220 --> 34:51.220
A life lived without an educated attunement to the beautiful

34:51.220 --> 34:55.220
will be as if the very colors of one's life's experiences

34:55.220 --> 34:57.220
are washed out.

34:57.220 --> 35:01.220
Children deserve opportunities to nourish their imagination,

35:01.220 --> 35:05.220
to respond to the beautiful in the outside world

35:05.220 --> 35:08.220
or a museum, playing a musical instrument,

35:08.220 --> 35:11.220
crafting a sculpture, mastering a dance

35:11.220 --> 35:13.220
or perspective in painting.

35:13.220 --> 35:16.220
To have to argue for an education in aesthetics

35:16.220 --> 35:18.220
is surprising,

35:18.220 --> 35:22.220
given its fundamental value to human sensibility.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.220
But it is also vital,

35:24.220 --> 35:27.220
since today it has so little standing

35:27.220 --> 35:29.220
in so many of our schools,

35:29.220 --> 35:31.220
at least in the United States.

35:31.220 --> 35:34.220
We have in America created

35:34.220 --> 35:37.220
a class system of subjects.

35:37.220 --> 35:40.220
Math and reading somehow is first class.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.220
Science and history, second class.

35:43.220 --> 35:46.220
We sometimes test them, we sometimes don't.

35:46.220 --> 35:48.220
Everything else is third class.

35:48.220 --> 35:51.220
Everything from philosophy to arts

35:51.220 --> 35:54.220
to physical education to computer,

35:54.220 --> 35:56.220
it's all third class.

35:58.220 --> 36:02.220
Immanuel Kant is compelling on the topic of aesthetics.

36:02.220 --> 36:05.220
In making aesthetic judgments,

36:05.220 --> 36:07.220
Kant as Kant sees it,

36:07.220 --> 36:09.220
we are in the realm of free choice.

36:09.220 --> 36:12.220
We cannot appeal to some scientific principle

36:12.220 --> 36:15.220
or proof that something is worthy

36:15.220 --> 36:17.220
of being called beautiful.

36:17.220 --> 36:19.220
We are just on our own

36:19.220 --> 36:21.220
with our experiences to rely on.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.220
This is because, he says,

36:23.220 --> 36:25.220
when we make aesthetic judgments

36:25.220 --> 36:27.220
that this painting is beautiful,

36:27.220 --> 36:29.220
nothing is given.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.220
Thinking doesn't determine in advance

36:31.220 --> 36:33.220
our own experience.

36:33.220 --> 36:36.220
We are free to act, to react to the painting

36:36.220 --> 36:38.220
as we please.

36:38.220 --> 36:41.220
But that produces a major problem.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.220
Our aesthetic judgments

36:43.220 --> 36:45.220
just a matter of private opinion,

36:45.220 --> 36:47.220
like, I like chocolate ice cream,

36:47.220 --> 36:48.220
you like vanilla.

36:48.220 --> 36:50.220
Kant rejects this view.

36:50.220 --> 36:53.220
He claims that when we make aesthetic judgments

36:53.220 --> 36:56.220
we are doing something very, very different.

36:56.220 --> 37:00.220
We are responding to something deep in human nature.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.220
And that response is so strong

37:03.220 --> 37:06.220
that we find we want to share our response

37:06.220 --> 37:08.220
with other people, with each other.

37:08.220 --> 37:10.220
When I say this is beautiful,

37:10.220 --> 37:13.220
I make a claim not just for myself,

37:13.220 --> 37:16.220
but for all humanity.

37:16.220 --> 37:18.220
As we encounter the objects,

37:18.220 --> 37:20.220
our thoughts about it come together

37:20.220 --> 37:23.220
in a positive and powerful urge

37:23.220 --> 37:25.220
to share with others.

37:25.220 --> 37:27.220
We are convinced that they, too,

37:27.220 --> 37:29.220
should be struck by the quality

37:29.220 --> 37:31.220
of what has been created.

37:31.220 --> 37:34.220
Don't you see, don't you hear

37:34.220 --> 37:37.220
how beautiful this is?

37:37.220 --> 37:39.220
What occurs inside our mind

37:39.220 --> 37:41.220
when we are moved by the beauty of an object,

37:41.220 --> 37:44.220
when it evokes this powerful urge

37:44.220 --> 37:47.220
to celebrate, retain, and communicate

37:47.220 --> 37:49.220
our experience?

37:49.220 --> 37:52.220
Kant suggests that at that moment

37:52.220 --> 37:55.220
both our facilities of imagination

37:55.220 --> 37:58.220
and understanding are equally active.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.220
If an object creates an experience

38:01.220 --> 38:04.220
of what Kant calls the harmony

38:04.220 --> 38:06.220
of understanding and imagination,

38:06.220 --> 38:09.220
we feel that unity as a deep pleasure

38:09.220 --> 38:12.220
and experience of beauty.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.220
A vast literature suggests

38:15.220 --> 38:18.220
that in his discussion of how imagination

38:18.220 --> 38:20.220
and cognition or thought come together

38:20.220 --> 38:23.220
in a moment of appreciation of beauty,

38:23.220 --> 38:26.220
these account is not without problems.

38:26.220 --> 38:30.220
In fact, in one point in his famous third critique,

38:30.220 --> 38:32.220
which is talking about aesthetic judgment,

38:32.220 --> 38:34.220
Kant stops and says,

38:34.220 --> 38:36.220
I'm not sure I understand what I'm writing,

38:36.220 --> 38:38.220
so maybe we too.

38:38.220 --> 38:42.220
But as he describes this aesthetic experience,

38:42.220 --> 38:44.220
he is also talking about something

38:44.220 --> 38:46.220
very familiar to us.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.220
A piece of music or art

38:48.220 --> 38:51.220
startles us out of indifference,

38:51.220 --> 38:53.220
out of complacency.

38:53.220 --> 38:55.220
We are drawn to it powerfully.

38:55.220 --> 38:58.220
We may make some effort to describe it,

38:58.220 --> 39:00.220
but that effort gives way before

39:00.220 --> 39:03.220
the just the experience of the painting.

39:03.220 --> 39:07.220
We are amazed, delighted, horrified.

39:09.220 --> 39:12.220
The British philosopher Peter de Bola

39:12.220 --> 39:16.220
describes an example of this aesthetic experience

39:16.220 --> 39:20.220
as he stands in front of Bonnet Newman's abstract painting

39:20.220 --> 39:24.220
Vier heroico sublimus man heroic and sublime.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.220
He writes as follows,

39:26.220 --> 39:29.220
the image seems to compose me

39:29.220 --> 39:33.220
to generate a sense of well-being.

39:33.220 --> 39:37.220
Here de Bola describes both an emotional response

39:37.220 --> 39:40.220
and a sense that the painting was offering him

39:40.220 --> 39:42.220
new forms of thought.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.220
The painting creates the feeling

39:44.220 --> 39:46.220
like one is knowing something,

39:46.220 --> 39:51.220
a heightened sense of the self being well composed.

39:51.220 --> 39:54.220
That is aesthetic knowing feeling

39:54.220 --> 39:58.220
which de Bola places between pure emotion

39:58.220 --> 40:00.220
and thinking,

40:00.220 --> 40:02.220
or in plain English between thinking and thought

40:02.220 --> 40:04.220
is very powerful,

40:04.220 --> 40:08.220
even if we cannot fully understand or define it.

40:08.220 --> 40:11.220
De Bola's experience in front of this painting

40:11.220 --> 40:13.220
bears witness to what Kant described

40:13.220 --> 40:16.220
as an encounter with the truly beautiful.

40:16.220 --> 40:19.220
De Bola invites us to see the painting

40:19.220 --> 40:21.220
and share the experience.

40:21.220 --> 40:25.220
As he does so, he's recalling something very personal,

40:25.220 --> 40:28.220
his reaction to looking at the painting,

40:28.220 --> 40:33.220
but his claim is that all of us can have that experience.

40:33.220 --> 40:37.220
Compared to the exercise of simply reporting facts

40:37.220 --> 40:39.220
about the canvas,

40:39.220 --> 40:42.220
an exercise in which my engagement is quite weak,

40:42.220 --> 40:45.220
the effort of evoking an aesthetic claim

40:45.220 --> 40:48.220
is searching and demanding.

40:48.220 --> 40:52.220
It involves translating something very private

40:52.220 --> 40:54.220
into a shareable language

40:54.220 --> 40:57.220
into what de Bola calls a mutual terrain.

40:57.220 --> 41:02.220
The experience of sharing can be a powerful invitation

41:02.220 --> 41:06.220
to community, to inclusivity.

41:06.220 --> 41:09.220
These aren't just theoretical claims.

41:09.220 --> 41:13.220
In 2021, researchers from the United States and Germany

41:13.220 --> 41:17.220
examined the reaction of many hundreds of students

41:17.220 --> 41:20.220
from the U.S., the U.K. and India

41:20.220 --> 41:22.220
while looking at an image

41:22.220 --> 41:24.220
or listening to music

41:24.220 --> 41:28.220
or recalling a personal experience of beauty.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.220
The results of the research

41:30.220 --> 41:33.220
closely echo Kant's philosophical model.

41:33.220 --> 41:35.220
I quote,

41:35.220 --> 41:37.220
top-rated beauty experiences

41:37.220 --> 41:41.220
are strongly characterized by intense pleasure,

41:41.220 --> 41:44.220
an impression of universality,

41:44.220 --> 41:47.220
the wish to continue the experience,

41:47.220 --> 41:50.220
exceeding expectation

41:50.220 --> 41:54.220
and harmony in the variety and meaning

41:54.220 --> 41:56.220
of the experience.

41:56.220 --> 41:58.220
As Kant suggests,

41:58.220 --> 42:00.220
the language of thought and emotions

42:00.220 --> 42:03.220
are not separated but together at once.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.220
A child becomes conscious

42:05.220 --> 42:07.220
of what is in front of her.

42:07.220 --> 42:10.220
Trying to produce the sound on a violin,

42:10.220 --> 42:13.220
she struggles knowing it's not there yet.

42:13.220 --> 42:15.220
She experiences her own knowing,

42:15.220 --> 42:17.220
struggle as frustration

42:17.220 --> 42:19.220
but she wants to succeed

42:19.220 --> 42:22.220
to communicate the sound to us all.

42:22.220 --> 42:25.220
Or to take another example from the visual arts,

42:25.220 --> 42:28.220
imagine a student in front of a Rothko painting

42:28.220 --> 42:30.220
in a museum.

42:30.220 --> 42:34.220
There's no immediate meaning to the painting

42:34.220 --> 42:36.220
and the tendency of a student,

42:36.220 --> 42:39.220
particularly today, is just to keep walking.

42:39.220 --> 42:42.220
The teacher has to stop the student,

42:42.220 --> 42:45.220
place the student in front of the painting

42:45.220 --> 42:49.220
and enable the process of imagination and thought.

42:49.220 --> 42:52.220
Aesthetic education is above all

42:52.220 --> 42:55.220
an exhilarating experience of losing the self

42:55.220 --> 42:57.220
in an encounter,

42:57.220 --> 43:01.220
only to return to an enlarged and deepened self.

43:01.220 --> 43:03.220
This sounds theoretical,

43:03.220 --> 43:05.220
but it can be seen every day

43:05.220 --> 43:08.220
in the 94th aphorism of Nietzsche's

43:08.220 --> 43:10.220
Beyond Good and Evil.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.220
The seriousness, another translation,

43:13.220 --> 43:17.220
is the intensity of a child at play.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.220
You've all seen it.

43:19.220 --> 43:21.220
The intensity, the energy,

43:21.220 --> 43:24.220
the loss and recovery of a self

43:24.220 --> 43:27.220
comes from this energy that is fed

43:27.220 --> 43:30.220
by engagement with the experience.

43:30.220 --> 43:34.220
To offer students a rich set of such aesthetic experiences

43:34.220 --> 43:37.220
is a core value of education.

43:37.220 --> 43:39.220
Martin Heidegger, German philosopher,

43:39.220 --> 43:41.220
emphasizes the interaction

43:41.220 --> 43:45.220
between aesthetic judgment and thinking.

43:45.220 --> 43:47.220
Writing that our encounters with objects

43:47.220 --> 43:49.220
that are beautiful is not merely

43:49.220 --> 43:51.220
a matter of feeling,

43:51.220 --> 43:53.220
but are, I quote, amongst the most

43:53.220 --> 43:56.220
thought-provoking of all encounters.

43:56.220 --> 44:00.220
Aesthetic experiences also have ethical dimensions,

44:00.220 --> 44:03.220
as the cultural critic Roger Kimball

44:03.220 --> 44:06.220
reminds us when we share aesthetic responses

44:06.220 --> 44:08.220
with one another,

44:08.220 --> 44:10.220
we are reminded powerfully

44:10.220 --> 44:12.220
of our common humanity,

44:12.220 --> 44:15.220
of our capacity to share freely

44:15.220 --> 44:17.220
a sense of beauty

44:17.220 --> 44:19.220
that elevates us as human beings.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.220
Or, in the words of Dante

44:21.220 --> 44:24.220
from the Purgatorio canto 18,

44:24.220 --> 44:28.220
beauty awakens the soul to act.

44:28.220 --> 44:31.220
Thought, ethics and beauty

44:31.220 --> 44:33.220
were so, I would argue,

44:33.220 --> 44:36.220
are three intertwined and crucial elements

44:36.220 --> 44:39.220
of an education worthy of the name.

44:39.220 --> 44:42.220
To give up on making judgments about

44:42.220 --> 44:45.220
and then teaching a challenging

44:45.220 --> 44:47.220
content-rich curriculum,

44:47.220 --> 44:51.220
to leave ethical development to chance,

44:51.220 --> 44:54.220
to turn one's back on an education in beauty

44:54.220 --> 44:58.220
is to betray what it means to be a teacher.

44:58.220 --> 45:01.220
This three-part surrender

45:01.220 --> 45:04.220
because knowledge, ethics and aesthetics

45:04.220 --> 45:06.220
are intertwined

45:06.220 --> 45:08.220
is not a beautiful gift

45:08.220 --> 45:10.220
we give to the freedom of our children,

45:10.220 --> 45:13.220
it is simply to announce

45:13.220 --> 45:17.220
the loss of our role as teachers.

45:17.220 --> 45:20.220
In the United States today

45:20.220 --> 45:23.220
we have developed a habit

45:23.220 --> 45:27.220
of teaching that's very different.

45:27.220 --> 45:29.220
And I want to re-enter

45:29.220 --> 45:31.220
that we've moved towards our close

45:31.220 --> 45:36.220
this contemporary educational politics.

45:36.220 --> 45:39.220
We have turned our back on knowledge

45:39.220 --> 45:42.220
of the canon, of essential texts

45:42.220 --> 45:45.220
and I have argued with Hannah Arendt

45:45.220 --> 45:49.220
that this is not in any way a radical move,

45:49.220 --> 45:53.220
it is in fact to give up on enabling children

45:53.220 --> 45:56.220
to prepare for radical action.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.220
Today in the United States

45:58.220 --> 46:00.220
the argument is we must focus

46:00.220 --> 46:03.220
on teaching multiculturalism.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.220
Faced with students from all over the world,

46:05.220 --> 46:09.220
from many national ethnic religious

46:09.220 --> 46:11.220
and racial origins,

46:11.220 --> 46:15.220
our education, and you've heard this a thousand times,

46:15.220 --> 46:17.220
must respect their differences,

46:17.220 --> 46:20.220
must respect their differences.

46:20.220 --> 46:22.220
But a moment's thought should tell us

46:22.220 --> 46:26.220
that this has become educationally impossible.

46:26.220 --> 46:28.220
We were once told

46:28.220 --> 46:30.220
that we are to be very respectful,

46:30.220 --> 46:34.220
sensitive to Hispanic culture.

46:34.220 --> 46:36.220
Sounded reasonable.

46:36.220 --> 46:40.220
22 million Hispanic students.

46:40.220 --> 46:42.220
We are now reminded however

46:42.220 --> 46:45.220
of the deep differences correctly

46:45.220 --> 46:48.220
between Jamaicans and Hispanics

46:48.220 --> 46:51.220
or Hispanics and Latinos.

46:51.220 --> 46:54.220
We should realize that Cubans and Dominicans

46:54.220 --> 46:58.220
cannot be regarded as sharing the same identity.

46:58.220 --> 47:00.220
And so the list goes on,

47:00.220 --> 47:03.220
more and more differences.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.220
With the logical conclusion

47:05.220 --> 47:07.220
that perhaps every child should be taught

47:07.220 --> 47:10.220
a unique cultural content,

47:10.220 --> 47:13.220
the result would be a complete fragmentation

47:13.220 --> 47:15.220
of the curriculum.

47:15.220 --> 47:18.220
The word humanity should remind us

47:19.220 --> 47:22.220
the education of human beings.

47:22.220 --> 47:24.220
Some 60 years ago,

47:24.220 --> 47:26.220
President Kennedy reminded Americans

47:26.220 --> 47:27.220
that, quote,

47:27.220 --> 47:29.220
we all breathe the same air,

47:29.220 --> 47:31.220
we are all mortal,

47:31.220 --> 47:35.220
and we all cherish our children's future, close quote.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.220
If we no longer believe

47:37.220 --> 47:39.220
that texts can speak to all of us,

47:39.220 --> 47:41.220
if I cannot read Dante

47:41.220 --> 47:44.220
because I am not Italian and not Christian,

47:44.220 --> 47:47.220
if I cannot teach Dante to children

47:47.220 --> 47:50.220
because they are African American or Cuban,

47:50.220 --> 47:53.220
then I have turned my back on humanity

47:53.220 --> 47:56.220
on an education in what is most essential,

47:56.220 --> 47:59.220
most beautiful, most instructive

47:59.220 --> 48:02.220
to leading a considered life.

48:02.220 --> 48:06.220
Education is not about flattering,

48:06.220 --> 48:10.220
not about flattering the color of my skin

48:10.220 --> 48:13.220
or about celebrating the personality

48:13.220 --> 48:15.220
I happen to be

48:15.220 --> 48:18.220
or ensuring that my sense of self

48:18.220 --> 48:21.220
is never upset or angered.

48:21.220 --> 48:24.220
We seem to have discovered a new right

48:24.220 --> 48:26.220
in the United States Constitution,

48:26.220 --> 48:28.220
a right not to be upset.

48:28.220 --> 48:31.220
I don't find it in the document.

48:31.220 --> 48:35.220
To educate does not close one's eyes

48:35.220 --> 48:39.220
to the sufferings of people or of nations.

48:39.220 --> 48:44.220
Evil, too, is woven into the human condition.

48:44.220 --> 48:47.220
Education's most essential task, however,

48:47.220 --> 48:50.220
is to draw myself out of myself,

48:50.220 --> 48:52.220
edukare,

48:52.220 --> 48:55.220
to tell me the story of the human condition,

48:55.220 --> 48:58.220
enabling me to transcend

48:58.220 --> 49:02.220
the self I was as an ignorant child.

49:04.220 --> 49:07.220
An argument grounded in the humanities

49:07.220 --> 49:11.220
should perhaps come towards a close in poetry.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.220
Toto 115,

49:13.220 --> 49:15.220
one of the most troubled,

49:15.220 --> 49:17.220
most gifted poets of the last century,

49:17.220 --> 49:19.220
writing in his 80s

49:19.220 --> 49:22.220
and imprisoned for treason,

49:22.220 --> 49:24.220
provided four lines

49:24.220 --> 49:28.220
that demand the education I've tried today to summon.

49:28.220 --> 49:30.220
The academic preparation

49:30.220 --> 49:32.220
to hear the core metaphor,

49:32.220 --> 49:35.220
to trace in his language

49:35.220 --> 49:38.220
the echoes of Homer and Dante,

49:38.220 --> 49:40.220
an ethical sensibility

49:40.220 --> 49:44.220
to hear the harsh self condemnation of the poet

49:44.220 --> 49:46.220
and to forgive his madness,

49:46.220 --> 49:48.220
an aesthetic response

49:48.220 --> 49:51.220
to hear the beauty of the verse

49:51.220 --> 49:54.220
and ultimately to education

49:54.220 --> 49:57.220
that still believes in the future of humanities,

49:57.220 --> 50:00.220
for which the dying, anguished,

50:00.220 --> 50:04.220
sick Ezra Pound still has hope.

50:04.220 --> 50:07.220
A blown husk that is finished,

50:07.220 --> 50:10.220
but the light sings eternal.

50:10.220 --> 50:13.220
A pale flare over marshes

50:13.220 --> 50:15.220
where the salt hay whispers

50:15.220 --> 50:18.220
to tides change.

50:18.220 --> 50:20.220
A blown husk,

50:20.220 --> 50:22.220
Ezra himself,

50:22.220 --> 50:24.220
that is finished.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.220
His life is over,

50:26.220 --> 50:28.220
he has betrayed all his own values.

50:28.220 --> 50:30.220
But the light sings eternal.

50:30.220 --> 50:33.220
The light of the human condition of high culture

50:33.220 --> 50:36.220
is still there,

50:36.220 --> 50:38.220
is still singing.

50:38.220 --> 50:40.220
It's a pale flare.

50:40.220 --> 50:43.220
It is a delicate fragile light

50:43.220 --> 50:45.220
over the marshes

50:45.220 --> 50:48.220
where the salt hay whispers to tides change.

50:48.220 --> 50:50.220
The edge of the ocean

50:50.220 --> 50:52.220
in his larger part of the canto,

50:52.220 --> 50:55.220
Pound is recalling the Odyssey,

50:55.220 --> 50:59.220
the return of Odysseus,

50:59.220 --> 51:03.220
the tides of the oceans of the world.

51:03.220 --> 51:05.220
To introduce,

51:05.220 --> 51:08.220
to teach such verse

51:08.220 --> 51:12.220
is what is meant by education.

51:12.220 --> 51:14.220
And so I say to all of you,

51:14.220 --> 51:16.220
to all the educators,

51:16.220 --> 51:18.220
to all the teachers here today,

51:18.220 --> 51:22.220
you have chosen a great calling.

51:22.220 --> 51:24.220
The life prospects,

51:24.220 --> 51:26.220
the imaginings,

51:26.220 --> 51:28.220
the interior furnishings,

51:28.220 --> 51:31.220
the cultural enemy of your student's mind,

51:31.220 --> 51:34.220
the cultural enemy of your student's mind,

51:34.220 --> 51:38.220
all of this is in your hands.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.220
Of course,

51:40.220 --> 51:42.220
there will be difficult days,

51:42.220 --> 51:44.220
very difficult days,

51:44.220 --> 51:46.220
as well as joyful ones.

51:46.220 --> 51:49.220
You will need what the great poet

51:49.220 --> 51:51.220
Paul Eloard called in French

51:51.220 --> 51:54.220
le dur desil de duré,

51:54.220 --> 51:58.220
the difficult desire to endure.

51:58.220 --> 52:01.220
But each day, every day,

52:01.220 --> 52:04.220
remind yourself that on this day

52:04.220 --> 52:07.220
your teaching may open a world

52:07.220 --> 52:11.220
to a young person, to a child.

52:11.220 --> 52:15.220
There is no greater privilege.

52:15.220 --> 52:17.220
I thank you.

52:28.220 --> 52:30.220
Thank you, David,

52:30.220 --> 52:32.220
for such an inspiring speech.

52:32.220 --> 52:34.220
We have a few minutes

52:34.220 --> 52:37.220
for some brief questions.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.220
If someone wants to start

52:40.220 --> 52:42.220
a very brief dialogue.

52:42.220 --> 52:45.220
Sara has a microphone over there.

52:45.220 --> 52:47.220
Thank you, Sara.

52:47.220 --> 52:51.220
Just raise your hand if you want.

52:51.220 --> 52:53.220
It's a little bit difficult,

52:53.220 --> 52:55.220
but just raise your hand

52:55.220 --> 53:01.220
if you want a brief question to David.

53:07.220 --> 53:09.220
In the first row,

53:09.220 --> 53:12.220
maybe we collect three or four questions

53:12.220 --> 53:14.220
for David, as you wish.

53:14.220 --> 53:16.220
David, thank you very much

53:16.220 --> 53:21.220
for this inspiring presentation.

53:21.220 --> 53:23.220
I'm Erica Kopp

53:23.220 --> 53:25.220
from Budapest, Hungary.

53:25.220 --> 53:27.220
And I was really happy

53:27.220 --> 53:29.220
when I heard that you start

53:29.220 --> 53:31.220
with Hannah Arendt's work,

53:31.220 --> 53:33.220
because she is from this region,

53:33.220 --> 53:35.220
from this European region,

53:35.220 --> 53:38.220
and it's very important for us,

53:38.220 --> 53:40.220
her souls.

53:40.220 --> 53:43.220
My question is the following,

53:43.220 --> 53:47.220
because related to your statements

53:47.220 --> 53:49.220
about this knowledge,

53:49.220 --> 53:53.220
in the education of the United States,

53:53.220 --> 53:57.220
we have got a totally different experience.

53:57.220 --> 54:00.220
And I would like to go with my question

54:00.220 --> 54:02.220
from this experience,

54:02.220 --> 54:04.220
to expressing my experience.

54:04.220 --> 54:06.220
And I think most of those,

54:06.220 --> 54:09.220
they are from post-soviet countries here,

54:09.220 --> 54:12.220
they have got a totally different experience,

54:12.220 --> 54:16.220
because as I see all education systems,

54:16.220 --> 54:20.220
although they are at rhetorical level,

54:20.220 --> 54:24.220
this topic that we have to decrease the content

54:24.220 --> 54:27.220
in curriculum and in education,

54:27.220 --> 54:32.220
it didn't happen after these communist times.

54:32.220 --> 54:34.220
It's still there, overloaded.

54:34.220 --> 54:36.220
We have got enough knowledge,

54:36.220 --> 54:38.220
I think, I have to say,

54:38.220 --> 54:40.220
what you mentioned can't,

54:40.220 --> 54:42.220
we learned it in a secondary school,

54:42.220 --> 54:44.220
what you mentioned socrates,

54:44.220 --> 54:46.220
we learned it in a secondary school.

54:46.220 --> 54:48.220
So everything is there,

54:48.220 --> 54:52.220
but still we have got such bad results,

54:52.220 --> 54:56.220
on reading, on mathematics, on everything.

54:56.220 --> 55:00.220
And we feel that for students,

55:00.220 --> 55:04.220
the knowledge that we submit,

55:04.220 --> 55:06.220
this knowledge for students,

55:06.220 --> 55:08.220
they are not relevant for them.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.220
And my question is,

55:10.220 --> 55:13.220
now I arrived to the question,

55:13.220 --> 55:16.220
so what do you think,

55:16.220 --> 55:17.220
how can we deal,

55:17.220 --> 55:19.220
because I agree with you

55:19.220 --> 55:22.220
that this knowledge question is crucial

55:22.220 --> 55:24.220
when we are thinking about education,

55:24.220 --> 55:28.220
how can we deal with this power issue related to,

55:28.220 --> 55:32.220
who choose the knowledge?

55:32.220 --> 55:34.220
Thank you so much, excellent question.

55:34.220 --> 55:40.220
First, I want to start with the most powerful criticism,

55:40.220 --> 55:43.220
which is this question of relevance.

55:43.220 --> 55:46.220
This drives me up the wall,

55:46.220 --> 55:48.220
as it won't surprise you to hear.

55:48.220 --> 55:52.220
If children were only interested in what was relevant,

55:52.220 --> 55:54.220
they would never read Harry Potter,

55:54.220 --> 55:57.220
they would never read the Lord of the Rings.

55:57.220 --> 55:59.220
Children love to escape,

55:59.220 --> 56:02.220
they love to be in imagined worlds.

56:02.220 --> 56:05.220
We in America seem to believe

56:05.220 --> 56:07.220
that education should be a mirror,

56:07.220 --> 56:09.220
that we should only see ourselves,

56:09.220 --> 56:11.220
whoever we happen to be.

56:11.220 --> 56:14.220
But that's to be imprisoned in the self.

56:14.220 --> 56:18.220
It is the irrelevant that takes us out of ourselves.

56:18.220 --> 56:21.220
That is what, the great books

56:21.220 --> 56:23.220
sounds very conservative,

56:23.220 --> 56:25.220
but the great books are the great books

56:25.220 --> 56:27.220
because they were disturbing,

56:27.220 --> 56:29.220
because they pushed you.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.220
Remember, a meal was burnt,

56:31.220 --> 56:33.220
Rousseau's a meal was burnt.

56:33.220 --> 56:35.220
Socrates was put to death,

56:35.220 --> 56:37.220
Nietzsche was regarded as insane

56:37.220 --> 56:40.220
before he even went insane.

56:40.220 --> 56:43.220
These great books take us out of ourselves.

56:43.220 --> 56:44.220
That's the point.

56:44.220 --> 56:47.220
Second, on the exam results,

56:47.220 --> 56:51.220
it is true that we have to teach children to read.

56:51.220 --> 56:53.220
This cannot be an accident.

56:53.220 --> 56:57.220
Finally, the one place America has made progress,

56:57.220 --> 56:58.220
the one place,

56:58.220 --> 57:01.220
is that we now take seriously teaching phonics,

57:01.220 --> 57:03.220
phonemic awareness, right?

57:03.220 --> 57:05.220
The mechanics of reading.

57:05.220 --> 57:07.220
The problem is,

57:07.220 --> 57:10.220
we often do it with meaningless texts, right?

57:10.220 --> 57:12.220
Texts about nothing.

57:12.220 --> 57:15.220
So we sacrifice the opportunity to learn content

57:15.220 --> 57:17.220
while we're teaching reading.

57:17.220 --> 57:21.220
But we've managed to fragment that knowledge base,

57:21.220 --> 57:24.220
so they learn the mechanics of reading,

57:24.220 --> 57:28.220
but by the time they are 12, 13 years old,

57:28.220 --> 57:31.220
their reading results begin to decline,

57:31.220 --> 57:33.220
because the knowledge isn't there.

57:33.220 --> 57:37.220
In mathematics, there's a huge war going on.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.220
How to teach math?

57:39.220 --> 57:42.220
The Chinese have one way, which seems to work.

57:42.220 --> 57:44.220
It's a dispute.

57:44.220 --> 57:47.220
Japanese start by being quite constructivist,

57:47.220 --> 57:50.220
but then very old-fashioned in the high school.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.220
It's a complicated story.

57:52.220 --> 57:55.220
So I would say, on your question,

57:55.220 --> 57:58.220
there are technical answers to how to teach

57:58.220 --> 58:00.220
the basic fundamental skill,

58:00.220 --> 58:04.220
but they do not undermine the greater argument for content.

58:04.220 --> 58:10.220
And by the way, in Russia and Hungary before the revolution,

58:10.220 --> 58:13.220
math education was very strong, right?

58:13.220 --> 58:16.220
Russia did, compared to America,

58:16.220 --> 58:18.220
the results were much better.

58:18.220 --> 58:20.220
So nothing is perfect,

58:20.220 --> 58:24.220
but it was, you know, the United States would be envious

58:24.220 --> 58:27.220
of Soviet Russian mathematics.

58:27.220 --> 58:30.220
Other questions, please.

58:30.220 --> 58:32.220
Don't be shy.

58:35.220 --> 58:37.220
Yes, there's a question over there.

58:47.220 --> 58:48.220
Good morning.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.220
Good morning.

58:49.220 --> 58:51.220
Thank you for your talk.

58:51.220 --> 58:52.220
My name is Marian.

58:52.220 --> 58:53.220
I'm from the Philippines,

58:53.220 --> 58:55.220
but I'm now doing my PhD in Italy,

58:55.220 --> 58:57.220
and I'd like to ask about,

58:57.220 --> 58:59.220
I grew up learning the canon,

58:59.220 --> 59:01.220
primarily in American educational systems,

59:01.220 --> 59:04.220
so we grew up very Anglo-American.

59:04.220 --> 59:06.220
How do you reconcile this?

59:06.220 --> 59:10.220
And I do agree that learning canon, learning Dante, Shakespeare

59:10.220 --> 59:13.220
is very important in developing the sensibility,

59:13.220 --> 59:15.220
this idea of ethics and aesthetics,

59:15.220 --> 59:19.220
but how do we also reconcile this colonial legacy

59:19.220 --> 59:24.220
and, you know, we do not replicate colonial forms of imperialism

59:24.220 --> 59:26.220
or cognitive imperialism?

59:26.220 --> 59:27.220
Yeah.

59:27.220 --> 59:32.220
In my view, if a text is a slave to its context,

59:32.220 --> 59:35.220
it's not worth reading, right?

59:35.220 --> 59:40.220
The reason Nelson Mandela chose Sophocles is not, of course,

59:40.220 --> 59:43.220
because Sophocles was dead or white or male.

59:43.220 --> 59:47.220
He chose Sophocles because he could have chosen anything.

59:47.220 --> 59:48.220
He was in prison,

59:48.220 --> 59:51.220
he was facing what he thought would be a lifetime in prison,

59:51.220 --> 59:53.220
and the question was,

59:53.220 --> 59:55.220
what would be the play that he would put on

59:55.220 --> 59:59.220
with his fellow inmates, right, in the jail in South Africa?

59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.220
He could have chosen a story by South African,

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:07.220
African-American, he could have chosen anything.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.220
He chose Sophocles because he found in that text

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:18.220
more difficult, powerful, truthful, disturbing,

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.220
thinking about what mattered, right,

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:26.220
about power, families, despotism, nations,

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.220
religious faith, courage.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:34.220
So I believe that there are great texts from many, many places,

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.220
many traditions, many languages.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.220
It is a great shame in the United States

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.220
that we almost never read things in translation, right?

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.220
If it's not in English, oh my God, right?

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:52.220
As if most of the world's literature doesn't exist.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:58.220
So I think the test of reading a text is,

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.220
is it overwhelmed by its political context?

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:07.220
Is it a work of imperialism first and last?

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.220
Then why read it, right?

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.220
If it is a work worth reading,

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.220
it is innerly liberating for all humanity

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.220
because it asks universal questions.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.220
That's my point about Kennedy, right?

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:25.220
If you do not think that there are books, poems, art, music

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.220
that speak to all of us, all of us,

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.220
then you have given up on the humanities.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.220
You've given up on the idea of humanitas,

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:40.220
of the idea that we are all finally more in common

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.220
than we are different.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.220
The American metaphor used to be the melting pot, right?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220
We would all become American.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.220
Today it's called the salad bowl.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.220
This is a Californian idiocy, right?

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220
Because if you think about it,

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220
the idea of the salad bowl is somehow

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.220
that you both are yourself and not yourself.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.220
It makes no sense, in fact, in educational terms.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.220
So I think the best answer to your question

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:18.220
is simply, are you educated by reading this text?

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:22.220
Or is it simply an affirmation of an ideology,

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.220
of a political point of view, of a piece of race,

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.220
in which case, no, it does not pass,

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.220
and it should not be read in school?

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.220
Other questions?

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:40.220
Question, one more, thank you.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.220
Good morning.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.220
Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.220
Thank you for you.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.220
I have found it a little difficult to...

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:53.220
No, good morning again.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.220
My name is Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.220
Thank you for your great speech.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:04.220
Very wonderful, fantastic.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:08.220
I have a question.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:14.220
One of the most sentences that I took with myself

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.220
is education is not about flattering different cultures.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.220
And I agree.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.220
This means that we need to have some values

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:28.220
that we have to keep strong in our education.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.220
And as a teacher, we have to specify

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.220
what these values are.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.220
In the gate of the schools, we have everyday different groups

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.220
with different values that knock at our doors

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:49.220
and ask to introduce in the curriculum their values.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.220
And I found it very difficult to resist,

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.220
especially if the education has not enough money,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.220
is not enough strong to make those resistance.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.220
So, any comments or suggestions?

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.220
First of all, not all values are valuable.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.220
Not all values are valuable.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.220
Just because I think well of myself

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.220
does not mean that I should be flattered.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.220
Just because I am Jewish does not...

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.220
I am Jewish does not mean that I should only read Jewish texts,

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.220
or texts written by Jewish authors.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:31.220
I would be very angry if a teacher said to me,

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:36.220
I am not only going to read texts about Jewish identity.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:40.220
This would seem to me to be a fundamental betrayal.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:44.220
The director of schools in the city I live in

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.220
is African American, Sonja Sontalisis.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:52.220
And she said to me, the challenge of education

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:57.220
is that it must be both mirrors and windows.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:02.220
I remember, yes, of the identity of African American children

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:08.220
in Baltimore, because in the case of those African Americans

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.220
in Baltimore, there has been a history of racism and suffering,

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.220
which they are entitled to learn about.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.220
This has impacted their lives.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:24.220
But her important point is, if you stop there, it's hopeless.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.220
Then you simply reproduce the image of suffering.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.220
On the contrary, they must be introduced to the world,

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.220
to the horizon beyond Baltimore,

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.220
to the texts that come from far away places

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:40.220
and distant worlds and different imaginations.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.220
So we have to be very careful

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:47.220
of the narcissism of individual differences.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:52.220
Very careful about the idea that because all of us look different

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.220
and we come from different places,

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.220
that the education has to be about each one differently.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.220
No, we have differences.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.220
We live with our families, with our friends.

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.220
We can live those differences.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.220
But education, if you believe in the humanities,

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.220
is about what it means to be human.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:17.220
And that education is for everybody, or it is nothing at all.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220
Thank you.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.220
Thank you.
