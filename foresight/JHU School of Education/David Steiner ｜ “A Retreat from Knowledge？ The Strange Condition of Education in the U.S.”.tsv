113220	132220	Thank you so much, Francesca, and Nicole, University of Bergamo, for your warm hospitality and good morning to you all.
132720	140220	In her essay The Crisis in Education, Hannah Arendt asks the most important possible question,
140220	147220	is education any longer possible? And her answer, essentially, is no.
147220	155220	The problem she writes of education in the modern world lies in the fact that by its very nature we cannot forego,
155220	165220	cannot be without either authority or tradition, and yet we must proceed in a world that is neither structured by authority,
165220	175220	nor held together by tradition. Why are authority and tradition so important to the act of educating?
175220	184220	Arendt argues that child-centered or progressivist models of education devalu authority in ways that undermine
184220	192220	the very possibility of education. All the rules of sound human reasoning, she writes, are cast aside.
192220	202220	Her criticism of progressivism has three parts. First, child-centered education in trust's authority in education
202220	208220	to those who by nature cannot exercise it, namely children.
208220	217220	She stresses the helplessness of every child that instinctively seeks authority to guide her or him into the world
217220	226220	in which he or she is still a stranger, in which she cannot orient herself by her own judgment.
226220	236220	Second, we adults in choosing to give power to children to shape their own education have devalued our own knowledge.
236220	247220	If teachers abandon the teaching of their knowledge, then teachers remove, they sacrifice the one source of authority that should be theirs.
247220	257220	Finally, constructivism rests on the belief that a child can only understand what they have, quote, discovered by themselves, close quote.
257220	266220	But that's not true. It's simply not true. Think about learning to read. It's not a natural process. It must be taught.
266220	278220	But Arendt says the incorrect belief that children can only learn by self-discovery leads to a substitution of doing for learning,
278220	285220	a damaging replacement, she writes, of thoughtful work by labor without direction.
285220	294220	Our progressivist impulse to make sacred, to make autonomous, the world of the child is, in Hannah Arendt's view,
294220	298220	a symptom of something more serious, more fundamental.
298220	310220	Adults give up authority because we refuse, she writes, to assume responsibility for the world into which we have brought our children.
311220	316220	What does Arendt mean by giving up responsibility for our world?
316220	322220	And why does she believe that doing so destroys our capacity to educate children?
322220	331220	Her answer, to simplify if I may, is that when we educate, we must take responsibility for which stories,
331220	339220	which information, which picture about our world we are going to pass on to our children.
339220	346220	But today, Arendt argues, we are estranged, alienated from our own histories.
346220	355220	There is no coherent narrative, no shared set of stories about our world, of which we are willing to say this story,
355220	360220	these stories are worthy of teaching to our children.
360220	368220	We live in a culture, Arendt argues, in which there is a crisis in our attitude towards the realm of the past.
368220	375220	We are no longer prepared to introduce children into the unfolding stories of which they are a part,
375220	382220	and in the context of which children can, one day, remake their world.
382220	390220	Without a shared, valued narrative about the world, children will remain ignorant of how to act.
391220	401220	They will be like bats without a cave, they will have no way in which to find and then judge the limits of their world.
401220	409220	Arendt insists, quote, that exactly for the sake of what is new and revolutionary in every child,
409220	419220	education must be conservative, it must preserve the newness and introduce the world as a new thing to the child.
420220	427220	Paradoxically, Arendt reminds us, that in its most creative, revolutionary period,
427220	431220	American education was most conservative.
431220	438220	Today, she writes, educational experiments have struck a very revolutionary pose,
438220	445220	but that pose, she says, will leave children without the ability to act radically.
446220	453220	Today, an insistence on selecting and teaching a particular cultural content to our children
453220	458220	is under deep suspicion, especially from the political left.
458220	467220	Thus, Arendt's argument that choosing a particular content, a curriculum for our children's education,
467220	474220	her argument that doing so is not conservative, requires support.
474720	482220	To juz America as our example, I would remind us that the most important figures of protest
482220	489220	in the struggle for civil rights, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X,
489220	498220	each affirmed the centrality of classical learning in their resistance, in their voice of resistance.
498220	503220	You may remember that Malcolm X dropped out of school when he was 13,
503220	512220	but when imprisoned for robbery, he taught himself to read Tolstoy, Dostoevski, and Nietzsche, among many others.
512220	518220	To the American list, I would add one more powerful example, that of Nelson Mandela.
518220	522220	When he was imprisoned in South Africa in Robin Island,
522220	529220	he chose to play both the role of Creon and Antigone in Sophocles' play of that name.
529220	534220	He recalled later that he found the experience of studying that play,
534220	541220	and indeed classical literature more generally as, quote, enormously elevating, close quote.
541220	550220	Sophocles, he said, had much to teach him about power, despotism, politics, courage, and faith.
551220	560220	To repeat her central claim, the authority of the teacher then rests on the assumption of responsibility for our world.
560220	568220	Our intellectual irresponsibility when it comes to education lies in our unwillingness to select
568220	572220	to be responsible for content worth teaching.
573220	583220	We betray ourselves as parents and educators in pretending that children can be made the authors of their world.
583220	589220	In what our rent bluntly calls our disgust for our world, we wash our hands of our authority,
589220	595220	our responsibility, and our love both for our children and for our world.
596220	601220	Our rent ties the surrender of the core responsibility of the teacher,
601220	606220	our unwillingness to be responsible for choosing the content of education,
606220	612220	to our unwillingness to judge what is of value in human experience.
612220	619220	I now want to stress that the unwillingness to say this content is worth teaching
619220	623220	is not a theoretical issue alone.
623220	631220	In the United States, at least, the flight from responsibility is powerfully and destructively evident
631220	636220	in our preference for skills over curricular content.
636220	646220	We do not have in our nation as a whole or in any one of our 50 states a single shared curriculum in any subject.
646220	653220	No defined content in literature, or history, or science, or even mathematics.
653220	660220	Because there is no set curriculum, because we do not require students to read a list of books,
660220	670220	our state tests, our state tests of reading, for example, cannot test knowledge of any specific text.
670220	676220	We cannot ask questions about Moby Dick, or the Great Gatsby, or the Bluest Eye, for example.
676220	685220	Instead, our tests present students with a paragraph or two from a very obscure source
685220	690220	that no student has ever read before, so no student has an advantage.
690220	697220	We then ask students to, quote, find the main idea in the paragraph.
697220	703220	Of course, this ability depends on understanding what the text is about.
703220	711220	And it turns out that wealthy or richer students do much better in finding the main idea
711220	715220	because they have more knowledge about the world.
715220	722220	So the reading test in America becomes a test of family wealth.
722220	729220	We can predict quite well a student's results on a test if we know their parents' wealth.
729220	736220	Because poor students do badly, we try to train them on finding the main idea
736220	744220	instead of teaching them content, and as a result, every year they do worse and worse.
744220	749220	You know, a shift over the last hundred years from content to skill,
749220	752220	America is following, unfortunately.
752220	757220	The example said in France when it passed the loge au span,
757220	765220	when it abandoned gave up the national curriculum for a shift to child-centered progressive pedagogy.
765220	771220	Here is what happened to the performance of children in reading in France.
772220	778220	These lines represent the reading skills of children from different economic groups,
778220	782220	the wealthiest children at the top, the poorest children at the bottom,
782220	790220	from the time the law was passed in 1987 to 20 years later in 2007.
790220	795220	What you can see is that the shift to child-centered education
795220	799220	damaged the reading of every group of students,
799220	805220	but what is most tragic is that it damaged the reading of poorer students the most.
805220	808220	That is the bottom line.
808220	814220	Sadly, it has become fashionable to follow Jo Span's example.
814220	819220	For example, Finland, where excellent educational achievements were built
819220	825220	on a strong content-rich national curriculum, this was given up.
825220	829220	As a result, just like in France, there has in the last few years
829220	833220	been a steady decline in educational results.
833220	839220	England went through the same thing before it went back to a content-rich curriculum.
839220	842220	The United States has done the same thing,
842220	846220	but in the United States we have gone further.
846220	851220	Not only have we embraced empty skills instead of content,
851220	855220	we have in the last ten years become enchanted with the idea
855220	861220	that even teaching academic skills may be very old-fashioned.
861220	869220	Instead, an ever-increasing number of teachers supported by a very thin research base
869220	873220	have been embracing a very different agenda.
873220	878220	The following slide summarizes the new pedagogy in America.
881220	888220	I'll give you a moment to look at these wonderful examples.
888220	894220	As I lay out in my recent book, there is very little serious research
894220	897220	to support any of these ideas.
897220	903220	To take one example, it should be obvious, but apparently it is not,
903220	908220	that one cannot think critically about nothing in particular.
908220	913220	We need to have some knowledge to think critically about,
913220	916220	or take the 21st century skills.
916220	920220	It sounds very relevant, very sexy.
920220	925220	Well, it turns out that 21st century skills are a long, long list
925220	929220	of everything that you want in a human being.
929220	934220	Reliability, capacity to motivate, capacity to work in teams,
934220	938220	information literacy, communication skills, cross-cultural sensitivity,
938220	942220	flexibility, accountability, maybe clean socks.
942220	945220	It is an endless list.
945220	950220	The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars,
950220	954220	hundreds of millions of dollars, in the collective search
954220	961220	to do something, anything other than teach core academic content.
961220	965220	But the impact has been deeply negative.
965220	971220	After some real progress in the 1980s and the 1990s,
971220	976220	progress especially for the poorest students has stopped.
976220	981220	Here are the math results for our high school students.
981220	988220	As you can see, the United States has made exactly zero progress
988220	992220	since 1992, zero.
992220	996220	This is despite the fact that we have spent more dollars
996220	1002220	in real dollars after inflation, far more than we did in 1992.
1002220	1006220	But the situation, while it's bad in mathematics,
1006220	1013220	is much worse when it comes to students' knowledge of history and civics.
1013220	1017220	In this, as you see on the slide, in 2018,
1017220	1024220	just 25% of 13-year-olds in America passed the civics test.
1024220	1030220	This is the lowest result in the United States of any subject matter test.
1030220	1034220	It's worse than reading, worse than math, worse than science.
1034220	1040220	In other words, the result is bad across the country.
1040220	1044220	The result is bad across the board.
1044220	1050220	But for African-American and Hispanic students, it's a disaster.
1050220	1055220	The pass rate is 10% and 13% for those two groups.
1055220	1060220	Now, this is, again, not just a theoretical problem.
1060220	1063220	As you can see in the second paragraph,
1063220	1067220	the Center for Civic Education found in a major survey
1067220	1071220	that just 30% of Americans born since 1980s,
1071220	1076220	so the younger generation, believe it's essential to live in a democracy.
1076220	1079220	I just want that to sink in for a moment.
1079220	1086220	So 70% of our younger Americans do not think it's particularly important
1086220	1089220	to live in a democracy.
1089220	1094220	We may see the results in the next presidential election.
1094220	1098220	One might think that confronted by these results,
1098220	1105220	there would be widespread distress over our educational outcomes in the United States.
1105220	1111220	After all, in math and science, America's international results are very embarrassing.
1111220	1118220	We do worse, for example, in mathematics than Vietnam, a country we left in ruins.
1118220	1124220	But instead, America has discovered a deeply and deeply sophisticated way
1124220	1127220	to handle bad news.
1127220	1131220	It simply reports bad news as good news.
1131220	1133220	What do I mean?
1133220	1137220	Remember that the exam results of American high school students
1137220	1141220	has been flat since 1990 or so.
1142220	1146220	Now, if you have flat results,
1146220	1150220	you would assume that the grades we give to American students,
1150220	1154220	A, B, C, D, would be flat, right?
1154220	1156220	Flat results, flat grades.
1156220	1158220	Oh, no.
1158220	1162220	No, in America, while the results have been flat,
1162220	1166220	we have given ever higher grades to our American students.
1166220	1169220	That's those lines going upwards.
1169220	1172220	There's a very strange thing, if you think about it.
1172220	1177220	Why should we give higher and higher grades to the same result?
1177220	1180220	Not only have we done this in high school,
1180220	1183220	we've also done it in university.
1183220	1187220	We have grade inflation in the United States.
1187220	1191220	What does grade inflation actually mean?
1191220	1197220	Grade inflation means simply that we call today success
1197220	1201220	what 20 years ago we called failure.
1201220	1205220	We have gone up a complete grade in the United States.
1205220	1208220	It's a fiction. It's a complete myth.
1208220	1210220	It's a mythology.
1210220	1213220	It's as if we can't take bad news,
1213220	1216220	so we simply call it good.
1216220	1218220	It's beyond embarrassing.
1218220	1221220	It's a lie that damages children
1221220	1224220	because much later in life they find out
1224220	1229220	that they don't have the knowledge they need.
1229220	1232220	To summarize our argument so far,
1232220	1236220	America's decision to embrace skills over content
1236220	1239220	has damaged student learning.
1239220	1242220	Sympathetic to our rent's argument,
1242220	1246220	I have been for some time a critic of this flight,
1246220	1248220	this retreat from content,
1248220	1251220	this refusal to make judgments about
1251220	1253220	what is worth learning.
1253220	1257220	But where does this flight from educational responsibility,
1257220	1262220	this unwillingness to make judgments about content come from?
1264220	1268220	Our rent locates this inability to judge,
1268220	1271220	this refusal to act in judgment,
1271220	1275220	in thinking itself, in the retreat from thinking.
1275220	1279220	She writes, the precondition for judgment
1279220	1282220	is the disposition, the habit,
1282220	1288220	to live explicitly or consciously with oneself,
1288220	1291220	to have dialogue with oneself,
1291220	1295220	to be engaged in that silent dialogue
1295220	1297220	between me and myself,
1297220	1298220	which she says,
1298220	1303220	since Socrates and Plato we call thinking.
1303220	1306220	To illustrate this silent dialogue
1306220	1309220	when Socrates says his deepest fear is,
1309220	1310220	quote,
1310220	1315220	that I, being one, should be out of tune with myself
1315220	1318220	and contradict myself.
1318220	1319220	Close quote.
1319220	1321220	The meaning is clear.
1321220	1323220	Even though I am one person,
1323220	1326220	I am not simply one person.
1326220	1330220	I have a self and I am related to myself.
1330220	1333220	I am not simply one person.
1333220	1336220	I am self and I am related to myself.
1336220	1338220	This self is not an illusion.
1338220	1341220	It makes itself heard by talking.
1341220	1343220	I talk to myself.
1343220	1345220	That is what thinking is.
1345220	1348220	If I do wrong,
1348220	1351220	this is Arendt and Plato,
1351220	1355220	the key point is not that somebody else will find me guilty,
1355220	1358220	that somebody else will scold me.
1358220	1362220	The point is I have to live with that wrongdoer.
1362220	1364220	I have to be in this,
1364220	1367220	and this is Arendt's phrase, unbearable intimacy.
1367220	1371220	I can never get rid of myself.
1371220	1376220	Invited by thought into a lifelong dialogue with myself,
1376220	1379220	thinking is done in solitude.
1379220	1381220	This is not loneliness.
1381220	1383220	This is solitude.
1383220	1386220	It is the responsibility of the educator to judge
1386220	1389220	which content to teach a child
1389220	1393220	so that the child's developing internal dialogue
1393220	1398220	of self with self is not empty, random,
1398220	1400220	or filled with noise,
1400220	1403220	but is supplied with what is worth.
1403220	1406220	Worth something, the content of thought.
1406220	1409220	But please note too that we have slipped
1409220	1413220	almost without noticing into the realm of ethics.
1413220	1416220	If the content of my thought is unworthy,
1416220	1421220	if it is trash, my habits of thought are thus debased.
1421220	1426220	I am condemned to be in that unbearable intimacy
1426220	1430220	with my own emptiness, my own worthlessness.
1430220	1434220	Once again, the United States offers us a vivid
1434220	1436220	and disturbing model.
1436220	1440220	The average teenager in the United States today
1440220	1445220	is on social media for almost eight hours every day.
1445220	1448220	That's the most recent data.
1448220	1451220	That's longer than they are in a school setting.
1451220	1454220	It means they're coming home and they're right on the machine
1454220	1456220	and they stay on the machine.
1456220	1460220	While school is focused in America on offering
1460220	1463220	often content-empty skills,
1463220	1467220	it is social media that supplies the content of thought
1467220	1469220	unsupervised by adults.
1469220	1472220	There are no boundaries for the content
1472220	1476220	that floods the smartphone or the computer.
1476220	1480220	Once upon a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in the Emile
1480220	1483220	that children needed to experience limits,
1483220	1486220	he called them walls of bronze, close quote,
1486220	1489220	today those walls have collapsed
1489220	1492220	and the child is flooded by the chaos,
1492220	1496220	the cacophony, the noise of the world.
1496220	1501220	The internal space, the dialogue of the child with herself,
1501220	1505220	collapses under this avalanč.
1505220	1509220	The result, unsurprisingly,
1509220	1512220	is the rapid growth in the United States
1512220	1514220	of childhood depression
1514220	1519220	and an increasing unwillingness made worse by COVID
1519220	1522220	to attend school at all.
1522220	1525220	Today in Baltimore, where I live,
1525220	1530220	some 65% of high school students
1530220	1533220	are chronically absent from school,
1533220	1538220	meaning they miss more than 10% of school days.
1538220	1542220	Competing with the content of the internet,
1542220	1548220	the skills-based education cannot compete.
1548220	1553220	It is too boring, too fragmented, too empty.
1553220	1557220	It does not create ideas that are worth holding in mind.
1558220	1561220	Above all, with some exceptions,
1561220	1563220	especially if students are lucky enough
1563220	1565220	to have strong science teachers,
1565220	1570220	it does not provide material for serious thinking.
1570220	1575220	Other animals reproduce, hunt, build homes,
1575220	1579220	communicate, remember, experience emotions as we do,
1579220	1583220	but human beings alone can evaluate in language
1583220	1586220	our own actions and those of others,
1586220	1589220	appreciate beauty, acquire facilities
1589220	1591220	in different fields of knowledge,
1591220	1594220	be they literate, mathematical, historical,
1594220	1597220	scientific, or those expressed in musical
1597220	1600220	or other artistic or physical forms.
1600220	1603220	Only human beings can think reflectively
1603220	1607220	about the direction, the unfolding trajectory
1607220	1611220	of our lives without a well-developed capacity
1611220	1617220	in which thoughtfulness life becomes a matter of chance.
1617220	1620220	A life lived at the mercy of instinct,
1620220	1625220	of unfiltered emotion is the life of a human puppet
1625220	1629220	directed by forces of chance and circumstance
1629220	1632220	in his work Plato famously compares
1632220	1634220	such human beings to puppets,
1634220	1637220	whose strings are pulled by the gods.
1637220	1640220	The most fundamental purpose of education
1640220	1644220	is thus to nurture our capacity to think.
1644220	1646220	Education is the means by which
1646220	1650220	our most human capabilities are transformed
1650220	1653220	from just potential to a life in which
1653220	1656220	we can interrogate our experience
1656220	1659220	so as to learn and integrate our experience
1659220	1661220	into future action.
1661220	1664220	Michael Oakshot, philosopher and political theorist
1664220	1667220	put it this way, I quote,
1667220	1670220	the price of the intelligent activity
1670220	1674220	which constitutes being human is learning.
1674220	1678220	When the human condition is said to be burdensome, heavy,
1678220	1681220	what is being pointed out is not the mere necessity
1681220	1685220	of having to think, to speak, and to act
1685220	1688220	instead of merely being like a stone
1688220	1690220	or growing like a tree,
1690220	1693220	but the impossibility of thinking or feeling
1693220	1697220	without having slowly and often painfully
1697220	1701220	learned to think something.
1701220	1704220	While the need for a good education
1704220	1707220	can be defended for many reasons,
1707220	1710220	including both economic and civic,
1710220	1713220	our most essential responsibility as educators
1713220	1716220	involves the guiding, the careful nurturing
1716220	1720220	of children's learning to think.
1720220	1723220	The argument of my recent book is that there are
1723220	1726220	three crucial elements in the education of thought.
1726220	1730220	Learning academic content, we've talked about this
1730220	1733220	in literature, history, math and science at least,
1733220	1737220	and education in ethics and in education in aesthetics.
1737220	1740220	Our schools need to nurture the capacity
1740220	1743220	for academic learning, ethical reflection
1743220	1746220	and aesthetic sensibility because they are crucial
1746220	1749220	to forging a fulfilling life.
1749220	1753220	I can only sketch that argument today.
1753220	1757220	We've already discussed our refusal to take responsibility
1757220	1760220	for the rich content of education,
1760220	1763220	the core of academic learning.
1763220	1766220	We now briefly will consider ethics
1766220	1770220	and then turn to aesthetics.
1770220	1774220	The founding American hope now exported to the world
1774220	1778220	is that our lives might enable the pursuit of happiness,
1778220	1780220	what exactly does that mean?
1780220	1784220	Surely not that we do anything at all without thought.
1784220	1788220	24 centuries ago Aristotle coined the term eudaimonio,
1788220	1793220	human flourishing to describe the concept of happiness.
1793220	1796220	Eudaimonio, Aristotle argued, is the highest,
1796220	1798220	the most important of human ends,
1798220	1801220	the purpose of our existence.
1801220	1804220	A well-lived life is one in which the aim of happiness
1804220	1807220	or human flourishing is our north star,
1807220	1812220	guiding our choice, our values, our hopes, our dreams.
1815220	1818220	A well-lived life, an ethical life,
1818220	1822220	Aristotle insists, is about making wise choices.
1822220	1824220	If they are well educated in ethics,
1824220	1827220	human beings will have learned to weigh the consequences
1827220	1830220	of their choices in terms of how the outcomes
1830220	1835220	will affect the pathway, the life of their life story,
1835220	1838220	the values that they will embrace.
1838220	1841220	Aristotle argues that in making choices
1841220	1844220	that will shape the future direction of our life,
1844220	1848220	well-educated humans will seek out opportunities
1848220	1851220	to be involved in actions that are courageous,
1851220	1853220	generous, and aren't honorable.
1853220	1857220	As you know, Aristotle calls the act of choosing
1857220	1860220	or reasoning about one's actions fronasis,
1860220	1864220	usually translated as intellectual virtue
1864220	1867220	of exercising practical wisdom.
1867220	1871220	When we exercise it, we combine the careful consideration
1871220	1874220	of the pathway of our life and a commitment
1874220	1877220	to understanding the virtuous course of actions
1877220	1880220	in reaching our goals.
1880220	1884220	Education worthy of the name is crucial to fronasis
1884220	1887220	because it is through education that children,
1887220	1890220	through repetition that becomes habit,
1890220	1893220	come to enjoy virtuous actions.
1893220	1896220	They will want to forge paths of living
1896220	1900220	in which they can enjoy what a virtuous life can offer.
1900220	1903220	In other words, they will have learned to desire
1903220	1909220	and thus seek to make the opportunities for a good life.
1909220	1911220	Aristotle's key point is this.
1911220	1915220	If adults are one day to successfully deliberate,
1915220	1917220	think about what is good,
1917220	1920220	they must already have come to enjoy doing
1920220	1924220	what is just, courageous, honest as children.
1924220	1927220	In šort, they will have developed a moral compass.
1927220	1929220	In Aristotle's words,
1929220	1933220	a good upbringing makes the noble a part,
1933220	1937220	perhaps the chief part of what is good in us.
1937220	1942220	How do we acquire this enjoyment of ethical choicemaking?
1942220	1944220	First through lived experience.
1944220	1947220	This is why, to cite him once again,
1947220	1950220	in Rousseau's Émile,
1950220	1954220	the tutor of the boy organizes the experience of the child
1954220	1957220	so that Émile experiences the connection
1957220	1961220	between wise actions and their positive consequences.
1961220	1964220	But secondly, ethical choicemaking
1964220	1967220	is developed through more formal education,
1967220	1971220	through stories, myths, history
1971220	1975220	that enable children to inhabit multiple worlds
1975220	1977220	beyond their own horizons,
1977220	1981220	to derive thoughtful lessons from those stories
1981220	1984220	which will serve their own developing capacities
1984220	1987220	for phronasis as they mature.
1987220	1990220	The curriculum we devise for our young children,
1990220	1992220	the tales we tell them,
1992220	1996220	or we read to them before they think for themselves,
1996220	1999220	are not simply devices to enable them
1999220	2001220	to master the mechanics of reading,
2001220	2003220	important though that is.
2003220	2008220	But a key reference point for an education in ethics.
2008220	2010220	Through their capacity to imagine,
2010220	2013220	children place themselves in previously unimagined
2013220	2015220	and unexpected worlds.
2015220	2018220	They associate with characters in the stories they read
2018220	2021220	and they take their experiences to heart.
2021220	2024220	The resulting lessons are ethically crucial.
2024220	2027220	Children in that imaginative space
2027220	2030220	rehearse the consequences of fictional
2030220	2033220	historical characters that they read about,
2033220	2036220	learning about the consequences of decisions
2036220	2038220	made with too little thought
2038220	2042220	or wise choices that lead to well-lived lives.
2042220	2045220	That is what phronasis consists in,
2045220	2048220	a conscious effort to slow down,
2048220	2050220	to rehearse various pathways,
2050220	2053220	to ask tough questions of oneself,
2053220	2057220	to enable the imagination to draw on multiple possibilities,
2058220	2061220	to deepen one's awareness in short,
2061220	2063220	to be thoughtful.
2063220	2065220	Today, particularly in the United States,
2065220	2068220	we've given up on ethical education.
2068220	2071220	We tried something called character education
2071220	2073220	in the 1980s, early 90s,
2073220	2075220	we've let that go,
2075220	2077220	we've simply turned our back
2077220	2080220	on one of the most essential tasks of education
2080220	2084220	to provide an ethical compass.
2084220	2086220	And now aesthetics.
2086220	2091220	A life lived without an educated attunement to the beautiful
2091220	2095220	will be as if the very colors of one's life's experiences
2095220	2097220	are washed out.
2097220	2101220	Children deserve opportunities to nourish their imagination,
2101220	2105220	to respond to the beautiful in the outside world
2105220	2108220	or a museum, playing a musical instrument,
2108220	2111220	crafting a sculpture, mastering a dance
2111220	2113220	or perspective in painting.
2113220	2116220	To have to argue for an education in aesthetics
2116220	2118220	is surprising,
2118220	2122220	given its fundamental value to human sensibility.
2122220	2124220	But it is also vital,
2124220	2127220	since today it has so little standing
2127220	2129220	in so many of our schools,
2129220	2131220	at least in the United States.
2131220	2134220	We have in America created
2134220	2137220	a class system of subjects.
2137220	2140220	Math and reading somehow is first class.
2140220	2143220	Science and history, second class.
2143220	2146220	We sometimes test them, we sometimes don't.
2146220	2148220	Everything else is third class.
2148220	2151220	Everything from philosophy to arts
2151220	2154220	to physical education to computer,
2154220	2156220	it's all third class.
2158220	2162220	Immanuel Kant is compelling on the topic of aesthetics.
2162220	2165220	In making aesthetic judgments,
2165220	2167220	Kant as Kant sees it,
2167220	2169220	we are in the realm of free choice.
2169220	2172220	We cannot appeal to some scientific principle
2172220	2175220	or proof that something is worthy
2175220	2177220	of being called beautiful.
2177220	2179220	We are just on our own
2179220	2181220	with our experiences to rely on.
2181220	2183220	This is because, he says,
2183220	2185220	when we make aesthetic judgments
2185220	2187220	that this painting is beautiful,
2187220	2189220	nothing is given.
2189220	2191220	Thinking doesn't determine in advance
2191220	2193220	our own experience.
2193220	2196220	We are free to act, to react to the painting
2196220	2198220	as we please.
2198220	2201220	But that produces a major problem.
2201220	2203220	Our aesthetic judgments
2203220	2205220	just a matter of private opinion,
2205220	2207220	like, I like chocolate ice cream,
2207220	2208220	you like vanilla.
2208220	2210220	Kant rejects this view.
2210220	2213220	He claims that when we make aesthetic judgments
2213220	2216220	we are doing something very, very different.
2216220	2220220	We are responding to something deep in human nature.
2220220	2223220	And that response is so strong
2223220	2226220	that we find we want to share our response
2226220	2228220	with other people, with each other.
2228220	2230220	When I say this is beautiful,
2230220	2233220	I make a claim not just for myself,
2233220	2236220	but for all humanity.
2236220	2238220	As we encounter the objects,
2238220	2240220	our thoughts about it come together
2240220	2243220	in a positive and powerful urge
2243220	2245220	to share with others.
2245220	2247220	We are convinced that they, too,
2247220	2249220	should be struck by the quality
2249220	2251220	of what has been created.
2251220	2254220	Don't you see, don't you hear
2254220	2257220	how beautiful this is?
2257220	2259220	What occurs inside our mind
2259220	2261220	when we are moved by the beauty of an object,
2261220	2264220	when it evokes this powerful urge
2264220	2267220	to celebrate, retain, and communicate
2267220	2269220	our experience?
2269220	2272220	Kant suggests that at that moment
2272220	2275220	both our facilities of imagination
2275220	2278220	and understanding are equally active.
2278220	2281220	If an object creates an experience
2281220	2284220	of what Kant calls the harmony
2284220	2286220	of understanding and imagination,
2286220	2289220	we feel that unity as a deep pleasure
2289220	2292220	and experience of beauty.
2292220	2295220	A vast literature suggests
2295220	2298220	that in his discussion of how imagination
2298220	2300220	and cognition or thought come together
2300220	2303220	in a moment of appreciation of beauty,
2303220	2306220	these account is not without problems.
2306220	2310220	In fact, in one point in his famous third critique,
2310220	2312220	which is talking about aesthetic judgment,
2312220	2314220	Kant stops and says,
2314220	2316220	I'm not sure I understand what I'm writing,
2316220	2318220	so maybe we too.
2318220	2322220	But as he describes this aesthetic experience,
2322220	2324220	he is also talking about something
2324220	2326220	very familiar to us.
2326220	2328220	A piece of music or art
2328220	2331220	startles us out of indifference,
2331220	2333220	out of complacency.
2333220	2335220	We are drawn to it powerfully.
2335220	2338220	We may make some effort to describe it,
2338220	2340220	but that effort gives way before
2340220	2343220	the just the experience of the painting.
2343220	2347220	We are amazed, delighted, horrified.
2349220	2352220	The British philosopher Peter de Bola
2352220	2356220	describes an example of this aesthetic experience
2356220	2360220	as he stands in front of Bonnet Newman's abstract painting
2360220	2364220	Vier heroico sublimus man heroic and sublime.
2364220	2366220	He writes as follows,
2366220	2369220	the image seems to compose me
2369220	2373220	to generate a sense of well-being.
2373220	2377220	Here de Bola describes both an emotional response
2377220	2380220	and a sense that the painting was offering him
2380220	2382220	new forms of thought.
2382220	2384220	The painting creates the feeling
2384220	2386220	like one is knowing something,
2386220	2391220	a heightened sense of the self being well composed.
2391220	2394220	That is aesthetic knowing feeling
2394220	2398220	which de Bola places between pure emotion
2398220	2400220	and thinking,
2400220	2402220	or in plain English between thinking and thought
2402220	2404220	is very powerful,
2404220	2408220	even if we cannot fully understand or define it.
2408220	2411220	De Bola's experience in front of this painting
2411220	2413220	bears witness to what Kant described
2413220	2416220	as an encounter with the truly beautiful.
2416220	2419220	De Bola invites us to see the painting
2419220	2421220	and share the experience.
2421220	2425220	As he does so, he's recalling something very personal,
2425220	2428220	his reaction to looking at the painting,
2428220	2433220	but his claim is that all of us can have that experience.
2433220	2437220	Compared to the exercise of simply reporting facts
2437220	2439220	about the canvas,
2439220	2442220	an exercise in which my engagement is quite weak,
2442220	2445220	the effort of evoking an aesthetic claim
2445220	2448220	is searching and demanding.
2448220	2452220	It involves translating something very private
2452220	2454220	into a shareable language
2454220	2457220	into what de Bola calls a mutual terrain.
2457220	2462220	The experience of sharing can be a powerful invitation
2462220	2466220	to community, to inclusivity.
2466220	2469220	These aren't just theoretical claims.
2469220	2473220	In 2021, researchers from the United States and Germany
2473220	2477220	examined the reaction of many hundreds of students
2477220	2480220	from the U.S., the U.K. and India
2480220	2482220	while looking at an image
2482220	2484220	or listening to music
2484220	2488220	or recalling a personal experience of beauty.
2488220	2490220	The results of the research
2490220	2493220	closely echo Kant's philosophical model.
2493220	2495220	I quote,
2495220	2497220	top-rated beauty experiences
2497220	2501220	are strongly characterized by intense pleasure,
2501220	2504220	an impression of universality,
2504220	2507220	the wish to continue the experience,
2507220	2510220	exceeding expectation
2510220	2514220	and harmony in the variety and meaning
2514220	2516220	of the experience.
2516220	2518220	As Kant suggests,
2518220	2520220	the language of thought and emotions
2520220	2523220	are not separated but together at once.
2523220	2525220	A child becomes conscious
2525220	2527220	of what is in front of her.
2527220	2530220	Trying to produce the sound on a violin,
2530220	2533220	she struggles knowing it's not there yet.
2533220	2535220	She experiences her own knowing,
2535220	2537220	struggle as frustration
2537220	2539220	but she wants to succeed
2539220	2542220	to communicate the sound to us all.
2542220	2545220	Or to take another example from the visual arts,
2545220	2548220	imagine a student in front of a Rothko painting
2548220	2550220	in a museum.
2550220	2554220	There's no immediate meaning to the painting
2554220	2556220	and the tendency of a student,
2556220	2559220	particularly today, is just to keep walking.
2559220	2562220	The teacher has to stop the student,
2562220	2565220	place the student in front of the painting
2565220	2569220	and enable the process of imagination and thought.
2569220	2572220	Aesthetic education is above all
2572220	2575220	an exhilarating experience of losing the self
2575220	2577220	in an encounter,
2577220	2581220	only to return to an enlarged and deepened self.
2581220	2583220	This sounds theoretical,
2583220	2585220	but it can be seen every day
2585220	2588220	in the 94th aphorism of Nietzsche's
2588220	2590220	Beyond Good and Evil.
2590220	2593220	The seriousness, another translation,
2593220	2597220	is the intensity of a child at play.
2597220	2599220	You've all seen it.
2599220	2601220	The intensity, the energy,
2601220	2604220	the loss and recovery of a self
2604220	2607220	comes from this energy that is fed
2607220	2610220	by engagement with the experience.
2610220	2614220	To offer students a rich set of such aesthetic experiences
2614220	2617220	is a core value of education.
2617220	2619220	Martin Heidegger, German philosopher,
2619220	2621220	emphasizes the interaction
2621220	2625220	between aesthetic judgment and thinking.
2625220	2627220	Writing that our encounters with objects
2627220	2629220	that are beautiful is not merely
2629220	2631220	a matter of feeling,
2631220	2633220	but are, I quote, amongst the most
2633220	2636220	thought-provoking of all encounters.
2636220	2640220	Aesthetic experiences also have ethical dimensions,
2640220	2643220	as the cultural critic Roger Kimball
2643220	2646220	reminds us when we share aesthetic responses
2646220	2648220	with one another,
2648220	2650220	we are reminded powerfully
2650220	2652220	of our common humanity,
2652220	2655220	of our capacity to share freely
2655220	2657220	a sense of beauty
2657220	2659220	that elevates us as human beings.
2659220	2661220	Or, in the words of Dante
2661220	2664220	from the Purgatorio canto 18,
2664220	2668220	beauty awakens the soul to act.
2668220	2671220	Thought, ethics and beauty
2671220	2673220	were so, I would argue,
2673220	2676220	are three intertwined and crucial elements
2676220	2679220	of an education worthy of the name.
2679220	2682220	To give up on making judgments about
2682220	2685220	and then teaching a challenging
2685220	2687220	content-rich curriculum,
2687220	2691220	to leave ethical development to chance,
2691220	2694220	to turn one's back on an education in beauty
2694220	2698220	is to betray what it means to be a teacher.
2698220	2701220	This three-part surrender
2701220	2704220	because knowledge, ethics and aesthetics
2704220	2706220	are intertwined
2706220	2708220	is not a beautiful gift
2708220	2710220	we give to the freedom of our children,
2710220	2713220	it is simply to announce
2713220	2717220	the loss of our role as teachers.
2717220	2720220	In the United States today
2720220	2723220	we have developed a habit
2723220	2727220	of teaching that's very different.
2727220	2729220	And I want to re-enter
2729220	2731220	that we've moved towards our close
2731220	2736220	this contemporary educational politics.
2736220	2739220	We have turned our back on knowledge
2739220	2742220	of the canon, of essential texts
2742220	2745220	and I have argued with Hannah Arendt
2745220	2749220	that this is not in any way a radical move,
2749220	2753220	it is in fact to give up on enabling children
2753220	2756220	to prepare for radical action.
2756220	2758220	Today in the United States
2758220	2760220	the argument is we must focus
2760220	2763220	on teaching multiculturalism.
2763220	2765220	Faced with students from all over the world,
2765220	2769220	from many national ethnic religious
2769220	2771220	and racial origins,
2771220	2775220	our education, and you've heard this a thousand times,
2775220	2777220	must respect their differences,
2777220	2780220	must respect their differences.
2780220	2782220	But a moment's thought should tell us
2782220	2786220	that this has become educationally impossible.
2786220	2788220	We were once told
2788220	2790220	that we are to be very respectful,
2790220	2794220	sensitive to Hispanic culture.
2794220	2796220	Sounded reasonable.
2796220	2800220	22 million Hispanic students.
2800220	2802220	We are now reminded however
2802220	2805220	of the deep differences correctly
2805220	2808220	between Jamaicans and Hispanics
2808220	2811220	or Hispanics and Latinos.
2811220	2814220	We should realize that Cubans and Dominicans
2814220	2818220	cannot be regarded as sharing the same identity.
2818220	2820220	And so the list goes on,
2820220	2823220	more and more differences.
2823220	2825220	With the logical conclusion
2825220	2827220	that perhaps every child should be taught
2827220	2830220	a unique cultural content,
2830220	2833220	the result would be a complete fragmentation
2833220	2835220	of the curriculum.
2835220	2838220	The word humanity should remind us
2839220	2842220	the education of human beings.
2842220	2844220	Some 60 years ago,
2844220	2846220	President Kennedy reminded Americans
2846220	2847220	that, quote,
2847220	2849220	we all breathe the same air,
2849220	2851220	we are all mortal,
2851220	2855220	and we all cherish our children's future, close quote.
2855220	2857220	If we no longer believe
2857220	2859220	that texts can speak to all of us,
2859220	2861220	if I cannot read Dante
2861220	2864220	because I am not Italian and not Christian,
2864220	2867220	if I cannot teach Dante to children
2867220	2870220	because they are African American or Cuban,
2870220	2873220	then I have turned my back on humanity
2873220	2876220	on an education in what is most essential,
2876220	2879220	most beautiful, most instructive
2879220	2882220	to leading a considered life.
2882220	2886220	Education is not about flattering,
2886220	2890220	not about flattering the color of my skin
2890220	2893220	or about celebrating the personality
2893220	2895220	I happen to be
2895220	2898220	or ensuring that my sense of self
2898220	2901220	is never upset or angered.
2901220	2904220	We seem to have discovered a new right
2904220	2906220	in the United States Constitution,
2906220	2908220	a right not to be upset.
2908220	2911220	I don't find it in the document.
2911220	2915220	To educate does not close one's eyes
2915220	2919220	to the sufferings of people or of nations.
2919220	2924220	Evil, too, is woven into the human condition.
2924220	2927220	Education's most essential task, however,
2927220	2930220	is to draw myself out of myself,
2930220	2932220	edukare,
2932220	2935220	to tell me the story of the human condition,
2935220	2938220	enabling me to transcend
2938220	2942220	the self I was as an ignorant child.
2944220	2947220	An argument grounded in the humanities
2947220	2951220	should perhaps come towards a close in poetry.
2951220	2953220	Toto 115,
2953220	2955220	one of the most troubled,
2955220	2957220	most gifted poets of the last century,
2957220	2959220	writing in his 80s
2959220	2962220	and imprisoned for treason,
2962220	2964220	provided four lines
2964220	2968220	that demand the education I've tried today to summon.
2968220	2970220	The academic preparation
2970220	2972220	to hear the core metaphor,
2972220	2975220	to trace in his language
2975220	2978220	the echoes of Homer and Dante,
2978220	2980220	an ethical sensibility
2980220	2984220	to hear the harsh self condemnation of the poet
2984220	2986220	and to forgive his madness,
2986220	2988220	an aesthetic response
2988220	2991220	to hear the beauty of the verse
2991220	2994220	and ultimately to education
2994220	2997220	that still believes in the future of humanities,
2997220	3000220	for which the dying, anguished,
3000220	3004220	sick Ezra Pound still has hope.
3004220	3007220	A blown husk that is finished,
3007220	3010220	but the light sings eternal.
3010220	3013220	A pale flare over marshes
3013220	3015220	where the salt hay whispers
3015220	3018220	to tides change.
3018220	3020220	A blown husk,
3020220	3022220	Ezra himself,
3022220	3024220	that is finished.
3024220	3026220	His life is over,
3026220	3028220	he has betrayed all his own values.
3028220	3030220	But the light sings eternal.
3030220	3033220	The light of the human condition of high culture
3033220	3036220	is still there,
3036220	3038220	is still singing.
3038220	3040220	It's a pale flare.
3040220	3043220	It is a delicate fragile light
3043220	3045220	over the marshes
3045220	3048220	where the salt hay whispers to tides change.
3048220	3050220	The edge of the ocean
3050220	3052220	in his larger part of the canto,
3052220	3055220	Pound is recalling the Odyssey,
3055220	3059220	the return of Odysseus,
3059220	3063220	the tides of the oceans of the world.
3063220	3065220	To introduce,
3065220	3068220	to teach such verse
3068220	3072220	is what is meant by education.
3072220	3074220	And so I say to all of you,
3074220	3076220	to all the educators,
3076220	3078220	to all the teachers here today,
3078220	3082220	you have chosen a great calling.
3082220	3084220	The life prospects,
3084220	3086220	the imaginings,
3086220	3088220	the interior furnishings,
3088220	3091220	the cultural enemy of your student's mind,
3091220	3094220	the cultural enemy of your student's mind,
3094220	3098220	all of this is in your hands.
3098220	3100220	Of course,
3100220	3102220	there will be difficult days,
3102220	3104220	very difficult days,
3104220	3106220	as well as joyful ones.
3106220	3109220	You will need what the great poet
3109220	3111220	Paul Eloard called in French
3111220	3114220	le dur desil de duré,
3114220	3118220	the difficult desire to endure.
3118220	3121220	But each day, every day,
3121220	3124220	remind yourself that on this day
3124220	3127220	your teaching may open a world
3127220	3131220	to a young person, to a child.
3131220	3135220	There is no greater privilege.
3135220	3137220	I thank you.
3148220	3150220	Thank you, David,
3150220	3152220	for such an inspiring speech.
3152220	3154220	We have a few minutes
3154220	3157220	for some brief questions.
3157220	3160220	If someone wants to start
3160220	3162220	a very brief dialogue.
3162220	3165220	Sara has a microphone over there.
3165220	3167220	Thank you, Sara.
3167220	3171220	Just raise your hand if you want.
3171220	3173220	It's a little bit difficult,
3173220	3175220	but just raise your hand
3175220	3181220	if you want a brief question to David.
3187220	3189220	In the first row,
3189220	3192220	maybe we collect three or four questions
3192220	3194220	for David, as you wish.
3194220	3196220	David, thank you very much
3196220	3201220	for this inspiring presentation.
3201220	3203220	I'm Erica Kopp
3203220	3205220	from Budapest, Hungary.
3205220	3207220	And I was really happy
3207220	3209220	when I heard that you start
3209220	3211220	with Hannah Arendt's work,
3211220	3213220	because she is from this region,
3213220	3215220	from this European region,
3215220	3218220	and it's very important for us,
3218220	3220220	her souls.
3220220	3223220	My question is the following,
3223220	3227220	because related to your statements
3227220	3229220	about this knowledge,
3229220	3233220	in the education of the United States,
3233220	3237220	we have got a totally different experience.
3237220	3240220	And I would like to go with my question
3240220	3242220	from this experience,
3242220	3244220	to expressing my experience.
3244220	3246220	And I think most of those,
3246220	3249220	they are from post-soviet countries here,
3249220	3252220	they have got a totally different experience,
3252220	3256220	because as I see all education systems,
3256220	3260220	although they are at rhetorical level,
3260220	3264220	this topic that we have to decrease the content
3264220	3267220	in curriculum and in education,
3267220	3272220	it didn't happen after these communist times.
3272220	3274220	It's still there, overloaded.
3274220	3276220	We have got enough knowledge,
3276220	3278220	I think, I have to say,
3278220	3280220	what you mentioned can't,
3280220	3282220	we learned it in a secondary school,
3282220	3284220	what you mentioned socrates,
3284220	3286220	we learned it in a secondary school.
3286220	3288220	So everything is there,
3288220	3292220	but still we have got such bad results,
3292220	3296220	on reading, on mathematics, on everything.
3296220	3300220	And we feel that for students,
3300220	3304220	the knowledge that we submit,
3304220	3306220	this knowledge for students,
3306220	3308220	they are not relevant for them.
3308220	3310220	And my question is,
3310220	3313220	now I arrived to the question,
3313220	3316220	so what do you think,
3316220	3317220	how can we deal,
3317220	3319220	because I agree with you
3319220	3322220	that this knowledge question is crucial
3322220	3324220	when we are thinking about education,
3324220	3328220	how can we deal with this power issue related to,
3328220	3332220	who choose the knowledge?
3332220	3334220	Thank you so much, excellent question.
3334220	3340220	First, I want to start with the most powerful criticism,
3340220	3343220	which is this question of relevance.
3343220	3346220	This drives me up the wall,
3346220	3348220	as it won't surprise you to hear.
3348220	3352220	If children were only interested in what was relevant,
3352220	3354220	they would never read Harry Potter,
3354220	3357220	they would never read the Lord of the Rings.
3357220	3359220	Children love to escape,
3359220	3362220	they love to be in imagined worlds.
3362220	3365220	We in America seem to believe
3365220	3367220	that education should be a mirror,
3367220	3369220	that we should only see ourselves,
3369220	3371220	whoever we happen to be.
3371220	3374220	But that's to be imprisoned in the self.
3374220	3378220	It is the irrelevant that takes us out of ourselves.
3378220	3381220	That is what, the great books
3381220	3383220	sounds very conservative,
3383220	3385220	but the great books are the great books
3385220	3387220	because they were disturbing,
3387220	3389220	because they pushed you.
3389220	3391220	Remember, a meal was burnt,
3391220	3393220	Rousseau's a meal was burnt.
3393220	3395220	Socrates was put to death,
3395220	3397220	Nietzsche was regarded as insane
3397220	3400220	before he even went insane.
3400220	3403220	These great books take us out of ourselves.
3403220	3404220	That's the point.
3404220	3407220	Second, on the exam results,
3407220	3411220	it is true that we have to teach children to read.
3411220	3413220	This cannot be an accident.
3413220	3417220	Finally, the one place America has made progress,
3417220	3418220	the one place,
3418220	3421220	is that we now take seriously teaching phonics,
3421220	3423220	phonemic awareness, right?
3423220	3425220	The mechanics of reading.
3425220	3427220	The problem is,
3427220	3430220	we often do it with meaningless texts, right?
3430220	3432220	Texts about nothing.
3432220	3435220	So we sacrifice the opportunity to learn content
3435220	3437220	while we're teaching reading.
3437220	3441220	But we've managed to fragment that knowledge base,
3441220	3444220	so they learn the mechanics of reading,
3444220	3448220	but by the time they are 12, 13 years old,
3448220	3451220	their reading results begin to decline,
3451220	3453220	because the knowledge isn't there.
3453220	3457220	In mathematics, there's a huge war going on.
3457220	3459220	How to teach math?
3459220	3462220	The Chinese have one way, which seems to work.
3462220	3464220	It's a dispute.
3464220	3467220	Japanese start by being quite constructivist,
3467220	3470220	but then very old-fashioned in the high school.
3470220	3472220	It's a complicated story.
3472220	3475220	So I would say, on your question,
3475220	3478220	there are technical answers to how to teach
3478220	3480220	the basic fundamental skill,
3480220	3484220	but they do not undermine the greater argument for content.
3484220	3490220	And by the way, in Russia and Hungary before the revolution,
3490220	3493220	math education was very strong, right?
3493220	3496220	Russia did, compared to America,
3496220	3498220	the results were much better.
3498220	3500220	So nothing is perfect,
3500220	3504220	but it was, you know, the United States would be envious
3504220	3507220	of Soviet Russian mathematics.
3507220	3510220	Other questions, please.
3510220	3512220	Don't be shy.
3515220	3517220	Yes, there's a question over there.
3527220	3528220	Good morning.
3528220	3529220	Good morning.
3529220	3531220	Thank you for your talk.
3531220	3532220	My name is Marian.
3532220	3533220	I'm from the Philippines,
3533220	3535220	but I'm now doing my PhD in Italy,
3535220	3537220	and I'd like to ask about,
3537220	3539220	I grew up learning the canon,
3539220	3541220	primarily in American educational systems,
3541220	3544220	so we grew up very Anglo-American.
3544220	3546220	How do you reconcile this?
3546220	3550220	And I do agree that learning canon, learning Dante, Shakespeare
3550220	3553220	is very important in developing the sensibility,
3553220	3555220	this idea of ethics and aesthetics,
3555220	3559220	but how do we also reconcile this colonial legacy
3559220	3564220	and, you know, we do not replicate colonial forms of imperialism
3564220	3566220	or cognitive imperialism?
3566220	3567220	Yeah.
3567220	3572220	In my view, if a text is a slave to its context,
3572220	3575220	it's not worth reading, right?
3575220	3580220	The reason Nelson Mandela chose Sophocles is not, of course,
3580220	3583220	because Sophocles was dead or white or male.
3583220	3587220	He chose Sophocles because he could have chosen anything.
3587220	3588220	He was in prison,
3588220	3591220	he was facing what he thought would be a lifetime in prison,
3591220	3593220	and the question was,
3593220	3595220	what would be the play that he would put on
3595220	3599220	with his fellow inmates, right, in the jail in South Africa?
3599220	3603220	He could have chosen a story by South African,
3603220	3607220	African-American, he could have chosen anything.
3607220	3611220	He chose Sophocles because he found in that text
3611220	3618220	more difficult, powerful, truthful, disturbing,
3618220	3621220	thinking about what mattered, right,
3621220	3626220	about power, families, despotism, nations,
3626220	3628220	religious faith, courage.
3628220	3634220	So I believe that there are great texts from many, many places,
3634220	3638220	many traditions, many languages.
3638220	3640220	It is a great shame in the United States
3640220	3643220	that we almost never read things in translation, right?
3643220	3647220	If it's not in English, oh my God, right?
3647220	3652220	As if most of the world's literature doesn't exist.
3652220	3658220	So I think the test of reading a text is,
3658220	3663220	is it overwhelmed by its political context?
3663220	3667220	Is it a work of imperialism first and last?
3667220	3669220	Then why read it, right?
3669220	3672220	If it is a work worth reading,
3672220	3675220	it is innerly liberating for all humanity
3675220	3678220	because it asks universal questions.
3678220	3680220	That's my point about Kennedy, right?
3680220	3685220	If you do not think that there are books, poems, art, music
3685220	3689220	that speak to all of us, all of us,
3689220	3692220	then you have given up on the humanities.
3692220	3694220	You've given up on the idea of humanitas,
3694220	3700220	of the idea that we are all finally more in common
3700220	3702220	than we are different.
3702220	3706220	The American metaphor used to be the melting pot, right?
3706220	3708220	We would all become American.
3708220	3711220	Today it's called the salad bowl.
3711220	3715220	This is a Californian idiocy, right?
3715220	3717220	Because if you think about it,
3717220	3719220	the idea of the salad bowl is somehow
3719220	3723220	that you both are yourself and not yourself.
3723220	3727220	It makes no sense, in fact, in educational terms.
3727220	3731220	So I think the best answer to your question
3731220	3738220	is simply, are you educated by reading this text?
3738220	3742220	Or is it simply an affirmation of an ideology,
3742220	3745220	of a political point of view, of a piece of race,
3745220	3748220	in which case, no, it does not pass,
3748220	3752220	and it should not be read in school?
3752220	3755220	Other questions?
3755220	3760220	Question, one more, thank you.
3760220	3762220	Good morning.
3762220	3765220	Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.
3765220	3767220	Thank you for you.
3767220	3770220	I have found it a little difficult to...
3770220	3773220	No, good morning again.
3773220	3776220	My name is Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.
3776220	3780220	Thank you for your great speech.
3780220	3784220	Very wonderful, fantastic.
3784220	3788220	I have a question.
3788220	3794220	One of the most sentences that I took with myself
3794220	3799220	is education is not about flattering different cultures.
3799220	3801220	And I agree.
3801220	3804220	This means that we need to have some values
3804220	3808220	that we have to keep strong in our education.
3808220	3812220	And as a teacher, we have to specify
3812220	3815220	what these values are.
3815220	3820220	In the gate of the schools, we have everyday different groups
3820220	3823220	with different values that knock at our doors
3823220	3829220	and ask to introduce in the curriculum their values.
3829220	3832220	And I found it very difficult to resist,
3832220	3836220	especially if the education has not enough money,
3836220	3840220	is not enough strong to make those resistance.
3840220	3844220	So, any comments or suggestions?
3844220	3848220	First of all, not all values are valuable.
3848220	3850220	Not all values are valuable.
3850220	3854220	Just because I think well of myself
3854220	3857220	does not mean that I should be flattered.
3857220	3860220	Just because I am Jewish does not...
3860220	3864220	I am Jewish does not mean that I should only read Jewish texts,
3864220	3867220	or texts written by Jewish authors.
3867220	3871220	I would be very angry if a teacher said to me,
3871220	3876220	I am not only going to read texts about Jewish identity.
3876220	3880220	This would seem to me to be a fundamental betrayal.
3880220	3884220	The director of schools in the city I live in
3884220	3888220	is African American, Sonja Sontalisis.
3888220	3892220	And she said to me, the challenge of education
3892220	3897220	is that it must be both mirrors and windows.
3897220	3902220	I remember, yes, of the identity of African American children
3902220	3908220	in Baltimore, because in the case of those African Americans
3908220	3912220	in Baltimore, there has been a history of racism and suffering,
3912220	3915220	which they are entitled to learn about.
3915220	3918220	This has impacted their lives.
3918220	3924220	But her important point is, if you stop there, it's hopeless.
3924220	3928220	Then you simply reproduce the image of suffering.
3928220	3931220	On the contrary, they must be introduced to the world,
3931220	3934220	to the horizon beyond Baltimore,
3934220	3937220	to the texts that come from far away places
3937220	3940220	and distant worlds and different imaginations.
3940220	3943220	So we have to be very careful
3943220	3947220	of the narcissism of individual differences.
3947220	3952220	Very careful about the idea that because all of us look different
3952220	3954220	and we come from different places,
3954220	3958220	that the education has to be about each one differently.
3958220	3960220	No, we have differences.
3960220	3963220	We live with our families, with our friends.
3963220	3965220	We can live those differences.
3965220	3969220	But education, if you believe in the humanities,
3969220	3972220	is about what it means to be human.
3972220	3977220	And that education is for everybody, or it is nothing at all.
3977220	3978220	Thank you.
3978220	3980220	Thank you.
