1. **Education and Universal Values**: Education should not just flatter different cultures but should instead instill strong, universal values. As educators, we must identify what these core values are.

2. **Resisting Pressure**: Schools often face pressure from various groups with different values wanting to be included in the curriculum. It can be challenging to resist these pressures, especially when education systems are underfunded or weak.

3. **Mirrors and Windows**: Education should serve as both a mirror and a window. A mirror reflecting students' own experiences and identities, and a window providing access to broader perspectives beyond their immediate circumstances.

4. **Avoiding Narcissism**: It is crucial to avoid the narcissistic trap of focusing solely on individual differences, such as race or culture, which can lead to a narrow and hopeless educational experience.

5. **Humanities and Humanity**: The purpose of humanities education is to explore what it means to be human. This type of education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, because it aims to address the commonality we all share as humans.

6. **Educational Leadership**: Educational leaders, like Sonja Santalisis, can provide guidance on how to balance reflecting individual identities with exposing students to a broader world of ideas and experiences.
