29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,220
In her essay The Crisis in Education, Hannah Arendt asks the most important possible question,

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,220
is education any longer possible? And her answer, essentially, is no.

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:35,220
The problem she writes of education in the modern world lies in the fact that by its very nature we cannot forego,

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:45,220
cannot be without either authority or tradition, and yet we must proceed in a world that is neither structured by authority,

33
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:55,220
nor held together by tradition. Why are authority and tradition so important to the act of educating?

34
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Arendt argues that child-centered or progressivist models of education devalu authority in ways that undermine

35
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,220
the very possibility of education. All the rules of sound human reasoning, she writes, are cast aside.

36
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Her criticism of progressivism has three parts. First, child-centered education in trust's authority in education

37
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,220
to those who by nature cannot exercise it, namely children.

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:37,220
She stresses the helplessness of every child that instinctively seeks authority to guide her or him into the world

39
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:46,220
in which he or she is still a stranger, in which she cannot orient herself by her own judgment.

40
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:56,220
Second, we adults in choosing to give power to children to shape their own education have devalued our own knowledge.

41
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:07,220
If teachers abandon the teaching of their knowledge, then teachers remove, they sacrifice the one source of authority that should be theirs.

42
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:17,220
Finally, constructivism rests on the belief that a child can only understand what they have, quote, discovered by themselves, close quote.

43
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,220
But that's not true. It's simply not true. Think about learning to read. It's not a natural process. It must be taught.

44
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:38,220
But Arendt says the incorrect belief that children can only learn by self-discovery leads to a substitution of doing for learning,

45
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,220
a damaging replacement, she writes, of thoughtful work by labor without direction.

46
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Our progressivist impulse to make sacred, to make autonomous, the world of the child is, in Hannah Arendt's view,

47
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,220
a symptom of something more serious, more fundamental.

48
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Adults give up authority because we refuse, she writes, to assume responsibility for the world into which we have brought our children.

49
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,220
What does Arendt mean by giving up responsibility for our world?

50
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,220
And why does she believe that doing so destroys our capacity to educate children?

51
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:31,220
Her answer, to simplify if I may, is that when we educate, we must take responsibility for which stories,

52
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:39,220
which information, which picture about our world we are going to pass on to our children.

53
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:46,220
But today, Arendt argues, we are estranged, alienated from our own histories.

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:55,220
There is no coherent narrative, no shared set of stories about our world, of which we are willing to say this story,

55
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,220
these stories are worthy of teaching to our children.

56
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:08,220
We live in a culture, Arendt argues, in which there is a crisis in our attitude towards the realm of the past.

57
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:15,220
We are no longer prepared to introduce children into the unfolding stories of which they are a part,

58
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,220
and in the context of which children can, one day, remake their world.

59
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:30,220
Without a shared, valued narrative about the world, children will remain ignorant of how to act.

60
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:41,220
They will be like bats without a cave, they will have no way in which to find and then judge the limits of their world.

61
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Arendt insists, quote, that exactly for the sake of what is new and revolutionary in every child,

62
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:59,220
education must be conservative, it must preserve the newness and introduce the world as a new thing to the child.

63
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Paradoxically, Arendt reminds us, that in its most creative, revolutionary period,

64
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,220
American education was most conservative.

65
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Today, she writes, educational experiments have struck a very revolutionary pose,

66
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,220
but that pose, she says, will leave children without the ability to act radically.

67
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Today, an insistence on selecting and teaching a particular cultural content to our children

68
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,220
is under deep suspicion, especially from the political left.

69
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Thus, Arendt's argument that choosing a particular content, a curriculum for our children's education,

70
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:54,220
her argument that doing so is not conservative, requires support.

71
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,220
To juz America as our example, I would remind us that the most important figures of protest

72
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,220
in the struggle for civil rights, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X,

73
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:18,220
each affirmed the centrality of classical learning in their resistance, in their voice of resistance.

74
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,220
You may remember that Malcolm X dropped out of school when he was 13,

75
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:32,220
but when imprisoned for robbery, he taught himself to read Tolstoy, Dostoevski, and Nietzsche, among many others.

76
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,220
To the American list, I would add one more powerful example, that of Nelson Mandela.

77
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,220
When he was imprisoned in South Africa in Robin Island,

78
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,220
he chose to play both the role of Creon and Antigone in Sophocles' play of that name.

79
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,220
He recalled later that he found the experience of studying that play,

80
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,220
and indeed classical literature more generally as, quote, enormously elevating, close quote.

81
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Sophocles, he said, had much to teach him about power, despotism, politics, courage, and faith.

82
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:20,220
To repeat her central claim, the authority of the teacher then rests on the assumption of responsibility for our world.

83
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Our intellectual irresponsibility when it comes to education lies in our unwillingness to select

84
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,220
to be responsible for content worth teaching.

85
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:43,220
We betray ourselves as parents and educators in pretending that children can be made the authors of their world.

86
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,220
In what our rent bluntly calls our disgust for our world, we wash our hands of our authority,

87
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,220
our responsibility, and our love both for our children and for our world.

88
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Our rent ties the surrender of the core responsibility of the teacher,

89
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,220
our unwillingness to be responsible for choosing the content of education,

90
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,220
to our unwillingness to judge what is of value in human experience.

91
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,220
I now want to stress that the unwillingness to say this content is worth teaching

92
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,220
is not a theoretical issue alone.

93
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:31,220
In the United States, at least, the flight from responsibility is powerfully and destructively evident

94
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,220
in our preference for skills over curricular content.

95
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:46,220
We do not have in our nation as a whole or in any one of our 50 states a single shared curriculum in any subject.

96
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,220
No defined content in literature, or history, or science, or even mathematics.

97
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Because there is no set curriculum, because we do not require students to read a list of books,

98
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:10,220
our state tests, our state tests of reading, for example, cannot test knowledge of any specific text.

99
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,220
We cannot ask questions about Moby Dick, or the Great Gatsby, or the Bluest Eye, for example.

100
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Instead, our tests present students with a paragraph or two from a very obscure source

101
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,220
that no student has ever read before, so no student has an advantage.

102
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,220
We then ask students to, quote, find the main idea in the paragraph.

103
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Of course, this ability depends on understanding what the text is about.

104
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:51,220
And it turns out that wealthy or richer students do much better in finding the main idea

105
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,220
because they have more knowledge about the world.

106
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,220
So the reading test in America becomes a test of family wealth.

107
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,220
We can predict quite well a student's results on a test if we know their parents' wealth.

108
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,220
Because poor students do badly, we try to train them on finding the main idea

109
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,220
instead of teaching them content, and as a result, every year they do worse and worse.

110
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,220
You know, a shift over the last hundred years from content to skill,

111
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
America is following, unfortunately.

112
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,220
The example said in France when it passed the loge au span,

113
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:45,220
when it abandoned gave up the national curriculum for a shift to child-centered progressive pedagogy.

114
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,220
Here is what happened to the performance of children in reading in France.

115
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:58,220
These lines represent the reading skills of children from different economic groups,

116
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,220
the wealthiest children at the top, the poorest children at the bottom,

117
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:10,220
from the time the law was passed in 1987 to 20 years later in 2007.

118
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,220
What you can see is that the shift to child-centered education

119
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,220
damaged the reading of every group of students,

120
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,220
but what is most tragic is that it damaged the reading of poorer students the most.

121
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,220
That is the bottom line.

122
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Sadly, it has become fashionable to follow Jo Span's example.

123
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,220
For example, Finland, where excellent educational achievements were built

124
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,220
on a strong content-rich national curriculum, this was given up.

125
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,220
As a result, just like in France, there has in the last few years

126
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,220
been a steady decline in educational results.

127
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,220
England went through the same thing before it went back to a content-rich curriculum.

128
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,220
The United States has done the same thing,

129
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,220
but in the United States we have gone further.

130
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Not only have we embraced empty skills instead of content,

131
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,220
we have in the last ten years become enchanted with the idea

132
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,220
that even teaching academic skills may be very old-fashioned.

133
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Instead, an ever-increasing number of teachers supported by a very thin research base

134
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,220
have been embracing a very different agenda.

135
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,220
The following slide summarizes the new pedagogy in America.

136
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:48,220
I'll give you a moment to look at these wonderful examples.

137
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,220
As I lay out in my recent book, there is very little serious research

138
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,220
to support any of these ideas.

139
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,220
To take one example, it should be obvious, but apparently it is not,

140
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,220
that one cannot think critically about nothing in particular.

141
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,220
We need to have some knowledge to think critically about,

142
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,220
or take the 21st century skills.

143
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,220
It sounds very relevant, very sexy.

144
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Well, it turns out that 21st century skills are a long, long list

145
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,220
of everything that you want in a human being.

146
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Reliability, capacity to motivate, capacity to work in teams,

147
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,220
information literacy, communication skills, cross-cultural sensitivity,

148
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,220
flexibility, accountability, maybe clean socks.

149
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,220
It is an endless list.

150
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,220
The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars,

151
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,220
hundreds of millions of dollars, in the collective search

152
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,220
to do something, anything other than teach core academic content.

153
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,220
But the impact has been deeply negative.

154
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,220
After some real progress in the 1980s and the 1990s,

155
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,220
progress especially for the poorest students has stopped.

156
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Here are the math results for our high school students.

157
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,220
As you can see, the United States has made exactly zero progress

158
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,220
since 1992, zero.

159
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,220
This is despite the fact that we have spent more dollars

160
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,220
in real dollars after inflation, far more than we did in 1992.

161
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,220
But the situation, while it's bad in mathematics,

162
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:53,220
is much worse when it comes to students' knowledge of history and civics.

163
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,220
In this, as you see on the slide, in 2018,

164
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,220
just 25% of 13-year-olds in America passed the civics test.

165
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,220
This is the lowest result in the United States of any subject matter test.

166
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,220
It's worse than reading, worse than math, worse than science.

167
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,220
In other words, the result is bad across the country.

168
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,220
The result is bad across the board.

169
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,220
But for African-American and Hispanic students, it's a disaster.

170
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,220
The pass rate is 10% and 13% for those two groups.

171
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Now, this is, again, not just a theoretical problem.

172
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,220
As you can see in the second paragraph,

173
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,220
the Center for Civic Education found in a major survey

174
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,220
that just 30% of Americans born since 1980s,

175
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,220
so the younger generation, believe it's essential to live in a democracy.

176
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,220
I just want that to sink in for a moment.

177
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,220
So 70% of our younger Americans do not think it's particularly important

178
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,220
to live in a democracy.

179
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,220
We may see the results in the next presidential election.

180
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,220
One might think that confronted by these results,

181
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,220
there would be widespread distress over our educational outcomes in the United States.

182
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,220
After all, in math and science, America's international results are very embarrassing.

183
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:38,220
We do worse, for example, in mathematics than Vietnam, a country we left in ruins.

184
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,220
But instead, America has discovered a deeply and deeply sophisticated way

185
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,220
to handle bad news.

186
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,220
It simply reports bad news as good news.

187
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
What do I mean?

188
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Remember that the exam results of American high school students

189
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,220
has been flat since 1990 or so.

190
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Now, if you have flat results,

191
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,220
you would assume that the grades we give to American students,

192
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,220
A, B, C, D, would be flat, right?

193
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
Flat results, flat grades.

194
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Oh, no.

195
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,220
No, in America, while the results have been flat,

196
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,220
we have given ever higher grades to our American students.

197
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,220
That's those lines going upwards.

198
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,220
There's a very strange thing, if you think about it.

199
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Why should we give higher and higher grades to the same result?

200
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Not only have we done this in high school,

201
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,220
we've also done it in university.

202
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,220
We have grade inflation in the United States.

203
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,220
What does grade inflation actually mean?

204
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,220
Grade inflation means simply that we call today success

205
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,220
what 20 years ago we called failure.

206
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,220
We have gone up a complete grade in the United States.

207
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,220
It's a fiction. It's a complete myth.

208
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
It's a mythology.

209
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,220
It's as if we can't take bad news,

210
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,220
so we simply call it good.

211
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
It's beyond embarrassing.

212
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,220
It's a lie that damages children

213
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,220
because much later in life they find out

214
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,220
that they don't have the knowledge they need.

215
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,220
To summarize our argument so far,

216
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,220
America's decision to embrace skills over content

217
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,220
has damaged student learning.

218
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Sympathetic to our rent's argument,

219
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,220
I have been for some time a critic of this flight,

220
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
this retreat from content,

221
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,220
this refusal to make judgments about

222
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
what is worth learning.

223
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,220
But where does this flight from educational responsibility,

224
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,220
this unwillingness to make judgments about content come from?

225
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Our rent locates this inability to judge,

226
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
this refusal to act in judgment,

227
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,220
in thinking itself, in the retreat from thinking.

228
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,220
She writes, the precondition for judgment

229
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,220
is the disposition, the habit,

230
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,220
to live explicitly or consciously with oneself,

231
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,220
to have dialogue with oneself,

232
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,220
to be engaged in that silent dialogue

233
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
between me and myself,

234
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
which she says,

235
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,220
since Socrates and Plato we call thinking.

236
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,220
To illustrate this silent dialogue

237
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,220
when Socrates says his deepest fear is,

238
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
quote,

239
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,220
that I, being one, should be out of tune with myself

240
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,220
and contradict myself.

241
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Close quote.

242
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
The meaning is clear.

243
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Even though I am one person,

244
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I am not simply one person.

245
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,220
I have a self and I am related to myself.

246
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,220
I am not simply one person.

247
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I am self and I am related to myself.

248
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
This self is not an illusion.

249
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,220
It makes itself heard by talking.

250
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I talk to myself.

251
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
That is what thinking is.

252
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,220
If I do wrong,

253
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,220
this is Arendt and Plato,

254
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,220
the key point is not that somebody else will find me guilty,

255
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,220
that somebody else will scold me.

256
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,220
The point is I have to live with that wrongdoer.

257
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
I have to be in this,

258
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,220
and this is Arendt's phrase, unbearable intimacy.

259
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,220
I can never get rid of myself.

260
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Invited by thought into a lifelong dialogue with myself,

261
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,220
thinking is done in solitude.

262
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
This is not loneliness.

263
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
This is solitude.

264
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,220
It is the responsibility of the educator to judge

265
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,220
which content to teach a child

266
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,220
so that the child's developing internal dialogue

267
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,220
of self with self is not empty, random,

268
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
or filled with noise,

269
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,220
but is supplied with what is worth.

270
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Worth something, the content of thought.

271
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,220
But please note too that we have slipped

272
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,220
almost without noticing into the realm of ethics.

273
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,220
If the content of my thought is unworthy,

274
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,220
if it is trash, my habits of thought are thus debased.

275
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,220
I am condemned to be in that unbearable intimacy

276
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,220
with my own emptiness, my own worthlessness.

277
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Once again, the United States offers us a vivid

278
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
and disturbing model.

279
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,220
The average teenager in the United States today

280
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,220
is on social media for almost eight hours every day.

281
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,220
That's the most recent data.

282
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,220
That's longer than they are in a school setting.

283
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,220
It means they're coming home and they're right on the machine

284
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
and they stay on the machine.

285
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,220
While school is focused in America on offering

286
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,220
often content-empty skills,

287
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,220
it is social media that supplies the content of thought

288
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
unsupervised by adults.

289
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,220
There are no boundaries for the content

290
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,220
that floods the smartphone or the computer.

291
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Once upon a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in the Emile

292
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,220
that children needed to experience limits,

293
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,220
he called them walls of bronze, close quote,

294
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,220
today those walls have collapsed

295
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,220
and the child is flooded by the chaos,

296
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,220
the cacophony, the noise of the world.

297
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,220
The internal space, the dialogue of the child with herself,

298
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,220
collapses under this avalanč.

299
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,220
The result, unsurprisingly,

300
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,220
is the rapid growth in the United States

301
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
of childhood depression

302
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,220
and an increasing unwillingness made worse by COVID

303
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,220
to attend school at all.

304
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Today in Baltimore, where I live,

305
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,220
some 65% of high school students

306
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,220
are chronically absent from school,

307
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,220
meaning they miss more than 10% of school days.

308
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Competing with the content of the internet,

309
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,220
the skills-based education cannot compete.

310
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,220
It is too boring, too fragmented, too empty.

311
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,220
It does not create ideas that are worth holding in mind.

312
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Above all, with some exceptions,

313
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
especially if students are lucky enough

314
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
to have strong science teachers,

315
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,220
it does not provide material for serious thinking.

316
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Other animals reproduce, hunt, build homes,

317
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,220
communicate, remember, experience emotions as we do,

318
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,220
but human beings alone can evaluate in language

319
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,220
our own actions and those of others,

320
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,220
appreciate beauty, acquire facilities

321
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
in different fields of knowledge,

322
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,220
be they literate, mathematical, historical,

323
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,220
scientific, or those expressed in musical

324
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,220
or other artistic or physical forms.

325
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,220
Only human beings can think reflectively

326
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,220
about the direction, the unfolding trajectory

327
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,220
of our lives without a well-developed capacity

328
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,220
in which thoughtfulness life becomes a matter of chance.

329
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,220
A life lived at the mercy of instinct,

330
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,220
of unfiltered emotion is the life of a human puppet

331
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,220
directed by forces of chance and circumstance

332
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,220
in his work Plato famously compares

333
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
such human beings to puppets,

334
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,220
whose strings are pulled by the gods.

335
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,220
The most fundamental purpose of education

336
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,220
is thus to nurture our capacity to think.

337
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Education is the means by which

338
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,220
our most human capabilities are transformed

339
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,220
from just potential to a life in which

340
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
we can interrogate our experience

341
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,220
so as to learn and integrate our experience

342
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
into future action.

343
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Michael Oakshot, philosopher and political theorist

344
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,220
put it this way, I quote,

345
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,220
the price of the intelligent activity

346
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,220
which constitutes being human is learning.

347
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,220
When the human condition is said to be burdensome, heavy,

348
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,220
what is being pointed out is not the mere necessity

349
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,220
of having to think, to speak, and to act

350
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,220
instead of merely being like a stone

351
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,220
or growing like a tree,

352
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,220
but the impossibility of thinking or feeling

353
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,220
without having slowly and often painfully

354
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,220
learned to think something.

355
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,220
While the need for a good education

356
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,220
can be defended for many reasons,

357
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,220
including both economic and civic,

358
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,220
our most essential responsibility as educators

359
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,220
involves the guiding, the careful nurturing

360
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,220
of children's learning to think.

361
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,220
The argument of my recent book is that there are

362
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,220
three crucial elements in the education of thought.

363
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Learning academic content, we've talked about this

364
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,220
in literature, history, math and science at least,

365
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,220
and education in ethics and in education in aesthetics.

366
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Our schools need to nurture the capacity

367
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,220
for academic learning, ethical reflection

368
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,220
and aesthetic sensibility because they are crucial

369
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,220
to forging a fulfilling life.

370
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,220
I can only sketch that argument today.

371
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,220
We've already discussed our refusal to take responsibility

372
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,220
for the rich content of education,

373
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,220
the core of academic learning.

374
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,220
We now briefly will consider ethics

375
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,220
and then turn to aesthetics.

376
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,220
The founding American hope now exported to the world

377
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,220
is that our lives might enable the pursuit of happiness,

378
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
what exactly does that mean?

379
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Surely not that we do anything at all without thought.

380
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,220
24 centuries ago Aristotle coined the term eudaimonio,

381
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,220
human flourishing to describe the concept of happiness.

382
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Eudaimonio, Aristotle argued, is the highest,

383
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
the most important of human ends,

384
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,220
the purpose of our existence.

385
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
A well-lived life is one in which the aim of happiness

386
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,220
or human flourishing is our north star,

387
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,220
guiding our choice, our values, our hopes, our dreams.

388
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,220
A well-lived life, an ethical life,

389
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Aristotle insists, is about making wise choices.

390
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
If they are well educated in ethics,

391
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,220
human beings will have learned to weigh the consequences

392
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,220
of their choices in terms of how the outcomes

393
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,220
will affect the pathway, the life of their life story,

394
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,220
the values that they will embrace.

395
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Aristotle argues that in making choices

396
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,220
that will shape the future direction of our life,

397
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,220
well-educated humans will seek out opportunities

398
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,220
to be involved in actions that are courageous,

399
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
generous, and aren't honorable.

400
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,220
As you know, Aristotle calls the act of choosing

401
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,220
or reasoning about one's actions fronasis,

402
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,220
usually translated as intellectual virtue

403
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,220
of exercising practical wisdom.

404
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,220
When we exercise it, we combine the careful consideration

405
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,220
of the pathway of our life and a commitment

406
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,220
to understanding the virtuous course of actions

407
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,220
in reaching our goals.

408
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Education worthy of the name is crucial to fronasis

409
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
because it is through education that children,

410
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,220
through repetition that becomes habit,

411
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,220
come to enjoy virtuous actions.

412
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,220
They will want to forge paths of living

413
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,220
in which they can enjoy what a virtuous life can offer.

414
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,220
In other words, they will have learned to desire

415
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,220
and thus seek to make the opportunities for a good life.

416
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Aristotle's key point is this.

417
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,220
If adults are one day to successfully deliberate,

418
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
think about what is good,

419
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,220
they must already have come to enjoy doing

420
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
what is just, courageous, honest as children.

421
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,220
In šort, they will have developed a moral compass.

422
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,220
In Aristotle's words,

423
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,220
a good upbringing makes the noble a part,

424
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,220
perhaps the chief part of what is good in us.

425
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,220
How do we acquire this enjoyment of ethical choicemaking?

426
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
First through lived experience.

427
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,220
This is why, to cite him once again,

428
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,220
in Rousseau's Émile,

429
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,220
the tutor of the boy organizes the experience of the child

430
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,220
so that Émile experiences the connection

431
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,220
between wise actions and their positive consequences.

432
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,220
But secondly, ethical choicemaking

433
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,220
is developed through more formal education,

434
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
through stories, myths, history

435
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,220
that enable children to inhabit multiple worlds

436
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
beyond their own horizons,

437
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,220
to derive thoughtful lessons from those stories

438
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,220
which will serve their own developing capacities

439
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,220
for phronasis as they mature.

440
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,220
The curriculum we devise for our young children,

441
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
the tales we tell them,

442
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,220
or we read to them before they think for themselves,

443
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,220
are not simply devices to enable them

444
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
to master the mechanics of reading,

445
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,220
important though that is.

446
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,220
But a key reference point for an education in ethics.

447
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
Through their capacity to imagine,

448
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,220
children place themselves in previously unimagined

449
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
and unexpected worlds.

450
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,220
They associate with characters in the stories they read

451
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,220
and they take their experiences to heart.

452
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,220
The resulting lessons are ethically crucial.

453
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Children in that imaginative space

454
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,220
rehearse the consequences of fictional

455
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,220
historical characters that they read about,

456
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,220
learning about the consequences of decisions

457
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
made with too little thought

458
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,220
or wise choices that lead to well-lived lives.

459
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,220
That is what phronasis consists in,

460
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,220
a conscious effort to slow down,

461
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
to rehearse various pathways,

462
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,220
to ask tough questions of oneself,

463
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,220
to enable the imagination to draw on multiple possibilities,

464
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,220
to deepen one's awareness in short,

465
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
to be thoughtful.

466
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
Today, particularly in the United States,

467
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,220
we've given up on ethical education.

468
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,220
We tried something called character education

469
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
in the 1980s, early 90s,

470
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
we've let that go,

471
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
we've simply turned our back

472
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,220
on one of the most essential tasks of education

473
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,220
to provide an ethical compass.

474
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
And now aesthetics.

475
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:51,220
A life lived without an educated attunement to the beautiful

476
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,220
will be as if the very colors of one's life's experiences

477
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
are washed out.

478
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Children deserve opportunities to nourish their imagination,

479
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,220
to respond to the beautiful in the outside world

480
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,220
or a museum, playing a musical instrument,

481
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,220
crafting a sculpture, mastering a dance

482
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
or perspective in painting.

483
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,220
To have to argue for an education in aesthetics

484
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
is surprising,

485
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,220
given its fundamental value to human sensibility.

486
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
But it is also vital,

487
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,220
since today it has so little standing

488
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
in so many of our schools,

489
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
at least in the United States.

490
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,220
We have in America created

491
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,220
a class system of subjects.

492
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
Math and reading somehow is first class.

493
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Science and history, second class.

494
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,220
We sometimes test them, we sometimes don't.

495
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Everything else is third class.

496
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Everything from philosophy to arts

497
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,220
to physical education to computer,

498
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,220
it's all third class.

499
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Immanuel Kant is compelling on the topic of aesthetics.

500
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,220
In making aesthetic judgments,

501
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Kant as Kant sees it,

502
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
we are in the realm of free choice.

503
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,220
We cannot appeal to some scientific principle

504
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,220
or proof that something is worthy

505
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
of being called beautiful.

506
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
We are just on our own

507
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
with our experiences to rely on.

508
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
This is because, he says,

509
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
when we make aesthetic judgments

510
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
that this painting is beautiful,

511
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
nothing is given.

512
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Thinking doesn't determine in advance

513
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
our own experience.

514
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,220
We are free to act, to react to the painting

515
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
as we please.

516
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,220
But that produces a major problem.

517
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Our aesthetic judgments

518
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
just a matter of private opinion,

519
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
like, I like chocolate ice cream,

520
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
you like vanilla.

521
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Kant rejects this view.

522
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,220
He claims that when we make aesthetic judgments

523
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,220
we are doing something very, very different.

524
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,220
We are responding to something deep in human nature.

525
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,220
And that response is so strong

526
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,220
that we find we want to share our response

527
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
with other people, with each other.

528
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
When I say this is beautiful,

529
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I make a claim not just for myself,

530
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,220
but for all humanity.

531
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
As we encounter the objects,

532
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
our thoughts about it come together

533
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,220
in a positive and powerful urge

534
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
to share with others.

535
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
We are convinced that they, too,

536
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
should be struck by the quality

537
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
of what has been created.

538
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Don't you see, don't you hear

539
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,220
how beautiful this is?

540
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
What occurs inside our mind

541
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
when we are moved by the beauty of an object,

542
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,220
when it evokes this powerful urge

543
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,220
to celebrate, retain, and communicate

544
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
our experience?

545
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,220
Kant suggests that at that moment

546
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,220
both our facilities of imagination

547
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,220
and understanding are equally active.

548
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,220
If an object creates an experience

549
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,220
of what Kant calls the harmony

550
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
of understanding and imagination,

551
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,220
we feel that unity as a deep pleasure

552
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,220
and experience of beauty.

553
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,220
A vast literature suggests

554
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,220
that in his discussion of how imagination

555
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
and cognition or thought come together

556
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,220
in a moment of appreciation of beauty,

557
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,220
these account is not without problems.

558
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,220
In fact, in one point in his famous third critique,

559
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
which is talking about aesthetic judgment,

560
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Kant stops and says,

561
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm not sure I understand what I'm writing,

562
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
so maybe we too.

563
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,220
But as he describes this aesthetic experience,

564
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
he is also talking about something

565
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
very familiar to us.

566
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
A piece of music or art

567
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,220
startles us out of indifference,

568
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
out of complacency.

569
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,220
We are drawn to it powerfully.

570
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,220
We may make some effort to describe it,

571
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
but that effort gives way before

572
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,220
the just the experience of the painting.

573
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,220
We are amazed, delighted, horrified.

574
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,220
The British philosopher Peter de Bola

575
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,220
describes an example of this aesthetic experience

576
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,220
as he stands in front of Bonnet Newman's abstract painting

577
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,220
Vier heroico sublimus man heroic and sublime.

578
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
He writes as follows,

579
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,220
the image seems to compose me

580
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,220
to generate a sense of well-being.

581
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Here de Bola describes both an emotional response

582
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
and a sense that the painting was offering him

583
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
new forms of thought.

584
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
The painting creates the feeling

585
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
like one is knowing something,

586
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,220
a heightened sense of the self being well composed.

587
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,220
That is aesthetic knowing feeling

588
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,220
which de Bola places between pure emotion

589
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
and thinking,

590
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
or in plain English between thinking and thought

591
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
is very powerful,

592
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,220
even if we cannot fully understand or define it.

593
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,220
De Bola's experience in front of this painting

594
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220
bears witness to what Kant described

595
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,220
as an encounter with the truly beautiful.

596
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,220
De Bola invites us to see the painting

597
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,220
and share the experience.

598
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,220
As he does so, he's recalling something very personal,

599
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,220
his reaction to looking at the painting,

600
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:33,220
but his claim is that all of us can have that experience.

601
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,220
Compared to the exercise of simply reporting facts

602
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
about the canvas,

603
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,220
an exercise in which my engagement is quite weak,

604
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,220
the effort of evoking an aesthetic claim

605
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,220
is searching and demanding.

606
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,220
It involves translating something very private

607
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
into a shareable language

608
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,220
into what de Bola calls a mutual terrain.

609
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,220
The experience of sharing can be a powerful invitation

610
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,220
to community, to inclusivity.

611
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,220
These aren't just theoretical claims.

612
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,220
In 2021, researchers from the United States and Germany

613
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,220
examined the reaction of many hundreds of students

614
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,220
from the U.S., the U.K. and India

615
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
while looking at an image

616
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
or listening to music

617
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,220
or recalling a personal experience of beauty.

618
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
The results of the research

619
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,220
closely echo Kant's philosophical model.

620
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
I quote,

621
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,220
top-rated beauty experiences

622
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,220
are strongly characterized by intense pleasure,

623
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,220
an impression of universality,

624
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,220
the wish to continue the experience,

625
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,220
exceeding expectation

626
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,220
and harmony in the variety and meaning

627
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
of the experience.

628
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
As Kant suggests,

629
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
the language of thought and emotions

630
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,220
are not separated but together at once.

631
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
A child becomes conscious

632
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
of what is in front of her.

633
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Trying to produce the sound on a violin,

634
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,220
she struggles knowing it's not there yet.

635
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
She experiences her own knowing,

636
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
struggle as frustration

637
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
but she wants to succeed

638
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,220
to communicate the sound to us all.

639
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,220
Or to take another example from the visual arts,

640
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,220
imagine a student in front of a Rothko painting

641
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220
in a museum.

642
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,220
There's no immediate meaning to the painting

643
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
and the tendency of a student,

644
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,220
particularly today, is just to keep walking.

645
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,220
The teacher has to stop the student,

646
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,220
place the student in front of the painting

647
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,220
and enable the process of imagination and thought.

648
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,220
Aesthetic education is above all

649
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,220
an exhilarating experience of losing the self

650
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,220
in an encounter,

651
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,220
only to return to an enlarged and deepened self.

652
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,220
This sounds theoretical,

653
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
but it can be seen every day

654
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,220
in the 94th aphorism of Nietzsche's

655
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
Beyond Good and Evil.

656
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,220
The seriousness, another translation,

657
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,220
is the intensity of a child at play.

658
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
You've all seen it.

659
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,220
The intensity, the energy,

660
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,220
the loss and recovery of a self

661
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,220
comes from this energy that is fed

662
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,220
by engagement with the experience.

663
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,220
To offer students a rich set of such aesthetic experiences

664
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,220
is a core value of education.

665
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,220
Martin Heidegger, German philosopher,

666
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
emphasizes the interaction

667
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,220
between aesthetic judgment and thinking.

668
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,220
Writing that our encounters with objects

669
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,220
that are beautiful is not merely

670
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,220
a matter of feeling,

671
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,220
but are, I quote, amongst the most

672
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,220
thought-provoking of all encounters.

673
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,220
Aesthetic experiences also have ethical dimensions,

674
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,220
as the cultural critic Roger Kimball

675
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,220
reminds us when we share aesthetic responses

676
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,220
with one another,

677
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,220
we are reminded powerfully

678
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
of our common humanity,

679
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,220
of our capacity to share freely

680
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
a sense of beauty

681
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,220
that elevates us as human beings.

682
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,220
Or, in the words of Dante

683
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,220
from the Purgatorio canto 18,

684
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,220
beauty awakens the soul to act.

685
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,220
Thought, ethics and beauty

686
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,220
were so, I would argue,

687
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,220
are three intertwined and crucial elements

688
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,220
of an education worthy of the name.

689
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,220
To give up on making judgments about

690
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,220
and then teaching a challenging

691
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
content-rich curriculum,

692
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,220
to leave ethical development to chance,

693
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,220
to turn one's back on an education in beauty

694
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,220
is to betray what it means to be a teacher.

695
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,220
This three-part surrender

696
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,220
because knowledge, ethics and aesthetics

697
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
are intertwined

698
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,220
is not a beautiful gift

699
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
we give to the freedom of our children,

700
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,220
it is simply to announce

701
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,220
the loss of our role as teachers.

702
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,220
In the United States today

703
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,220
we have developed a habit

704
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,220
of teaching that's very different.

705
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,220
And I want to re-enter

706
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,220
that we've moved towards our close

707
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,220
this contemporary educational politics.

708
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,220
We have turned our back on knowledge

709
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,220
of the canon, of essential texts

710
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,220
and I have argued with Hannah Arendt

711
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,220
that this is not in any way a radical move,

712
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,220
it is in fact to give up on enabling children

713
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,220
to prepare for radical action.

714
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
Today in the United States

715
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
the argument is we must focus

716
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,220
on teaching multiculturalism.

717
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Faced with students from all over the world,

718
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,220
from many national ethnic religious

719
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,220
and racial origins,

720
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,220
our education, and you've heard this a thousand times,

721
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,220
must respect their differences,

722
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,220
must respect their differences.

723
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
But a moment's thought should tell us

724
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,220
that this has become educationally impossible.

725
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
We were once told

726
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
that we are to be very respectful,

727
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,220
sensitive to Hispanic culture.

728
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,220
Sounded reasonable.

729
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,220
22 million Hispanic students.

730
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,220
We are now reminded however

731
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,220
of the deep differences correctly

732
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,220
between Jamaicans and Hispanics

733
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,220
or Hispanics and Latinos.

734
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,220
We should realize that Cubans and Dominicans

735
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,220
cannot be regarded as sharing the same identity.

736
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,220
And so the list goes on,

737
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,220
more and more differences.

738
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
With the logical conclusion

739
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,220
that perhaps every child should be taught

740
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,220
a unique cultural content,

741
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,220
the result would be a complete fragmentation

742
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,220
of the curriculum.

743
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,220
The word humanity should remind us

744
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,220
the education of human beings.

745
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Some 60 years ago,

746
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
President Kennedy reminded Americans

747
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
that, quote,

748
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,220
we all breathe the same air,

749
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
we are all mortal,

750
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,220
and we all cherish our children's future, close quote.

751
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,220
If we no longer believe

752
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
that texts can speak to all of us,

753
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,220
if I cannot read Dante

754
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,220
because I am not Italian and not Christian,

755
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,220
if I cannot teach Dante to children

756
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,220
because they are African American or Cuban,

757
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,220
then I have turned my back on humanity

758
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,220
on an education in what is most essential,

759
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,220
most beautiful, most instructive

760
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,220
to leading a considered life.

761
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,220
Education is not about flattering,

762
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,220
not about flattering the color of my skin

763
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,220
or about celebrating the personality

764
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,220
I happen to be

765
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,220
or ensuring that my sense of self

766
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,220
is never upset or angered.

767
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,220
We seem to have discovered a new right

768
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,220
in the United States Constitution,

769
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
a right not to be upset.

770
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,220
I don't find it in the document.

771
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,220
To educate does not close one's eyes

772
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,220
to the sufferings of people or of nations.

773
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,220
Evil, too, is woven into the human condition.

774
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,220
Education's most essential task, however,

775
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,220
is to draw myself out of myself,

776
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
edukare,

777
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,220
to tell me the story of the human condition,

778
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,220
enabling me to transcend

779
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,220
the self I was as an ignorant child.

780
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,220
An argument grounded in the humanities

781
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,220
should perhaps come towards a close in poetry.

782
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,220
Toto 115,

783
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,220
one of the most troubled,

784
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,220
most gifted poets of the last century,

785
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,220
writing in his 80s

786
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,220
and imprisoned for treason,

787
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,220
provided four lines

788
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,220
that demand the education I've tried today to summon.

789
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,220
The academic preparation

790
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,220
to hear the core metaphor,

791
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,220
to trace in his language

792
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,220
the echoes of Homer and Dante,

793
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,220
an ethical sensibility

794
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:44,220
to hear the harsh self condemnation of the poet

795
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
and to forgive his madness,

796
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,220
an aesthetic response

797
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,220
to hear the beauty of the verse

798
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,220
and ultimately to education

799
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,220
that still believes in the future of humanities,

800
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,220
for which the dying, anguished,

801
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,220
sick Ezra Pound still has hope.

802
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,220
A blown husk that is finished,

803
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,220
but the light sings eternal.

804
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,220
A pale flare over marshes

805
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,220
where the salt hay whispers

806
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,220
to tides change.

807
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,220
A blown husk,

808
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,220
Ezra himself,

809
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,220
that is finished.

810
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,220
His life is over,

811
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,220
he has betrayed all his own values.

812
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,220
But the light sings eternal.

813
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,220
The light of the human condition of high culture

814
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,220
is still there,

815
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,220
is still singing.

816
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,220
It's a pale flare.

817
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,220
It is a delicate fragile light

818
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,220
over the marshes

819
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,220
where the salt hay whispers to tides change.

820
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,220
The edge of the ocean

821
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,220
in his larger part of the canto,

822
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,220
Pound is recalling the Odyssey,

823
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,220
the return of Odysseus,

824
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,220
the tides of the oceans of the world.

825
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,220
To introduce,

826
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,220
to teach such verse

827
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,220
is what is meant by education.

828
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,220
And so I say to all of you,

829
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,220
to all the educators,

830
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
to all the teachers here today,

831
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,220
you have chosen a great calling.

832
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,220
The life prospects,

833
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,220
the imaginings,

834
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,220
the interior furnishings,

835
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,220
the cultural enemy of your student's mind,

836
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,220
the cultural enemy of your student's mind,

837
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:38,220
all of this is in your hands.

838
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,220
Of course,

839
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,220
there will be difficult days,

840
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,220
very difficult days,

841
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,220
as well as joyful ones.

842
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,220
You will need what the great poet

843
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,220
Paul Eloard called in French

844
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,220
le dur desil de duré,

845
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,220
the difficult desire to endure.

846
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,220
But each day, every day,

847
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,220
remind yourself that on this day

848
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,220
your teaching may open a world

849
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,220
to a young person, to a child.

850
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,220
There is no greater privilege.

851
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,220
I thank you.

852
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,220
Thank you, David,

853
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,220
for such an inspiring speech.

854
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,220
We have a few minutes

855
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,220
for some brief questions.

856
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,220
If someone wants to start

857
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,220
a very brief dialogue.

858
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,220
Sara has a microphone over there.

859
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Thank you, Sara.

860
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:51,220
Just raise your hand if you want.

861
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,220
It's a little bit difficult,

862
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
but just raise your hand

863
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:01,220
if you want a brief question to David.

864
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,220
In the first row,

865
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,220
maybe we collect three or four questions

866
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,220
for David, as you wish.

867
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,220
David, thank you very much

868
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,220
for this inspiring presentation.

869
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,220
I'm Erica Kopp

870
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,220
from Budapest, Hungary.

871
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,220
And I was really happy

872
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,220
when I heard that you start

873
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,220
with Hannah Arendt's work,

874
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,220
because she is from this region,

875
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,220
from this European region,

876
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,220
and it's very important for us,

877
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,220
her souls.

878
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,220
My question is the following,

879
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,220
because related to your statements

880
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,220
about this knowledge,

881
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,220
in the education of the United States,

882
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,220
we have got a totally different experience.

883
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,220
And I would like to go with my question

884
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,220
from this experience,

885
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,220
to expressing my experience.

886
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,220
And I think most of those,

887
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,220
they are from post-soviet countries here,

888
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,220
they have got a totally different experience,

889
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:16,220
because as I see all education systems,

890
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:20,220
although they are at rhetorical level,

891
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,220
this topic that we have to decrease the content

892
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,220
in curriculum and in education,

893
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:32,220
it didn't happen after these communist times.

894
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
It's still there, overloaded.

895
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,220
We have got enough knowledge,

896
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,220
I think, I have to say,

897
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
what you mentioned can't,

898
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
we learned it in a secondary school,

899
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,220
what you mentioned socrates,

900
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
we learned it in a secondary school.

901
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,220
So everything is there,

902
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:52,220
but still we have got such bad results,

903
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,220
on reading, on mathematics, on everything.

904
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,220
And we feel that for students,

905
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,220
the knowledge that we submit,

906
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,220
this knowledge for students,

907
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,220
they are not relevant for them.

908
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,220
And my question is,

909
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,220
now I arrived to the question,

910
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,220
so what do you think,

911
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,220
how can we deal,

912
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,220
because I agree with you

913
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,220
that this knowledge question is crucial

914
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,220
when we are thinking about education,

915
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,220
how can we deal with this power issue related to,

916
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,220
who choose the knowledge?

917
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,220
Thank you so much, excellent question.

918
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:40,220
First, I want to start with the most powerful criticism,

919
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,220
which is this question of relevance.

920
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,220
This drives me up the wall,

921
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
as it won't surprise you to hear.

922
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,220
If children were only interested in what was relevant,

923
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,220
they would never read Harry Potter,

924
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,220
they would never read the Lord of the Rings.

925
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,220
Children love to escape,

926
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,220
they love to be in imagined worlds.

927
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,220
We in America seem to believe

928
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,220
that education should be a mirror,

929
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,220
that we should only see ourselves,

930
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
whoever we happen to be.

931
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,220
But that's to be imprisoned in the self.

932
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:18,220
It is the irrelevant that takes us out of ourselves.

933
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,220
That is what, the great books

934
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,220
sounds very conservative,

935
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,220
but the great books are the great books

936
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
because they were disturbing,

937
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,220
because they pushed you.

938
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,220
Remember, a meal was burnt,

939
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
Rousseau's a meal was burnt.

940
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,220
Socrates was put to death,

941
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
Nietzsche was regarded as insane

942
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,220
before he even went insane.

943
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,220
These great books take us out of ourselves.

944
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
That's the point.

945
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,220
Second, on the exam results,

946
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,220
it is true that we have to teach children to read.

947
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,220
This cannot be an accident.

948
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,220
Finally, the one place America has made progress,

949
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,220
the one place,

950
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,220
is that we now take seriously teaching phonics,

951
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
phonemic awareness, right?

952
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
The mechanics of reading.

953
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
The problem is,

954
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,220
we often do it with meaningless texts, right?

955
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,220
Texts about nothing.

956
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,220
So we sacrifice the opportunity to learn content

957
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,220
while we're teaching reading.

958
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,220
But we've managed to fragment that knowledge base,

959
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,220
so they learn the mechanics of reading,

960
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,220
but by the time they are 12, 13 years old,

961
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,220
their reading results begin to decline,

962
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,220
because the knowledge isn't there.

963
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,220
In mathematics, there's a huge war going on.

964
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,220
How to teach math?

965
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,220
The Chinese have one way, which seems to work.

966
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,220
It's a dispute.

967
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,220
Japanese start by being quite constructivist,

968
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,220
but then very old-fashioned in the high school.

969
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,220
It's a complicated story.

970
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,220
So I would say, on your question,

971
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,220
there are technical answers to how to teach

972
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,220
the basic fundamental skill,

973
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,220
but they do not undermine the greater argument for content.

974
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:10,220
And by the way, in Russia and Hungary before the revolution,

975
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,220
math education was very strong, right?

976
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,220
Russia did, compared to America,

977
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,220
the results were much better.

978
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,220
So nothing is perfect,

979
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,220
but it was, you know, the United States would be envious

980
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,220
of Soviet Russian mathematics.

981
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,220
Other questions, please.

982
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,220
Don't be shy.

983
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,220
Yes, there's a question over there.

984
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,220
Good morning.

985
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,220
Good morning.

986
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,220
Thank you for your talk.

987
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,220
My name is Marian.

988
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,220
I'm from the Philippines,

989
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,220
but I'm now doing my PhD in Italy,

990
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,220
and I'd like to ask about,

991
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,220
I grew up learning the canon,

992
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,220
primarily in American educational systems,

993
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,220
so we grew up very Anglo-American.

994
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,220
How do you reconcile this?

995
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,220
And I do agree that learning canon, learning Dante, Shakespeare

996
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,220
is very important in developing the sensibility,

997
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,220
this idea of ethics and aesthetics,

998
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,220
but how do we also reconcile this colonial legacy

999
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,220
and, you know, we do not replicate colonial forms of imperialism

1000
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,220
or cognitive imperialism?

1001
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Yeah.

1002
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:32,220
In my view, if a text is a slave to its context,

1003
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,220
it's not worth reading, right?

1004
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:40,220
The reason Nelson Mandela chose Sophocles is not, of course,

1005
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,220
because Sophocles was dead or white or male.

1006
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,220
He chose Sophocles because he could have chosen anything.

1007
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,220
He was in prison,

1008
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,220
he was facing what he thought would be a lifetime in prison,

1009
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,220
and the question was,

1010
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,220
what would be the play that he would put on

1011
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,220
with his fellow inmates, right, in the jail in South Africa?

1012
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,220
He could have chosen a story by South African,

1013
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,220
African-American, he could have chosen anything.

1014
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,220
He chose Sophocles because he found in that text

1015
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:18,220
more difficult, powerful, truthful, disturbing,

1016
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,220
thinking about what mattered, right,

1017
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:26,220
about power, families, despotism, nations,

1018
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,220
religious faith, courage.

1019
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:34,220
So I believe that there are great texts from many, many places,

1020
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,220
many traditions, many languages.

1021
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,220
It is a great shame in the United States

1022
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,220
that we almost never read things in translation, right?

1023
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:47,220
If it's not in English, oh my God, right?

1024
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,220
As if most of the world's literature doesn't exist.

1025
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:58,220
So I think the test of reading a text is,

1026
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,220
is it overwhelmed by its political context?

1027
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,220
Is it a work of imperialism first and last?

1028
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,220
Then why read it, right?

1029
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,220
If it is a work worth reading,

1030
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,220
it is innerly liberating for all humanity

1031
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,220
because it asks universal questions.

1032
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
That's my point about Kennedy, right?

1033
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:25,220
If you do not think that there are books, poems, art, music

1034
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,220
that speak to all of us, all of us,

1035
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,220
then you have given up on the humanities.

1036
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,220
You've given up on the idea of humanitas,

1037
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:40,220
of the idea that we are all finally more in common

1038
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,220
than we are different.

1039
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,220
The American metaphor used to be the melting pot, right?

1040
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,220
We would all become American.

1041
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,220
Today it's called the salad bowl.

1042
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,220
This is a Californian idiocy, right?

1043
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
Because if you think about it,

1044
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,220
the idea of the salad bowl is somehow

1045
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,220
that you both are yourself and not yourself.

1046
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,220
It makes no sense, in fact, in educational terms.

1047
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:11,220
So I think the best answer to your question

1048
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:18,220
is simply, are you educated by reading this text?

1049
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:22,220
Or is it simply an affirmation of an ideology,

1050
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,220
of a political point of view, of a piece of race,

1051
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,220
in which case, no, it does not pass,

1052
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:32,220
and it should not be read in school?

1053
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,220
Other questions?

1054
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:40,220
Question, one more, thank you.

1055
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,220
Good morning.

1056
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,220
Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.

1057
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,220
Thank you for you.

1058
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,220
I have found it a little difficult to...

1059
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,220
No, good morning again.

1060
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,220
My name is Balbona Natanahili, from Albania.

1061
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,220
Thank you for your great speech.

1062
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,220
Very wonderful, fantastic.

1063
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,220
I have a question.

1064
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:14,220
One of the most sentences that I took with myself

1065
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,220
is education is not about flattering different cultures.

1066
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,220
And I agree.

1067
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:24,220
This means that we need to have some values

1068
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:28,220
that we have to keep strong in our education.

1069
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:32,220
And as a teacher, we have to specify

1070
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,220
what these values are.

1071
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,220
In the gate of the schools, we have everyday different groups

1072
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,220
with different values that knock at our doors

1073
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:49,220
and ask to introduce in the curriculum their values.

1074
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,220
And I found it very difficult to resist,

1075
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,220
especially if the education has not enough money,

1076
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:00,220
is not enough strong to make those resistance.

1077
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:04,220
So, any comments or suggestions?

1078
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:08,220
First of all, not all values are valuable.

1079
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,220
Not all values are valuable.

1080
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:14,220
Just because I think well of myself

1081
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,220
does not mean that I should be flattered.

1082
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,220
Just because I am Jewish does not...

1083
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,220
I am Jewish does not mean that I should only read Jewish texts,

1084
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,220
or texts written by Jewish authors.

1085
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:31,220
I would be very angry if a teacher said to me,

1086
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:36,220
I am not only going to read texts about Jewish identity.

1087
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:40,220
This would seem to me to be a fundamental betrayal.

1088
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:44,220
The director of schools in the city I live in

1089
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,220
is African American, Sonja Sontalisis.

1090
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:52,220
And she said to me, the challenge of education

1091
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:57,220
is that it must be both mirrors and windows.

1092
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:02,220
I remember, yes, of the identity of African American children

1093
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:08,220
in Baltimore, because in the case of those African Americans

1094
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,220
in Baltimore, there has been a history of racism and suffering,

1095
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,220
which they are entitled to learn about.

1096
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:18,220
This has impacted their lives.

1097
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:24,220
But her important point is, if you stop there, it's hopeless.

1098
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,220
Then you simply reproduce the image of suffering.

1099
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,220
On the contrary, they must be introduced to the world,

1100
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,220
to the horizon beyond Baltimore,

1101
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,220
to the texts that come from far away places

1102
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:40,220
and distant worlds and different imaginations.

1103
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,220
So we have to be very careful

1104
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:47,220
of the narcissism of individual differences.

1105
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:52,220
Very careful about the idea that because all of us look different

1106
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,220
and we come from different places,

1107
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,220
that the education has to be about each one differently.

1108
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,220
No, we have differences.

1109
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,220
We live with our families, with our friends.

1110
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,220
We can live those differences.

1111
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:09,220
But education, if you believe in the humanities,

1112
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,220
is about what it means to be human.

1113
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:17,220
And that education is for everybody, or it is nothing at all.

1114
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,220
Thank you.

1115
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,220
Thank you.
