00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, yeah, thank you everyone, thanks for coming, well it's a great pleasure to do this

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
all together today, make up your blog, and while your blog is busy, that's part of most

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
of the other state activities here in the U.S. that you want to discuss in the future,

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
you know, and well, if you can use original contract, I'm looking at your blog, it's

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
in the U.K. of the United States, he's, he got his beauty in Harvard University,

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
and then he was in Cambridge, and eventually he ended up as a professor in England,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
he's a professor since 1987.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
I will not go through his very long career, okay, there's a very large number of papers

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
and models, I'll just say he's a, well, he's a fellow of the American Geo-society,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
and of the science, the society where he's here, and he's also a tournament scouser

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
in the University of Oxford here in Bruce, an University of the U.S.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, again, I'll not go through all of these, but he is an extraordinary person,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
but I must say without any doubt, he's one of the people who know more about

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
the issue of thermodynamics.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
He's probably a local, so I go out, and he's a, he's a good person to have in here

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
who's going to give a talk in front of him, well, he's a general talk, so I hope you will

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
join about, about the mission of the organization and the topic that we will go on a lot

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
and that will be very easy for you to do.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
So, I don't know what to say, of course.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Thank you, Damian.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
So, it's a great pleasure to be at IFISC again.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I was here some 12 years ago for an extended period invited by Manuel Matias,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
and I enjoyed that visit as well as this one, of course.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
So, thank you for hosting me.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
So, I was asked to give a general talk about spatial acquisition.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
This is a topic that I started working on since my last visit to IFISC.

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
So, this will not be a repetition in case there are any people who were here 12 years ago.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
So, I'm going to start by giving some examples of spatial localized structures

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
and explain the origins of these structures, kind of in hand-waving terms.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
And then I will describe a mathematical model which captures a lot of the behavior

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
that is seen in the experiment.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
And then I will extend the theory a little bit to two dimensions and more.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
And I'll mention in particular some examples from fluid mechanics,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
which I think are very interesting.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
And in fact, it was fluid mechanics that got me interested in spatial localization in the first place.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
So, let's start with some simple examples of localized structures.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So, this is an example of buckling.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
This is the kind of experiment that you can do in your bathroom.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
It's not a very perfect experiment, but you get the idea is that you take a cylinder and you compress it.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
And it doesn't, you know, if you don't compress it too much, it will just compress partially.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
And in a numerical simulation of this process, you see that it buckles along the mid-secumference, as you can see here.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
You can see these cellular structures form that resemble these kinds of structures that you see in the experiment.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
So, how does one think about these kinds of structures?

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, here is the way that people who work in dynamical systems would think about this.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
So, on the vertical axis, I have a parameter that I'm varying.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
This is the load that I apply to the cylinder.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
And on the horizontal axis is the response of the system to that load.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
In other words, how much does it contract?

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
And what you see here is that the onset of linear instability occurs somewhere over here.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So, this is where the perfect cylinder first starts to buckle.

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
And from this point, there is a branch of stationary, steady solutions, which are all partially buckled.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
And they go along here and go through this kind of a curve.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So, let me explain in a few words what happens along this curve.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
So, this blue curve represents an unstable equilibrium.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
If I perturb the cylinder to the right of this blue curve, then it's just going to collapse.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
So, this is a marginal state.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
But what is interesting about this marginal state, if I follow it as a function of the applied load that it turns around here.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
And at this point, I can increase the load and my partially buckled cylinder will support that load.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
So, it gains some strength up to some point where an increase in load makes it collapse a little more.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
And then I can load it up some more like this and then it'll collapse again and so on.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
So, you get this sequence of partially collapsed states and what they look like is something like this.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
So, this is the unloaded cylinder.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So, this is the vertical direction.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
This is the circumference.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
What you see is this band of cells along the mid perimeter.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And when you go from A to this region, you will have four rows of these cells.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
When you go from here to B, you will have six rows of these cells.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And these are examples of partially buckled states or spatial localized structures.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
The reason they are spatial localized is because the cylinder here is not buckled.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
It's not buckled here.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
It's just buckled in some region.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm going to give you some more examples with the same flavor.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So, here is an example of a ferrofluid experiment.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
So, you take a petri dish and you fill it with a suspension of very small magnetic dark holes.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Held in suspension by surfactant.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
And then you apply a normal vertical magnetic field.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Stationary time independent DC magnetic field.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
And what happens is initially the surfaces just remain flat.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Modulate these end effects which I'm not going to talk about.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
But then when the strength of the magnetic field becomes too strong,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
the whole surface of the fluid buckles into a hexagonal pattern.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And that occurs at this value of the applied magnetic field.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So, the system jumps to a new state.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It's a state of hexagonal peaks.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And as you increase the magnetic field, there are any defects here.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And up here you have almost perfect hexagonal structure.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
And then when you decrease the magnetic field, the hexagonal structure remains.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
The height of the peaks decreases.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
And here they collapse back to the flat interface.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
So, you have a system here with a large hysteresis loop.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And it's these hysteresis loops that are very interesting to me.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Because within those hysteresis loops, in some range of parameters,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
you can do the following experiment that's shown here.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
What you can do is you can bring the bar magnet to the surface.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You pull out a peak.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
The bar magnet pulls out a peak.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
You remove the bar magnet.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
And the peak, instead of falling back into the flat interface, remains sitting there.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
That's very counterintuitive.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So now that you've done it once, you can do it again.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You can bring the bar magnet to another region of the fluid.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
You pull out a peak.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
You remove the bar magnet and the peak remains.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And you can do this many times.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
And when you do that many times, you get a sequence of individual peaks

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
that just sit there in equilibrium.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
These are indicated by this sequence of dots,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
each dot corresponding to a different number of peaks.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
So you have one peak, two peaks there.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
And these peaks can form clumps, bound states.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And this is from another experiment, a more recent experiment.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
And you see these kind of patches of hexagons,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
where the hexagons are confined to some region.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And outside, there is no displacement,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
essentially no displacement of the interface.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
So I'm going to talk about these kinds of structures.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So a lot of people here are interested in vegetation patterns.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
So I can't resist showing some examples.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
These are also associated with what's called a subcritical instability.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And the reason is the following.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
If I imagine that I have a plant growing in some region,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
then the plant may have extended roots in the horizontal direction

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
and the roots take up moisture, of course,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
and prevent the growth of the plant to the side.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
So this is a mechanism for preferring the plant that's already there.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
That's the notion of subcritical instability.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Alternatively, in various deserts, and we have these deserts in California,

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
you may have a situation where the surface of the desert

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
is covered by a kind of biofilm, a crust, which is essentially impermeable.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And if it does happen to rain, then any water that's collected

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
will run into regions where the crust is broken

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
and it's broken exactly where plants are, right?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
So this gives you another mechanism for positive feedback,

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
whereby the existence of plants, you know,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
leads to the collection of water

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and therefore enhances the growth of those plants.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
So these are the basic mechanisms believed to be responsible

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
for many types of vegetation structures,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
including these remarkable so-called fairy circles.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
This is from Namibia, an aerial picture.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
This is a region that's covered by bush.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
But the bush is broken by these little bare circles,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
typically four kilometers across.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
And you can see that there's more growth

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
around the boundary of the circle

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
because there is less competition for water.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Half of the region is dry and there is no water collected.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
So it's believed that these types of mechanisms

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
are responsible for the presence of these kinds of localized structures.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Now localized structures can be dynamic,

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
and this is from an old experiment from Harry Sweeney's lab in Austin, in Texas.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
You take, again, a Petri dish.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
You fill it with very small brass beads,

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
and then you vibrate the dish up and down

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
with a certain frequency and a certain amplitude.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And if you do it in the right range of parameters,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
you can get structures which oscillate up and down.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
So for a while it's a peak,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
and then one period of the forcing is a crater.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
It's a subharmonic instability.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
The interesting thing about this structure is that it's localized in state.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And this is created in the same sort of way

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
as in that ferrofluid experiment that I mentioned earlier.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
This is what it looks like in reflected light.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So this is the peak that I showed you at one period.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
One period of the forcing later it forms a crater,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
and then it goes back to a peak.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So it's an oscillation between these two states.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
This is what it looks like from the side.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
These things can also form bound structures,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
like these bound states of a peak and a crater.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
One period later the peak becomes a crater,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
the crater becomes a peak.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
They oscillate out of phase like this and remain bound.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And you can get chains of these structures.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
You can get these kind of molecules with one peak,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
three craters.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
A period later you have a crater surrounded by three peaks.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
There are a lot of different structures, of course,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
that can be made in two dimensions.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
This is a nice example from the lab of Hans-Gerl Provence in Münster.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
He takes two electrodes and partially evacuates the region between them.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
It fills it with different types of gas.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
And then he puts a voltage difference across the electrodes.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
If the voltage difference is large enough,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
you get electrical breakdown,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
meaning that you get current filaments

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
shorting the gap between the electrodes.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And of course that radiates,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
and so you can see the current filaments.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
And this is basically what the experiment is.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And what he finds are the same kinds of structures

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
that we've been talking about.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
You can get a stationary hexagonal pattern,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
like the pattern of peaks in the ferrofluid experiment,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
that I mentioned.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
You can get a structure of these current filaments

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
where the current filaments are not stationary,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
but move around in complicated ways.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
And so the analogy might be that this is more like a liquid state

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
as opposed to a crystalline state.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You can get a gas-like state

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
where you have fewer of these structures that are in motion.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But you can also get the sort of chains

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
that we were talking about earlier, networks.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
And you can get states where you have, for example,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
part of the region is solidified or crystallized,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
and some of these current filaments are free to move around

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
in an irregular fashion.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Now what is interesting about a lot of these problems

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
is that, first of all, they behave in a similar way,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
but also that we don't necessarily even know

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
the right equations to describe this.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
This is a very complicated problem.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
The business of the granular media,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
you know the brass beads moving up.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Now we don't have an aviastope equation for granular media.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And so what we would like to be able to do

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
is describe a lot of these structures in some generic way,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
which doesn't depend on the basic physics

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
that's responsible for these different types of behavior

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
that you see here,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
and that captures the common behavior

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
that's exhibited by all these different systems.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Now there are examples of this in fluid mechanics.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Fluid mechanics is nice,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
because I actually know what the equations are.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And so we can study the equations numerically,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and I'll talk about some results that we've obtained.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
So this is an example of what we call convectons.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
These are localized regions of convection.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
And what you see here is a two-dimensional layer

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
of a binary mixture, a lighter and a heavier component

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
that is heated from below.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And in response to the applied heating,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
the heavier component migrates towards the bottom boundary.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
This is a cross-diffusion effect that's called the Sorai effect.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
It's very well known in these types of problems.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And what you see here is the temperature fluctuations

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
about the linear temperature gradient.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
It's hot at the bottom, cold at the top,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
so there's a linear temperature gradient in the background.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
But this shows the region of hot fluid rising

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and cold fluid descendant.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
But as you can see, the convection rows that are set up.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
And the interesting thing here is that the convection

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
doesn't fill the whole domain.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It just fills part of the domain.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
And what is interesting also, like in the examples we saw before,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
is that for the same parameter values,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I can get distinct states.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
All nominal is stable.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So these states are obtained for the same parameter values,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
but they are different.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
In an odd state, I have a descending cold plume,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
rising hot plume on the opposite sides,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
and here I have two rising plumes on the two sides.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
So they're distinct states.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Simultaneously stable.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Just like in that buckling problem,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
we had lots of simultaneously stable,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
partially buckled states.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
And you can get more complicated structures

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
like these turbulent states in couette flow.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
What couette flow is, is a shear flow

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
between two power plates,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
the top plate moving towards you,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
the bottom plate moving away from you.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And you can get structures of localized turbulence,

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
which are inclined relative to the direction of motion of the plates.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
So what do these states have in common?

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Well, they can be found in one, two, and in three dimensions.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I'll talk about some three-dimensional structures at the end.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
They may be stationary.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Most of the examples we've talked about were stationary.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
They can propagate or they can oscillate in place,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
as we saw in the oscillon example.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
They are generated by finite amplitude perturbations.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Like the bar magnet that I bring to the surface to pull out a peak,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
that's a finite amplitude disturbance.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And therefore the structures are fully nonlinear,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and they have to be described by methods

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
which go beyond linear or weakly in nonlinear theory.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And they can, of course, experience a variety of instabilities

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
that lead to splitting, decay, disappearance, propagation,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
or localized complex dynamics, in fact.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
And they form these different types of bound structures

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
that we looked at in the gas-like state

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
that you also saw in the previous slides.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Now, I want to emphasize these things are sometimes called

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
dissipative solitons,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
but they have nothing to do with solitons.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
They are not solutions of integral PDEs.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
They, in fact, have very different interaction rules,

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
and I'll talk about some of those in a moment.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
So here is my kind of toll problem

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
that I think is a very interesting equation.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
It looks deceptively simple,

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
but it captures a lot of the behavior that we've seen.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
And it explains why lots of systems with different physics

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
behave in the same way.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So what is this equation?

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
It's an equation for a scalar field, u, here.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
This is the time derivative of u with respect to time.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
The field depends on space.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
For example, in a plane, this would be x, this would be y.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
It has its fourth order in space,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
and that's important that it's fourth order in space.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
There is a bifurcation parameter like the load,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
for example, when I was crushing my cylinder,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
and then there is a bi-stable nonlinear term

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
with a destabilizing quadratic contribution

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
and a stabilizing cubic contribution.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
So I'm going to call this equation with this FSH23,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
or I can maybe have a destabilizing cubic contribution

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and a stabilizing fifth order contribution.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I'm going to call that equation SH35,

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
SH for St. Holmberg and the 35 for these systems.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
So now we can play the same game that Reinhard Richter played

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
in his ferrofluid experiment.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
What I can do is I can go into a plane here,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
and I can generate the localized finite-empadue disturbance

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
like bringing the bar magnet towards the surface.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
And then if I'm in the right parameter regime,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
and by right parameter regime I'm in the right range of S

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
and the associated range of R,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
an interesting thing happens that the localized perturbation

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
that I've created will relax to a non-zero localized state.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
It won't fade away.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
For example, here I created one perturbation

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and it created this target pattern.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Here I generated a different perturbation, created a spot.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Here I generated a third type of initial perturbation,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
created a hexagonal patch.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
So the same idea, generating different initial finite-empadue disturbances

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
and they relax to different types of localized structures.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
And they're all here sitting simultaneously stable.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So let's try to understand why this might be the case.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
So here is my equation, and just for simplicity,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I've written it in one dimension.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And I've also introduced this Qc, which is a length scale.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It's actually the intrinsic length scale of my crystal

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
that you saw in the previous slides.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
And it's important that it's foreordering space,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
that you have this intrinsic length scale,

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
that you have bistability that comes from this nonlinear term

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
that gives you that hysteresis loop that we saw at the beginning.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
And it helps that it's spatially reversible,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
that you have the symmetry x goes to minus x.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
And it also helps that it has gradient dynamics.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
In other words, the dynamics is boring.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
What this equation means is that the system just evolves always to steady solutions

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
and the steady solutions correspond to a local minima of this functional f

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
that I'm going to refer to as the free energy of the system,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
by analogy with phase transition.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
So in a sense, what I'm going to be talking about is the energy landscape of the system.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
And if I'm going to have multiple local solutions that are linearly stable,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
all of those must correspond to local minima of f.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Of course, there'll be local maxima, there'll be saddle points,

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
the idea is to understand the energy landscape of this functional.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
So this slide is, I guess, probably more for the students,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
but I think it's actually a very important slide,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
probably my most important slide.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
So what I want to do is explain to you the idea of the difference

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
between temporal and spatial dynamics.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
These are different ways of looking at the same problem.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Of course, when I'm interested in temporal dynamics,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I want to know how things evolve in time.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
And what I can do, for example, to find instability of a uniform state,

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
u equals 0, I can perturb that state with some time-dependent perturbation

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
with a growth rate sigma and a spatial scale q.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
That's the usual thing that we all do.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
And then when sigma of particular q is positive,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
you say that q grows in time.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Now, we're interested here in stationary solutions, steady solutions,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
independent of time.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And where are those?

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
Well, those solutions only exist on the curve sigma of q equals 0.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
And I've drawn that curve here, here is that curve.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
So q is horizontally r, the parameter is on the vertical direction.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
In this region, you have instability for some q.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Below the curve, you have no instability.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
So steady solutions only exist on this curve.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
And notice that if I pick this value of r, there are two types of steady solutions,

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
ones with wave number q minus and ones with wave number q plus.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
And as I decrease r towards the onset of instability,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
those two solutions come together and merge.

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
It's a co-lessons of two distinct wave numbers at this critical wave number qc.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
And this is what you would normally call the onset of temporal instability,

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
because it's the minimum of this curve sigma of q.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
And the way we think about this is this is a fourth order problem in space.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
If I put this equal to 0, I have an ODE in four-dimensional phase space.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
And I can look at spatial eigenvalues of u equals 0.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
And there will be four, because it's a fourth of the problem.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
And so when r is greater than this critical value, which is 0,

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
I actually have four eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
This one corresponds to eigenvalue lambda is iq plus, iq minus,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
and then the negative, the complex function.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And the fact that the eigenvalues are on the imaginary axis

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
is a consequence of the spatial versatility I mentioned.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
And then as r decreases towards 0, these two come together at co-lessons.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
You have eigenvalues of double multiplicity on the imaginary axis.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
And then when I go below r equals 0, I have this quartet of eigenvalues,

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
a pair in the unstable positive real part of the complex plane

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
and a pair in the negative real part of the half plane.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
And this is important because now I have a two-dimensional unstable manifold

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
whereby I can leave u equals 0,

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
but I can also return to u equals 0 along the stable manifold span

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
by these two stable eigenvalues.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
And what this looks like in a picture is something like this,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
is that here is u equals 0 as a function of x.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
I'm leaving u equals 0 along those two directions, the unstable eigenvalue.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
And I can also come back and all I have to make sure

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
if I want to generate the nonlinear localized solutions

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
is somehow that these curves connect in the nonlinear regime.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
And without going into details,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
you can do this using multiple scale methods.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
You find that at r equals 0, there is a pair of solutions that appear from u equals 0.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
The reason you have a pair of solutions, in fact more than two,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
is that it's a multiple bifurcation

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
because those spatial wave numbers have co-lessed

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
and leaving you a multiple bifurcation in space,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
not in time, but in space.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And the two solutions are these.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
You have a periodic pattern with some amplitude that goes like the square root of minus r

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
because alpha is negative.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
And then you also have a modulated solution

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
where you have a periodic solution that's modulated in envelope

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
by this sex-like function.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
And here the spatial phase phi is arbitrary.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
You can just translate the pattern as you wish.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
But here I cannot pick any phi

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
because I cannot translate the periodic pattern relative to the envelope

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
by arbitrary amounts.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
I have to pick certain values of phi and only 0 and phi are permitted.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
So this is what we've learned.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
So this is a bifurcation diagram, like the ones we've seen before.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Now the parameter is shown horizontally

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
and the response, the norm of the solutions, is plotted in the vertical direction.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
And at r equals 0, you see that there are lots of branches coming out of there.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
There is the red branch that corresponds to periodic solutions.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's a subcritical instability

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
because that coefficient alpha was negative,

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
so solutions exist for r less than 0.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And so that solution is unstable initially

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
and then it requires stability at the top.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
But you also get the localized solutions.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
They bifurcate simultaneously with the periodic solutions.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
They're also subcritical and also unstable.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
But when they reach this shaded region, they start oscillating back and forth.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Here the heavy line indicates stable solutions.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
And so you can see that in this region,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
the localized solutions have required stability

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
and moreover, you can get a very large multiplicity of simultaneous with stable states.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
And of course, the ones you will see will depend on how you do the experiment.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
The word you put your magnet.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
That depends on what kind of initial disturbance you are applying.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And what is the difference between these states?

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So L0 have a peak in the middle.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And you can see that as I follow L0 like this,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
the structure gradually grows and extends,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
spatial extent.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
L pi solutions are similar, but they have a dip in the middle.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
And so we call this kind of structure,

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
the snakes and ladder structure of this region of localized states.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
And the ladders, or the rungs of the ladder at these states here,

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
they correspond to asymmetrical solutions.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
For example, you know, if you start with a solution,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
it's a peak in the middle on the L0 branch,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
and you go to state two, it becomes asymmetrical.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
You can see then it becomes again more asymmetrical.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
And then at the far end, it emerges as a solution with a dip in the middle.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
And so it lies on the L pi branch.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
These states are all unstable.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Now, if you do this for a single peak, as I've just done,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
then you can also do it for pairs of peaks, right?

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
And you get the same sort of snaking until you fill the domain.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
You can do it for these bound states.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
So here is a bound state of two single peak structures.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And they lie on a figurate isola.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
These lie in that shaded region.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
If I have a two-peak state, they lie on this kind of figurate solution.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
These ones lie on this figurate solution and so on.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
The isolas depend on the separation of the structures.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
So here I am changing the separation between these states.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
And you can see that the isola depends on that separation.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
There's a lot of possible solutions that you can get in that shaded region.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
In fact, you can get more.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
You can get solutions which are bound states of similar structures,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
like this structure with one peak, two peaks.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
At this location, by the time you get to here, you have three peaks and two peaks.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
So this one has grown. This one hasn't.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
When you go from two to one, this one remains the same.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
This one grows and so on.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
There's a huge variety of different solutions inside the shaded region.

30:33.000 --> 30:48.000
So I'd like now to tell you why this region might support this great variety of different solutions.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
And I'm going to do it by analogy with what you know about phase transitions.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
So what I'm drawing here is my parameter. You can think of that as temperature.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
And here is the response of the system.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And so this is the periodic state.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
Remember, it was unstable. It became stable at the fold.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
And there is a parameter value here at which the periodic state actually has the same energy as the homogeneous state.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
So this is what in thermodynamics you would call a Maxwell point.

31:21.000 --> 31:30.000
And I want to make use of that analogy to understand why we can get lots of different structures in that shaded region of parameter space.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
So imagine in the middle here that I'm plotting the density as a function of space.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
And I'm doing it at the critical temperature.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
For example, think of this as a liquid and this as gas.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
So the liquid has higher density. This has lower density.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
Then in the absence of surface tension, I can put any number of interfaces in there.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It doesn't cost me anything.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
So I can get very complicated states.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
Now if I change the temperature, for example, I increase the temperature above critical where what happens?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Then the liquid wants to evaporate and that means that this front is going to move in.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
This one is going to move in and eventually the drop is going to disappear.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
So there's no steady solution.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
No steady solution when I change the temperature away from critical temperature.

32:21.000 --> 32:30.000
If I decrease the temperature, then of course I have condensation and so the fronts are going to move in the opposite direction and the drop is going to grow.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
So that's the thing I want to bear in mind.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
But now I want to think about what happens if I don't have coexistence between two homogeneous phases like the gas and the liquid phases.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
But instead let's say I have a liquid and I have a solid, a crystal structure, a medium.

32:49.000 --> 32:59.000
Then things change and they change in an important way and that was originally recognized by Yves Poivre long time ago.

32:59.000 --> 33:10.000
You have a front here that you're trying to get to move but this front is pinned to the potential of the heterogeneity behind it and so it's not free to move.

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
You have to change the temperature by a finite amount before that front can move and for example the crystal can invade the liquid.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
We call that crystallization.

33:21.000 --> 33:31.000
And inside that region generated by this pinning potential, that's where all the localized states exist that I've been talking about.

33:31.000 --> 33:39.000
There's a mathematical way of thinking about this and some of you may prefer that even though this is a physics institute, right?

33:39.000 --> 33:45.000
So I mean four dimensions, right?

33:45.000 --> 33:54.000
It's a spatial way of looking at things and it turns out that this equation has a spatial Hamiltonian.

33:54.000 --> 34:06.000
So there's a conserved quantity so I can go from four to three and then I can look at the wavelength one map that takes me from three to two and so I can draw things in two dimensions.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
And so here is the fixed point that corresponds to the homogeneous state.

34:10.000 --> 34:19.000
Here is the fixed point that corresponds to the periodic state that corresponds to the fixed point under this wavelength one map.

34:19.000 --> 34:29.000
And these are all associated with stable and unstable manifolds because as I showed you we have some stable eigenvalues, some unstable eigenvalues.

34:29.000 --> 34:39.000
And what you see here for example at the fold here is that I have a tangency between the unstable manifold of this point and the stable manifold of this point.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
And then when I cross inside the shaded region which is this region here, I have transversal intersections as you can see here.

34:46.000 --> 34:58.000
And the unstable manifold of the homogeneous state actually has to intersect the stable manifold of the homogeneous state along the line that corresponds to the fixed point subspace.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
So the reflection symmetry x goes to minus.

35:02.000 --> 35:10.000
And so this point here, run backwards, goes back to the homogeneous state, run this way, goes to the homogeneous state.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
So it's a localized solution.

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
And you can also see those asymmetric solutions, they also have to form the same mechanism.

35:20.000 --> 35:31.000
And they all accumulate, as you see from this heterogeneic tango, they all accumulate on the periodic orbit as this black dot over here.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
So that's what happens in that shaded region is you have these transversal intersections of stable and stable.

35:38.000 --> 35:47.000
And one way to think about this is in terms of fronts, and this is a front that connects the homogeneous state to the periodic solution.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
This is another front of the same time. This one is stable, this one is unstable.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
You put two of these back to back, you get state one, it's an unstable state.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
You put two of these back to back, you get a stable state.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
And if you do one of each, you're going to get an unstable, wrong state.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
And I just want to say a couple words about the wavelength selection in that shaded region.

36:09.000 --> 36:19.000
As I vary my parameter R, the wavelength can change across that of the periodic oscillations, the localized periodic oscillations,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
because there's no boundaries.

36:21.000 --> 36:31.000
And the wavelength that is selected, as you can see here, is the wavelength determined by the requirement that this spatial Hamiltonian is conserved.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
That spatial Hamiltonian contains the homogeneous state and the periodic solution,

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
and any connection between those two has to lie in the level set H equals zero of this Hamiltonian.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
So we understand some things about this.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.000
If I go outside of this pinning region, right, so the pinning region has to straddle the Maxwell point, which is this dash dotted line,

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
I can either go this way or this way outside, then of course I have no localized stationary solutions,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
and instead I have dynamical solutions.

37:02.000 --> 37:10.000
And here is an example, space, time increasing upwards of what happens if I go to the right of the pinning region.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
In the region to the right, the state that has lowest energy is the periodic state,

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
and the system approaches a periodic state through a sequence of nucleations that generate new wavelengths on either side.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
And so this is an example of a stable state, a periodic state invading another stable state,

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
but the periodic state has lower energy, so it's preferred.

37:32.000 --> 37:40.000
And you can develop some theory to understand what is the frequency of nucleation events as a function of the parameter, and so on.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
And the same sort of thing happens if you go to the other side where the preferred state is the homogeneous state,

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
and so the periodic structure eventually disappears through these annihilation events.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
Now in 2D things are more interesting, of course,

37:56.000 --> 38:03.000
and so I just want to say a few words about, so this is now x and y, not time but y,

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
and I had a localized structure, a localized region of stripes,

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
and the front here was unstable to a y-dependent perturbation,

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
and that deepened the front so that eventually the whole region is taken over by a hexagonal pattern.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
But that doesn't have to happen.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
In a different region, the hexagons only invade inward, and you generate a localized patch of hexagons like this,

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
or in another region you can get structures where the front's deepened and send out these fingers,

38:34.000 --> 38:42.000
which then buckle because the wavelength that is selected by this kind of moving front is not the equilibrium wavelength.

38:42.000 --> 38:49.000
And so the system then relaxes to what would be the equilibrium wavelength, subsequent to the passage of the front.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
And this is the same sort of thing for the 3.5Ks, you can get these kind of finger structures.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
Here is a labyrinthine pattern that is generated by this dynamical evolution,

38:59.000 --> 39:06.000
the moving front between the homogeneous and structured state.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
A couple words about how these structures might be connected, I think this is quite interesting.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
So this dot here, mu is minus r, so this red dot corresponds to a state like this,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
norm in the vertical direction.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
If I follow this in one direction, it's going to follow the state up to this red dot here,

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
and what you see here is that these fingers have grown out.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
These are the steady solutions of the Swift-Holbert equation, 3.5.1.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
If I follow the red dot in the opposite direction, it generates this kind of structure.

39:39.000 --> 39:46.000
And what you see here is that these dots here or the spots reconnect horizontally

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
and create these stripes as the front moves away from the central region.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
So these kinds of structures and these kind of structures are actually on the same solution branch of the Swift-Holbert equation,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
which is quite interesting.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
And then you get all these kinds of interconnections that I talked about, there's many more of them in 2D.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
You can get lots of isolas of these checkerboard structures.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
You can get structures that have this kind of lozenge appearance.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
You have fronts which are pinned because of the oscillation behind them.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
And they're also pinned here because of the gradient in the wave number due to the curved interface.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
And then you have these things which we've called worms, which are very strange things.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
And if people here are interested in PDEs, you might ask, you know, what's happening here at that point?

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
It's not a singularity because the PDE doesn't permit.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Old steady solutions?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Old steady? No. Well, some are stable.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
I don't know whether specifically these ones are stable.

40:50.000 --> 41:00.000
But as you go along here, the stability changes at falls in the same sort of way.

41:00.000 --> 41:09.000
But I think it's very interesting that you form these kinds of structures that have these cusp behavior.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
It's not understood at all why this might be possible.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I just want to say a few words.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
So this is an attempt to draw in parameter space.

41:18.000 --> 41:25.000
So this is R now, and this is the coefficient of the quadratic term for SH23 squared.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
You know, where the different kinds of localized structures are.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
I want to say a few words about the hexagons here.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
So this shows the snaking branch of hexagonal structures.

41:38.000 --> 41:49.000
And what you see that at point one here, what you see is a hexagonal patch like some of the things we saw in earlier pictures.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
When I go from one to two, I've nucleated a cell in the middle of each phase.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
When I go from two to three, I nucleate new solutions on either side, but I'm still missing the corners.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
And when I get to four, I actually generated a full patch so the process can repeat.

42:07.000 --> 42:18.000
So there's a very regular ordered way whereby these structures grow as you quasi-statically vary the parameter or temperature or whatever you want to call it.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
And here is a situation with these kind of stripe-like states.

42:23.000 --> 42:34.000
The small oscillations here correspond to adding cells along each row, and then each big row is associated with these large-scale excursions.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
So let me go back to now fluid mechanics, because time is running.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
So you've seen this picture, these odd and even convectons.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
I want to show you how they're generated in the fluid problem.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
So here is space, because I have a layer, so I'm just looking at what happens at mid-level.

42:53.000 --> 43:00.000
I just want to see what the temperature looks like at mid-level, and I'm plotting it at a sequence of successive times.

43:00.000 --> 43:07.000
And what you see here is that the initial state is a kind of spatial-temporal complex state,

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
but that state undergoes a focusing instability you can see over here.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
And after some further time, this solution is not a stationary solution of the system,

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
but in fact it evolves by that same erosion of wavelengths that we saw in the Svthomberg equation.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
It collapses back into the chaotic state, and then, of course, that's unstable to the focusing instability, and so the process repeats.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
And it generates this kind of relaxation time trace.

43:38.000 --> 43:47.000
We have the chaotic state, here is the focusing instability, here is the erosion of the structure, and the process repeats.

43:47.000 --> 43:59.000
And now you change the parameter from 1774 to 1775, and now the solution remains as far as you know forever.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
Here is that focusing instability, it's generated the structure, suppressed oscillations outside,

44:04.000 --> 44:14.000
and all the heat now is transported through this hole, if you like, through this layer that's been self-generated by this focusing instability.

44:14.000 --> 44:23.000
And so this is the bifurcation diagram. This is a measure of the temperature difference across the system.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
Here is the response of the system, it's the heat transported.

44:27.000 --> 44:35.000
Here was that primary instability that generated the chaotic state, and here is the appearance of the localized solution,

44:35.000 --> 44:43.000
stationary stable, numerically stable localized solutions that I just showed you, and notice they are inside this hysteresis loop.

44:43.000 --> 44:51.000
They coexist with spatially extended, you know, more or less standard convection.

44:51.000 --> 45:01.000
I've separated the odd and even structures, just so you can see, and I'm going to compare the solutions at these successive points.

45:01.000 --> 45:13.000
For the odd ones, you can see that I'm picking up heavier material from below like this, and then I'm picking up lighter material from above,

45:13.000 --> 45:23.000
because the rolls at the two ends rotate in the same direction, and so I have actually like a little pump that picks up stuff from one side and deposits it on the other side.

45:23.000 --> 45:30.000
And then the direction of the pump changes when I go from A to C, because I've added rolls in the opposite direction at each end,

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
and so the pumping now is in the opposite direction.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
And if I have an even state, then of course the rolls are in opposite directions at the two ends,

45:39.000 --> 45:46.000
so they either pick up the heavier stuff from the bottom, or they pick up the lighter stuff from above.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
If I go outside that pinning region, I get behavior that's indistinguishable from the Swigfumberg equation, yet this is Navier-Stokes.

45:54.000 --> 46:03.000
Structure grows by the successive nucleation events that you saw earlier.

46:03.000 --> 46:17.000
I want to say a few words about collisions of these things, because they are one of the things that distinguishes the local structures that we've been talking about from solitons.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
And so the way we do that is as follows. We take the three-fold Swigfumberg equation, and we add a quadratic term.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Why do we do that? We do it for two reasons.

46:27.000 --> 46:38.000
One is that the quadratic term breaks the gradient structure of the system, so structures can now move, but also that it breaks the symmetry U goes to minus U.

46:38.000 --> 46:51.000
And that means that structures that were kept fixed stationary by diagonal reflection, you know, left, right, up, down, those solutions are no longer exist, they won't exist anymore,

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
and therefore whatever takes their place has to move.

46:55.000 --> 47:04.000
Because it messes up my beautiful diagram, but you have lots of possible stable solutions that you can pick up that are now moving.

47:04.000 --> 47:12.000
They have the solutions that were odd solutions, odd parity solutions, when epsilon was zero.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
And so here I've taken two of those solutions back to back, and I collide them.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
And notice that it's a very inelastic collision, right?

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Stick and form a different localized solution.

47:24.000 --> 47:31.000
I can take different solutions, you know, the different structures that are moving and they stick,

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
or I can take solutions that move in the same direction, the skinny ones travel more rapidly than the fat ones,

47:37.000 --> 47:45.000
and so they catch up and eventually they form a moving localized solution over here.

47:45.000 --> 47:54.000
Here I have a collision with a stationary even solution, and I call this an attractive solution because the fronts here are of opposite type,

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
down here, up here, and that leads to attraction between these structures.

47:59.000 --> 48:09.000
If I have the same front on both sides that leads to repulsion, and you can see that this little guy hits this one, and then the whole thing moves to the right.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
So we can do the same thing in fluid mechanics with these convectons.

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
The way we do that is we have to change the boundary conditions at the top, so they are now different from those at the bottom.

48:20.000 --> 48:30.000
For example, we can allow Newton's law of cooling to allow temperature heat to escape from the top boundary.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
That's a nice, physically realizable way of doing this.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
And if we do that, the even solutions remain stationary, just as in the previous suit Hombra example,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and the solutions that were odd are now moving.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
After all, Navier-Stokes is not a gradient system, right?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
And so I can play the same game.

48:48.000 --> 48:55.000
So here I've taken two solutions with identical solutions with opposite speed,

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
and I collide them and they glue in the same sort of way as in the Sweden-Homberg equation.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
It's a little more complicated because their waves generated is not a gradient system, as I mentioned,

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
but it behaves in a somewhat similar way.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Here I have a stationary solution that's being hit by a moving one.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
And notice that the two fronts are opposite, so this is an attractive solution,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
and you can see these are coming together.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
It's an asymmetric collision, a lot of radiation, but eventually you get a local solution.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
Here I have a repulsive interaction.

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
This was a stationary solution that's being pushed to the right by the proximity of this guy.

49:36.000 --> 49:46.000
The two fronts are the same at both ends, but eventually they glue again as in the Sweden-Homberg example.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
How much time do I have?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Five more minutes.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Five more minutes?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Okay.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I'll just show a little movie.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So we can do this also in three dimensions.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
So this is an example of a convecting system in a porous medium.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Same sort of system, heated from below.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
You have a mixture of a lighter and a heavier component.

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
The Navier-Stokes equation is simplified because it's a porous medium, and then we solve these equations.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
And of course the bifurcation diagram is a little worse, as you might imagine.

50:21.000 --> 50:28.000
But basically what we do through dynamical simulations, we find the localized solution that is not a steady solution.

50:28.000 --> 50:35.000
It's not an equilibrium solution, but the system poses at this kind of solution.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
Then we can converge it, and then we can follow that solution in the parameter space.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
And so this hopefully will work.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
And what you should see here is a green dot,

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
marching along here, and on this panel you see the structures that are following that correspond to the location of the green dot.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
So this is not temporal evolution.

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
This is just a sequence of steady equilibrium solution of the PDE that I had on the previous slide.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
And you can see these three-dimensional structures growing.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
They form this kind of...

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
A periodic horizontal, but of course non-trivial in the vertical direction.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
Well, we have no mass flux and fixed temperature.

51:30.000 --> 51:36.000
So the mass flux boundary condition is like a boundary condition in concentration.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
And it's no slip.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
So what's basically happening here is that the solution is trying to find that spatially extended state,

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
that fills the whole domain, but it's having a hard time.

51:51.000 --> 51:58.000
And it's not actually clear in this problem that he ever finds a periodic solution that fills the whole domain.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
Because you follow it and it just keeps moving in and out like this,

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
and it forms these bizarre shapes that people have never seen in convection, as far as I know.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
But these are all steady solutions of that system.

52:15.000 --> 52:22.000
And many are stable if you impose some reflection symmetry that we know.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
Okay, last thing I want to mention is same things occur in plain coed flow.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
So remember that shear flow that I showed you at the beginning with one plate going towards you,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
one plate going away from you.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
What you see here are periodic array vortices.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So this is a top view.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
These periodic array vortices would fill the whole domain.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
But they're also localized solutions.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
They're localized in the transverse direction.

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
And this is what it looks like in a vertical cross section through that system.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
You can see these vortices.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And there are two of them.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
These ones travel because one of them closer to one of the boundary than to the other boundary.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
So they travel partly with the boundary.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
These ones have diagonal symmetry.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
So they're stationary.

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
And they do the same kind of snaking, the same cross links that you saw in the Swift-Holmberg equation.

53:20.000 --> 53:27.000
And to me, this is really interesting because these kinds of shear flow problems have been studied for more than 100 years.

53:27.000 --> 53:35.000
And it's only taken this way of looking at these problems to try to look for new types of solutions in these very, very old problems.

53:35.000 --> 53:44.000
They go back to Rayleigh and all the famous fluid machinations from the end of the 19th, early 20th century.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
So here are my conclusions.

53:46.000 --> 53:59.000
So I've shown you that the growth process of these stationary localized structures in dissipative systems have lots of rules whereby they grow in size,

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
whereby their stability changes and how they interact.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
These things are independent of the physics.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
But they're captured by this Swift-Holmberg model in a very effective way.

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
So much so that, for example, I could make predictions based on the Swift-Holmberg model for the collision, for example.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
And they worked out very well in a much more complicated Navier-Stokes system.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
And you might ask, how is that even possible?

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
Because the Swift-Holmberg has nothing to do with fluid mechanics.

54:32.000 --> 54:45.000
And the reason this works is because the structures I'm talking about are robust in the sense that they are there because of transverse intersections

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
between stable and unstable manifolds in the spatial dynamics description of the system.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
And of course, if you have transverse intersections of stable and stable manifolds, you can't unhook those.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
You can change parameters and they're still transverse intersections.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
You can add an extra term and you still have a transverse intersection.

55:02.000 --> 55:09.000
So you can change not just parameters, you can change equations and these structures are still there.

55:09.000 --> 55:19.000
So that doesn't have anything to do with physics per se, but it's a good mathematical model for understanding the robustness of the behavior that I described.

55:19.000 --> 55:29.000
It was useful for me to use the variation of the gradient structure of the dynamics and the fact that it's a Hamiltonian in space,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
in this case of the Swift-Holmberg equation.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
But because of what I've just said, those things are irrelevant, actually.

55:36.000 --> 55:45.000
So it works for Navier-Stokes, which is neither a gradient system and it's also, of course, not a spatial Hamiltonian system.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
Anyway, I wrote the review article about this if some people are interested.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
So thank you for your attention.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Thank you very much.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
I want to make you a question that I have precisely about the very last thing that you were saying.

56:08.000 --> 56:20.000
This thing that when you study the structure of Navier-Stokes, you can capture it in a variational equation.

56:21.000 --> 56:39.000
What is the property of this thing that is allowing you to understand what a non-variational equation like Navier-Stokes is being understood by a variational equation?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Is it spatial reversibility in a way?

56:41.000 --> 56:48.000
Well, the spatial reversibility helps, but of course if I have systems in a plane,

56:48.000 --> 56:56.000
then it's spatial reversibility just in a single variable is very nice because it makes the spatial variable time-like.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
That's why you get these quartets of eigenvalues.

56:59.000 --> 57:04.000
It's more complicated if you are in a plane because what does it mean to have two time-like solutions?

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You have to think about that.

57:07.000 --> 57:14.000
But really the key thing is the dimension of the stable and unstable manifolds,

57:14.000 --> 57:20.000
of for example in the Convecton case of the conduction solution.

57:20.000 --> 57:27.000
So I have a conduction solution which is homogeneous, but there are some stable directions and there are some unstable directions.

57:27.000 --> 57:37.000
And I need these manifolds to be of sufficiently high dimension so I get these structurally stable transverse intersections.

57:37.000 --> 57:45.000
If it's only one-dimensional this way and one-dimensional this way, they're going to miss each other and you won't get these robust structures.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
So the dimensions have to work out.

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
You were writing R, the parameter, I love that.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
You were writing the contour parameter, so the rest is all valid.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
The formation of this solution is all valid also when R is an object.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Yes, yes.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
But then you were making an argument looking at these eigenvalues, but to go from one to the other you were actually changing R.

58:11.000 --> 58:21.000
Yes, so what I was doing in that Swift-Homberg example was I was trying to find a region in R space in which these dimensions actually work out.

58:21.000 --> 58:36.000
So in the case of the Swift-Homberg equation, I needed to have a two-dimensional stable manifold and two-dimensional unstable manifold in order for these things to meet in the nonlinear regime.

58:36.000 --> 58:46.000
And I did that by going into the subcritical regime, because in the supercritical regime I had no stable non-stable direction.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
That was the case R equals 0 with the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.

58:51.000 --> 58:59.000
But the way I got eigenvalues off the imaginary axis was by decreasing R below R equals 0.

58:59.000 --> 59:10.000
So that means I went into the subcritical regime where I had coexistence between the homogeneous solution and the periodic state.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
So that's really what's behind.

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
And that's the kind of calculation you have to do for each separate problem, including the Navier-Stokes problem.

59:19.000 --> 59:27.000
The Navier-Stokes problem is much higher-dimensional of course, because you have a Laplacian in the horizontal velocity component,

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
you have two horizontal components, you have the temperature, you have the concentration, right?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
So you have already five Laplacians, right?

59:36.000 --> 59:45.000
So it's in the spatial description, it's already in ten-dimensional phase space.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
So it's a much more complicated situation than the Swift-Homberg.

59:48.000 --> 59:57.000
So Swift-Homberg is really nice because it's actually the minimal, it's the minimal size of the phase space,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
the dimension of the phase space that allows this behavior to take place.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So in that sense it's the simplest model of this behavior.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Could you list the other different properties between localized structures and sources?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So one is the collisions, and maybe there are other different differences between localized structures and sources.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I mean there are many differences.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
The collisions of course are the most important thing.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I mean the main difference is that these structures physically only exist if I'm driving the system, right?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So what happens inside this convector is that I'm putting energy, I'm heating the system, and that energy is being dissipated inside the structure.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So the structure is an equilibrium state only in the sense that energy in goes out as dissipation.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But it's not a thermodynamically equilibrium structure, right?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Because it's only an equilibrium structure in the sense that I have a balance between energy in and energy out.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And of course solitons are, you know, completely different structures.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
There's no dissipation inside the structure.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And of course you're also not no energy input because it's a conservative system.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm not sure I answered your question, but...

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You discussed the interaction of this sort of...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
What kind of interaction?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
When you have some...

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You introduce some sort of activation, as we've talked about, to introduce a sort of drift.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But even without the drift, the structures should interact by details.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So if you have two such structures, they should somehow interact.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They do.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
There's no need to force them with the drift.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So how much is general of this interaction?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I mean, what...

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I mean, I guess that something should be similar to the one where you also have the drift.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
These two structures collide.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
They all rejoin and mess together.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
It wasn't because of anything.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Well, so the important thing about being in the subcritical regime is that the...

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You have these fronts, and the fronts have oscillatory tails.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Because the eigenvalues have a non-zero imaginary part.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And so if I have two of these structures, they will interact through these oscillatory tails,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and the tails lock.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And so by themselves, they will not start to drift because they're actually a stationary solution.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Because you can push on them, and if you push hard enough, they will unlock.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So that would be one way to do what you say.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
What I like about the way we do this is we're not actually putting any extra forces into the system.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
We're actually just changing the boundary conditions to change the symmetry,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and then everything happens spontaneously.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
You know, we don't have to reach in and push on these things.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
But we could.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But basically, you take the symmetry, and then of course,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
the drift is proportional to the symmetry, like that.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
That's right.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So that would be an easy work transition for now.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Except in our case, the direction of motion is generated spontaneously

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
by whatever initial perturbation there is.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Because breaking the symmetry at the top relative to the boundary condition at the bottom,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
that doesn't select left over right.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The system selects that.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So it's spontaneous symmetry breaking as opposed to forced symmetry breaking,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
which is what you're referring to.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And absolutely, we could do that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I have another question.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Most of these structures would be considered for how symmetric they are,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
except for this rating at the end of, so they are,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
what's called, busy, light structure.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Because one is in front, if they're symmetric,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
you're in two states.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
If one considers structures that arise on a block of that symmetry,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
in principle, a symmetry of the archival and all that,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
how much is known in those structures?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Steer, shape, I mean, I, of course,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
we can find some sort of human part,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
is the knowledge of extension in this case also?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, I mean, less is known.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
No surprise.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I mean, so you can think, you know,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
if you're interested in reaction diffusion problems,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
for example, when you're interested in spiral waves and things like that.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And there are, you know, situations where you can get localized spirals

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and things like that, in fact.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Maybe that's not a good example.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I was trying to think of a chiral state.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You can certainly get localized spirals

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
in these kind of field periods.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Absolutely.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But it won't have localized spirals.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And the reason is that it's not of high enough order.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So, that's, but it's, yeah, if you want to think in terms of

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Ginsberg-Landau, of course you can.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You need to kind of...

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
People, we can't take one or...

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
No, not so you need to kind of...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I mean, you know, there are equations like the complex Swift-Homberg equation,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
which we've also worked on,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
which, you know, are better models of that kind of behavior.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Because the problem with Swift-Homberg

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
is that except in certain very special circumstances,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
including some in optics,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
you can't derive them from the basic field equation.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
In fact, there is no way to derive Swift-Homberg

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
from Navier-Stokes, for example.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And you certainly can't derive the complex Swift-Homberg

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
from Navier-Stokes either.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So these have to be taken as mathematical models

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
rather than physical models.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And it's really in that spirit, I think, that, you know,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
you should take what I've tried to describe in this talk.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Is that there are mathematical models,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
which, in a sense, supersede, you know,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
the details of the physics behind this phenomenon.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But I'll lead you to understand something about the

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
commonality of the mathematical behavior of these structures.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Okay, so I think we should stop here.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Maybe I'll continue.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And Eger will be here in a few days,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
so if you have anything, let's go.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Thank you.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Thank you.
