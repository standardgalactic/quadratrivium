 Certainly! In the context of the discussion about subcritical regime and the interaction between two fronts, we explored how these fronts can interact through their oscillatory tails, which are a result of the non-zero imaginary part of the eigenvalues in the system. Since the fronts are stationary solutions under normal circumstances, they do not drift unless perturbed beyond a certain threshold. The interaction between the two fronts is locking due to these tails, and this happens spontaneously without any external forces being applied.

The discussion then shifted towards symmetry breaking in the system. It was noted that in the case presented, the symmetry breaking was done by altering the boundary conditions rather than applying external forces. This leads to a spontaneous selection of motion direction from the system itself, which is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking as opposed to forced symmetry breaking.

Furthermore, when considering structures with less symmetry, such as those arising in a block that maintains the overall symmetry of the system, there is less known compared to more symmetric states. Examples of such behavior include reaction-diffusion systems where localized spirals can form, but these would not be expected in this case due to the order of the system being too low for such patterns.

The conversation also touched on the limitations of equations like Swift-Hohenberg, which are often used as mathematical models rather than derived from fundamental field equations. These models have their applications and are useful for understanding certain types of behavior in systems that exhibit pattern formation.

In summary, the interaction between patterns in a system can be complex and is influenced by factors such as symmetry and initial perturbations. The discussion highlighted the importance of both the physics and the mathematics behind these phenomena, with an emphasis on the mathematical models that help us understand and predict the behavior of pattern-forming systems.
