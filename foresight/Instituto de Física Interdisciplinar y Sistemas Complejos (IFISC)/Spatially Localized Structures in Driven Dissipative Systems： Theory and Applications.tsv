0	11000	Okay, yeah, thank you everyone, thanks for coming, well it's a great pleasure to do this
11000	16000	all together today, make up your blog, and while your blog is busy, that's part of most
16000	21000	of the other state activities here in the U.S. that you want to discuss in the future,
21000	28000	you know, and well, if you can use original contract, I'm looking at your blog, it's
28000	34000	in the U.K. of the United States, he's, he got his beauty in Harvard University,
34000	40000	and then he was in Cambridge, and eventually he ended up as a professor in England,
40000	45000	he's a professor since 1987.
45000	51000	I will not go through his very long career, okay, there's a very large number of papers
51000	56000	and models, I'll just say he's a, well, he's a fellow of the American Geo-society,
56000	61000	and of the science, the society where he's here, and he's also a tournament scouser
61000	67000	in the University of Oxford here in Bruce, an University of the U.S.
67000	72000	Well, again, I'll not go through all of these, but he is an extraordinary person,
72000	79000	but I must say without any doubt, he's one of the people who know more about
79000	82000	the issue of thermodynamics.
82000	89000	He's probably a local, so I go out, and he's a, he's a good person to have in here
89000	94000	who's going to give a talk in front of him, well, he's a general talk, so I hope you will
94000	100000	join about, about the mission of the organization and the topic that we will go on a lot
100000	104000	and that will be very easy for you to do.
104000	107000	So, I don't know what to say, of course.
107000	109000	Thank you, Damian.
109000	112000	So, it's a great pleasure to be at IFISC again.
112000	118000	I was here some 12 years ago for an extended period invited by Manuel Matias,
118000	122000	and I enjoyed that visit as well as this one, of course.
122000	125000	So, thank you for hosting me.
125000	131000	So, I was asked to give a general talk about spatial acquisition.
131000	136000	This is a topic that I started working on since my last visit to IFISC.
136000	145000	So, this will not be a repetition in case there are any people who were here 12 years ago.
145000	150000	So, I'm going to start by giving some examples of spatial localized structures
150000	155000	and explain the origins of these structures, kind of in hand-waving terms.
155000	160000	And then I will describe a mathematical model which captures a lot of the behavior
160000	162000	that is seen in the experiment.
162000	168000	And then I will extend the theory a little bit to two dimensions and more.
168000	171000	And I'll mention in particular some examples from fluid mechanics,
171000	173000	which I think are very interesting.
173000	181000	And in fact, it was fluid mechanics that got me interested in spatial localization in the first place.
181000	185000	So, let's start with some simple examples of localized structures.
185000	187000	So, this is an example of buckling.
187000	192000	This is the kind of experiment that you can do in your bathroom.
192000	200000	It's not a very perfect experiment, but you get the idea is that you take a cylinder and you compress it.
200000	206000	And it doesn't, you know, if you don't compress it too much, it will just compress partially.
206000	215000	And in a numerical simulation of this process, you see that it buckles along the mid-secumference, as you can see here.
215000	222000	You can see these cellular structures form that resemble these kinds of structures that you see in the experiment.
222000	225000	So, how does one think about these kinds of structures?
225000	232000	Well, here is the way that people who work in dynamical systems would think about this.
232000	237000	So, on the vertical axis, I have a parameter that I'm varying.
237000	240000	This is the load that I apply to the cylinder.
240000	245000	And on the horizontal axis is the response of the system to that load.
245000	249000	In other words, how much does it contract?
249000	256000	And what you see here is that the onset of linear instability occurs somewhere over here.
256000	259000	So, this is where the perfect cylinder first starts to buckle.
259000	267000	And from this point, there is a branch of stationary, steady solutions, which are all partially buckled.
267000	271000	And they go along here and go through this kind of a curve.
271000	274000	So, let me explain in a few words what happens along this curve.
274000	280000	So, this blue curve represents an unstable equilibrium.
280000	288000	If I perturb the cylinder to the right of this blue curve, then it's just going to collapse.
288000	291000	So, this is a marginal state.
291000	299000	But what is interesting about this marginal state, if I follow it as a function of the applied load that it turns around here.
299000	306000	And at this point, I can increase the load and my partially buckled cylinder will support that load.
306000	314000	So, it gains some strength up to some point where an increase in load makes it collapse a little more.
314000	319000	And then I can load it up some more like this and then it'll collapse again and so on.
319000	325000	So, you get this sequence of partially collapsed states and what they look like is something like this.
325000	327000	So, this is the unloaded cylinder.
327000	329000	So, this is the vertical direction.
329000	331000	This is the circumference.
331000	337000	What you see is this band of cells along the mid perimeter.
337000	341000	And when you go from A to this region, you will have four rows of these cells.
341000	345000	When you go from here to B, you will have six rows of these cells.
345000	349000	And these are examples of partially buckled states or spatial localized structures.
349000	353000	The reason they are spatial localized is because the cylinder here is not buckled.
353000	354000	It's not buckled here.
354000	358000	It's just buckled in some region.
358000	365000	I'm going to give you some more examples with the same flavor.
365000	368000	So, here is an example of a ferrofluid experiment.
368000	374000	So, you take a petri dish and you fill it with a suspension of very small magnetic dark holes.
374000	377000	Held in suspension by surfactant.
377000	384000	And then you apply a normal vertical magnetic field.
384000	388000	Stationary time independent DC magnetic field.
388000	393000	And what happens is initially the surfaces just remain flat.
393000	397000	Modulate these end effects which I'm not going to talk about.
397000	401000	But then when the strength of the magnetic field becomes too strong,
401000	406000	the whole surface of the fluid buckles into a hexagonal pattern.
406000	410000	And that occurs at this value of the applied magnetic field.
410000	412000	So, the system jumps to a new state.
412000	415000	It's a state of hexagonal peaks.
415000	419000	And as you increase the magnetic field, there are any defects here.
419000	423000	And up here you have almost perfect hexagonal structure.
423000	427000	And then when you decrease the magnetic field, the hexagonal structure remains.
427000	429000	The height of the peaks decreases.
429000	433000	And here they collapse back to the flat interface.
433000	436000	So, you have a system here with a large hysteresis loop.
436000	440000	And it's these hysteresis loops that are very interesting to me.
440000	445000	Because within those hysteresis loops, in some range of parameters,
445000	448000	you can do the following experiment that's shown here.
448000	452000	What you can do is you can bring the bar magnet to the surface.
452000	454000	You pull out a peak.
454000	456000	The bar magnet pulls out a peak.
456000	458000	You remove the bar magnet.
458000	464000	And the peak, instead of falling back into the flat interface, remains sitting there.
464000	467000	That's very counterintuitive.
467000	469000	So now that you've done it once, you can do it again.
469000	472000	You can bring the bar magnet to another region of the fluid.
472000	474000	You pull out a peak.
474000	477000	You remove the bar magnet and the peak remains.
477000	479000	And you can do this many times.
479000	484000	And when you do that many times, you get a sequence of individual peaks
484000	487000	that just sit there in equilibrium.
487000	491000	These are indicated by this sequence of dots,
491000	494000	each dot corresponding to a different number of peaks.
494000	497000	So you have one peak, two peaks there.
497000	501000	And these peaks can form clumps, bound states.
501000	505000	And this is from another experiment, a more recent experiment.
505000	509000	And you see these kind of patches of hexagons,
509000	513000	where the hexagons are confined to some region.
513000	516000	And outside, there is no displacement,
516000	518000	essentially no displacement of the interface.
518000	522000	So I'm going to talk about these kinds of structures.
522000	525000	So a lot of people here are interested in vegetation patterns.
525000	528000	So I can't resist showing some examples.
528000	533000	These are also associated with what's called a subcritical instability.
533000	535000	And the reason is the following.
535000	538000	If I imagine that I have a plant growing in some region,
538000	543000	then the plant may have extended roots in the horizontal direction
543000	545000	and the roots take up moisture, of course,
545000	549000	and prevent the growth of the plant to the side.
549000	554000	So this is a mechanism for preferring the plant that's already there.
554000	557000	That's the notion of subcritical instability.
557000	561000	Alternatively, in various deserts, and we have these deserts in California,
561000	566000	you may have a situation where the surface of the desert
566000	571000	is covered by a kind of biofilm, a crust, which is essentially impermeable.
571000	575000	And if it does happen to rain, then any water that's collected
575000	577000	will run into regions where the crust is broken
577000	580000	and it's broken exactly where plants are, right?
580000	583000	So this gives you another mechanism for positive feedback,
583000	589000	whereby the existence of plants, you know,
589000	591000	leads to the collection of water
591000	594000	and therefore enhances the growth of those plants.
594000	597000	So these are the basic mechanisms believed to be responsible
597000	600000	for many types of vegetation structures,
600000	603000	including these remarkable so-called fairy circles.
603000	606000	This is from Namibia, an aerial picture.
606000	609000	This is a region that's covered by bush.
609000	613000	But the bush is broken by these little bare circles,
613000	616000	typically four kilometers across.
616000	619000	And you can see that there's more growth
619000	621000	around the boundary of the circle
621000	623000	because there is less competition for water.
623000	628000	Half of the region is dry and there is no water collected.
628000	631000	So it's believed that these types of mechanisms
631000	637000	are responsible for the presence of these kinds of localized structures.
637000	639000	Now localized structures can be dynamic,
639000	645000	and this is from an old experiment from Harry Sweeney's lab in Austin, in Texas.
645000	647000	You take, again, a Petri dish.
647000	649000	You fill it with very small brass beads,
649000	653000	and then you vibrate the dish up and down
653000	656000	with a certain frequency and a certain amplitude.
656000	659000	And if you do it in the right range of parameters,
659000	663000	you can get structures which oscillate up and down.
663000	665000	So for a while it's a peak,
665000	668000	and then one period of the forcing is a crater.
668000	671000	It's a subharmonic instability.
671000	676000	The interesting thing about this structure is that it's localized in state.
676000	678000	And this is created in the same sort of way
678000	682000	as in that ferrofluid experiment that I mentioned earlier.
682000	685000	This is what it looks like in reflected light.
685000	688000	So this is the peak that I showed you at one period.
688000	691000	One period of the forcing later it forms a crater,
691000	693000	and then it goes back to a peak.
693000	696000	So it's an oscillation between these two states.
696000	699000	This is what it looks like from the side.
699000	702000	These things can also form bound structures,
702000	706000	like these bound states of a peak and a crater.
706000	709000	One period later the peak becomes a crater,
709000	711000	the crater becomes a peak.
711000	714000	They oscillate out of phase like this and remain bound.
714000	716000	And you can get chains of these structures.
716000	720000	You can get these kind of molecules with one peak,
720000	722000	three craters.
722000	725000	A period later you have a crater surrounded by three peaks.
725000	727000	There are a lot of different structures, of course,
727000	731000	that can be made in two dimensions.
731000	739000	This is a nice example from the lab of Hans-Gerl Provence in Münster.
739000	746000	He takes two electrodes and partially evacuates the region between them.
746000	749000	It fills it with different types of gas.
749000	754000	And then he puts a voltage difference across the electrodes.
754000	756000	If the voltage difference is large enough,
756000	758000	you get electrical breakdown,
758000	760000	meaning that you get current filaments
760000	765000	shorting the gap between the electrodes.
765000	767000	And of course that radiates,
767000	769000	and so you can see the current filaments.
769000	772000	And this is basically what the experiment is.
772000	775000	And what he finds are the same kinds of structures
775000	777000	that we've been talking about.
777000	780000	You can get a stationary hexagonal pattern,
780000	783000	like the pattern of peaks in the ferrofluid experiment,
783000	784000	that I mentioned.
784000	787000	You can get a structure of these current filaments
787000	789000	where the current filaments are not stationary,
789000	792000	but move around in complicated ways.
792000	796000	And so the analogy might be that this is more like a liquid state
796000	798000	as opposed to a crystalline state.
798000	800000	You can get a gas-like state
800000	803000	where you have fewer of these structures that are in motion.
803000	805000	But you can also get the sort of chains
805000	809000	that we were talking about earlier, networks.
809000	811000	And you can get states where you have, for example,
811000	815000	part of the region is solidified or crystallized,
815000	820000	and some of these current filaments are free to move around
820000	823000	in an irregular fashion.
823000	826000	Now what is interesting about a lot of these problems
826000	829000	is that, first of all, they behave in a similar way,
829000	832000	but also that we don't necessarily even know
832000	834000	the right equations to describe this.
834000	837000	This is a very complicated problem.
837000	839000	The business of the granular media,
839000	841000	you know the brass beads moving up.
841000	845000	Now we don't have an aviastope equation for granular media.
845000	847000	And so what we would like to be able to do
847000	851000	is describe a lot of these structures in some generic way,
851000	854000	which doesn't depend on the basic physics
854000	858000	that's responsible for these different types of behavior
858000	859000	that you see here,
859000	862000	and that captures the common behavior
862000	865000	that's exhibited by all these different systems.
865000	867000	Now there are examples of this in fluid mechanics.
867000	869000	Fluid mechanics is nice,
869000	872000	because I actually know what the equations are.
872000	874000	And so we can study the equations numerically,
874000	877000	and I'll talk about some results that we've obtained.
877000	881000	So this is an example of what we call convectons.
881000	884000	These are localized regions of convection.
884000	887000	And what you see here is a two-dimensional layer
887000	891000	of a binary mixture, a lighter and a heavier component
891000	893000	that is heated from below.
893000	895000	And in response to the applied heating,
895000	899000	the heavier component migrates towards the bottom boundary.
899000	902000	This is a cross-diffusion effect that's called the Sorai effect.
902000	906000	It's very well known in these types of problems.
906000	909000	And what you see here is the temperature fluctuations
909000	912000	about the linear temperature gradient.
912000	914000	It's hot at the bottom, cold at the top,
914000	917000	so there's a linear temperature gradient in the background.
917000	920000	But this shows the region of hot fluid rising
920000	922000	and cold fluid descendant.
922000	925000	But as you can see, the convection rows that are set up.
925000	928000	And the interesting thing here is that the convection
928000	930000	doesn't fill the whole domain.
930000	932000	It just fills part of the domain.
932000	936000	And what is interesting also, like in the examples we saw before,
936000	938000	is that for the same parameter values,
938000	941000	I can get distinct states.
941000	944000	All nominal is stable.
944000	948000	So these states are obtained for the same parameter values,
948000	950000	but they are different.
950000	953000	In an odd state, I have a descending cold plume,
953000	956000	rising hot plume on the opposite sides,
956000	959000	and here I have two rising plumes on the two sides.
959000	961000	So they're distinct states.
961000	963000	Simultaneously stable.
963000	965000	Just like in that buckling problem,
965000	967000	we had lots of simultaneously stable,
967000	970000	partially buckled states.
970000	973000	And you can get more complicated structures
973000	976000	like these turbulent states in couette flow.
976000	979000	What couette flow is, is a shear flow
979000	981000	between two power plates,
981000	983000	the top plate moving towards you,
983000	985000	the bottom plate moving away from you.
985000	988000	And you can get structures of localized turbulence,
988000	995000	which are inclined relative to the direction of motion of the plates.
995000	998000	So what do these states have in common?
998000	1003000	Well, they can be found in one, two, and in three dimensions.
1003000	1006000	I'll talk about some three-dimensional structures at the end.
1006000	1008000	They may be stationary.
1008000	1010000	Most of the examples we've talked about were stationary.
1010000	1013000	They can propagate or they can oscillate in place,
1013000	1017000	as we saw in the oscillon example.
1017000	1021000	They are generated by finite amplitude perturbations.
1021000	1024000	Like the bar magnet that I bring to the surface to pull out a peak,
1024000	1027000	that's a finite amplitude disturbance.
1027000	1029000	And therefore the structures are fully nonlinear,
1029000	1031000	and they have to be described by methods
1031000	1035000	which go beyond linear or weakly in nonlinear theory.
1035000	1038000	And they can, of course, experience a variety of instabilities
1038000	1041000	that lead to splitting, decay, disappearance, propagation,
1041000	1045000	or localized complex dynamics, in fact.
1045000	1048000	And they form these different types of bound structures
1048000	1053000	that we looked at in the gas-like state
1053000	1056000	that you also saw in the previous slides.
1056000	1059000	Now, I want to emphasize these things are sometimes called
1059000	1061000	dissipative solitons,
1061000	1063000	but they have nothing to do with solitons.
1063000	1066000	They are not solutions of integral PDEs.
1066000	1069000	They, in fact, have very different interaction rules,
1069000	1074000	and I'll talk about some of those in a moment.
1074000	1078000	So here is my kind of toll problem
1078000	1081000	that I think is a very interesting equation.
1081000	1085000	It looks deceptively simple,
1085000	1089000	but it captures a lot of the behavior that we've seen.
1089000	1094000	And it explains why lots of systems with different physics
1094000	1097000	behave in the same way.
1097000	1099000	So what is this equation?
1099000	1104000	It's an equation for a scalar field, u, here.
1104000	1108000	This is the time derivative of u with respect to time.
1108000	1110000	The field depends on space.
1110000	1113000	For example, in a plane, this would be x, this would be y.
1113000	1116000	It has its fourth order in space,
1116000	1119000	and that's important that it's fourth order in space.
1119000	1122000	There is a bifurcation parameter like the load,
1122000	1125000	for example, when I was crushing my cylinder,
1125000	1129000	and then there is a bi-stable nonlinear term
1129000	1133000	with a destabilizing quadratic contribution
1133000	1136000	and a stabilizing cubic contribution.
1136000	1140000	So I'm going to call this equation with this FSH23,
1140000	1144000	or I can maybe have a destabilizing cubic contribution
1144000	1146000	and a stabilizing fifth order contribution.
1146000	1149000	I'm going to call that equation SH35,
1149000	1154000	SH for St. Holmberg and the 35 for these systems.
1154000	1158000	So now we can play the same game that Reinhard Richter played
1158000	1160000	in his ferrofluid experiment.
1160000	1165000	What I can do is I can go into a plane here,
1165000	1169000	and I can generate the localized finite-empadue disturbance
1169000	1172000	like bringing the bar magnet towards the surface.
1172000	1175000	And then if I'm in the right parameter regime,
1175000	1178000	and by right parameter regime I'm in the right range of S
1178000	1181000	and the associated range of R,
1181000	1185000	an interesting thing happens that the localized perturbation
1185000	1190000	that I've created will relax to a non-zero localized state.
1190000	1193000	It won't fade away.
1193000	1196000	For example, here I created one perturbation
1196000	1198000	and it created this target pattern.
1198000	1201000	Here I generated a different perturbation, created a spot.
1202000	1205000	Here I generated a third type of initial perturbation,
1205000	1208000	created a hexagonal patch.
1208000	1215000	So the same idea, generating different initial finite-empadue disturbances
1215000	1218000	and they relax to different types of localized structures.
1218000	1222000	And they're all here sitting simultaneously stable.
1224000	1228000	So let's try to understand why this might be the case.
1228000	1231000	So here is my equation, and just for simplicity,
1231000	1233000	I've written it in one dimension.
1233000	1236000	And I've also introduced this Qc, which is a length scale.
1236000	1239000	It's actually the intrinsic length scale of my crystal
1239000	1242000	that you saw in the previous slides.
1242000	1246000	And it's important that it's foreordering space,
1246000	1248000	that you have this intrinsic length scale,
1248000	1253000	that you have bistability that comes from this nonlinear term
1253000	1257000	that gives you that hysteresis loop that we saw at the beginning.
1257000	1261000	And it helps that it's spatially reversible,
1261000	1264000	that you have the symmetry x goes to minus x.
1264000	1268000	And it also helps that it has gradient dynamics.
1268000	1271000	In other words, the dynamics is boring.
1273000	1279000	What this equation means is that the system just evolves always to steady solutions
1279000	1285000	and the steady solutions correspond to a local minima of this functional f
1285000	1289000	that I'm going to refer to as the free energy of the system,
1289000	1292000	by analogy with phase transition.
1292000	1299000	So in a sense, what I'm going to be talking about is the energy landscape of the system.
1299000	1304000	And if I'm going to have multiple local solutions that are linearly stable,
1304000	1308000	all of those must correspond to local minima of f.
1308000	1311000	Of course, there'll be local maxima, there'll be saddle points,
1311000	1317000	the idea is to understand the energy landscape of this functional.
1321000	1326000	So this slide is, I guess, probably more for the students,
1326000	1329000	but I think it's actually a very important slide,
1329000	1332000	probably my most important slide.
1332000	1337000	So what I want to do is explain to you the idea of the difference
1337000	1340000	between temporal and spatial dynamics.
1340000	1345000	These are different ways of looking at the same problem.
1345000	1348000	Of course, when I'm interested in temporal dynamics,
1348000	1350000	I want to know how things evolve in time.
1350000	1355000	And what I can do, for example, to find instability of a uniform state,
1355000	1360000	u equals 0, I can perturb that state with some time-dependent perturbation
1360000	1364000	with a growth rate sigma and a spatial scale q.
1365000	1367000	That's the usual thing that we all do.
1367000	1371000	And then when sigma of particular q is positive,
1371000	1375000	you say that q grows in time.
1375000	1379000	Now, we're interested here in stationary solutions, steady solutions,
1379000	1381000	independent of time.
1381000	1383000	And where are those?
1383000	1389000	Well, those solutions only exist on the curve sigma of q equals 0.
1389000	1393000	And I've drawn that curve here, here is that curve.
1393000	1397000	So q is horizontally r, the parameter is on the vertical direction.
1397000	1401000	In this region, you have instability for some q.
1401000	1403000	Below the curve, you have no instability.
1403000	1407000	So steady solutions only exist on this curve.
1407000	1411000	And notice that if I pick this value of r, there are two types of steady solutions,
1411000	1416000	ones with wave number q minus and ones with wave number q plus.
1416000	1421000	And as I decrease r towards the onset of instability,
1421000	1424000	those two solutions come together and merge.
1424000	1433000	It's a co-lessons of two distinct wave numbers at this critical wave number qc.
1433000	1438000	And this is what you would normally call the onset of temporal instability,
1438000	1442000	because it's the minimum of this curve sigma of q.
1442000	1446000	And the way we think about this is this is a fourth order problem in space.
1446000	1452000	If I put this equal to 0, I have an ODE in four-dimensional phase space.
1452000	1456000	And I can look at spatial eigenvalues of u equals 0.
1456000	1459000	And there will be four, because it's a fourth of the problem.
1459000	1463000	And so when r is greater than this critical value, which is 0,
1463000	1468000	I actually have four eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.
1468000	1474000	This one corresponds to eigenvalue lambda is iq plus, iq minus,
1474000	1477000	and then the negative, the complex function.
1477000	1480000	And the fact that the eigenvalues are on the imaginary axis
1480000	1484000	is a consequence of the spatial versatility I mentioned.
1484000	1489000	And then as r decreases towards 0, these two come together at co-lessons.
1489000	1493000	You have eigenvalues of double multiplicity on the imaginary axis.
1493000	1498000	And then when I go below r equals 0, I have this quartet of eigenvalues,
1498000	1504000	a pair in the unstable positive real part of the complex plane
1504000	1508000	and a pair in the negative real part of the half plane.
1508000	1514000	And this is important because now I have a two-dimensional unstable manifold
1514000	1517000	whereby I can leave u equals 0,
1517000	1522000	but I can also return to u equals 0 along the stable manifold span
1522000	1526000	by these two stable eigenvalues.
1526000	1530000	And what this looks like in a picture is something like this,
1530000	1533000	is that here is u equals 0 as a function of x.
1533000	1539000	I'm leaving u equals 0 along those two directions, the unstable eigenvalue.
1539000	1543000	And I can also come back and all I have to make sure
1543000	1546000	if I want to generate the nonlinear localized solutions
1546000	1551000	is somehow that these curves connect in the nonlinear regime.
1551000	1554000	And without going into details,
1554000	1557000	you can do this using multiple scale methods.
1557000	1565000	You find that at r equals 0, there is a pair of solutions that appear from u equals 0.
1565000	1570000	The reason you have a pair of solutions, in fact more than two,
1570000	1573000	is that it's a multiple bifurcation
1573000	1576000	because those spatial wave numbers have co-lessed
1576000	1580000	and leaving you a multiple bifurcation in space,
1580000	1582000	not in time, but in space.
1582000	1584000	And the two solutions are these.
1584000	1589000	You have a periodic pattern with some amplitude that goes like the square root of minus r
1589000	1591000	because alpha is negative.
1591000	1595000	And then you also have a modulated solution
1595000	1598000	where you have a periodic solution that's modulated in envelope
1598000	1601000	by this sex-like function.
1601000	1604000	And here the spatial phase phi is arbitrary.
1604000	1607000	You can just translate the pattern as you wish.
1607000	1610000	But here I cannot pick any phi
1610000	1614000	because I cannot translate the periodic pattern relative to the envelope
1614000	1615000	by arbitrary amounts.
1615000	1622000	I have to pick certain values of phi and only 0 and phi are permitted.
1622000	1623000	So this is what we've learned.
1623000	1628000	So this is a bifurcation diagram, like the ones we've seen before.
1628000	1630000	Now the parameter is shown horizontally
1630000	1636000	and the response, the norm of the solutions, is plotted in the vertical direction.
1636000	1640000	And at r equals 0, you see that there are lots of branches coming out of there.
1640000	1644000	There is the red branch that corresponds to periodic solutions.
1644000	1646000	It's a subcritical instability
1646000	1649000	because that coefficient alpha was negative,
1649000	1652000	so solutions exist for r less than 0.
1652000	1654000	And so that solution is unstable initially
1654000	1657000	and then it requires stability at the top.
1657000	1659000	But you also get the localized solutions.
1659000	1664000	They bifurcate simultaneously with the periodic solutions.
1664000	1667000	They're also subcritical and also unstable.
1667000	1672000	But when they reach this shaded region, they start oscillating back and forth.
1672000	1676000	Here the heavy line indicates stable solutions.
1676000	1679000	And so you can see that in this region,
1679000	1681000	the localized solutions have required stability
1681000	1686000	and moreover, you can get a very large multiplicity of simultaneous with stable states.
1686000	1690000	And of course, the ones you will see will depend on how you do the experiment.
1690000	1692000	The word you put your magnet.
1693000	1698000	That depends on what kind of initial disturbance you are applying.
1698000	1700000	And what is the difference between these states?
1700000	1703000	So L0 have a peak in the middle.
1703000	1706000	And you can see that as I follow L0 like this,
1706000	1709000	the structure gradually grows and extends,
1709000	1711000	spatial extent.
1711000	1716000	L pi solutions are similar, but they have a dip in the middle.
1716000	1719000	And so we call this kind of structure,
1719000	1725000	the snakes and ladder structure of this region of localized states.
1725000	1729000	And the ladders, or the rungs of the ladder at these states here,
1729000	1733000	they correspond to asymmetrical solutions.
1733000	1736000	For example, you know, if you start with a solution,
1736000	1738000	it's a peak in the middle on the L0 branch,
1738000	1741000	and you go to state two, it becomes asymmetrical.
1741000	1744000	You can see then it becomes again more asymmetrical.
1744000	1749000	And then at the far end, it emerges as a solution with a dip in the middle.
1749000	1752000	And so it lies on the L pi branch.
1752000	1755000	These states are all unstable.
1755000	1759000	Now, if you do this for a single peak, as I've just done,
1759000	1762000	then you can also do it for pairs of peaks, right?
1762000	1767000	And you get the same sort of snaking until you fill the domain.
1767000	1770000	You can do it for these bound states.
1770000	1773000	So here is a bound state of two single peak structures.
1773000	1776000	And they lie on a figurate isola.
1776000	1779000	These lie in that shaded region.
1779000	1783000	If I have a two-peak state, they lie on this kind of figurate solution.
1783000	1788000	These ones lie on this figurate solution and so on.
1788000	1793000	The isolas depend on the separation of the structures.
1793000	1797000	So here I am changing the separation between these states.
1797000	1802000	And you can see that the isola depends on that separation.
1802000	1806000	There's a lot of possible solutions that you can get in that shaded region.
1806000	1808000	In fact, you can get more.
1808000	1812000	You can get solutions which are bound states of similar structures,
1812000	1814000	like this structure with one peak, two peaks.
1814000	1819000	At this location, by the time you get to here, you have three peaks and two peaks.
1819000	1822000	So this one has grown. This one hasn't.
1822000	1825000	When you go from two to one, this one remains the same.
1825000	1827000	This one grows and so on.
1827000	1833000	There's a huge variety of different solutions inside the shaded region.
1833000	1848000	So I'd like now to tell you why this region might support this great variety of different solutions.
1848000	1854000	And I'm going to do it by analogy with what you know about phase transitions.
1854000	1858000	So what I'm drawing here is my parameter. You can think of that as temperature.
1858000	1864000	And here is the response of the system.
1864000	1866000	And so this is the periodic state.
1866000	1869000	Remember, it was unstable. It became stable at the fold.
1869000	1877000	And there is a parameter value here at which the periodic state actually has the same energy as the homogeneous state.
1877000	1881000	So this is what in thermodynamics you would call a Maxwell point.
1881000	1890000	And I want to make use of that analogy to understand why we can get lots of different structures in that shaded region of parameter space.
1890000	1897000	So imagine in the middle here that I'm plotting the density as a function of space.
1897000	1900000	And I'm doing it at the critical temperature.
1900000	1904000	For example, think of this as a liquid and this as gas.
1904000	1907000	So the liquid has higher density. This has lower density.
1907000	1912000	Then in the absence of surface tension, I can put any number of interfaces in there.
1912000	1914000	It doesn't cost me anything.
1914000	1917000	So I can get very complicated states.
1917000	1924000	Now if I change the temperature, for example, I increase the temperature above critical where what happens?
1924000	1928000	Then the liquid wants to evaporate and that means that this front is going to move in.
1928000	1932000	This one is going to move in and eventually the drop is going to disappear.
1932000	1936000	So there's no steady solution.
1936000	1941000	No steady solution when I change the temperature away from critical temperature.
1941000	1950000	If I decrease the temperature, then of course I have condensation and so the fronts are going to move in the opposite direction and the drop is going to grow.
1950000	1954000	So that's the thing I want to bear in mind.
1954000	1961000	But now I want to think about what happens if I don't have coexistence between two homogeneous phases like the gas and the liquid phases.
1961000	1969000	But instead let's say I have a liquid and I have a solid, a crystal structure, a medium.
1969000	1979000	Then things change and they change in an important way and that was originally recognized by Yves Poivre long time ago.
1979000	1990000	You have a front here that you're trying to get to move but this front is pinned to the potential of the heterogeneity behind it and so it's not free to move.
1990000	1998000	You have to change the temperature by a finite amount before that front can move and for example the crystal can invade the liquid.
1998000	2001000	We call that crystallization.
2001000	2011000	And inside that region generated by this pinning potential, that's where all the localized states exist that I've been talking about.
2011000	2019000	There's a mathematical way of thinking about this and some of you may prefer that even though this is a physics institute, right?
2019000	2025000	So I mean four dimensions, right?
2025000	2034000	It's a spatial way of looking at things and it turns out that this equation has a spatial Hamiltonian.
2034000	2046000	So there's a conserved quantity so I can go from four to three and then I can look at the wavelength one map that takes me from three to two and so I can draw things in two dimensions.
2046000	2050000	And so here is the fixed point that corresponds to the homogeneous state.
2050000	2059000	Here is the fixed point that corresponds to the periodic state that corresponds to the fixed point under this wavelength one map.
2059000	2069000	And these are all associated with stable and unstable manifolds because as I showed you we have some stable eigenvalues, some unstable eigenvalues.
2069000	2079000	And what you see here for example at the fold here is that I have a tangency between the unstable manifold of this point and the stable manifold of this point.
2079000	2086000	And then when I cross inside the shaded region which is this region here, I have transversal intersections as you can see here.
2086000	2098000	And the unstable manifold of the homogeneous state actually has to intersect the stable manifold of the homogeneous state along the line that corresponds to the fixed point subspace.
2098000	2102000	So the reflection symmetry x goes to minus.
2102000	2110000	And so this point here, run backwards, goes back to the homogeneous state, run this way, goes to the homogeneous state.
2110000	2113000	So it's a localized solution.
2113000	2120000	And you can also see those asymmetric solutions, they also have to form the same mechanism.
2120000	2131000	And they all accumulate, as you see from this heterogeneic tango, they all accumulate on the periodic orbit as this black dot over here.
2131000	2138000	So that's what happens in that shaded region is you have these transversal intersections of stable and stable.
2138000	2147000	And one way to think about this is in terms of fronts, and this is a front that connects the homogeneous state to the periodic solution.
2147000	2151000	This is another front of the same time. This one is stable, this one is unstable.
2151000	2155000	You put two of these back to back, you get state one, it's an unstable state.
2155000	2158000	You put two of these back to back, you get a stable state.
2158000	2164000	And if you do one of each, you're going to get an unstable, wrong state.
2164000	2169000	And I just want to say a couple words about the wavelength selection in that shaded region.
2169000	2179000	As I vary my parameter R, the wavelength can change across that of the periodic oscillations, the localized periodic oscillations,
2179000	2181000	because there's no boundaries.
2181000	2191000	And the wavelength that is selected, as you can see here, is the wavelength determined by the requirement that this spatial Hamiltonian is conserved.
2191000	2196000	That spatial Hamiltonian contains the homogeneous state and the periodic solution,
2196000	2202000	and any connection between those two has to lie in the level set H equals zero of this Hamiltonian.
2202000	2205000	So we understand some things about this.
2205000	2213000	If I go outside of this pinning region, right, so the pinning region has to straddle the Maxwell point, which is this dash dotted line,
2213000	2219000	I can either go this way or this way outside, then of course I have no localized stationary solutions,
2219000	2222000	and instead I have dynamical solutions.
2222000	2230000	And here is an example, space, time increasing upwards of what happens if I go to the right of the pinning region.
2230000	2235000	In the region to the right, the state that has lowest energy is the periodic state,
2235000	2243000	and the system approaches a periodic state through a sequence of nucleations that generate new wavelengths on either side.
2243000	2248000	And so this is an example of a stable state, a periodic state invading another stable state,
2248000	2252000	but the periodic state has lower energy, so it's preferred.
2252000	2260000	And you can develop some theory to understand what is the frequency of nucleation events as a function of the parameter, and so on.
2260000	2266000	And the same sort of thing happens if you go to the other side where the preferred state is the homogeneous state,
2266000	2272000	and so the periodic structure eventually disappears through these annihilation events.
2272000	2276000	Now in 2D things are more interesting, of course,
2276000	2283000	and so I just want to say a few words about, so this is now x and y, not time but y,
2283000	2288000	and I had a localized structure, a localized region of stripes,
2288000	2293000	and the front here was unstable to a y-dependent perturbation,
2293000	2300000	and that deepened the front so that eventually the whole region is taken over by a hexagonal pattern.
2300000	2302000	But that doesn't have to happen.
2302000	2309000	In a different region, the hexagons only invade inward, and you generate a localized patch of hexagons like this,
2309000	2314000	or in another region you can get structures where the front's deepened and send out these fingers,
2314000	2322000	which then buckle because the wavelength that is selected by this kind of moving front is not the equilibrium wavelength.
2322000	2329000	And so the system then relaxes to what would be the equilibrium wavelength, subsequent to the passage of the front.
2329000	2333000	And this is the same sort of thing for the 3.5Ks, you can get these kind of finger structures.
2333000	2339000	Here is a labyrinthine pattern that is generated by this dynamical evolution,
2339000	2346000	the moving front between the homogeneous and structured state.
2346000	2351000	A couple words about how these structures might be connected, I think this is quite interesting.
2351000	2358000	So this dot here, mu is minus r, so this red dot corresponds to a state like this,
2358000	2360000	norm in the vertical direction.
2360000	2365000	If I follow this in one direction, it's going to follow the state up to this red dot here,
2365000	2368000	and what you see here is that these fingers have grown out.
2368000	2374000	These are the steady solutions of the Swift-Holbert equation, 3.5.1.
2374000	2379000	If I follow the red dot in the opposite direction, it generates this kind of structure.
2379000	2386000	And what you see here is that these dots here or the spots reconnect horizontally
2386000	2392000	and create these stripes as the front moves away from the central region.
2392000	2398000	So these kinds of structures and these kind of structures are actually on the same solution branch of the Swift-Holbert equation,
2398000	2400000	which is quite interesting.
2400000	2405000	And then you get all these kinds of interconnections that I talked about, there's many more of them in 2D.
2405000	2410000	You can get lots of isolas of these checkerboard structures.
2410000	2416000	You can get structures that have this kind of lozenge appearance.
2416000	2420000	You have fronts which are pinned because of the oscillation behind them.
2420000	2427000	And they're also pinned here because of the gradient in the wave number due to the curved interface.
2427000	2432000	And then you have these things which we've called worms, which are very strange things.
2432000	2439000	And if people here are interested in PDEs, you might ask, you know, what's happening here at that point?
2439000	2443000	It's not a singularity because the PDE doesn't permit.
2443000	2444000	Old steady solutions?
2444000	2447000	Old steady? No. Well, some are stable.
2447000	2450000	I don't know whether specifically these ones are stable.
2450000	2460000	But as you go along here, the stability changes at falls in the same sort of way.
2460000	2469000	But I think it's very interesting that you form these kinds of structures that have these cusp behavior.
2469000	2473000	It's not understood at all why this might be possible.
2473000	2475000	I just want to say a few words.
2475000	2478000	So this is an attempt to draw in parameter space.
2478000	2485000	So this is R now, and this is the coefficient of the quadratic term for SH23 squared.
2485000	2488000	You know, where the different kinds of localized structures are.
2488000	2493000	I want to say a few words about the hexagons here.
2493000	2498000	So this shows the snaking branch of hexagonal structures.
2498000	2509000	And what you see that at point one here, what you see is a hexagonal patch like some of the things we saw in earlier pictures.
2509000	2515000	When I go from one to two, I've nucleated a cell in the middle of each phase.
2515000	2522000	When I go from two to three, I nucleate new solutions on either side, but I'm still missing the corners.
2522000	2527000	And when I get to four, I actually generated a full patch so the process can repeat.
2527000	2538000	So there's a very regular ordered way whereby these structures grow as you quasi-statically vary the parameter or temperature or whatever you want to call it.
2538000	2543000	And here is a situation with these kind of stripe-like states.
2543000	2554000	The small oscillations here correspond to adding cells along each row, and then each big row is associated with these large-scale excursions.
2554000	2560000	So let me go back to now fluid mechanics, because time is running.
2560000	2563000	So you've seen this picture, these odd and even convectons.
2563000	2567000	I want to show you how they're generated in the fluid problem.
2567000	2573000	So here is space, because I have a layer, so I'm just looking at what happens at mid-level.
2573000	2580000	I just want to see what the temperature looks like at mid-level, and I'm plotting it at a sequence of successive times.
2580000	2587000	And what you see here is that the initial state is a kind of spatial-temporal complex state,
2587000	2593000	but that state undergoes a focusing instability you can see over here.
2593000	2599000	And after some further time, this solution is not a stationary solution of the system,
2599000	2605000	but in fact it evolves by that same erosion of wavelengths that we saw in the Svthomberg equation.
2605000	2612000	It collapses back into the chaotic state, and then, of course, that's unstable to the focusing instability, and so the process repeats.
2612000	2618000	And it generates this kind of relaxation time trace.
2618000	2627000	We have the chaotic state, here is the focusing instability, here is the erosion of the structure, and the process repeats.
2627000	2639000	And now you change the parameter from 1774 to 1775, and now the solution remains as far as you know forever.
2639000	2644000	Here is that focusing instability, it's generated the structure, suppressed oscillations outside,
2644000	2654000	and all the heat now is transported through this hole, if you like, through this layer that's been self-generated by this focusing instability.
2654000	2663000	And so this is the bifurcation diagram. This is a measure of the temperature difference across the system.
2663000	2667000	Here is the response of the system, it's the heat transported.
2667000	2675000	Here was that primary instability that generated the chaotic state, and here is the appearance of the localized solution,
2675000	2683000	stationary stable, numerically stable localized solutions that I just showed you, and notice they are inside this hysteresis loop.
2683000	2691000	They coexist with spatially extended, you know, more or less standard convection.
2691000	2701000	I've separated the odd and even structures, just so you can see, and I'm going to compare the solutions at these successive points.
2701000	2713000	For the odd ones, you can see that I'm picking up heavier material from below like this, and then I'm picking up lighter material from above,
2713000	2723000	because the rolls at the two ends rotate in the same direction, and so I have actually like a little pump that picks up stuff from one side and deposits it on the other side.
2723000	2730000	And then the direction of the pump changes when I go from A to C, because I've added rolls in the opposite direction at each end,
2730000	2734000	and so the pumping now is in the opposite direction.
2734000	2739000	And if I have an even state, then of course the rolls are in opposite directions at the two ends,
2739000	2746000	so they either pick up the heavier stuff from the bottom, or they pick up the lighter stuff from above.
2746000	2754000	If I go outside that pinning region, I get behavior that's indistinguishable from the Swigfumberg equation, yet this is Navier-Stokes.
2754000	2763000	Structure grows by the successive nucleation events that you saw earlier.
2763000	2777000	I want to say a few words about collisions of these things, because they are one of the things that distinguishes the local structures that we've been talking about from solitons.
2777000	2784000	And so the way we do that is as follows. We take the three-fold Swigfumberg equation, and we add a quadratic term.
2784000	2787000	Why do we do that? We do it for two reasons.
2787000	2798000	One is that the quadratic term breaks the gradient structure of the system, so structures can now move, but also that it breaks the symmetry U goes to minus U.
2798000	2811000	And that means that structures that were kept fixed stationary by diagonal reflection, you know, left, right, up, down, those solutions are no longer exist, they won't exist anymore,
2811000	2815000	and therefore whatever takes their place has to move.
2815000	2824000	Because it messes up my beautiful diagram, but you have lots of possible stable solutions that you can pick up that are now moving.
2824000	2832000	They have the solutions that were odd solutions, odd parity solutions, when epsilon was zero.
2832000	2836000	And so here I've taken two of those solutions back to back, and I collide them.
2836000	2840000	And notice that it's a very inelastic collision, right?
2840000	2844000	Stick and form a different localized solution.
2844000	2851000	I can take different solutions, you know, the different structures that are moving and they stick,
2851000	2857000	or I can take solutions that move in the same direction, the skinny ones travel more rapidly than the fat ones,
2857000	2865000	and so they catch up and eventually they form a moving localized solution over here.
2865000	2874000	Here I have a collision with a stationary even solution, and I call this an attractive solution because the fronts here are of opposite type,
2874000	2879000	down here, up here, and that leads to attraction between these structures.
2879000	2889000	If I have the same front on both sides that leads to repulsion, and you can see that this little guy hits this one, and then the whole thing moves to the right.
2889000	2894000	So we can do the same thing in fluid mechanics with these convectons.
2894000	2900000	The way we do that is we have to change the boundary conditions at the top, so they are now different from those at the bottom.
2900000	2910000	For example, we can allow Newton's law of cooling to allow temperature heat to escape from the top boundary.
2910000	2913000	That's a nice, physically realizable way of doing this.
2913000	2919000	And if we do that, the even solutions remain stationary, just as in the previous suit Hombra example,
2919000	2921000	and the solutions that were odd are now moving.
2921000	2926000	After all, Navier-Stokes is not a gradient system, right?
2926000	2928000	And so I can play the same game.
2928000	2935000	So here I've taken two solutions with identical solutions with opposite speed,
2935000	2940000	and I collide them and they glue in the same sort of way as in the Sweden-Homberg equation.
2940000	2946000	It's a little more complicated because their waves generated is not a gradient system, as I mentioned,
2946000	2949000	but it behaves in a somewhat similar way.
2949000	2953000	Here I have a stationary solution that's being hit by a moving one.
2953000	2957000	And notice that the two fronts are opposite, so this is an attractive solution,
2957000	2960000	and you can see these are coming together.
2960000	2967000	It's an asymmetric collision, a lot of radiation, but eventually you get a local solution.
2967000	2970000	Here I have a repulsive interaction.
2970000	2976000	This was a stationary solution that's being pushed to the right by the proximity of this guy.
2976000	2986000	The two fronts are the same at both ends, but eventually they glue again as in the Sweden-Homberg example.
2986000	2988000	How much time do I have?
2988000	2989000	Five more minutes.
2989000	2991000	Five more minutes?
2991000	2992000	Okay.
2992000	2994000	I'll just show a little movie.
2994000	2996000	So we can do this also in three dimensions.
2996000	3001000	So this is an example of a convecting system in a porous medium.
3001000	3003000	Same sort of system, heated from below.
3003000	3007000	You have a mixture of a lighter and a heavier component.
3007000	3015000	The Navier-Stokes equation is simplified because it's a porous medium, and then we solve these equations.
3015000	3020000	And of course the bifurcation diagram is a little worse, as you might imagine.
3021000	3028000	But basically what we do through dynamical simulations, we find the localized solution that is not a steady solution.
3028000	3035000	It's not an equilibrium solution, but the system poses at this kind of solution.
3035000	3042000	Then we can converge it, and then we can follow that solution in the parameter space.
3042000	3046000	And so this hopefully will work.
3046000	3051000	And what you should see here is a green dot,
3051000	3058000	marching along here, and on this panel you see the structures that are following that correspond to the location of the green dot.
3058000	3061000	So this is not temporal evolution.
3061000	3068000	This is just a sequence of steady equilibrium solution of the PDE that I had on the previous slide.
3068000	3071000	And you can see these three-dimensional structures growing.
3071000	3074000	They form this kind of...
3077000	3081000	A periodic horizontal, but of course non-trivial in the vertical direction.
3085000	3090000	Well, we have no mass flux and fixed temperature.
3090000	3096000	So the mass flux boundary condition is like a boundary condition in concentration.
3096000	3099000	And it's no slip.
3101000	3107000	So what's basically happening here is that the solution is trying to find that spatially extended state,
3107000	3111000	that fills the whole domain, but it's having a hard time.
3111000	3118000	And it's not actually clear in this problem that he ever finds a periodic solution that fills the whole domain.
3118000	3123000	Because you follow it and it just keeps moving in and out like this,
3123000	3131000	and it forms these bizarre shapes that people have never seen in convection, as far as I know.
3131000	3135000	But these are all steady solutions of that system.
3135000	3142000	And many are stable if you impose some reflection symmetry that we know.
3142000	3148000	Okay, last thing I want to mention is same things occur in plain coed flow.
3148000	3153000	So remember that shear flow that I showed you at the beginning with one plate going towards you,
3153000	3156000	one plate going away from you.
3156000	3161000	What you see here are periodic array vortices.
3161000	3163000	So this is a top view.
3163000	3167000	These periodic array vortices would fill the whole domain.
3167000	3169000	But they're also localized solutions.
3169000	3172000	They're localized in the transverse direction.
3172000	3179000	And this is what it looks like in a vertical cross section through that system.
3179000	3181000	You can see these vortices.
3181000	3183000	And there are two of them.
3183000	3188000	These ones travel because one of them closer to one of the boundary than to the other boundary.
3188000	3190000	So they travel partly with the boundary.
3190000	3192000	These ones have diagonal symmetry.
3192000	3193000	So they're stationary.
3193000	3200000	And they do the same kind of snaking, the same cross links that you saw in the Swift-Holmberg equation.
3200000	3207000	And to me, this is really interesting because these kinds of shear flow problems have been studied for more than 100 years.
3207000	3215000	And it's only taken this way of looking at these problems to try to look for new types of solutions in these very, very old problems.
3215000	3224000	They go back to Rayleigh and all the famous fluid machinations from the end of the 19th, early 20th century.
3224000	3226000	So here are my conclusions.
3226000	3239000	So I've shown you that the growth process of these stationary localized structures in dissipative systems have lots of rules whereby they grow in size,
3239000	3244000	whereby their stability changes and how they interact.
3244000	3248000	These things are independent of the physics.
3248000	3253000	But they're captured by this Swift-Holmberg model in a very effective way.
3253000	3261000	So much so that, for example, I could make predictions based on the Swift-Holmberg model for the collision, for example.
3261000	3266000	And they worked out very well in a much more complicated Navier-Stokes system.
3266000	3269000	And you might ask, how is that even possible?
3269000	3272000	Because the Swift-Holmberg has nothing to do with fluid mechanics.
3272000	3285000	And the reason this works is because the structures I'm talking about are robust in the sense that they are there because of transverse intersections
3285000	3291000	between stable and unstable manifolds in the spatial dynamics description of the system.
3291000	3296000	And of course, if you have transverse intersections of stable and stable manifolds, you can't unhook those.
3296000	3299000	You can change parameters and they're still transverse intersections.
3299000	3302000	You can add an extra term and you still have a transverse intersection.
3302000	3309000	So you can change not just parameters, you can change equations and these structures are still there.
3309000	3319000	So that doesn't have anything to do with physics per se, but it's a good mathematical model for understanding the robustness of the behavior that I described.
3319000	3329000	It was useful for me to use the variation of the gradient structure of the dynamics and the fact that it's a Hamiltonian in space,
3329000	3332000	in this case of the Swift-Holmberg equation.
3332000	3336000	But because of what I've just said, those things are irrelevant, actually.
3336000	3345000	So it works for Navier-Stokes, which is neither a gradient system and it's also, of course, not a spatial Hamiltonian system.
3346000	3350000	Anyway, I wrote the review article about this if some people are interested.
3350000	3352000	So thank you for your attention.
3359000	3361000	Thank you very much.
3362000	3368000	I want to make you a question that I have precisely about the very last thing that you were saying.
3368000	3380000	This thing that when you study the structure of Navier-Stokes, you can capture it in a variational equation.
3381000	3399000	What is the property of this thing that is allowing you to understand what a non-variational equation like Navier-Stokes is being understood by a variational equation?
3399000	3401000	Is it spatial reversibility in a way?
3401000	3408000	Well, the spatial reversibility helps, but of course if I have systems in a plane,
3408000	3416000	then it's spatial reversibility just in a single variable is very nice because it makes the spatial variable time-like.
3416000	3419000	That's why you get these quartets of eigenvalues.
3419000	3424000	It's more complicated if you are in a plane because what does it mean to have two time-like solutions?
3424000	3427000	You have to think about that.
3427000	3434000	But really the key thing is the dimension of the stable and unstable manifolds,
3434000	3440000	of for example in the Convecton case of the conduction solution.
3440000	3447000	So I have a conduction solution which is homogeneous, but there are some stable directions and there are some unstable directions.
3447000	3457000	And I need these manifolds to be of sufficiently high dimension so I get these structurally stable transverse intersections.
3457000	3465000	If it's only one-dimensional this way and one-dimensional this way, they're going to miss each other and you won't get these robust structures.
3465000	3469000	So the dimensions have to work out.
3470000	3475000	You were writing R, the parameter, I love that.
3475000	3479000	You were writing the contour parameter, so the rest is all valid.
3479000	3482000	The formation of this solution is all valid also when R is an object.
3482000	3484000	Yes, yes.
3484000	3491000	But then you were making an argument looking at these eigenvalues, but to go from one to the other you were actually changing R.
3491000	3501000	Yes, so what I was doing in that Swift-Homberg example was I was trying to find a region in R space in which these dimensions actually work out.
3501000	3516000	So in the case of the Swift-Homberg equation, I needed to have a two-dimensional stable manifold and two-dimensional unstable manifold in order for these things to meet in the nonlinear regime.
3516000	3526000	And I did that by going into the subcritical regime, because in the supercritical regime I had no stable non-stable direction.
3526000	3531000	That was the case R equals 0 with the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.
3531000	3539000	But the way I got eigenvalues off the imaginary axis was by decreasing R below R equals 0.
3539000	3550000	So that means I went into the subcritical regime where I had coexistence between the homogeneous solution and the periodic state.
3550000	3553000	So that's really what's behind.
3553000	3559000	And that's the kind of calculation you have to do for each separate problem, including the Navier-Stokes problem.
3559000	3567000	The Navier-Stokes problem is much higher-dimensional of course, because you have a Laplacian in the horizontal velocity component,
3568000	3573000	you have two horizontal components, you have the temperature, you have the concentration, right?
3573000	3576000	So you have already five Laplacians, right?
3576000	3585000	So it's in the spatial description, it's already in ten-dimensional phase space.
3585000	3588000	So it's a much more complicated situation than the Swift-Homberg.
3588000	3597000	So Swift-Homberg is really nice because it's actually the minimal, it's the minimal size of the phase space,
3597000	3601000	the dimension of the phase space that allows this behavior to take place.
3601000	3609000	So in that sense it's the simplest model of this behavior.
3610000	3616000	Could you list the other different properties between localized structures and sources?
3616000	3625000	So one is the collisions, and maybe there are other different differences between localized structures and sources.
3631000	3633000	I mean there are many differences.
3633000	3638000	The collisions of course are the most important thing.
3638000	3645000	I mean the main difference is that these structures physically only exist if I'm driving the system, right?
3645000	3653000	So what happens inside this convector is that I'm putting energy, I'm heating the system, and that energy is being dissipated inside the structure.
3653000	3663000	So the structure is an equilibrium state only in the sense that energy in goes out as dissipation.
3663000	3669000	But it's not a thermodynamically equilibrium structure, right?
3669000	3676000	Because it's only an equilibrium structure in the sense that I have a balance between energy in and energy out.
3676000	3681000	And of course solitons are, you know, completely different structures.
3681000	3683000	There's no dissipation inside the structure.
3683000	3689000	And of course you're also not no energy input because it's a conservative system.
3690000	3692000	I'm not sure I answered your question, but...
3695000	3698000	You discussed the interaction of this sort of...
3698000	3699000	What kind of interaction?
3699000	3700000	When you have some...
3700000	3705000	You introduce some sort of activation, as we've talked about, to introduce a sort of drift.
3705000	3709000	But even without the drift, the structures should interact by details.
3709000	3712000	So if you have two such structures, they should somehow interact.
3712000	3713000	They do.
3713000	3715000	There's no need to force them with the drift.
3715000	3718000	So how much is general of this interaction?
3718000	3719000	I mean, what...
3719000	3723000	I mean, I guess that something should be similar to the one where you also have the drift.
3723000	3725000	These two structures collide.
3725000	3728000	They all rejoin and mess together.
3728000	3730000	It wasn't because of anything.
3733000	3739000	Well, so the important thing about being in the subcritical regime is that the...
3739000	3742000	You have these fronts, and the fronts have oscillatory tails.
3742000	3747000	Because the eigenvalues have a non-zero imaginary part.
3747000	3751000	And so if I have two of these structures, they will interact through these oscillatory tails,
3751000	3753000	and the tails lock.
3753000	3761000	And so by themselves, they will not start to drift because they're actually a stationary solution.
3761000	3765000	Because you can push on them, and if you push hard enough, they will unlock.
3765000	3768000	So that would be one way to do what you say.
3768000	3774000	What I like about the way we do this is we're not actually putting any extra forces into the system.
3774000	3778000	We're actually just changing the boundary conditions to change the symmetry,
3778000	3780000	and then everything happens spontaneously.
3780000	3783000	You know, we don't have to reach in and push on these things.
3783000	3785000	But we could.
3785000	3788000	But basically, you take the symmetry, and then of course,
3788000	3790000	the drift is proportional to the symmetry, like that.
3790000	3791000	That's right.
3791000	3792000	Yeah.
3792000	3794000	So that would be an easy work transition for now.
3794000	3799000	Except in our case, the direction of motion is generated spontaneously
3799000	3802000	by whatever initial perturbation there is.
3802000	3810000	Because breaking the symmetry at the top relative to the boundary condition at the bottom,
3810000	3812000	that doesn't select left over right.
3812000	3814000	The system selects that.
3814000	3818000	So it's spontaneous symmetry breaking as opposed to forced symmetry breaking,
3818000	3820000	which is what you're referring to.
3820000	3822000	And absolutely, we could do that.
3822000	3824000	I have another question.
3824000	3828000	Most of these structures would be considered for how symmetric they are,
3828000	3831000	except for this rating at the end of, so they are,
3831000	3834000	what's called, busy, light structure.
3834000	3837000	Because one is in front, if they're symmetric,
3837000	3840000	you're in two states.
3840000	3845000	If one considers structures that arise on a block of that symmetry,
3845000	3849000	in principle, a symmetry of the archival and all that,
3849000	3851000	how much is known in those structures?
3851000	3853000	Steer, shape, I mean, I, of course,
3853000	3856000	we can find some sort of human part,
3856000	3859000	is the knowledge of extension in this case also?
3859000	3866000	Well, I mean, less is known.
3866000	3868000	No surprise.
3868000	3870000	I mean, so you can think, you know,
3870000	3872000	if you're interested in reaction diffusion problems,
3872000	3876000	for example, when you're interested in spiral waves and things like that.
3876000	3880000	And there are, you know, situations where you can get localized spirals
3880000	3883000	and things like that, in fact.
3898000	3900000	Maybe that's not a good example.
3900000	3903000	I was trying to think of a chiral state.
3903000	3906000	You can certainly get localized spirals
3906000	3908000	in these kind of field periods.
3909000	3911000	Absolutely.
3911000	3914000	But it won't have localized spirals.
3914000	3918000	And the reason is that it's not of high enough order.
3918000	3924000	So, that's, but it's, yeah, if you want to think in terms of
3924000	3926000	Ginsberg-Landau, of course you can.
3926000	3928000	You need to kind of...
3928000	3931000	People, we can't take one or...
3931000	3934000	No, not so you need to kind of...
3935000	3937000	Yeah.
3942000	3947000	I mean, you know, there are equations like the complex Swift-Homberg equation,
3947000	3949000	which we've also worked on,
3949000	3952000	which, you know, are better models of that kind of behavior.
3952000	3955000	Because the problem with Swift-Homberg
3955000	3958000	is that except in certain very special circumstances,
3958000	3961000	including some in optics,
3961000	3964000	you can't derive them from the basic field equation.
3964000	3966000	In fact, there is no way to derive Swift-Homberg
3966000	3968000	from Navier-Stokes, for example.
3970000	3973000	And you certainly can't derive the complex Swift-Homberg
3973000	3975000	from Navier-Stokes either.
3975000	3978000	So these have to be taken as mathematical models
3978000	3981000	rather than physical models.
3981000	3984000	And it's really in that spirit, I think, that, you know,
3984000	3988000	you should take what I've tried to describe in this talk.
3988000	3990000	Is that there are mathematical models,
3990000	3993000	which, in a sense, supersede, you know,
3993000	3996000	the details of the physics behind this phenomenon.
3996000	4000000	But I'll lead you to understand something about the
4000000	4004000	commonality of the mathematical behavior of these structures.
4006000	4008000	Okay, so I think we should stop here.
4008000	4010000	Maybe I'll continue.
4010000	4013000	And Eger will be here in a few days,
4013000	4015000	so if you have anything, let's go.
4018000	4020000	Thank you.
4048000	4051000	Thank you.
