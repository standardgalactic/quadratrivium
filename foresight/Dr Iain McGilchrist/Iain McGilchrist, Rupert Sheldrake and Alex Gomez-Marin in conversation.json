{"text": " Okay, so I feel like I am the luckiest and happiest corpus callosum, separating and reaching these two gentlemen, Ima Gilchrist and Rupert Sheldrake. I've had the honor and pleasure to spend many hours in conversation with you two, and we're here at Rupert's house because we've recorded a series of conversations with Rupert and also with Iain. The last one covering his book The Matter With Things, and so we couldn't miss this opportunity to be the three of us, and especially you two in conversation, so I'm really glad we're doing this. So am I. Me too. So let's start with any curiosity back and forth, maybe from Rupert about the hemisphere apothesis, and perhaps from me and Rupert about morphic resonance, and then see where we go. All right. Well, I confess I haven't read the whole of your book, but I've read several chats of it, and I've watched many of your talks and so on, and one thing I deduced is that it's something to do with the two hemispheres of the brain. That has come through quite loud and clear in every chapter, and there are two things I'm curious about, about the hemispheres and your chosen central terrain. One is that when people started doing these split brain operations, they were done, I think for epileptics mainly, weren't they? They severed the corpus callosum that joins the two halves of the brain together, and this enabled Sperry and other scientists to look at the lateralization of function in the two hemispheres, and they had to do very sophisticated experiments to show this, that all that leads to this idea of differentiated function. But the bit that interests me is that they were doing these operations on patients who had their brain split in two, or at least all down to, there were still a few connections in the basal brain, but largely severed the connections between them, and the reason they were able to do this and go on doing it was because when people went home, it seemed to have solved the seizure problem, and they seemed perfectly normal. And for me, that's the most astonishing thing of all in this research, that people who had had their brain completely cut in two, not completely, but largely cut in two, worked to coordinate the movements of both sides of their body, their mouth moved, coordinated as they spoke, their spouses and loved ones hardly noticed any difference. And for me, that suggests either that the nervous connections to the two halves of the brain are completely or largely unnecessary, which is very surprising, or that the coordination between the two halves of the brain, which must be there in order to walk and speak and swim and dance and do all the normal movements of life. I'm just talking about motor coordination here, not just about, you know, the more sophisticated cognitive functions, that then there must be still some coordination to the two halves of the brain. And for me, that suggests there's a kind of resonance between the two halves of the brain resonate, either electromagnetically or through something like morphic resonance, that there's an overall wholeness within which these two parts are coordinated by resonance. They're not coordinated by direct nervous connections, as one might otherwise have assumed. So for me, it raises a completely different view of how the brain may actually work and how the two hemispheres may be coordinated. What would you think about that? I mean, why is it that severing the connection of corpus callosum that links the two halves has so little manifest effect? The first thing to say is that the corpus callosum, many people don't realize, is a mammalian invention. So although reptiles, amphibians, and many other creatures lower down that tree have two centers in their brain, they're not connected in this direct way. Corpus callosum started with the first mammals. The second thing I think that's worth reflecting on is that it's not uncommon for people to be born with what's called colossal age genesis, in other words, they don't have a corpus callosum, and it's often a chance finding a postmortem. So quite clearly, the finding that you can sever the connection and people can lead a reasonably normal life, almost impossible really to, if casually encountered, you wouldn't notice that there was a problem. These are consonant findings and they are a bit mysterious, I agree. But what they think they show is that, first of all, this direct connection between the hemispheres is not the only way in which the two hemispheres can communicate. For example, they very obviously share a body and the eyes and the senses take in both parts of the body, so they know where, if you like, they can sense outwardly as well as inwardly what's going on. Mostly in these cases, the operation was done in somebody who had a longish life and had got used to the coordination of the two hemispheres. They communicate with one another through the endocrine system. There are all sorts of ways in which they have a common internal environment. And as you say, they communicate at the level of the brainstem and even a little bit above it. So there is definitely connection there of a kind. I don't know quite how to understand the resonance though, because the immediate question is, I mean, when you think of things resonating, you think the brain waves from this hemisphere are they literally resonating with the other hemisphere? I don't know of any evidence of that. So what sort of a resonance exactly is it that they might have? Well, I'm not sure, but what I think of it, say that there was a field, a morphic field covering the whole brain and brain activity, that included within it the activity of the two hemispheres, then the way in which they're coordinated might be through this field, co-ordinating the two parts within a larger hole. And the coordination wouldn't necessarily mean that one echoes the other in a most literal resonance way. But the way in which, say, the different organs of the body, or say, different atoms within a molecule are coordinated within a larger field. Now, if you take a molecule, a very simple molecule like H2O or CO2, the atoms, the carbon and the two oxygens in carbon dioxide, are bound together by bonds. But the bonds that bind them together have an electron cloud that goes around the whole molecule. Covalently bonded molecules have a cloud of electrons surrounding the whole molecule, like a membrane around the whole molecule. And the bond between the actual individual atoms is there are shared electrons that bond them. But there's a cloud, an electron cloud, around the whole thing. And the vibratory patterns of carbon and oxygen within a CO2, they have different vibratory patterns, but they're coordinated together by an overall field which influences both through its influence on their vibratory frequencies and coordinates them and is sensitive to changes in both in a way that communicates it to the other. Something like that. I mean, this is a crude model and I haven't actually tried to work it out in detail. But some overarching field of whatever kind, I mean, my favorite kind of morphic fields, but some overarching, organizing field in which both are parts and which coordinates the two, would seem to me to be one way of thinking about this. Well, immediately, of course, I think of the way in which quantum field theory suggests that the way we tend to think in terms of little balls or particles is at most of metaphorical meaning. And that what is being referred to there is a very particular state of something that is an overall field that has energy and exerts influence. So such fields are very basic. And without the idea that there is some sort of coordinating field, it's difficult to explain how a simple organism, a single cell organism, can detect changes and respond to them in other parts of even that cell. I mean, this is something that has been puzzled over by many biologists. And there seems to be some overall coordination. And of course this goes much further when you come to a multicellular organism and how do the various parts of this organism know that certain things need to be responded to elsewhere in the organism? Look, we don't at the moment have any way of understanding how this communication takes place. Yes. You see, I think it even applies to physical systems like crystals. I mean, there's a longstanding problem, as you know, with snowflakes. You know, Johannes Kepler wrote a monograph on the six-sided snowflake. I didn't actually know. He did. Yes, he was fascinated by snowflakes. All these people have taken wonderful pictures of snowflakes. You know, Bentley is one of the great ones, the classic pictures. What you see with the snowflake is they all have six sides or arms. And the six arms are the same as each other. But each snowflake is different. Exactly. So the thing is, how come they're coordinated? Because you could say, well, the particular branches on the thing are random to do with the immediate environment. But then you'd have to say to explain the whole snowflake being the same. The every arm of the growing snowflake was exactly the same on that snowflake. And they're all the same just because they were in exactly the same fluctuating environment, fluctuating in the same way. And the next snowflake was in a completely different environment. Or you could say, as intriguingly the late editor of Nature, Sir John Maddox, no friend of mine in many ways, puzzling over this question of snowflakes, said there must be some kind of internal resonance within the lattice structure of the snowflake that enables it to be co-ordinated. It must be reading you. Possibly. But you see, there are resonances within crystal lattices, there are resonant patterns and harmonics and stuff. And so say there's a co-ordination between these seemingly separate arms of the snowflake, which could depend on some kind of field that's over and above the individual arms. So that's the kind of model. And one would expect with any holistic model of organisms that there's a field for the entire body that helps coordinate the development of the body and all the organs within it. But this field also helps coordinate development of different parts. So for example, when the fingerprint patterns are similar on right and left hands, and when the right and left hand side of the faces are similar, they're not exactly the same, of course. But I think in normal morphogenesis there's a kind of right-left resonance going on all the time, which helps coordinate bilaterally symmetrical structures. Now, of course, the brain's not exactly bilaterally symmetrical as one of the points that we know from its anatomy as well as its function. But some overarching field that enables this to happen. That to me is why one reason I myself got interested in split brains in a sense, the opposite from your own interest, which is about the differences. And I was just interested in how come the co-ordination is still so remarkable and so integrated that we don't experience two, most people don't experience two sub-personalities all the time. And the idea of a co-ordinating field that includes both and co-ordinates both would help to explain why we don't go around with right-hand Rupert and left-hand Rupert, one with a wonderfully integrated view of the world and the other with a kind of obsessive literal one. Is your question perhaps rephrased by saying, is there an organizing principle that unites the master and his emissary? Or can the master do it on its own? No, I think one way of thinking about what you're talking about is that just as in the developing organism there needs to be differentiation, say that on one side of the body there'll be a liver on the other, you know, spleen and so on. These things are also part of a single overarching field, if you like. And the brain could be seen as similarly asymmetrical, but part of that asymmetry is already part of a single field. I think you must have been reading McGilchrist, actually, because of course I have wonderful images of snowflakes, actually, and talk about exactly this issue, which also occurs in deer antlers, for example. Deer antlers have a particular form peculiar to that deer. If you cut them off, they regenerate exactly according to that pattern, but where this pattern is stored is not known. So overall we have problems that are generally neglected because they're difficult to answer, but as soon as you start thinking about it in a more inquiring way, which I would have thought was the point of science, that's a difficult question. How is it that these things have this overall confusion? I mean, no, for example, in the brain, I forget the exact figure, but it's something staggering, like 500,000 neurons are generated every minute in the business of gestation in the womb, and all those neurons have to end up precisely in the right place in the brain, and the brain has minute architectural... Where exactly is this information stored about the three-dimensional structure alone of the brain? I don't think it can be even encoded in simple linear code in the sense that we think of code. Of course, we've now dropped the idea that it's a taller linear code in the way the computer is coded, but instead must be a three-dimensional code, and so we know about the conformation in epigenetics of the genes involved. But nonetheless, where is this... You don't see anywhere in that this intricate three-dimensional structure stored, and the simplest thing I can imagine is that there is some overarching field. Can I just add a couple of other amusing or interesting things? I mean, one is the striking fact that people who are born without limbs nonetheless have the sense of the limbs. They've never had them, but nonetheless, they have an internal sense of those limbs, and Ramachandra describes a woman who had no limbs, no upper limbs, having phantom limbs, which she couldn't stop gesticulating when she talked. So this part of evolutionary history, the hand movements are coordinated with speech, was there in her, although she had never experienced hands or arms. The other thing, which is raised by F. S. Schiller, the Victorian philosopher, Oxford philosopher, which is a very good point, is we know, of course, that when people have damage to one part of the brain, other parts of the brain can take over the function. But how is this coordinated? How does one part of the brain that's supposedly doing whatever it does know we need speech? How are we going to get it back? I mean, in a way, there's a need for something overarching to draw out that function in a new place in the brain. Well, of course, my own starting point for my ideas on morphogenetic resonance was morphogenetic fields, form-shaping fields. And I started my scientific career working on plant development. Yes. And how is it that leaves and flowers and stem ends and so on develop? And the idea of morphogenetic fields, first put forward in the 1920s, was exactly that of a coordinating field that brings forth these patterns, and underlies regeneration. And so, for example, in the regeneration of salamander eyes, so-called wolfian regeneration, you cut out the lens of the eye of a new torus salamander, and it will regenerate new lens from the edge of the iris, which is not how the lens forms in the embryo, it forms by folding in the skin from the outside. So there's a completely filling and missing structure by modifying some other structure would never normally be modified to create, to fill that function. And all this similar kind of coordination applies in social insects. If you remove some of the workers, or remove some of the soldiers, or remove some of the hive, or something. The whole system re-adjusts, they stop doing what they're doing, some of them take on different functions and roles. So these coordinating fields, I think, underlie all of biology, all of nature of self-organizing systems. And phantom limbs are particularly interesting because I think in a phantom limb, the phantom is the field of the limb which is experienced from within, but which doesn't have a material structure associated with it. And as you may know, one of the experiments that I proposed in my book Seven Experiments That Could Change the World is on detecting phantom limbs. I recruit amputees through veterans' organizations, tried recruiting them through hospitals, but they were extremely uncooperative. And then I have the phantom amputee, but they push their phantom arm through one of six positions in a barrier, a door, for example. And on the other side, that's done in a randomized sequence, on the other side, I have people who do subtle energy medicine, Reiki, Helos, and so on. And one at a time, I lead them in, I say, one of those panels has a phantom arm sticking through it, and the others don't, which has got the phantom, and they sort of feel in different places. And they say that one, and they write more than chance so far, substantially more than chance. So the main objection I've had to this is, well, how do you know it's not telepathy? If we've moved, if the skeptic of the argument says, it must be telepathy, and we've moved it. That's beautiful. Yes, yes. But then, as a test for that, I haven't done this yet, but the control, the telepathy control is you ask them to imagine pushing their phantom arm through, or you ask them to extend their phantom arm with a step back yard or two to start with and extend it so it doesn't actually go through the door. And so that would be another control. Now, these experiments are not expensive. In fact, they're free. So I think that actually this whole question can be taken much further. This is not the kind of thing people do in labs at the moment, but they could. But before we leave the subject of the divided brain and all that, I have a more, probably a simpler easy to answer question. You could probably refer me to page 3027 in your Magnum Office, which is, I'm a pianist, and so obviously playing the piano involves coordinating the right and the left hand. And the left hand, which mainly does the rhythmic section as well, is clearly controlled by the right brain. And the right hand, which does the sort of melody and all the rest is by the left brain. And in playing the piano, these are coordinated. And how does this map on to your interpretation? I'm sure it maps wonderfully well, but I just love to know how. Well, one of the mysteries is that music is abnormally lateralized in the brain of performers. So in the general population who are not professional musicians or full-time musicians, the only bit of music that is really understood or interpreted by the left hemisphere is rhythm. And melody and harmony are almost exclusively understood and experienced in the right hemisphere. So that seems on the face of it very different from what you're describing. And one of the things is that for most instruments, the two hands need to be coordinated for all these activities. And so when you look at professional musicians, what I've just described is not the case. So they have developed a left hemisphere which is also capable of understanding melody and harmony. And the right hemisphere already actually understands rhythm anyway. In fact, complex rhythms in the ordinary person are understood by the right hemisphere, not by the left. It's only simple rhythms the left can get. The sort of thing that I constantly hear everywhere I go, blaring out of cars on speakers in shops and so on, which is just boom, boom, boom. That is the left hemisphere speaking. But I think what you're describing is an effortful coordination which actually modifies the brain. I see. Because you see, I thought on the basic, I mean my understanding of McGillchrist 101 was that actually the right and left hand should be reversed. And there's no reason why when the development of piano playing took place, the keyboards shouldn't have been the other way round. With the deep notes at the top. Yes. Well, yes, with the keyboard reversed. So you play with the left hemisphere, the right hand would do the rhythm and the left hand would do, I mean it could have been exactly the mirror image of the way it is now. There's nothing in the technology that says it has to be that way round. It's quite right. I never really thought about that. I think that you'd have to have had, not just a reversal of, you'd have to have had the higher notes on the left hands part of the scale. Yes. That's right. The thing is that in the brain there are certain things that are positionally, it seems like, for example, the sequence from left to right in which things grow is innate in, for example, chicks. They tend to see that a series of numbers grows as you move towards the right, which is the way in which we see from one to itself. And so we start from lower to higher. And it may be that this is also the way in which it seems fundamentally that the lower notes are basic. They are the base. And the other is what is built more complexly on top of it. And so it may be natural that an instrument developed in this way. But I haven't studied all instruments around the world to see whether or not there's a project for somebody with nothing else to do. Well, look at Islamic music, you see, because they read from right to left. Yes. And so their whole sense of the way things develop. Yes. You start at the back of the book by our criteria and you read from right to left. It's the exact opposite. Of course. If pianos had first been developed in the Caliphate, in Baghdad or somewhere, perhaps the upper part of the keyboard would have been the lower notes and the rhythm section, and it might have been a mirror image of existing pianos. It's a hypothetical, but some research, anthropological search, would be interesting. Yes. I don't know why it's ended up that way in brief, but that is the way it is. And it's also true, of course, of all instruments. I don't know of any instruments that are just played with one hand. I mean, it's one of the things we do, even with sort of playing a flute, playing a violin. Both hands have to be coordinated, at least in Western music, that is, almost as I think we know. So the hands have to work together in this way, and the brain is modified in those who do it, so that it can. I wonder how much learning the piano, you see, I started learning piano when I was five. I come from a musical family. And my son, Merlin, learned at five, Cosmo, who started learning at four. And that means from a very early age, they and lots and lots of other people have actually been using brains in a way that would be somewhat counterintuitive if they read McGillchrist first. So does this affect the actual development? Do people who learn the piano or other instruments at an early age develop differently? I mean, professional musicians, you said, are noticeably different. But what about amateur musicians who play every day? Well, of course, the distinction is not between amateur and professional, but between people who are constantly playing and those who are only occasionally playing. So I don't think there's a problem with that. But I would imagine that starting early to learn an instrument like this will modify, certainly we know in respect of the appreciation of sound that it does modify the brain. And I don't see why it should not modify the brain in other ways. You and your two sons have interesting brains that work perhaps slightly different from the standard Western brain. Yes. Yes. Well, that's a really interesting possibility, isn't it? I don't know if anybody has done more tests on professional pianists or, you know, I don't know of any. No. Well, it would be a good research area from the point of view of brain naturalization, wouldn't it? Absolutely. When I have seen reports saying the people who learn the piano or other instruments have a different way in which they think and stuff. Okay. But it would be an obvious thing to do because this involves a close coordination of the two hemispheres in a way that, I mean, we need it in every physical activity, walking, running, jumping, sports skills, presumably, you know, playing cricket, playing football, etc., right and left feet. Presumably all these physical skills involve coordination of hemispheres. Well, they do, but the difference is that the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and motor performance each control the other. And there's not the, you know, there's the distinction that there is between melody, harmony and rhythm, if you see what I mean. Yes. So music introduces a whole different aspect. Yes. There's no reason to suppose that we should be discoordinated when we move. And then animals that have no corpus callosum are perfectly well coordinated. You know, this question of yours could be scaled up to in asking how could we nurture young brains so that they have an easier time to grasp the world as you've proposed in your book or another way to put it would be how to nurture the Ruperts and eons of the future, which is something I'm very concerned with. What can we do to facilitate those intuitions that you both have been pursuing in different ways, but scientifically and beyond? You know, if you have some thoughts on that. Well, one thought I have that seems relevant is that I think that to the extent that what you're asking for is people who think more flexibly. There is a problem with dogma in both in philosophy and in science. It's a natural tendency for things to ossify, to fix prematurely and not allow evolution. It's natural for thought to evolve. And to do this, it has to be creative. And the best kinds of thinking that will allow this are those in which analytic acumen is there, but coupled with rather like the left and the right hand, coupled with a more imaginative and intuitive way of thinking. And I describe the insights of many scientists and mathematicians and it's quite extraordinary how virtually all of them describe this so-called ah-ha moment as being the creative thing that reveals the new Gestalt. And this ah-ha moment is robustly associated with the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus of the right hemisphere. So we know that this is right hemisphere, mediate it. And the trouble with our education now is that it's very much technically orientated. More and more we're saying what's the point in teaching people unless it's teaching them some mechanical skill that will be useful to them. But in fact, the point of an education is to draw out of us our humanity. And humanity used to be part of what we discussed in school, the humanities. And I think that a greater emphasis on music, on poetry, which also involves very largely the right hemisphere, whereas ordinary discursive language is probably more dependent on the left hemisphere than on both. These ways of thinking should be part of the way we educate children. What do you say, Rupert? Yes. Well, I think there are some forms of education like sports, physical skills, crafts, which are part of education. I mean, they're always being squeezed out by the senses on more science, more literacy, more language, more learning. I think training other skills like intuitive abilities and emotional intelligence, all these things, they seem to be really important. But we've got a system of education which is designed for, well, basically it follows from Victorian design, doesn't it, of preparing people for life in an industrial society. One thing is to make children used to getting up and showing up for school at nine o'clock in the morning and fixed hours, I mean, which you need in an industrial society, disciplining from an early age. And I think a lot of it's about that. I think that's very important myself. It's important, but it's not primarily about creativity. Obviously so. Actually, for most people, I don't think creativity is, I don't think we necessarily need to have creativity built into the entire educational system because it's a major disadvantage. It's a disadvantage for a lot of people to be creative. I mean, if you've got a regular job and you're creative, you're going to have an awfully difficult time. Most jobs require lack of creativity. Yes. And, you know, I went into the scientific career believing that the importance of scientists be original and creative. And I soon discovered there was every obstacle to doing that. You know, whenever I'm trying to be or am being or, you know, doing something that seems to me original and creative, instead of people saying how wonderful, I mean, the vast majority of people say rubbish, nonsense, where's the evidence, etc. And if you have the evidence and you do an experiment you think is creative, you say, well, you've got these results, but where's the theory? You know, and as Alex sometimes says, you know, one of the responses I get to my research on telepathy and things like that is, you know, it's all very well in practice, but does it work in theory? Yes, it does. So actually originality is a major disadvantage for a lot of people. Well, it may be, but it depends what we mean by an education. If we mean simply preparing people for routine jobs, then we're limiting their potential and we're prescribing what is valued in society. Whereas if we were to encourage some people, definitely need their originality enhancing or not even enhancing but liberating, I think it's there in a lot of people. But it does need disciplining as well. This is why I see that both parts are important. I think that modern education both lacks discipline and lacks originality. It's about sticking information into people inefficiently and then hoping they can regurgitate it later. But that's not an education at all. An education is about enabling something that is innate to grow. But that growth also, if you like, needs a formal field in which to grow. And that should be provided by good teachers and was, I hope for you and certainly was for me, by highly disciplined, intellectually acute, but also imaginatively inspired teachers from whom I learned. You know, this was extraordinarily important. Now, I was very lucky too with my teachers at school and at university. But I mean, what I want to emphasize is it's not about letting it all hang out. I mean, there was an enormous amount of discipline. You know, at an early age, one had to know trigonometry and calculus. One had to be able to understand Greek grammar and Latin grammar, all these things. And these are difficult. I mean, there are all things that you get by sort of going, oh, well, whatever. I mean, they really require serious application. And one does need that structure. And I believe that in learning a skill, and you talked about that, and you're talking about manual skills largely. I think they're very important crafts and skills. But to begin with, you have to do rather laborious copying of things. But then you're in the position to be able to go further than that. But you need that first element to be there before you can go further. I mean, I didn't write this book out of not knowing anything about neuroscience or, you know, years of hard work involved. And your work, it also involves years of hard work, I know. It's that commute from right to left to right that you mentioned, right? Yes, it needs to go from right to left and back to right. By which I mean that one's first apprehension of something is a perceptive and imaginative understanding. And then one needs to, as we learn more, by the process of analysis and seeing the structure of what one's doing and making comparisons and putting things together in a certain way. But they must never stop there. That is an intermediary phase. And then it needs to be reintegrated into a new whole in which that laborious analysis has been not lost because that suggests that it was pointless, but it had its point at a certain period in time. What your discussion reminds me of the simple organisms I used to study, E. coli, how they navigate the world. It's like learning to tumble and learning to run. They need to run and tumble. So in a way, a certain dose of dogmatism is needed to just keep on going for some while because it would stop at every point. To reconceive that you would get nowhere. But if you don't stop and tumble, then you also go nowhere. So it's this balance in a way. It's very interesting. And of course science needs to balance its openness to change and newness and its willingness to stick to certain things unless there's a good reason for moving on. Otherwise it would be changing its mind about everything all the time. So everything in life is a matter of balancing things and coming to a position which honours and respects and enhances by integrating the two things that we think are separate in some way, but they're not really separate. I agree. Now let's not make of your particular biographies as a friend of mine says, a universal category, but I'd like to hear a bit about your own paths because it's clear that you've gone through the margins or the edge. You could even say cutting edge. You haven't followed the prescribed path. At your risk, you've succeeded. That's why maybe we don't have your other people who didn't make it, but you've made it and in a way your paths are similar in that respect. And what does that tell us as a model or what it doesn't tell us as a model for other people? Well, I suppose we're both feral academics and we were both fellows of colleges in Oxford, me at Cambridge and we somehow escaped from domestication and lived in the wild. As much in the wild as you. I mean, you were treated to the fastnesses of the Western Isles. I'm merely on the edge of Hampstead Heath. But I find, I don't know if you do, that very often now, and I didn't think this was always the case, but very often now, the really interesting ideas are coming forth from places that are not in the middle of the mainstream. They're coming from people who are working on their own or working in small groups and these are producing highly interesting and imaginative propositions whereas in the mainstream there's far too much emphasis on not stepping out of line, not rocking the boat, and if you say something that isn't what your colleagues are saying, then you won't get promoted, you won't get a grant and all the rest. So it must be deadening actually living like that and I'm just not prepared to live like that and I don't expect you to be a writer. No, no, but it does. I mean, it's not a career path one can recommend to other people because it's not very easy to survive outside the framework of regular salaries. Alex is a uniquely privileged being Spanish in a way that we can't be being British because being a scientist in Spain is to be part of the civil service and once you've got tenure as he has, then you've got it for life and so he can do what he likes. So he's in a uniquely privileged position of having an actual salary which neither of you or I have had for a very long time and the freedom to be inquiring into all these things and talking to you and me and investigating all sorts of areas of science with a remarkable freedom. Two caveats here. One is once you've got tenure, that's one caveat and what has happened to those who didn't get it and were perhaps more valuable and also those who got it, how the whole process has shaped their minds, that's one thing and the second paradox is I have many colleagues who got tenure but they continue, I mean, probably some of them may want to continue doing what they're doing but even having tenure, like some people say, I'll wait until I retire and then I'll write that book or that idea and perhaps that's also a good idea to do it later but maybe it's too late. Maybe it's too late often, I think. One you need to get to tenure and even if you get there, it's no guarantee for anything of that. No, it doesn't guarantee people or take you seriously. I mean, I used to think that people who got the Nobel Prize would have enough confidence to do and say what they think and would be taken seriously but actually even the Nobel Prize is no guarantee. Brian Josephson, for example, at Cambridge, well, as soon as he got interest in psychic phenomena and the nature of consciousness although he's a professor with tenure, as a Nobel laureate, a fellow of Trinity College, his colleagues make sure he doesn't get students and that he's marginalized, etc. because his views are untenable in their eyes. So even the Nobel Prize and tenure, it may guarantee a certain freedom of manoeuvre but it doesn't guarantee that what one does will have much influence. The influence is perhaps another matter but I haven't found that, I mean, largely being in the mainstream race of my life has impeded me. I mean, because I was, you know, I was a fellow of Oxford College and I became a psychiatrist and director at the Bethelman Morsley Hospital in London which is of all the institutions of mental health, one of the most, you know, central in the world. And I was salaried but of course there was freedom to use what one saw and think in another way and I think it's open to more people than one thinks. They don't have to go out completely on a limb but if you look at what you experience and think about it in a deeper, broader context, you see something different. And I just think that an awful lot of people see what they're doing in science as sort of self-evident and not raising further questions. It's a rather unusual kind of mind that asks the question, so why does it actually do that? Why does it work like that? And I have found one of the best books on this topic is Erwin Chargaff's autobiography, Heraklite and Fire. You know, he was a very great, honoured biochemist at Yale who laid the groundwork for Crick and Watson and so on, the author of Chargaff's Rules, but he writes brilliantly and with enormous imagination about what he sees science to be and he contrasts it with this extremely deadening, simple following out of linear paths. I think it's partly a result of the massive expansion and professionalisation of science. Exactly. I mean, so he would say in World War, it becomes a career path. It was a struggle. In the 19th century a lot of scientists in Britain were either amateurs like Charles Darwin who never had an academic job. Faraday was at the Royal Institution, not in the university, in a rather eccentric small institution. But when it became professionalised, something that T. H. Huxley was one of the drivers of in Britain, to make science a professional, like a priesthood, where only people who got the right degrees and qualifications could teach it and influence people through universities. The school system and what was taught in schools and all that was professionalised. And then you've got to have the right qualifications. His aim was to squeeze out country vicos who did wonderful natural history, who believed in God. He thought no one in science should believe in God, or if they did, it should be kept at least very much their private life. You've got to have two priestshoods. That's right. You have one priesthood and then this model of scientists as priests then spread to the Soviet Union. Scientists were the highest rank of the intellectuals and all that kind of thing. And so it became all over the world. In countries like India and China, engineers and scientists are very, very high prestige. They're not terribly high prestige in Britain because they're regarded as boffins and geeks and things. The highest prestige goes to people who've been to Eaton and Oxford and who belong to the Bollinger Club and become conservative prime ministers, at least for a while. So they don't know that the person you're referring to currently enjoys great esteem in the country. No, no. It's only temporary. It shows these things are always temporary. But still, the point is that in Britain, scientists have never commanded, Newton's being venerated and Darwin's being venerated and so on, but it's never been like there's quite the priesthood level that it achieves in many other countries. But nevertheless, it's the idea is of a kind of priesthood. And then you've got all the ranks of the sort of deacons and sub-deacons and stuff. It becomes a whole professional thing. Then it becomes a career. And when I lived in India, I worked with Indian scientists. I was an Indian International Scientific Institute. Most of my Indian scientific colleagues had not gone into science because of a deep curiosity about nature. They'd gone into it because their parents believed in education and science and medicine and engineering were the three top careers. And so any bright children had been pushed into that and pushed in their studies and pushed through the university. And then they got jobs in high prestige institutions if they worked hard enough. And their whole social status and the ability to marry off their daughters to more prestigious husbands in an arranged marriage system moved them up the social scale instead. It wasn't at all about curiosity for most of them. And I think for many scientists today here in Britain, it's not primarily about deep curiosity about nature. It's about being a functionary within a system. Well, as Whitehead said, this divorce between science and philosophy has been a congestion of both. And I think that science properly understood is a form of philosophy. It's an investigation of philosophy in certain particular empirical methods. But it has philosophical implications and it draws on philosophical principles that it's outset. You may not understand that it does that. But that's more dangerous when people don't realize what it is they're doing. They don't do it well. But I think that we need to get back to the understanding that science has philosophical meaning and that this is not enough discussed. If one needs philosophically minded scientists and scientifically minded philosophers, philosophers who are willing to spend time learning about the science that will give them insights into the forming of their philosophy. Well, I mean, here in Britain the word science wasn't introduced until the 19th century. And before that it was called natural philosophy. And Newton's great book, Principia Mathematica, the mathematical principles of natural philosophy. So I think that natural philosophy is actually a really good word and for it. I'm a member of the main Cambridge University Scientific Society which is called the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Because when it was started in the early 19th century it was called natural philosophy as Cambridge. I subscribed to biological reviews which was on the main review journals in biology, the subtitles of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. So I think natural philosophy is what you are. I like to think it's what I and Alex are too. And I think that probably most people who listen to us are natural philosophers. And so in a sense it's a matter of recovering what was the root of what we now call science. Before it was hijacked by this professionalization movement and this creation of this priesthood and making it an exclusive professional organization that you have to obey the rules of. One of the things I feel about the age we live in is the predominance of the administrative or bureaucratic mind over almost every aspect of our lives. And I think this is deeply damaging and I think it's an exhibition of the left hemisphere's way of both trying to understand but misunderstanding what it's dealing with and above all to control it. And I think that what has happened is that yes, I understand the analogy with the church but what has really happened is that something much less glamorous has happened in science which is simply that it's become a huge bureaucracy. It has money to spend which follows people who tow the party line do more of what everyone else is doing and it's very difficult in this sclerotic hierarchy as it would be in the middle of an enormous Byzantine civil service to be able to break out and see something else or do something else. So I think the future will depend on the development of small private colleges where people are very much you take in only the brightest people. I think that's very important. We're sort of worried by the concept of elitism but looked at another way. Education depends on and our future depends on people who have the capacity to think clearly and to think imaginatively being encouraged and that's what a good college should be doing in my view. And so I think it's from those small institutions which are beginning to spring up in competition with the great universities that the future will flourish. And I'm sorry about that because I have a great allegiance for the enormously interesting and valuable history of our great institutions. I'm very sorry to say this but they're beginning to turn themselves into something that can be easily dispensed with. How to prevent those institutions from following the same path and also how to solve the accreditation problem there? Because in a way that I wanted to ask you both this very question like you have navigated outside the institutional seas but nevertheless there's some appreciation for institutions still in both of you. Very much so, yes. How much of it can we still embrace and how much we need to just reject? So back to the future, these future scientists and philosophers are they going to be in institutions and if they're not, how is the new order or the new business going to be in terms of accreditation and so on? It's like designing a new Atlantis you know, what's the new new Atlantis? Four hundred years later. Well I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know but I think that what you say in the sense that there needs to be an institution but it may not be these institutions I think is right. I mean everything evolves and evolution is partly that things have their proper period and the great universities, Oxford and Cambridge for example have a thousand year history they're currently committing suicide in my view by not sticking to their guns and so this means that other institutions will spring up because there's a natural need to nourish those who will benefit from being given freedom and discipline together and the time to fulfill these things. Let me tell you something about my own experience which will sound horribly, you know, I don't know, unusual but I got this fellowship at 21 of all souls and I was to embark on a doctorate on 18th century English literature and this fellowship was a seven year fellowship after examination there's this strange thing that doesn't have any equivalent to Cambridge or anywhere else in Oxford of a college that consists only of fellows not of any students, graduate or otherwise and when you become a fellow after examination which is a three day examination if you become one you get seven years in which to do whatever it is that interests you intellectually and Derek Parfit, a very well-known philosopher said to me, don't do your doctorate anybody can do a doctorate, that's part of the sort of machinery but you've been given something completely extraordinary which is seven years in which you can pursue ideas and I thought he was absolutely right and at the time I followed all kinds of interests in science, in other languages, in literature, in philosophy and at the time I thought, you know, this is wonderful but I didn't realise until much later in my life why it had been so important and I'm not sure that even, I don't know enough I mustn't speak about what I'm not certain of but I think that the ethos of all souls is rather changed as everything does and there's more of that, you know, we must keep an eye on what he's reading and has he published a paper and all that but I was free of that and later in life I thought, well what did I make of that? and to me the answer came with the publication of these books because I couldn't possibly have written them unless I'd been allowed to range wild, as you should say but I did it within an institution over the fields of things from which I drew the bigger picture I've tried to express in these books which can only be done if you've had the ability to range so this business of range which is exactly the opposite of the tendency towards ever greater specialism is very, very important and I think that more institutions ought to follow what happened in the 60s which was, you know, institutions used to take people that had proved themselves to be intelligent and give them carte blanche and they gave them an office, gave them an income for a few years and then said, follow your instincts, you know, what you find interesting and out of that came many, many inventions Well I had a very similar period of freedom to you and actually I feel enormously grateful for it and I had two periods of freedom First of all, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge I became increasingly disenchanted with mechanistic science which I was studying I started reading Goethe and I had the idea of a holistic science and everyone assumed I'd go on and do a PhD because I got a double first but I wasn't sure if I wanted to I mean I liked science but I didn't like killing animals all the time and I didn't like treating them as machines and the whole attitude of mechanistic science so I found there was this fellowship at Harvard that was open to people from Cambridge for a year in the graduate school, I applied for it and I got it and when I got to Harvard to do history and philosophy of science to step back to see the bigger picture, that's what I wanted to do I found that they treat graduate students at Harvard in a way I hadn't been treated since I was about 15 read these pages this week, read those and we'll test you to make sure you've read it it was spoon feeding, there was no freedom I tried doing what they said and after about a month I just couldn't do it, I mean you'd have to stay up till midnight every night to read all this stuff and they'd test you there was no time to read anything else to study anything else that interested you it was completely on their own track so I went to see the professor of history of science who was in charge of me and I said look, I love being here at Harvard and I'm really interested in these subjects this isn't the way I learn and this isn't the way I work I don't really need a master's degree from Harvard because I can buy one from Cambridge for 75 pounds and in those days all you had to do was stay alive for three and a third years and pay five pounds and you've got a master's degree if you've got a bachelor's, same as Oxford same as Oxford, yes so presumably you bought yours too or maybe you didn't bother yes, it came to me automatically I don't think I had to pay oh yes, I had to pay five pounds so I said to the professor I just don't need your master's degree and he said are you sure and he said there's a Harvard master's degree and I said well I'm quite sure I'll get a Cambridge one and I said is there any way out and just be here for a year and be part of the university and not do all these exams and tests and things I said I think that would be much more useful and valuable for me he said well actually we do have a rarely used provision called special students and he said and I said well can you make me one and he said well I'd have to talk to the committee and stuff so anyway I got him to register they agreed and I was registered as a special student so I was there in the graduate school at Harvard I was doing a bit of teaching to earn a bit of money in the natural sciences program in biology labs in biology 101 I was teaching lab classes but otherwise, apart from my obligation to do that I had complete freedom I went to lectures in history of art and philosophy and classics in history I had the entire I got the university catalogue and I went through the list of lectures every week and I did a lot of philosophy in history of science but I had an entire university at my disposal and whenever I was doing exams I just caught the train to New York and had fun in New York for a few days and it was the most blissful way of being at a university and then later when I got my fellowship at Clare College in Cambridge it started as a research fellowship and it was I had a six year research fellowship where my teaching load was limited to six hours a week of tutorials and since in Cambridge, like Oxford, the vacations last six and a half months a year this is only six hours a week for five and a half months a year and actually less than that because half a month is exams it was not exactly an onerous teaching burden it was the nicest form of teaching to students at a time informally in tutorials and the rest of the time I was completely free I don't think I even read annual reports then I got a research fellowship from the Ross site and I did have to write a one page annual report but I was completely free and quite into it when I said to the college I just got this thing from the Ross site a tropical research grant and I'm going off to the University of Malaya for a year to study rainforest plants and travelling through India on the way they said well fine it was an incredible period for me laid the foundation for everything I've done since so like you given an extraordinary freedom within an institutional framework which was vastly valuable now very very few people have that opportunity absolutely and you know what I want to emphasise is I like you I think it's very important like you I feel very grateful for having been given it my worry is that it won't be given in the future to many people but I think it's important we live in an era of micro-management and I think micro-management produces only mediocrity if you're constantly controlling and dictating what people read and think you'll only get mediocrity and if you give people a degree of freedom okay there's a risk that they will abuse it and they won't come up with something but it's a much smaller risk than the risk of micro-managing them which ensures that they will never come up with anything interesting so you actually have to in a way trust you have time to people to explore things that are of interest to them otherwise it's the death of the life of the mind it's for this reason that so many as we both know in the past so much of the science of the 18th and 19th century and even into the 20th century comes from the work of priests of vickers of monks I mean Mendel was a monk they weren't part of any particular mainstream but they had the security of a place and they were allowed to think and observe and ask interesting questions why do people work in this way well I think one simple way this could be achieved at the strike of a pen is simply changing the name of unemployment benefit to research grants so then we could have lots of people on research grants and the stigma of being on unemployment would be transformed at least for some people yes very nice because we after all have a lot of people who are economically idle as in we're in the classification of governments who are actually being paid by the state and so much of that could be repurposed I mean mostly people are disempowered by being unemployed if this could be seen as a positive thing and also another idea it's only academics really that have sabbatical years which is supposed to be a year in which you can enjoy the kind of freedom we're talking about to be refreshed and so on and so another scheme would be to make sabbatical years optional for everybody so when you're at 40 or 50 or 60 you could take an optional sabbatical year and you'd take a cut in income, you'd take leave from your regular job and you'd get the unemployment benefit which would now be a redesignated research grant or a sabbatical grant it wouldn't cost the state anymore because they're paying lots of people not to work anyway and by empowering people who are not working in regular jobs to think of themselves as doing something different it could be voluntary work it could be natural history it could be scientific research there could be small grants for people on sabbaticals to set up experiments in their garages and stuff it could fuel a whole wealth of invention throughout the population I'm sure you were right almost no extra cost and one thing I know from experiences a practical skill that it has been enormously satisfying probably more satisfying than almost anything else and so encouraging people not just to feel demoralized and not have any goal it might be better to allow people to train to develop a skill which is a very life enhancing thing and useful to society there's not enough skilled labour ones always looking for people who can do this or that or the other and maybe that should be part of the scheme as well there's already government schemes for people in deprived areas economically for retraining there's already retraining grants I haven't looked into how they're administered but I imagine that if one got into the details of existing bureaucracy and existing grant structures some of it could be repurposed in a way that's along the lines you're suggesting some of it's intended for that so I think within the present system there's probably quite a lot of potential for revisioning what people can learn and do so drawing things together perhaps there's a need to break out of the straight jacket of these people are unemployed and therefore just waiting to get back into this horrible machine there's life outside the machine there are other things that can be developed for all of us depending on what is both practical for us and enjoyable for us to develop and it's about abandoning this micromanaging administrative approach to education to science and allowing people to develop the skills that they have innately in other words education should be a matter of growing things not inserting things and at the moment it's mainly about inserting things but it's interesting one of the things that's happening at the moment is the so called skill shortage or employment shortage I read an article just yesterday the mystery of why we have very low unemployment at the moment in Britain and yet you can't get people to do jobs but there's large numbers of people who are economically inactive and so most people in Britain assume the skills shortage or labour shortage is because of Brexit no immigration from Europe but those are very similar when we were in Canada in the summer they have the same situation there in western Canada it's the same in the United States what seems to have happened is that a large number of people have just voluntarily retired from the labour force before retirement age simply can't be bothered to have a job and that must mean a drop in income but there's millions of people prepared to take that rather than carry on well what that tells you is that a lot of people's jobs are very unrewarding and I think what's really sad is that jobs that are in the past are obviously rewarding like being a teacher or a doctor I think people are probably not keen to, we know there's a shortage of doctors there's a shortage of teachers and I think that's partly to do with the way again a management culture has taken over from a professional culture and the individual is no longer allowed to pursue interests and it's entirely micromanaged like the Harvard thing today you read these things or you read those so we need to stop this and there was a wonderful moment of creativity early on in the Covid crisis when managers couldn't keep up with the situation and doctors said well the hell with it we're going to do what we think will work and lots of things were experimented with and some of them were successful and some of them not but this is a good situation there's one in which doctors use their experience are not told what to do by a manager who has no experience and in closing it's not only important we talk about it but again let me say both of you are examples that this can be done so I think it's useful again to have the discussion but to show that there are living examples and it's not easy but it can be done and hopefully more people in the future will be able to we've been very fortunate yes very fortunate both within and outside institutions all right thank
