0	20240	Well, Alex and I are about to talk about a book that I wrote over about the last 10 years called
20240	25360	The Matter With Things, subtitled Our Brains, Our Delusions and The Unmaking of the World.
26000	32720	I was very fortunate that Alex approached me to talk some more about this. We don't know how many
32720	37840	sessions we will do, but we thought we'd start at any rate at the beginning of the book and discuss
37840	45600	that and see where we go. Alex is a remarkable person. I'm personally in awe of his curriculum
45600	52880	vitae. He is a theoretical physicist by training and has a couple of doctorates in physics,
52880	63600	but he then retrained as a biologist and has worked on molecular biology and empirical zoology,
63600	73120	but also on the theory of the theoretical aspects of biology and is currently a professor at the
73120	83680	Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante. He is a person with a remarkable breadth of interest
83680	92640	and mind. This is very nice for me because I find that I don't easily fit into any particular box.
94320	100400	I'm generally interested in philosophy and have been since my younger years. I started out training
100400	107920	in literature and humanities and then read medicine and became a psychiatrist with particular
107920	116720	interest in the overlapping areas of psychology and neurology. We need to see what happens and
116720	123280	I'm very excited about it. Well, thank you again. It's a pleasure, really, and an honor to take
123280	129440	part in this journey with you and to continue learning from you and with you as we cover your
130000	134720	really, really remarkable book. Thank you. Well, thank you very much.
136880	143200	Before going on, I thought I might just give a brief overview of the introduction, which is
143200	148800	something like 50 pages long, and it's that that we're going to be discussing this morning. See how
148800	159360	that goes. This particular book, The Matter with Things, arises from something I have been
159360	166720	thinking over all my adult life, which is that there is something wrong with the way in which we
166720	175200	are taught by popular science and many of the voxpop thinkers that are on the internet, the way
175200	179920	we're taught to think about the world. And it's really part also of the way in which we educate
179920	188800	the young. That is to liken it to a machine, a mechanism that has meaning only insofar as we
188800	196480	put it into that world. But when we come to look at the world, what we're really faced with is a
196480	206720	collection of meaningless fragments of material stuff colliding with itself in ways that are to
206720	214320	an extent predictable, but largely chaotic. And that this has no intrinsic beauty, complexity,
214320	220720	structure, meaning, or direction. That has never seemed to me at all convincing.
221600	231760	What I want to do in this book, or what I wanted to do in this book, was to explain why that vision
231760	237760	of the world is to me not a convincing one and to offer an alternative. So in the introduction,
237760	244960	I ask us to reconsider some of our assumptions about the world. For example, that there is only
244960	253920	there is only matter that that matter is naturally speaking, static until it is set in motion,
254960	265920	that things are essentially atomistic until they're connected by us, that structures are,
266880	275760	in essence, simple, and then evolve from that simplicity into a greater complexity. And what
275760	284560	to suggest is all these ideas are wrong, that we've inverted the evidence that we have before us.
284560	292240	The evidence is, I will argue, that consciousness is every bit as real as matter. And that matter,
292400	299040	in fact, is something we know secondarily by consciousness, not the other way around, that
300000	304640	the natural condition of things is not as in the Newtonian universe out of stasis,
305440	311360	but is of motion. And what needs to be explained is not how things come to move,
311360	316160	but how they ever come to be static. And I indeed argue that they are never truly static.
316640	324880	I will argue that the world is not principally chaotic, nor that structures are, in essence,
324880	331920	simple. These are products of the way we come to look at the world. In fact, there is no such
331920	340880	thing as chaos. Randomness cannot really be any more than approximated. Everything has intrinsic
341680	351440	structure. And what is simple in our eyes is simple, not because it's somehow what existed
351440	357840	before things became complex. Things have always been complex, but our way of looking at them can
357840	365120	share off most of the picture that surrounds what we're looking at, and thus make it appear simple,
365200	373360	and to obey simple linear laws. Whereas, in reality, nothing in the cosmos behaves in this
373360	379520	mechanistic way. So those are some of the assumptions I set out with. And then I want to
380240	387120	talk about the way in which the two hemispheres of the brain change the world that we look at,
387120	392240	because obviously, if I'm interested in examining what we can take as more real,
392240	399120	more true than anything else, we need to take into account that how we tend to the world changes
399120	405760	what is there for us to see. In an earlier book called The Master and His Emissary,
405760	412720	I explained that the two hemispheres of the brain have evolved as all neural networks that we know
412720	421920	are going back 700 million years show an asymmetry. Why is there this asymmetry? It appears to be to
422640	429840	with the most basic problems of survival for any living creature. And that is how to pay attention
429840	439040	to an isolated detail, something that is a mortal that we want to eat, prey that we want to catch,
439040	444560	a twig that we want to pick up to build a nest, anything that we want to grab and get and manipulate,
445200	453200	which requires a highly focused, targeted attention to a precisely visualized detail.
454320	461920	And at the same time, not for prey ourselves to predators that are in our surroundings.
461920	469680	So at the same time as paying this very focused, detailed attention to one particular item,
470480	476560	we need to be paying the exact opposite, a kind of broad, open, sustained, vigilant attention
476560	483680	in which we can see what is unfolding around us. We can see dangers, we can see the presence of
483680	488480	the creatures that form part of our social network, those that we want to nourish,
488480	494560	those that we need to flee from. So that is a very, very essential aspect of being alive.
495280	502400	And in the human case, it is eventuated in the two hemispheres of the brain, which are
504080	509120	different in a number of respects, but all of these can be traced to the way in which they
509120	515520	pay attention. If, as in the case of the left hemisphere, you pay this very narrow,
515520	521600	beam, highly focused, targeted attention to detail, then the world appears to be
521600	527440	created out of a heap of fragments, little pieces here, there, and everywhere that are
527440	533440	isolated atomistic in themselves, meaningless, sheared off from any context that might give
533440	538880	the meaning static, because this is the attention that fixes and freezes things so that you can
538880	548400	get hold of them, and essentially inanimate. Whereas the right hemisphere, seeing continuity
548400	555440	over time and continuity over space, sees a world in which everything is interconnected seamlessly,
556160	562720	in which things are never fixed but constantly changing and flowing, in which context is vital
562720	567920	importance to understanding what it is that we're looking at, in which everything is charged with
567920	575120	many layers of meaning, and which is essentially an animate world. One way of looking at this
575120	581440	difference is that the left hemisphere sees something like a very simplified diagram that
581440	587280	we create after the event of experience. So the right hemisphere, as it were, experiencing the
587280	595440	world, it is bringing the thing into being for us, and the left hemisphere is representing,
595440	600880	in other words, literally after the fact of it's being present, is making it present again,
600880	606400	when it no longer truly is present, in the shape of a theory, a diagram, a schema, or a map.
607040	614400	And this difference between the world in theory and as it is mapped by the left hemisphere, which
614400	621120	sees everything in mechanical terms, is quite different from the living vibrant world that
621120	626640	the right hemisphere sees without making presumptions about its mechanical nature.
627200	633920	Because I'm suggesting that attention changes the world, I need to clarify that I don't mean
633920	642720	that we make up the world in a purely idealist way, that there is no real world at all, but it's
642720	650880	just what the product of our mind produces. I'm not saying that, but I'm also not saying that there
651840	661360	is just simply, naively, a world out there that is purely objective and has nothing of us in it,
661360	667680	and that the way to understand it is to exclude our attention entirely from the process. That will
667680	672240	produce certainly a version of the world, but a very remarkable one in which everything that
672320	681760	makes it valuable to us has been taken out of the picture. Then I give some of the core ideas of
682400	690240	the hemisphere hypothesis, as I have developed it, some 20 perhaps differences that one can see
690240	695120	between the ways in which the right and left hemisphere deliver the world, the nature of
695120	700880	those differences, and they address some of the potential causes of confusion. So over the last
700880	706800	decade or so people have raised perfectly valid questions about what it is I'm saying, but which
706800	716080	are misunderstandings of what I'm trying to convey, and so I address some of those. I also
716080	721840	address the question of should we go beyond the facts. This is something that scientists sometimes
721840	727360	say when one looks at scientific findings in a philosophical way, as though they had
728160	735360	as though they had significance for us as human beings. There is no way they cannot have
735360	744400	significance for us, and most great scientists have also seen that what we find in empirical
744400	751680	science helps us shape the picture of the world. And what I want to do is to reintroduce philosophy
751680	758000	to science and science to philosophy. They're natural companions. In fact, until probably 200
758000	764080	years ago they would have been thought of as aspects of the same business of coming to understand
764080	772480	what there is in the world. And I think that I can offer a way in which we can make progress in
772480	780400	philosophy, because in following the argument that I lay out both in the master and his emissary
780400	789360	and in the matter with things in more detail in the more recent book, one can see what the hallmarks,
789360	795680	the characteristics are of the way in which the world seems to the left hemisphere and the way
795680	804720	in which the world seems to the right hemisphere. And if it's possible to evaluate how reliable
805280	812880	either of these visions is, we can then, for the first time, make some progress in philosophy.
812880	816640	If there are two conflicting points of view, we don't just have to shrug our shoulders and say,
816640	822880	well, some people say this, and some people have said that. We can say, yes, this particular vision
822880	829760	is typical of what happens when the left hemisphere gets hold of the world and tries to make sense of
829760	835120	it. And this other picture is an attempt to convey what the right hemisphere sees there.
835120	842320	Now, if, and that's of course a big if, which we will have to explore, if we can show that one of
842320	847680	these visions, and spoiler alert, I'm going to suggest that this is the vision of the right
847680	855520	hemisphere, sees more of what there is, and is a more reliable witness for us to base our activities
855520	862160	in the world, our experience of the world, our reaction to the world on, then we can make that
862160	869440	step and identify where certain trains of thought are to be attributed to the right or the left
869440	877520	hemisphere. And I think that's probably enough to say here, except perhaps to give a brief note
877520	883760	about the structure of the book. So it's in three parts, although physically in two volumes. The
883760	891600	first part of the book is neuropsychology, in which I aim to look at the ways in which we can get a
891600	899440	hold on the world at all, the means or portals whereby the world comes to be experienced by us.
899440	906480	And I take those to be things like attention, perception, which is not the same as attention,
907440	914240	judgments formed on what we tend to and how we perceive it, the ways in which we grab hold of
914240	921680	things and use them in the world, our emotional and social intelligence, our cognitive intelligence,
921680	928640	and indeed our creativity, all these help to bring about the basic view of the world that we have to
928640	934720	operate on. The second part of the book, as I've mentioned, is epistemology. I look at what are
934720	942880	the ways open to us to take further the data that we have through those portals or means that I've
942880	950560	just described. One of them is science. We can, in the practice of science, we can use our senses and
950560	958320	our various intellectual and imaginative faculties to create a picture of the world that helps us
958320	966000	understand it. Another would obviously be reason. A third, I suggest, would be intuition and a
966000	971920	fourth, imagination. And I look at each of those in part two of the book and suggest that, in fact,
971920	978160	we cannot dispense with any of these, but need to bring them to bear in different ratios and in
978160	984800	different ways on everything that we come to look at. And that's interesting in each case,
984800	993120	the view of the right hemisphere is the one that gives most power to each of those paths to truth,
994720	999440	toward truth, because of course we can't ever actually reach that truth in itself.
1000400	1006000	And that takes me to part three, which is the second physical volume of the book,
1006000	1013280	which is metaphysics. When we apply what we found in parts one and two to the universe,
1013280	1019360	what do we find? And this involves looking at the basic elements of the cosmos, things like
1019360	1026400	time and space, matter and consciousness, but also things such as values and the sense of the sacred.
1027040	1034480	So that is the outline of the book and it's that that I try to convey in this introductory part
1034480	1039840	of the book. So Alex, that's probably as much as I need to say at the moment, probably more than
1039840	1047920	enough. And I'd like to hand over to you now, because I'm sure you've got comments and questions.
1047920	1052640	Sure. I mean, that's fantastic. And one can see there's so much to unpack. And that's
1053360	1058640	the reason why we're doing this, actually, to have this conversation. So yours is obviously
1058640	1064080	an ambitious task. And it's an important task. And you argue that it's also an urgent task.
1064080	1069840	And as you also mentioned a minute ago, and there are all these isms, right, materialism,
1069840	1074720	reductionism, representationalism, or there are all these connection of isms that in a way,
1075440	1080720	well, you're fighting against or even better, you're trying, as you said, to invert or correct
1081280	1086480	kind of the hierarchy or the superiority they have on other ways of understanding the world.
1086480	1090560	Now, a distinction that you make that I think it's really, really powerful. And that's what I
1090560	1097440	would like to discuss now for a little for a little time is this distinction between apprehending
1097440	1103680	and comprehending as as illustrating this radically different views of seeing the world.
1103680	1109040	And one has to do with manipulation, of course, and the other one with understanding. And I think
1109040	1114080	just from the words themselves and the roots of the works, it is very powerful both as a summary
1114080	1121680	and also as a as a root of the of the cause of all these preference for certain isms that you're
1121680	1127600	saying pop thinkers present as if they were true, actually, which are, in my view, abstractions.
1127600	1135840	And to confront these with experience, and also a avoiding the common distrust we have
1135840	1139760	on experience. But I wanted to ask you about experience later, but maybe we could continue
1139760	1143520	with apprehending and comprehending, because it's very useful to me.
1144960	1151600	Yes, thank you for drawing attention to that. I use the word apprehend in a specific sense,
1151600	1157360	which is its original sense of grasping hold of something. And this comes from the Latin root
1157920	1166240	add and prehendery, prehendery, to take hold and add to go to it and take it. And this is
1167200	1172960	the function I suggest from an evolutionary point of view of the left hemisphere to enables
1172960	1182720	us to manipulate the world. The right hemisphere, I suggest comprehends helps us understand the
1182720	1187920	world. And that comes from a root and Latin meaning to take together. And that's really an
1187920	1196880	important point, because an awful lot of what I'm talking about is what follows from whether you
1196880	1205280	see things as a whole, and only move to focus on a part, taking into account that you're looking
1205280	1211280	in an artificial way as part of a whole. And the other way of looking at it, which is you try and
1211280	1216240	break it down into the smallest parts, you can understand those and then build it back up from
1216240	1222560	there. That is, of course, how we make a machine. And so it's the obvious way in which the part of
1222560	1228320	the mind that grasps things and takes them apart wants to view the cosmos itself, which it didn't
1228320	1235360	actually make, but imagines it is something like a machine that we could have constructed.
1235360	1240000	So that's an effective difference. And as I say, a sort of sound bike would be the left hemisphere
1240000	1245280	helps us apprehend or grasp and manipulate the world. The right helps us comprehend or
1245280	1251920	understand it. And that distinction, as I say, is an ancient one going back at least 700 million
1251920	1259040	years, and explains the otherwise baffling fact that the brain, a structure that is made to make
1259040	1265120	connections, and this power exists only in the number of connections it can make, has an enormous
1265120	1271120	divide down the middle. It's also asymmetrical. Why? And the band of tissues at the base of the brain,
1271120	1276320	the corpus callosum that connects those two aspects is often inhibitory. A lot of the work
1276320	1281520	it does is to tell the other hemisphere, keep out of this while I deal with it. That suggests that
1281520	1286640	there are two potent ways of viewing the world that mustn't interfere with one another if they're
1286640	1293040	each of them to work well to the end that they're designed to fulfill. All right, I'll come back to
1293040	1298400	apprehending and comprehending later. But since you, let's jump into the bihemispheric structure
1298480	1306800	of the brain, because that's also the soil on which all these ideas will grow. And so we have
1306800	1313200	these neurological facts that you've studied and put together in a remarkable way, because that
1313200	1320000	seems to be sometimes far beyond what one person alone can hold in their mind. But there are these
1320000	1326800	neurological facts that we will of course unpack. But then from here, you draw psychological
1326800	1332080	implications. And as you said, even later, also metaphysical consequences, not just from the
1332080	1338000	neurology, but also from physics and from philosophy itself. So maybe we could discuss a bit now,
1338000	1344320	or as much as needed, what are these neurological facts and probably advancing one of the usual
1344320	1351280	criticisms of the split brain hypothesis and what it means, which is that, well, fine, sure,
1351760	1356320	you know, there's split and there are all these inhibitory connections and so on. But
1357840	1363680	people may not be so comfortable saying more than that, as you were saying at the beginning,
1363680	1370000	like, drawing real-world consequences of what's purely, in a way, neuroscientific data. But let's
1370000	1375200	not say that there are two brains and two minds and two ways, because that seems hand-waving. I
1375200	1380960	think it's not at all. And probably that's a foundational stone of your whole argument. I
1380960	1386240	think it would be very useful for everybody to realize and for us to explain, for you to explain
1386240	1394480	us that, yes, there has been some pop psychological understanding of it, and you're not saying that.
1394480	1399040	You're saying something more precise and more potent in a way. So it's a good time, perhaps,
1399040	1405920	for you to explain that, if you may. Yes, that's a good idea.
1408880	1415040	I think it's not passed into popular culture that the idea of differences between the brain
1415040	1422880	hemispheres is somehow an exploded idea that carries no scientific credibility. And that's
1422880	1430480	because after the first brain operations were carried out in the 1960s and 70s in California,
1431760	1444080	the remarkable operations, we were able to study the phenomenology of one isolated hemisphere at a
1444080	1450240	time and see what it is like. And it was discovered that, indeed, the phenomenology of the left hemisphere
1450240	1456800	and the right hemisphere are, in fact, very different. The fact that we're not aware of that is
1456800	1463280	because evolution has taken care to hide it from us if we were aware that we're kind of fusing two
1463280	1467760	quite different visions of the world all the time. We wouldn't be able to do anything. We would be
1467760	1476400	completely incapable of action. But the fact that there was some very simple minded deduction
1476400	1482880	that's made in the early days, such as that the left hemisphere is linguistic and rational,
1482880	1489760	and the right hemisphere emotional and artistic, they may have vestiges of truth in them, but only
1489760	1496080	vestiges, because the picture is very much more complex than that. And each hemisphere, in fact,
1496080	1504960	deals with everything, including reason and emotion, and including creativity and reason.
1504960	1512800	So the old differences are to be dispensed with. And I think one of the first things I would say to
1512800	1517360	anybody is, put out of your mind everything you think you know about the differences between
1517360	1525680	the left and right hemispheres because they will be wrong. So it is an important distinction to
1525680	1531840	make, and I'm not just following up the old vision, but the question won't go away.
1531840	1538160	There is, at the core of our being, this fascinating division in the brain, and therefore
1538160	1547680	inevitably in the mental world. Why is it there? And what is its nature? And I unpack those ideas
1548240	1555920	in the whatever it is, nine chapters, I think, of part one, and we'll probably look at those in
1555920	1564160	greater detail on another occasion. Yeah. So here, let me add a kind of a food note
1564800	1571600	referring to your biography in a way, because I think it's remarkable that what you're putting
1571600	1577920	forth is it is a brave endeavor in the sense that you're walking a fine line, right? Because you're
1577920	1583440	emphasizing how the structure of the brain shapes this way of attending the world that we have as
1583440	1588480	individuals, and as a society, and as a culture, and as a civilization, right? But at the same time,
1588480	1593920	you have to be very careful, and you lay it out in the introduction where you explain first the
1593920	1599040	kind of headline differences between the hemispheres, and then the common confusions, because
1599600	1603440	since the publication of the master and his imagery, you've had time to see
1604080	1608240	what people think and what they criticize, right? So you need to walk this fine line by saying, well,
1608800	1614480	yes, I'm drawing a lot of neural data, but I am not saying that mind is just a derivative of
1614480	1622560	brain stuff, and so on and so forth, right? And this is also related to your path as a scholar,
1622560	1629040	right? Where you wanted to study this, which seems this hemisphere difference, which maybe
1629040	1634800	seemed like a worn out idea, but it was actually underexplored. So you were advised not to do so,
1634880	1639840	as I understand. Nevertheless, you went for it, right? So you see how interesting, I mean,
1639840	1644480	just again, it's a food note, because we'll go back to the content again. But I think,
1644480	1649440	as you ever say, context is being something very important. I want to draw attention to the fact of
1649440	1655680	the context as you, of you as a scholar, while approaching these ideas, because that's important
1655680	1661120	in the wider picture of things. There are these ideas that either are pushed to the side,
1661120	1666240	and if you want to go and study them, you're usually advised not to do so, because that's not
1666240	1672000	career building, but it's in doing that, that one can make progress. So if you don't mind to
1672640	1680000	tell us a bit more about that path of yours, and we can quickly go back to the content of the book,
1680000	1688880	if you wish. Yeah, as I mentioned, I, for my life, really, I've been interested in philosophical
1688880	1698400	questions. And in philosophy, one is looking at the structure of ideas, putting them in
1699120	1704720	contrast with one another, in connection with one another. And this is in some ways, the opposite
1704720	1713120	of what people often think the process of science should be, which is taking things apart, and looking
1713200	1722160	at them as separate discrete facts or data points. And this is so strong that we've lost really the
1722160	1728320	whole purpose of science, which in the end, yes, you have to do a lot of analysis, a lot of taking
1728320	1733520	things apart. But the purpose of doing so is not fulfilled just in doing that process. That's an
1733520	1739600	intermediary step. The whole point of doing that is to be able to use that information to enrich
1739600	1745680	one's understanding and one's picture of the whole. And in fact, I start from a point made by
1745680	1751600	Erwin Schrodinger in the years just after the Second World War, when he was lecturing in Cambridge,
1751600	1760160	Schrodinger, of course, one of the great figures in the development of quantum mechanics in the last
1760160	1770320	century. He said, really, the point of scientific research is only fulfilled in as much as it begins
1770320	1777600	to help us understand the question, who are we? And he's actually quoting Plotinus, a Greek scholar
1777600	1782880	of the third century. And what Plotinus was asking is the question that we seem to have lost sight of.
1782880	1789680	And I think he's a damagingly lost sight of, we seem to have lost any idea, the remotest idea
1789680	1795040	of who we are and what we're doing here. And it's in an effort to help understand that question
1795040	1804160	that I wrote in this book. So it's inevitable that one tries to see the picture in a sense that makes
1805040	1812400	sense as a whole and also makes sense in the context of a human life. What I found is that
1813200	1823600	a lot of people who are specialists in the field of neurology have gravitated to my ideas. But
1823600	1831120	those who work purely in laboratory science in the neurosciences have tended not to. And I think
1831920	1838480	what we see there is that there is no way in which somebody who is a physician or a surgeon who is
1838480	1845600	actually dealing with real people can ignore the blatant evidence that these two parts of the brain
1846640	1853440	work in different ways and produce different kinds of experience for the individual. Whereas if you
1853440	1860080	are looking at a technical detail distanced by expensive and elaborate machinery in a laboratory,
1860080	1864480	you will neither be thinking in terms of where this fits into the whole picture,
1864480	1870080	nor will you welcome somebody who comes along and says, actually this has human meaning. So that
1870080	1880880	is the conflict I think. But I'm so convinced that there is meaning here. This was apparent to me
1880880	1887440	20 or 30 years ago and was enough at that stage. I knew very much less than I do now. But I could
1887440	1895520	also already see certain important connections. And it was that that led me to be audacious enough
1895520	1903520	to disregard the kind and very well meant advice of my mentors and older colleagues which was to
1903520	1908560	not touch this question of hemisphere difference with a barge pole because it would be career
1908560	1919760	destroying. Somehow I have a perverse desire to face certain risks if they seem important and
1919760	1926080	central enough. And I just want to, before I finish on this, I just want to pick up something you've
1926080	1933760	said there which was that I don't suggest that the mind is purely an emanation of the brain. We'll
1933760	1942480	come on to that very much later in other talks, I hope. But what at least one can say is that
1943200	1949680	the way in which we think our mental world is to some extent shaped by the brain, may not be
1949680	1955920	caused by the brain, but it is nonetheless formed by the brain. It has to come via the brain and
1955920	1961840	that leaves impression on our senses of work. Lovely. And actually this gets back into your,
1962640	1973360	again, your fine line walking between truth as something that's out there unattainable or something
1973360	1978800	that doesn't exist and putting in more towards a path to truth. And you are doing the same with
1978800	1985360	reality, which is what I wanted to ask you next. So you have in the introduction these
1985360	1993440	acronyms for the two views of conceiving reality, reality out there, R-O-T, I don't know if in
1993440	1998640	English that should be pronounced rot. And then you have the made up miraculously by ourselves,
1998640	2005920	the mambo version. And of course, again, you are in the virtuous middle. And in particular,
2005920	2010400	there is this quote of yours, which I would ask you to unpack, which I think can help
2010400	2015120	at least me because that's something I care a lot to understand. To what extent, as you said,
2015200	2021200	you're not saying the world is nothing of us, nor it just made up entirely by us.
2021200	2027360	And you're right. Quote, it is true that we can see the world only partially, but we still
2027360	2034720	each see the world directly. And I think this is, I think this is very important, especially,
2034720	2039920	I mean, this is an important problem always, but especially today, where, as you know, there are
2039920	2048880	these types of thinking, both in pop and psychology and science, but also injecting in the real people
2048880	2056080	of the real world, where we're drawn and hammered that the world is just an hallucination that
2056080	2062720	everything we perceive, it's kind of the matrix all the time. But it's a matrix where even if
2062720	2067120	you escape from the matrix, you would still doubt that you're still in a simulation again.
2067120	2073200	Now, having somebody right like you, that we see the world directly, which is something,
2073200	2077440	I believe as well, I think it's a very strong claim. And sometimes can be just
2078560	2084320	be there and modest in a paragraph. I think it's essential. So if you could also help us
2084320	2088000	understand your position with, again, with respect to idealism, and in what sense,
2089200	2095280	we have direct access to the world, which goes back to apprehending and comprehending, I think.
2095280	2102080	And also you emphasize representation or representing versus the world that's presented
2102960	2112160	to us without kind of a second hand dealer that hands it in. Yes. And indeed, even more
2115920	2123360	more striking is if one expresses it using neologism, which has come into philosophical
2123360	2129600	language from the German of Heidegger, the idea of something presencing, which is slightly
2129600	2135200	different from being is present, because his present sounds passive, as though the thing just
2135200	2141520	is manipulated, whereas presencing is something active. And I believe that the world actively
2141520	2148880	engages with our consciousness, which is also actively engaging with it. The idea that it's all
2148880	2155200	a hallucination or a projection on an internal screen is completely understandable, but I think
2155200	2161040	deeply mistaken. It's completely understandable in this sense. If the left hemisphere, which only
2161600	2168880	sees the representation of the world, were to try and explain what is going on, this is exactly
2168880	2174720	the picture it will come up with the idea of a homunculus sitting inside the brain, watching a
2174720	2181840	screen in a chamber that has no windows on the world, and that this is what we take for reality.
2182960	2193120	First of all, I think it would be remarkable if this were the case if there were as much agreement
2193120	2200720	between us as to what is going on in the world as there is. We mustn't emphasize, it's certainly
2200720	2206000	true that we can be deceived in what we find in the world. And some people see the world in a very
2206000	2211280	strange way, and this is often the case with people that we talk about as having a mental illness
2212160	2219120	hallucinating. But although that is a reality, the fact is that there is an extraordinary
2219120	2230400	commonality in the ways in which we find the world to be. What I try to explain is that it
2230400	2235360	is something like the way in which we appreciate a work of art, and perhaps particularly helpful is
2235360	2244000	a piece of music. So take the example of Mozart's G Minor Quintet. This is not something that just
2244000	2251680	exists in my mind, and it's not just something that exists in Mozart's mind, but it doesn't
2251680	2259680	actually exist on the page in the score either. It exists every time it is played or listened to.
2259760	2267040	It comes into being again in the minds of the players and the listeners. And this gives a rather
2267040	2272640	good way of understanding what I'm trying to get out, that it's neither something that we just make
2272640	2277920	up for ourselves miraculously, nor is it something that is out there objectively, and there is a
2277920	2283280	real G Minor Quintet of Mozart that is the ideal performance, and that's what we're trying to get
2283280	2289760	at all the time, but failing to do so. Instead I would suggest that there is an encounter,
2290480	2296880	and that experience is an encounter. I think this is a very, very important idea, and in an
2296880	2303760	encounter there are two elements, the encounterer and the encountered, but they are joined in a way.
2303760	2310080	They're not, again, atomistically separate. They, in this act of encounter, they come together to
2310080	2317920	create something. So, to an extent, it's always been newly created, that quintet, but in essence
2317920	2324720	it's always recognizably the same thing. We can all talk about it and have very similar
2324720	2330080	thoughts about it. That's probably the quickest and simplest way which I've ever conveyed. So,
2330080	2338880	what I want to emphasize is that when we see the world, it is only, indeed, an imperfect vision.
2338880	2344560	That, of course, I agree with, but the difference is not that it's imperfect because it is purely
2344560	2350480	a representation of something we can never know. It's only imperfect in the sense that it is partial,
2351680	2363280	and I make the comparison with a wonderful Zen garden, Ryoenji, in Japan, in which there are
2363280	2369760	15 rocks in this Zen garden, but from any one place in the garden, you can only see at the most
2369760	2375440	14. You can never see the full picture, and our lives are like that. We see parts, but we do
2375440	2381680	actually see it. What we see is not a hallucination. Yes, thank you. Well, this is very difficult to
2384240	2389920	unpack in a few minutes, and I'm sure we'll go back to it many times because, well, that has to
2389920	2397040	do with the process-relational view of the universe that I think you and I share, and this is very
2397040	2404080	difficult but also very important to try to spell out. Wonderful. Let me go back because, as you're
2404080	2410160	saying, well, and a smile came out of your face and mind, like when a neuroscientist, let's say,
2410800	2420960	is trying to justify or even claim, demonstrate that the world is nothing but the kind of
2420960	2427200	hallucination. In doing that, we have this sweet paradox where it's, if we can speak like that,
2429680	2434880	a hemisphere of the neuroscientist, again, making a claim about the whole of reality. So this brings
2434960	2443600	us back to these two modes and the asymmetry between them and, in a way, the irreversibility
2443600	2450960	in the sense that it seems very difficult, if not impossible, to just, especially the left one,
2450960	2460960	realizing that the right one has a different view of the world. But you're proposing here an
2460960	2465920	integration. So in a way, you're writing about both hemispheres and you're giving us all this
2465920	2472720	important detail and analysis. So in a way, you're using one mode, but then you always need to have
2473280	2480480	the master in its proper place to go back to the title of your previous book. So in a way,
2480480	2486480	the way, so I'm saying this in order to ask you, what's the way out? Because it seems to me that
2486480	2491920	if you fall into one mode of thinking, you can make amazing discoveries and say a lot of things,
2491920	2497120	but in a way, you're not going to get out of it alone, because that's the very nature of being
2497120	2503120	in that mode of thinking and seeing the world. You cannot go from, again, the barge to the
2503120	2508560	whole. You cannot go from all these isms or all these concepts you were enumerating at the beginning.
2508560	2515520	So it feels like a bit of bootstrapping is needed, or like a little miracle, so that when we are
2515520	2521360	trapped in it, the balance, the proper balance can come back to it. And I know you don't offer
2522080	2527920	solutions, because that would be perhaps, again, a left-brain way of thinking about it,
2527920	2533360	but you do offer a view that perhaps can help us see how do we get out of this
2533360	2538800	hole that we are digging ourselves. And I think that's very important also for civilization,
2539520	2547200	Ridlard. Well, yes, because as you know, in that earlier book, and to an extent in this book,
2548240	2556880	I make a case that our current thinking is dominated by this serial analytic
2557920	2563840	reductionist process, which is characteristic of the left hemisphere. And then, actually,
2563840	2569520	many of the great problems that we face, including the destruction of the natural world and the
2569520	2576880	destruction of our own civilization, which are both going on a pace, can be traced to this
2576880	2581680	way of looking at the world, which I believe is deeply related. Of course, it's not a matter that
2581680	2586880	is susceptible of proof in its nature. It's not just that I can't prove it. It's that it can't be
2586880	2594800	proven. And one of the first paradoxes is that if you view everything that is in the mind as a
2594800	2599360	hallucination, then, of course, your view that everything in the mind is a hallucination is
2599360	2605920	also your personal hallucination. And there is no way out of this particular box. But I offer
2606560	2617840	a way from experience in in two respects. One is to take the reader on a journey in part one of
2617840	2624720	the book that I think for anyone who is not actually a neuropsychiatrist or a clinical
2624720	2632080	neuropsychologist will be a remarkable eye opener, and even perhaps for such people. I'm looking at
2632160	2638480	actually what does happen to human beings when they start to deny purely or mainly on
2638480	2645520	hyponormacy or the right one here alone. And the other way in which I think I can say
2646960	2657840	I offer a pragmatic way of approaching it is that we if we want to evaluate two particular
2657840	2662960	points of view, one of the ways to do so would be to test it against experience.
2662960	2672480	Suppose I adopt a certain theory about humanity, and I act in that way. Do I find that I'm constantly
2672480	2678880	surprised, mistaken, or taken aback by the consequences of my doing so? Or do things
2678880	2686560	tend to fit with that vision of the world? And this is a point that has been made in respect of
2686560	2694640	the so-called pragmatist tradition in philosophy, that of C.S. Perse, John Dewey, and William
2694640	2703920	James, for example, in which, and I think a very rich one, in which the ideas of philosophy are not
2703920	2709920	simply thought about in a very abstract way, which would be a very left hemisphere, a biased way,
2709920	2718480	but tested out on experience. And what I find is that the vision of the world that the right
2718480	2729280	hemisphere offers us makes sense to us and doesn't betray us to the degree that it would be that the
2729280	2734320	left hemisphere's view of the world would betray us. And one way of thinking about this is like,
2734320	2739680	suppose you have a couple of banks of instruments and you're flying a plane and you
2739680	2745040	can't actually see, so you're relying very much on the electronics at the moment, and you're told
2745040	2751520	that there isn't enough power to run both of these ways of getting information about where you are,
2753440	2760560	which bank of instruments is more important to you, surely the one that minimizes the
2760560	2766640	likelihood of your crashing the plane. And what I suggest is that if you adopt the right hemisphere's
2767360	2772000	way of looking at the world, you are not likely to crash the plane. Whereas if you adopt the left
2772000	2775920	hemisphere's view of the world, you do crash the plane. And in a way, that's what I've just
2775920	2781360	preferred to, the destruction that's going on all around us as we think about the world in this
2781360	2786560	deeply fallacious way. Yes. And as the plane is crashing, the left hemisphere would insist
2786560	2792560	of bringing forth their own solutions in order to fix the problem in his thought he's been
2792560	2796880	causing, right? So again, this is kind of the self-circular nature of the problem.
2801360	2806320	I might say, so just particularly the way of the left hemisphere, which is self-referential,
2806320	2811840	because it can't break out as it were into reality. It's dealing all the time with its map,
2811840	2817440	and it's saying, yes, but the map says, and it is left on denial about what is happening. And this
2817440	2822480	is rather like, experienced this a couple of times, and people tell me about this happening to them,
2822640	2827280	that they're navigating in a car using a sat-nav and their passenger is saying,
2827280	2831120	well, the sat-nav says we're there, but you look out at the window, we're not there at all,
2831120	2835280	we're just in another place, you must not know what the sat-nav says. And that is really the
2835280	2840320	left hemisphere. It says, well, the sat-nav says it doesn't look out of the window. And it's trying
2840320	2846480	to get people to look out of the window that I'm aiming to do in this book. Exactly. Sorry. No,
2846480	2851520	it's perfect because this is also a way to summarize. It will be, yes, trust your abstractions,
2851600	2861120	but cherish your own experience, which is a big caveat, both for academics, but also,
2862080	2867920	I don't know, probably the real world people, too, including us, of course. But there is,
2867920	2874320	again, this trend of thinking that insists that, well, we need to doubt, which is a healthy skepticism.
2874320	2880240	Sure. But if we doubt to the point where nothing of what I can experience can bring forth any
2881200	2887840	any wave on me deciding what's going on in the world, and I just outsource these more and more
2887840	2893600	to abstractions, my abstractions or some abstractions that I borrow, I think we end up in this situation
2893600	2900320	where we are in the middle of nowhere, but the GPS says we arrived at the place and we can find a
2900320	2906480	way to just, well, maybe if I step out of the car and look around, I realize that we've made a mistake
2906480	2913600	and that's fine, we can't correct it. It's fine to correct the mistake. Okay, in wrapping up,
2913600	2918400	unless you want to add something on this, because I want to start writing, because you're not in a hurry.
2919680	2927440	No, well, what we haven't, of course, endeavored to do and perhaps can't in one go is to paint some
2927440	2933680	of the differences between the two hemispheres. And as I say, I'm not sure that that can be
2933680	2940640	done just like that now, but one of them that's very relevant is the left hemisphere's capacity
2940640	2946320	for denial and for false optimism. The left hemisphere, as far as it's concerned, there is
2946320	2954000	never a problem because it's always in control and it's always right. It actually physically will
2955600	2962560	look at a paralyzed limb and say it's not paralyzed. So somebody after a right hemisphere stroke,
2962560	2968480	relying only on their left hemisphere, may have a completely paralyzed left half of the body,
2968480	2973760	but the functioning left hemisphere will say, but it's functioning fine. Because this is what
2973760	2981040	we're up against. Yes, and I must admit that when I read those chapters, I was literally mind blown
2981040	2987920	and I couldn't believe really what can go wrong with their own minds. And it read like science
2987920	2992480	fiction, but it wasn't science fiction, it was neurology. And maybe just for our listeners,
2992480	2998080	because now we're saying, well, the left hemisphere says or things the right. But I promise, I can
2998080	3002640	make a promise because it has been fulfilled for me as I was reading your book, that as we move
3002640	3010320	through the detailed evidence and also its significance, it would be clear this is not just
3012000	3017680	just, and I maybe shouldn't just say just, but this is not a philosophical position only.
3017680	3024400	This is really what you get exactly as you see what actually happens when the left or the right
3024400	3032160	part of the brain is screwed up. And from here, it's from where you're drawing these statements
3032160	3040240	that it is in denial and so on, which brings us back to the fact that we are trapped and maybe
3040240	3047200	into its ways forward to entrap ourselves, which is where I think the book that you've written
3047760	3054960	over the last 10 years with nearly 2,000 pages, 1,600 pages and hundreds of references.
3055520	3061920	Well, I think this is the major contribution beyond science and philosophy. It's to show
3062480	3067200	a path and it's not just an argument, as you say, in the very first line of the book. It's not just
3067200	3074480	an argument, but it's not just an argument. It's a journey that hopefully while we finish
3074560	3080480	it, or as we are walking through the journey, we may realize that there are these views,
3080480	3085520	ways of looking that we are not enjoying so much as we could. So maybe this is also to
3085520	3090560	put it in a more positive note. It's not just a battle between bad ways and good ways, but
3090560	3096960	it's also a joyful journey. I think that's also part of what's going to happen as we go through
3097520	3102640	the means to truth or the portals to truth, which is part one, and the paths to truth,
3102640	3107840	which is part two, and part three, and so on, is that we're going to walk through attention,
3107840	3115360	perception, judgment, science, reason, imagination, and consciousness, matter, time, space, the sacred,
3115360	3122240	and it's going to be a joyful trip. And I think that's a good mark that we're doing something
3123600	3130080	good enough or right or true, that there's this joy in reading it. It's not like reading
3130080	3136400	philosophy or science when it is presented as a mathematical theorem. You must obey and
3136400	3141680	walk through that path, but it's both an argument and an offering, if you allow me to say that.
3141680	3148320	And I think this is fascinating, and I'm grateful that you wrote it in this way.
3149760	3155760	Well, thanks very much, Alex. I think that is a good point. In a way, what I'm suggesting is that
3155840	3161440	the sort of questions we want to answer are not susceptible of resolution by purely rational
3161440	3169040	argument, not by anyone else's. I do offer arguments as we go through that I hope are
3169040	3173360	persuasive, but the most persuasive thing, if you're trying to get somebody to see the world
3173360	3178320	a different way, is not just to sit in a seminar room and argue about it, but to go out into the
3178320	3185280	world and have a look. And this is how empirical science works. And it's also how a kind of empirical
3185280	3192480	philosophy works. And what I reckon is that if you accompany me as you have on this trip and look
3192480	3199280	at the evidence of what happens to human beings when they're forced to rely on one way of thinking
3199280	3205600	at the expense of another, it demonstrates, I mean, I can't help you if you don't see what I see,
3205600	3213200	and that's fair enough. But for those who want to see, I believe I show that one of these views
3213200	3219840	of the world is more reliable than the other. Importantly, that doesn't mean that the other
3219840	3224720	way of looking, the left hemisphere way of looking is wrong. It's just limited. It's very
3224720	3230640	limited. And it's limited with a purpose in mind to enable us to grab stuff. And that's not nothing.
3230640	3237040	We won't live if we can't eat and build shelter and so on. But that is not the tool whereby we
3237040	3244240	come to understand the world. To do that, we need to bring many strands from experience,
3244240	3249920	from intuition, from science, from reason together. And people who don't do that actually
3250720	3259600	have a fairly common mental illness. What is remarkable is that schizophrenia is really an
3259600	3265440	example of what happens to people who have to rationalize about everything. They can't start
3265440	3271840	from any bed of experience at all. And it's a point not just made by me, but made by others
3271840	3279360	before me, that when people are schizophrenic, it's not that they have lost their reason,
3279360	3284800	as we say in English, I don't know if one does in Spanish, say that a mad person has lost his
3284800	3290960	reason. It's not just that, but that they have lost everything but their reason and they have to
3291600	3297680	argue for and deduce things, as it were, theoretically, that most of us do intuitively
3297680	3302720	from a grounding in the real world. How interesting. Yes, you see how language
3302720	3308800	serves to both show and also conceal, because it's saying the opposite and it's a nice trick.
3308800	3314880	Well, one more thing to add, because you prompted me this thought where you mentioned it's not
3315760	3322400	just about rational argument. And that's where many people become very nervous, right? Because
3322400	3328480	since a rational argument like this sort of rationality is not just a good instrument,
3328480	3335280	which of course it is, but it's the only instrument allowed. And now when you do these
3335280	3339760	synthesis, because that's also what you propose, and also these conversions, because it's not just
3339840	3346560	the synthesis from one realm, but the conversions, synthesis, and you make explicit what starts to
3346560	3352480	become difficult, I would guess, to articulate, because the moment you're just talking about
3353360	3358320	what's super-rational or what's not only rational, maybe beyond rational, including it,
3358320	3362480	but including it, right? That's the beauty of it. It's not rejecting it, of course, including it,
3363040	3369120	and intuition and imagination. I think, Ian, what you're doing is you're going, if I may say so,
3369120	3375600	and many people may not feel comfortable with this either, but it's like going a bit forward in human
3375600	3383680	evolution. It's like, well, as a species and our human mind has excelled, no doubt, with reason and
3383680	3390800	with many other abilities, you may say, but the moment we start to talk more openly and precisely
3392000	3398960	and accurately about imagination and intuition, I think we're in a new path. Well, it's a well
3398960	3404240	floating path, but it's a good path, because we're making progress. We are not always all around
3404240	3410240	congratulating ourselves as to how enlightened we could be, but we are also acknowledging that there
3410800	3416960	is something else, and perhaps that's also why you have this amazing book, sorry, you know,
3416960	3421520	book. It's a chapter, but that's something that happens with your chapters, that they could all
3421520	3428240	be books by themselves, where you talk about consciousness, which is one of my favorite
3428240	3434400	chapters, but also the sacred at the very end. So here we have somebody that's very knowledgeable
3434400	3442640	in neurology and physics and philosophy, and at the end is writing about the sacred, and they should
3442640	3452000	not scare academics or real world people, and they should excite or at least make them feel
3452560	3459360	grateful for a chapter on the sacred, right? But you see how we are not just walking the fine line,
3459360	3464560	as I was telling you before, but also getting into a point where it's a kind of an edge,
3464560	3472640	there's this mist, and you start not to see the accuracy of the data of mathematical
3472640	3478480	theorem demonstration, but you're in this place where, to be honest, this is where I think we
3479040	3483440	we need to go, and we should not be scared, I think we should be enjoyed, and you're going
3483440	3492080	into that place, and I think that's also remarkable. Yes, thank you. Well, what I wanted in this book
3492080	3502000	was to show the confluence that I see between findings in neurology, trends in the last 100
3502000	3509600	years in philosophy, and findings in physics. I'm not a physicist, Alex, as you are, but I do,
3510480	3516240	I have, rather to my surprise, I found myself being approached by quite a number of physicists who'd
3516240	3522000	read the master and his emissary and said this is incredibly relevant to what we are dealing with,
3522000	3528000	and so I do have people that I can try out my ideas on before I write them, but in any case,
3528080	3535600	the point is that these, apparently, to our way of thinking, quite distinct paths of neuropsychology,
3535600	3540560	data philosophy, and data physics come together, and it's like starting from
3542000	3547120	points on the circumference of a circle and going inwards and coming together, and what is also
3547120	3554320	interesting to me is that the picture that coheres there is also recognizable in the great
3554320	3562240	ancient traditions of philosophy around the world. It agrees with the findings of ancient wisdom
3562240	3569920	traditions, hence the idea that we can just not say anything about the idea of value, like goodness,
3569920	3574800	beauty, truth, all of the sacred, you know, scientists and philosophers better keep off
3574800	3580240	those things. I mean, that is not the way it is for me, and what I hope is that people might start
3580320	3586160	out this book, I don't know, some of them, rather thinking, well, he's got a difficult
3586160	3590640	furrow to plow, if he's going to convince me that it's worth talking about these subjects,
3590640	3595680	but I hope that after following me through the book, if they have the patience and courage to do so,
3596240	3602320	they will find that it's absolutely essential and that, in a way, only somebody who was rather
3602320	3608640	blinkered would think, no, you can't bring these into the picture, they are at the core of the picture.
3608640	3613120	Yes, indeed. So, you know, we are there in the car, the GPS, we're not sure if it's working,
3613120	3619600	we can look through the window and we can ask the indigenous people around, and if now the GPS
3619600	3626320	and your site and your own orientation and what the locals tell you seems to start converging,
3626880	3633360	this is a good sign that we are approaching the place we want to get at, even though we will never
3633360	3637040	really get at it, but in this process, we're getting closer.
3638880	3642080	I love that, that's a very nice way of putting it, thank you.
3643120	3653120	Well, just for me to add, I hope this suffix is a good enough invitation for anyone to read your
3653120	3666640	book and we will continue, hopefully, unpacking it, enjoying it. Again, for me, it's an honor to
3666640	3672880	do so with you. Well, it is a hugely important experience for me to have somebody with your
3672880	3679760	breadth of background responding so positively to it, and I hope that we will actually make this
3679760	3686160	journey together and bring some listeners and viewers with us on that path. Great, so let's
3686160	3693840	leave it at that, thank you. All right, goodbye for now then, Alex. Yes, see you soon. Until next time.
